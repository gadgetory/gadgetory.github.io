management get it now
link in description below alright
computer on hello Jerry
what do we have for email alright it's
video time so audio is half the story
when it comes to video as you just saw
in this opening sequence you can
beautifully use sound to guide the
viewer through the visually silent
storyline and I would normally say that
if you have good video but crappy audio
that kind of sucks both ways but if you
have good audio but crappy video then
that might pass just like what camera
lenses it's good to know which
microphone to use in what situation for
most vocal recordings a condenser
microphone is the most popular it helps
to deliver a broadcast type of sound
that is full of range it's clear and
natural my go-to mics for voiceovers are
the Audio Technica 2035 and aeg c31 for
two highly praised condenser microphones
that handle high sound pressure levels
really well so it's excellent for vocals
and acoustics my main tip here is to let
the microphone do most of the work for
you don't color the audio with some
filters effects and presets if you have
to apply only slight compression curves
so boosting a little bit in the lowering
region if you want a little extra body
in the bass do the same thing with the
treble if you want extra detail but
don't
do it and the ruin the original
character of the microphone and this
recording the best way to visualize
audio treatment is let's say you can
over process an image to a point where
it no longer looks attractive it looks
very fake in whatever the same applies
to audio you can over process something
that it no longer sounds good
most people are really looking forward
to the natural sounding things and or
specially vocal recordings unless of
course you're going for some type of
effect that applies perfectly well to
what you're trying to portray
however keep things natural and you'll
be golden next up is a shotgun or a boom
microphone that has earned its
reputation for directional recording
it's light enough to position any way
you like it on a simple microphone stand
or on top the camera and you want it to
be just off frame but close on a few
subject to pick up a proper audio now
I've been recording myself on camera
with the boom microphone which is just a
frame and it's granted me so much
flexibility when I'm on camera because
I'm allowed to move around my office no
problem and I can do all the recordings
off the desk which is so much more
versatile and then there's the rode
videomic pro this is also another
shotgun microphone that is very
versatile it is a much improved step up
from any built-in camera microphone so
there's one microphone that I would
always take with me is the rode videomic
pro for on-camera audio because it's
reliable you can do interviews as long
as you have a close enough range you can
do ambient sounds and given the wind
film that's built in it's fine for
outdoors and the last piece of the
puzzle is the lavalier microphone or the
laughs now unfortunately most wireless
systems are quite pricey but this is one
of the best ways to capture on person
audio we are using son Heiser system
whenever all other solutions are not
optimal so for location interviews and
when I need to move around the scene
while still being able to capture audio
now all these microphones use XLR inputs
so we need an audio interface I've been
using the scarlett 2i2 for several years
it is an affordable stationary
illusion with good preamps for the mics
and even a headphone amplifier in there
which isn't the best but it's good for
monitoring what you're recording but
getting a field recorder with XLR inputs
as the most versatile solution since
your you won't be restricted to being so
close to the computer into that scarlett
2i2 desktop audio interface you can
literally use the field recorders
anywhere you are in the world it's all
battery powered and this gives you so
much flexibility and the last few things
to cover is watch your levels it is very
difficult to recover peaked audio so
lower your amplification at the source
and boost in post avoid recording wind
or breath directly into the microphone
so you can get a wind foam or a dead cat
a little foam thing that protects it
from capturing all the wind noise it's
highly beneficial and also position the
microphone on an angle so it doesn't
pick up your exhales also watch the
power requirement of a microphone if
something doesn't sound right to you
make sure your audio interface is
passing enough voltage to your
microphone or phantom power and keep in
mind that dynamic microphones do not
require phantom power and so that is the
story of audio from our side I hope you
enjoyed gives you a little bit of
clarification on the different
microphone solutions for whatever
situation and will hear you in next
audio</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
