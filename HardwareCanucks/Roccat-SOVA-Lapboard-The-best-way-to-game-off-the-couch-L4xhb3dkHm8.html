cooling with the 280 mm radiator with
long slim tubing for easier installation
and high-pressure copper cold plate you
can also customize led through the cam
software so get crackin flap pods or
interesting things that have just
started to make a name for themselves in
the peripheral market even though they
have been around for quite some time now
they subscribe to the idea that instead
of gaming on a desk directly in front of
your monitor some gamers want the
creature comforts of a couch or a lazy
boy or simply want to game on their
larger TVs to allow this means combining
both Lee mouse and keyboard into what
looks like a mega peripheral that's an
interesting concept and certainly not
one everybody will buy into when you
look at the range of gaming lap words on
the market everybody's experimenting to
make something unique and try to make it
stick while it's cool to see super
modular options like the Corsair lap dog
and Wireless offerings with the Razer
turret they each come with heavy
compromises namely their price bulk of
the lap dog and lackluster performance
or failed ergonomics with their turret
it turns out designing a stable platform
that's meant to house both a keyboard
while still being balanced on someone's
lap isn't that easy rocket might not
have the brand-name backing of Razer
steel series or Corsair but there's
overlap dog does quite a few things well
at first glance it looks like the
brought the most boring lap board to the
table but that's not a bad thing they're
not reinventing the wheel instead
they're refining it to make it the best
all-round let's start with what Rockets
got right the pricing the server comes
in two variants a membrane option which
is what we have priced at 149 and a
mechanical switched bergeon at 199 since
it has an integrated keyboard you're
still going to have to bring your own
mouse but it's reasonably priced when
compared with the lap dog which is $119
for just the base it's looking good even
without getting further into the
features the simplicity of the server is
what makes it so up
it's certainly still large at 64
centimeters or 25 inches in width and 28
centimeters or 11 inches long but its
thickness or lack thereof is what makes
it feel much smaller at only three point
five centimeters thick it's easy to move
and feels much smaller than the
alternatives like the lap dog and it a
little over 2.3 kilograms
its weight is very manageable the sova
uses that space effectively to with an
excellent layout rocket have chosen a 10
keyless design opting for a larger
mousepad I criticized the lap dog for
its numpad accommodation removing such
and frequently used item for gaming
makes a lot of sense
I also critiqued the lap dog for the
lack of a wrist rest and Rocket
delivered here with a well sized rest
that's appreciated for ergonomics on the
bottom of the board we have four pillows
to help it sit more comfortably on the
lap these work well although they are a
little bit on the thin side for my
preference however that's where rock-out
comes in again with their modular system
all the pillows are removable in
swappable and from here you can even
remove the magnet mounted rest rest and
mousepad it's super seamless and from
the top you wouldn't even pick up that
they're removable since the integration
is so well done Bravo rocket they're
saying that there will be choice of
other materials so that you can swap out
parts for your preference it's a great
concept however they haven't actually
shown any add-ons yet
so I'll reserve judgment for when I can
actually buy them they do mention 3d
printing possibilities though and this
is an avenue I'd like to see them put
some focus into right now rock out
charges for designs on their Nith Mouse
and I'd prefer to see an open approach
with a curated hub for user submitted
designs with rock out accommodating for
that let's get back to the board bow
with cable routing it's always a bit of
a sore spot for many lap boards however
it's handled well here the four meter
main call attaches and detaches easily
through a five pin connector without the
cable being too thick and no external
power is required you will need two USB
ports though and in my experience the
server doesn't play well with many USB
hubs your mouse of choice plugs into one
of the two USB ports on the back of the
server and then is routed through the
very effective cable channels at the
back rock out even has a mouse bungee
which is really nice to see and a great
solution for the cable mess that can
occur the server integrates into rock
out swarm software ecosystem which
raka has envisioned to not only allow
for control of connected peripherals but
also for remote connection through your
phone in the swarm interface you can
control your mouse assuming it is from
rocket as well as the server adding
macros and adjusting the backlight
brightness and effects
unfortunately the server currently can't
be controlled with a swarm app which is
disappointing there seems to be intent
for it especially with the intended
release of a smartphone holder
attachment for the lap board but
currently you won't get any of the
exciting features the main positive of
the sova is the ease of use there aren't
any hassles or large pitfalls you can
simply plug it in and go it's
comfortable easy to use in store and
whether it's in game or just controlling
a PC it's a pleasure to use overall
there are a couple of minor issues with
the server though the mousepad isn't my
favorite as not only is it very fast
compared to a cloth pad but because of
the excessive Glide
the mouse tends to fall off when the
server is angled while the bungee does
catch it some sort of barrier system or
a different surface is needed
the lack of RGB is also a bummer on this
keyboard it's not a huge deal but it
would be nice to see considering you
can't swap the keyboard out later so
you're stuck with blue as for the typing
experience on the membrane sample I
received it's okay with decent travel
distance but if you're using this quite
a lot I'd probably recommend giving the
mechanical variant a shot assembling
your verdaguer gaming chair just got a
whole lot easier with a simple insert
mechanism of the back seat onto the side
rails so you mount the side screws much
faster a true one-man job assembly made
easy by Roger in my mind the rocket
server is without a doubt the most
polished option on the market right now
it might not have everything the Corsair
laptop has all the razor turret which I
haven't had the chance to examine just
yet but every compromise it makes has a
sensible thought process behind it and I
found that overall I agreed with the
choices that were made it's easy to use
and works just as intended
resulting in an overall excellent
product we're giving up the hardware
canucks damn good award so what about
you guys do you see yourself gaming on
the couch or a lounge chair would
something like the server appeal to you
