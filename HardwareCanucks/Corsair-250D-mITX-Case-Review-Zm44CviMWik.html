and welcome to another video review the
Obsidian line from Corsair is getting
bigger and bigger and what people have
been asking for our smaller enclosures
in particularly for a mini ITX obsidian
and it seems like courser has listened
and on our review table today is this
teeny tiny 250 D this is $90 enclosure
actually quite competitive within this
small form-factor
and from what we've seen at CES it
packed the space efficient layout so
let's check it out the aluminum front
panel comes with a protective film and
in order to avoid leaving all the gunk
and the glue in the grain you peel the
film off in the direction of the brushed
aluminum they really should put a
sticker or something to indicate
otherwise you ruin a perfectly clean
brushed aluminum surface now after
that's done you can say goodbye to the
film and get on with your day power and
reset buttons are located at the top
left along with two USB 3 and audio
jacks on the other side separated by a
five and a quarter inch drive bay now
the front panel is removable with a push
to release clips the panel itself is
plastic with a tiny aluminum sheet on
the surface for that elegant look behind
which we find a dust filter and included
140 millimeter intake with both 120 and
200 millimeter mounts there's about 1/2
centimeters of space between the fan and
the front panel so front intake will
slightly be choked there's also a
protective shroud on the fan which is
considerate for all the cable work that
is about to come the 250 D is actually
quite small but is capable of handling
full-size ATX power supplies long
graphics cards and 240 million radiators
but more on that later both side panels
are ventilated with magnetic dust
filters and at the top a window to
reveal your internal goodies the case is
elevated with rubberized feet and
includes a removable dust filter taking
a look at the back two PCI brackets are
secured by a single lever we have dual
80 millimeter fan mounts with rubber
grommets bar supply bracket on the right
and the concealed drive cage on the left
after moving about 10 thumb screws we
can remove all these side panels and
take a look at the hidden drive gauge
what we have here are a couple
three and a half and two and a half inch
drive caddies they are not hot swappable
although that would have been an awesome
feature power supply is installed from
the back with the help of the power
supply bracket and while it looks like a
crazy cable mess right now there are
mini K bottom outs on the floor to
secure all your large cables the case is
designed to handle enthusiast graphics
cards and we have full 12 inches of
clearance and same goes for the power
supply all the front cable connections
are black which is always nice a courser
is thinking about the clean system and
after inserting all the drives in place
I was initially skeptical about how far
the SSDs were from the mechanical drives
so I thought solder routing would be
difficult but not to worry
cables fit just fine although a little
extra spacing would be nice taking a
better look from the top the optical
drive cage is there if you need it
also has a tool a secure bracket and the
cage is actually easily removable if you
don't particularly care for it now the
main attraction with the 250d is the
side radiator mount we have a 120mm fan
included on the right side of the case
where it will exhaust the bottom portion
of the radiator mount is removable if
you require a little extra room to work
with during assembly but I had no issues
with it in place also notice there are
two sets of holes that will be useful
here require a little extra height
clearance from your radiator for example
clearance for the side radiator is
limited but it seems Corsair has made
sure to allow their own 1h series to fit
just fine as there is about five
centimeters of clearance so your fans
and your radiator will fit just fine the
motherboard tray has a large opening in
the center that was very useful
it will allow any type of bracket behind
the motherboard to fit and after mini
ITX board installation you can see just
how much room there is right underneath
and that's very considerate from courser
especially since most all-in-one water
coolers require some type of support
bracket to be installed behind the CPU
socket installing our two ATX which is
an 11 inch card so it fits fine but it
is taller than standard and requires the
optical drive gauge to be removed so I
could drop the card in IO
notice that without the drive cage 250d
became quite flexible which I wasn't
expecting from an obsidian and with a
total system assembled wiring is out of
the way for the front intake and it all
was concentrated at the bottom and if
using the optical drive cage it is still
very clean system indeed and even when
the cable is routed through the left
side a 240 radiator would still fit with
no problem and I gotta say that I'm very
pleased with the results of the 250 D
that handled the assembly in the
user-friendly fashion with excellent
compatibility for your power supply
graphics cards and the watercooler even
I like the fully dustproof concept then
the overall space efficiency that
compliments it's relatively small
footprint really without a compromise
and relative to other mini ATX cases the
price is actually spot-on now a few
minor complaints would be the lack of a
USB 2 adapter it would be considered of
course sir to include it for non native
motherboards and while not necessarily
con the drive cage really screams for a
hot swappable format but aside from that
for all those interested going towards a
mini ITX gaming systems the 250 D is
very appealing case especially at that
price point and deserve the damn good
value a word I'm sure many gaming
systems would be born inside the 250 D
until now I think one of the most
popular mini ITX cases have been the
beat Fenix prodigy so let us know in the
comments below on which one of the two
you'd prefer and why as always thanks
