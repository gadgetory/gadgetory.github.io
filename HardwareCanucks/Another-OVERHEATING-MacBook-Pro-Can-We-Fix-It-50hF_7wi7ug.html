my MacBook Pro I've had it for about two
years
I love the form factor the speakers the
screen is awesome and the thinness and
the weight is not an issue for me but
the performance has been suffering
lately so let's investigate so in the
office I use my PC to render videos and
the MacBook is just being used as a
little Netflix machine it you know in my
living room but at CES as I was starting
to getting back into editing with this
machine everyone's still sleeping I'm
rendering my first CS video on the
throttle MacBook that has to be upside
down for best air flow so I think we're
on to a good start
it felt really slow it was throttle like
crazy even with the fans wrapping up to
100% so it was super loud so I really
wanted my Jigga herds back because in
the beginning when I bought the MacBook
how super happy with performance but now
where did my Jigga Hertz go and in its
current state I would have to wait way
too long for any 4k renders which is why
we had to revert to 1080p for our CES
coverage so I'm really sorry about that
so I have a little bit of thermal paste
left this is the Arctic silver 5 it's a
really nice thermal paste I've been
using this particular tube for like a
year and a half I have no idea how
there's still something in there left
but we're gonna put the new thermal
paste on and I've never actually opened
the macbook before so I don't know what
the procedure would be like but as long
as we follow instructions and nothing
breaks we'll be fine so let's begin
right after this wondering how to fix a
boring fan check out halos RGB they are
super slim fan frames that light up your
blades of any shade come on 120 and 140
member sizes to fit any fan and that
control through your motherboard or your
fan text case available in beautiful
aluminum or simple plastic it's time to
halos your build outline what matters
now before we begin I want to say that
you know watching a YouTube video on
this thing would give me like eighty
degrees Celsius and a really loud fan
operation I have no idea of why that's
happening and while rendering videos of
course they were just completely reach
like 99
Celsius at certain sections is just
unacceptable performance and I'm hoping
that my application of new thermal paste
and the low cleanup process will fix
things all I want is slightly better
performance and reach Ebers level
because he's using the gigabyte notebook
which is super powerful and exporting
times on that machine are just
incredible like they almost match what
I'm using on my desktop and so I'm
really hoping that with a little bit of
extra performance we can inch a bit
closer to what Ebor is experiencing on
his gigabyte all right so let's begin
the teardown
all right so everything went smoothly
and man you've gotta appreciate that
whole black PCB guts design it's you
never see it until you open it but you
do appreciate once you do and you
definitely have to appreciate the cooler
design it's thinner than my watch band
on my watch that's just crazy delivering
so much performance in such a compact
form factor which is ironic because I'm
having issues with performance so let's
see and that thermal paste reapplication
did anything and I'm happy to report
that it did suck at Heber would you
gigabyte no book to GT X 1080 whatever
now first I want to point out something
strange happening with Adobe Premiere
when I'm exporting my 1080p timeline
into either a 1080p output or a 4k
output a thoughts upscaling your footage
so in the 1080p render the CPU frequency
drops to 1.9 gigahertz on average while
the GPU frequency is around 8 80
megahertz while at 4k render we are
using about 2.3 gigahertz on the CPU and
1.1 gigahertz on the GPU and it seems
like it's down clocking when we are
exporting into 1080p both the GPU and
the CPU which I find strange because the
temperatures in that scenario are 85
degrees Celsius which gives us plenty of
headroom like 5 degrees Celsius until we
hit that 90 degree sort of ceiling for
premiere or for the MacBook in general
so I'm not exactly sure what's happening
and if you do let's have a conversation
below and after the thermal paste swap
we're actually seeing a hundred 50
megahertz bump in the CPU frequency and
about the hundred megahertz on the GPU
with slightly increased temperatures but
that's fine because as long as the
machine can do the cooling itself it can
boost to its maximum frequency and gain
extra power and thus reduce our render
times so that's 80% reduction and 1080p
renders
uh-huh and then for you so what does
that mean for my render times I still
plan to use this machine for shows
actually I might steal Ebers gigabyte
and so for 1080p we're seeing 8 percent
faster render times after the swap and
in 4k a 7% faster render times which is
fantastic for this quick little little
fixer-upper yeah and in simple minutes
instead of waiting 40 minutes for a 4k
export I now get to wait only 37 also
during YouTube playback I'm no longer
hovering around 80 degrees Celsius we
drop to about 76 so that's great and I'm
thinking I don't know what's happening
there but at load the fan speed may seem
to have dropped slightly because I'm
also seeing about the point 5 decibel
reading lower after the swap at load
while it's exporting right so I don't
know what else to say but it works
swapping your thermal paste on the
MacBook it's fairly straightforward as
long as you follow instructions and you
have the correct tools and really good
thermal paste too and just seeing what I
was able to achieve in this you know
performance wise pretty happy that it
all turned out well so guys thank you so
much for watching make sure to subscribe
and check out that gigabyte notebook
that I've been talking about because man
eBrush sure sells at wall it seems like
a fantastical or performer i'll child
leave it right over there I'm Dimitri
thanks much for watching we'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
