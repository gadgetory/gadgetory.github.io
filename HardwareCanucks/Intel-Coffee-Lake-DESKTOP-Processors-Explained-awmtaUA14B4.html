I'm back here to talk more about
processors from Intel and it's actually
starting to becoming a weekly thing for
me but that's actually a good thing
Ami's Rison CPUs let some series fire
under Intel's butt and they quickly came
up with a sky like X if you're
interested in the performance view you
can check it out right over here
but today we're talking about coffee
Lake I can have my coffee first I love
the taste of coffee every day in the
morning that's what gets me up and
running but you know what I mean I guess
there's that hidden joke I don't know I
really don't know coffee coffee lake
actually you might remember as making a
video on explaining Intel's upcoming a
generation of CPUs on the ultrabooks and
the lower end desktops if you're
interested in more information you can
check it out right over here now even
though skylake x processors cost more
money than many of you can afford and
the mobile low voltage coffee like
processors are a few months away Intel's
eighth generation coffee like CPUs are
on their way to desktops very soon and
next week stay tuned for our full
performance review of these new CPUs
because I can't quite share that
information just yet but Intel did allow
us to share some preliminary information
regarding these new chips so let's get
started
cooler master master keys keyboard
line-up is now available in three sizes
to fit within your space with large
medium and small boards with either
beautiful RGB or pure white LED
illumination a little something for
everyone make it yours with a master
keys probe by Coolermaster looking at
the high-end coffee like processors
first the lineup is headlined by the I
787 under K which is supposed to take
over from the 7700 K it is important to
remember that the actual differences
between cable ache and coffee lake are
minimal from a core architecture
standpoint but these newer CPUs use
Intel's 40 nanometer plus plus
technology allowing them to hit higher
overall clock speeds and core counts
without significantly increasing power
consumption or heat output this is why
with the 8700 K Intel is able to have
clock speeds up to 4.7 gigahertz 6 cores
12 threads and 12 megabytes of smart
cash while still having a TDP of chosen
95 watts that's pretty incredible what
isn't so incredible is the corner intel
has placed himself and with pricing the
87 undecayed will retail for about three
hundred and sixty dollars which places
it right among eight core risin some
processors and that could be an issue
for some productivity tasks it also
makes me wonder what was the whole point
with cable 8x I mean looking from a raw
performance standpoint coffee-like seems
to be a much better platform compared to
KT like X and it's gonna be a lot less
expensive to so Intel what is really
going on anyways back to the specs of HN
the i7 8700 is basically the same
processor but without and unlocked
multiplier lower clock speeds and a TDP
of 65 watts I'm expecting we will see
this one in a lot of pre-built gaming
systems like the i-5 7600 K it replaces
the new I 580 600 K is really meant to
be the value leader of this lineup it
offers high clock speeds and a native
six core die so it should be much better
than cable akin performance I'm really
excited to take a look at this one since
it actually costs more than the six core
12:38 Rison v 1600 x without offering
more processing threats
well those higher frequencies win the
day for Intel again I'll find out soon
where things get much less confusing is
in the lower end I five and I three
product lineups since Intel has done a
pretty good job with limiting the number
of processors they will be introducing I
would actually say the i5 8400 is
probably the most interesting of the
entire coffee lake launch for people who
don't care about overclocking it isn't
unlocked which is too bad but there are
six cores and a turbo frequency of 4
gigahertz that 65 watt TDP could even
make it a good fit for a mid-range HTPC
or small form-factor systems and intel
has ensured it doesn't cost a dime more
than these 7400 the only major challenge
could be once again with Andy's wives
and family since the 1500 x cost the
exact same amount of money it can be
overclocked and even offers aid
processing threats
yex if you really want budget-minded
overclocking from coffee lake things
stay really expensive guys it is only
$15 less than the 8400 and has two less
threads but the i3 83 50k is
what you will need honestly I just don't
get intel strategy with da 350k even the
73 50k was a complete waste of money and
and just resources to be honest now if
you look at the competition name DS
risin v 1400 might be a better choice
compared to the cpu because it offers
eight processing threads and it seems to
be a much popular choice among gamers
right now it really seems like Intel's
launching these new CPUs without taking
a look at what's happening with Rison
and I guess we'll have to see how all
DCP is stacked up with one another when
we put them through our test bench
finally there's the i3 8100 and the
massive $55 gap between this CPU and the
83 50k seems to indicate Intel isn't
done launching coffee leaking processors
just yet but if you want a lower-cost
quad core chip this might be a good fit
even though Intel still isn't offering
all of their coffee like processors and
unlocked their overclocking abilities
have been drastically improved things
like perk or overclocking real time
memory latency control and extended PLL
trim controls are all included and
there's some expectation that clock
speeds will be able to reach well over 5
gigahertz for the K series part
unfortunately these overclocking
features along with the enhanced power
delivery needs of coffee make processors
and their ability to run at consistent
26 66 megahertz memory speeds means that
once again Intel is asking you to
purchase a new motherboard yeah I know
guys this is getting very frustrating
and that excuse doesn't really add up
especially when you consider the new z3
7e generation doesn't really offer any
benefits over z2 70 all of the
platform's primary lanes comes from the
processor itself and there are still 16
of them that much is rising but what z
370 doesn't have is native support for
key technologies like USB 3.1 gen2 and
nvme storage devices those can be added
through third-party controllers linked
to the chipsets PCI 3.0 lanes but that
could cause slowdowns when compared to
the direct access those devices have on
Amy's X 370 and be 350 chipsets but what
I can see is that motherboard Wenders
are coming out with some really strong
looking Z 370 boards for instance take a
look at this gigabytes or as gaming 7
and
it takes all of their lessons from C to
70 and improves upon it in every way
there is USB 3.1 gen2 connectors triple
and two slots a high-end ESS saber audio
tag and terrible three I'll likely be
using this board for a complete build in
the next few weeks sales day tuned for
that but how does this all translate
into performance while Intel claims
coffee-like will offer up to 32 percent
faster 4k video editing and 25% faster
in game frame rates than cabling of
course some of those performance
benefits comes from the additional
threats on the i7 8700 K but it also
sounds like DCPS should operate it
consistently higher clock speeds - and
that means someone with an older Sandy
Bridge processor should really look into
coffee lake maybe we'll let you know
more about the performance once coffee
lake is officially launched on October
the 5th until then let us know if you're
excited about these new processors from
Intel also if you're coming from an
older Intel or AMD base system is coffee
lake or Z to be semi appealing or would
you perhaps lean towards AMD which means
you know rise in the next 370 in the
future let me know in the comments down
below any more with hurricane X thank
you so much for watching make sure to

we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
