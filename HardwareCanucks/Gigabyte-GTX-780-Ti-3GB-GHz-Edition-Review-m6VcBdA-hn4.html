dachshund welcome back to another review
today were going to take a look at the
monster card from gigabyte this is the
gtx 780 Ti the gigahertz edition now
since the launch of the reference card
in early November we haven't seen many
custom cards from Nvidia board partners
but that is soon to change as a soos MSI
and many others are going to be pumping
out the fastest single core gtx card to
date now gigabyte is very aggressive
with this gigahertz edition and tries to
squeeze every bit of power out of the
kepler JK 110 core with a 24% increase
on the base clock compared to the
reference design while keeping memory
speed that the same so the gigahertz
Edition packs and quite a bit more power
than the reference card that is of
course made possible with the wind force
3x cooler that incorporates a large
heatsink spanning the entire card with
six heat pipes in total and 380
millimeter fans for that adequate
cooling of course given the cooler type
you will have to have decent airflow
inside your case which is recommended
now gigabyte has made this card very
appealing with a custom cooler and of
course that powerful core clock but what
is a nice surprise
is the price at seven hundred twenty
nine dollars while still a premium price
to pay for a piece of hardware the
gigahertz Edition is only $30 more than
the reference design and while you don't
get that eliminated GeForce logo which
it looks really cool inside your window
with case I still think the added
benefits of this gigabyte card posed a
no-brainer when deciding which one to
purchase now gigabyte really pimped out
of this carpet and added backplate
heatsink that not only covers the
already awesome looking PCB but this
will aluminum casting on the outside
turn this from a beautiful card into
even better-looking one plus it will
reduce PCB temperatures the gigahertz
branding and gigabyte mark are oddly
position though as one inside your case
it will be displayed backwards it's like
oversight and design but in no way
should be the deciding factor for you to
look elsewhere the card has two eight
pin power connectors just like the
reference Sam in the apt I along with
SLI fingers and for connectivity we get
all DVI outputs hdmi and displayport so
from what we've seen so far the gamers
edition of the 780ti is beautifully
built features gigabytes custom
windforce cooler to maintain such a high
clock speed and without said let's check
out how it performs in games
we'll also be checking out temperatures
acoustics and power consumption testing
now as you can see the gigabyte 780ti
maintains and stronghold on top of all
of our charts which is extremely
impressive for a single core GPU it even
beats both dual GPU beasts and many of
the games and it's slightly back and
forth between the top place looking at
the temperatures while the reference
cards still maintain adequate results of
81 degrees Celsius the custom wind
forced 3x cooler chops away 9 degrees
all the way down to 72 Celsius under
load which is very impressive
next are the acoustics which really
showcased the beauty of that wind force
cooler obviously aside from its cooling
potential as the card is very very quiet
now due to a higher clock speed power
consumption is of course affected and
packing that extra 40 watts at load
compared to the reference 780ti but I
would say that extra power requirement
is totally justifiable given the
incredible performance in game at 1440p
now given such high out-of-the-box
frequencies there isn't much room for or
o'clock as NVIDIA has kept both the
voltages and the power limitations but
with such already impressive results in
factory overclock users are most likely
to be justified as it is
so the gigahertz edition of the card
from gigabyte truly showcases the power
of the gk110 core and the flexible
Headroom Nvidia left for its board
partners to experiment with as the
gigahertz card packs in 24% increase on
the core the delivers absolutely amazing
in-game results with both quiet and
cooperation due to that wind force
heatsink and fan design now while still
an incredibly expensive card a premium
of just $30 over the reference card gets
you a whole lot more now on the flipside
the cap voltage and power limits any
further
clock potential as with such great
temperatures it seems the core can go
even higher but having said that the
gear first edition of the 780ti is one
of the best and fastest single core GPUs
on a market today and deserves the damn
grand worth while this concludes our
review of this beast don't forget to
