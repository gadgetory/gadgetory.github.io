that simplistic Scandinavian appeal with
easy to work in internals great airflow
and storage potential and comes in both
the windows or plain side panels for
your preference we so often rely on
tablets for ultimate portability when it
comes to media consumption and getting
some work done but at some point I'm
sure you have wished if you were able to
run desktop class applications from
office to Photoshop on a tablet well we
have seen many Windows tablets try to
deliver a proper mobile Windows
experience but the concept not really
getting picked up by consumers however
Microsoft is out with their third
iteration of the surface pro a device
that gets so many things right for an
enjoyable mobile Windows experience the
model that we have your will cost you
around $1,400 and for that price you are
getting some serious hardware on the
device that's just under 1 centimeters
in thickness with an Intel Core i5 dual
core processor clocked at 1.9 gigahertz
with 2.5 gigahertz at turbo mode 8
gigabytes of RAM and a 256 gigabyte SSD
Microsoft has crafted the surface pro 3
on this beautiful magnesium alloy
chassis with an outstanding 12 inch 2160
by 1440 resolution display viewing
angles are perfect and the contrast
ratio is appropriate for rich and vivid
colors the four by three aspect ratio
will lead black bars on pretty much any
video content although this aspect ratio
helps a lot when using the on-screen
keyboard as we have more room to view
the content while typing plusses
benefits greatly when reading articles
and viewing web pages in portrait mode
the touch interface is accurate and
smooth the surface of the display feels
like a high-end phone with minimal
friction there's a front-facing camera
plus a back facing 2 megapixel shooter
that's included just in case but it's
really nothing special and so are the
speakers they are front-facing and
stereo but with very weak projection
let's take a listen
on the right side there's a full-size
USB 3.0 port mini DisplayPort and the
magnetic power input that's reminiscent
of the MacBook charging plug although
the light is only white and doesn't
change color to indicate the charging
progress speaking of the power plug the
charging brick is quite small and
portable and it also features a USB port
to charge any of your USB devices so
that's convenient a headphone jack and a
volume rocker on the left side with a
power button up top all these ports and
buttons are well positioned to be within
reach and the buttons offer outstanding
tactile registration well done Microsoft
there's a micro SD card slot hidden
behind the kickstand keeping it
protected when folded although I would
have preferred a full sized SD card slot
considering this price point one of the
unique features in the surface pro 3 is
its kickstand essentially it supports a
tablet all the way up to 150 degrees
that comes in handy when using the
on-screen keyboard writing or doodling
art there are two essential accessories
that you'll need with the pro 3/4 an
all-encompassing and proper experience
one of them being the surface tech cover
that will cost you an additional one
hundred and thirty dollars and comes in
a variety of colors it uses a magnetic
latch to connect to the pro 3 and
Microsoft has added another magnetic
strip on the top of the tech cover that
elevates the keyboard and an angle so it
makes the pro 3 more laptop like the
magnetic latches are really secure and
the overall typing experience is
impressive for such a thin keyboard with
plenty of travel time for all the keys
plus it's backlit to help in darker
environments the trackpad is there just
in case it's nothing really special and
I found myself using the touchscreen for
ninety
person of the time but a keyboard is an
essential component for any laptop like
machine and for the price it should have
been included as I feel the pro 3 isn't
complete without the surface type cover
the next accessory that asks the best
tablet experience and is my all-time
favorite is the surface band the
aluminum build quality feels premium and
Microsoft has perfected its accuracy and
response time with Windows 8.1 there is
a button up top that opens one node two
extra buttons in the mid portion of the
pen for quick erase and select tools and
this is where the surface pro 3 really
shines for a student machine taking
notes with this in class as ideal there
is no lag so it is as close as writing
on paper as you can get but the pen is
very precise that makes the experience
seamless and convenient palm rejection
works wonderful and you can save and
print your notes for later use the
problem is there is no mechanical
storage for the pen you will have to
rely on this fabric loop that will
attach it to the surface tack cover or
the device itself it's not the best
design but at least there's a way to
keep the pens secure with the surface
pro so I spent two weeks using the
surface as my daily driver for college
and my workplace
and the one thing that surprised me was
the battery life I was able to get
around 89 hours of operation with Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and brightness set to 50% I
used it to take notes using the pen with
some casual web browsing and consuming
media this essentially is ultrabook
territory when it comes to battery life
and for device is powerful I would say
it's totally acceptable using it as a
tablet was also interesting the pro 3
has really changed the way how we look
at Windows 8.1 the combination of Metro
UI despite its unattractive
functionality on a desktop machine
actually works beautifully with the
surface especially for multitasking I
used OneNote and beater side by side
playing some store games was fun and
once you've gained this mobile touch
experience with Windows the direction
Microsoft has taken makes sense for this
form factor combined with the type cover
it really felt like a complete two in
one package and a pleasant laptop
furious of course given you have a
surface to put on your surface on for
example it doesn't place well on your
lap unless you fold it and use it as a
tablet the core i5 in the eggs of RAM
and that speedy SSD ran most of the
applications snappy and I didn't notice
any hiccups
there is no dedicated GPU but you can
still get away running some intensive
applications like Adobe at which point
the fan kicks in the noise becomes
audible and the white side of the
machine becomes noticeably warm
comparing this to my XPS 15 and the
MacBook Pro ensure performance it is
comparable and a lot more portable
starting off with Geekbench 64-bit the
pro 3 scored a little over 5000 on the
multi-core test and the macbook score
around 6000 and compared to the XPS 15
which is a quad-core machine with
dedicated GPU the pro 3 is close enough
now I took one of my review videos and
rendered the entire sequence with After
Effects compositions and the pro 3 took
around 25 minutes to render the video
whereas the macbook took around 20
minutes now when I compared it to the
XPS 15 which surprisingly took an hour
to render it clearly looks like the
integrated graphics on these new Intel
chips are faster so in conclusion the
surface pro 3 is a beautifully made
machine with a vibrant and sharp display
the to and on functionality works as
you'd expect with all the needed IO
ports the performance they were able to
pack in such a small form-factor is
remarkable and the overall touch
experience plus note-taking and drawing
with the surface bin was surprisingly
good solid battery life quite operation
and the full 64-bit windows all served
well for its intended purpose and that's
exactly what the surface pro 3 was
designed to do however to fully take
advantage of the two-in-one
functionality of the surface pro 3 you
will need to purchase the top cover
separately that realistically should
have been included with the $1400 price
tag and the machine did heat up with
audible noise levels when running
intensive tasks and the kickstand design
doesn't allow proper support on non flat
surfaces however full utilization of the
machine is easy for those wanting to
take proper digital notes for class
while not being restricted to iOS or
Android ecosystems as Windows 8.1 is
actually quite capable when it's done
the right
and we are given the Microsoft Surface
pro 3 the damn good award as it's the
best iteration of this design yet so
what do you guys think about the surface
pro 3
would you consider investing in one
