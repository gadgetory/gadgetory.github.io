oxen today we're taking a look at the
mid tower from deep cool this is the
paint Juve - it is priced at $90 it
comes in different colors and I can't
help but notice the physical resemblance
to the cooler master 690 series with the
curved edges and I actually comparing
the internal layout to be identical to
the beat Phoenix Ronin now for $90 this
case doesn't particularly give off the
quality feel with very thin side panels
and the white plastic that does rub
right so that's nice but there is a
noticeable color difference between the
steel and the plastic also the lack of
features as we get inside doesn't
exactly compliment the price the front
has a removable dust filter for easy
cleaning but no fans included only the
rear exhaust fan is included with some
pretty unattractive colored cables
really wish these were sleeved or just
in black the front intake area is also
very much blocked by the drive cages and
that's certainly something I'd like to
see changed now the panel itself is also
removable and inside we find three
optical slots while the exterior design
only allows for two so that's certainly
an oversight coming around to the top we
find four USB ports two of which are USB
3 on your jacks and PR buttons the top
features an identical filter system that
is also very nice with room for dual
120-millimeter fans you can also let the
entire panel and installing the fans
above the frame means having to route
your cables through the opening and the
front although I would have preferred
additional cutouts closer to the fans
while you can't install fans above the
frame the dust filter will make contact
with the blades so intake is not an
option however as this most likely to be
used for exhaust it will work just fine
there's nothing unusual at the back with
bottomed out power supply and seven PCI
slots at the very bottom we find good
quality rubber coated case feet but here
is another unfitting feature for the $90
asking price we have one those really
annoying dust filters that's actually
attached with a screw now good thing it
covers both the power supply and the
optional fan mount but we definitely
need to see this change to the proper
dust filter so finally let's get inside
the case and like I said the panels are
really thin and despite the fact that
only the top two optical slots are
usable we still have two less mounting
for all three the drive cages cannot
accommodate for any additional fans but
we do have a bottom intake as long as
the power supply doesn't exceed 180
millimeters the top drive cage is easily
removable although there's no way to
fully secure it to the case that might
be useful during shipment
now with the cage removed this opens up
direct front intake but also allows for
extra GPU clearance but with the cage in
place we only have eleven point eight
inches that is limiting considering the
most recent enthusiast GPU offerings are
12 inches plus also I was surprised to
find DGA clearance to be mistaken on
their official spec sheet of the pen gb2
on their website so just be aware of the
real clearance now really like the drive
cat is here that expands for mounting so
no need to bend the plastic they are SSD
compatible as well and inserting a three
and a half inch drive lock the bracket
and you are ready to go a very simple
and efficient system now the entire
drive cage assembly is removable the
bottom drive cage is screwed in but as
you can see with a top fan in place how
close it is to the optical cage so this
leaves practically no clearance for
radiators and the front which is
disappointing coming onto the back one
thing missing our rubber grommets and
for ninety dollars again I wish they
were included but the pen juvey to is
prepared to handle a lot of cables with
large cutouts and so many came with the
mounts so making sure the system is
cleaned up wouldn't be a problem and
without reference system assembled it
was a hassle free build the lack of
rubber grommets does take away from how
the system should have looked especially
with the cable mess coming from the
power supply now one thing that I can't
get over is the absence of front intake
fans considering this is marketed as the
ultimate cooling structure there isn't
that much spacing up top just under two
inches of clearance so it's really good
thing that you can install fans above
the frame cable management at the back
is also really straightforward and
Pangea v2 will be able to handle a lot
more although the CPU cut out is quite
small and it's also very common to see
SSD brackets within this area which
unfortunately are not present in this
enclosure now the overall package is
quite basic the incorporation of
removable drive cages with complementing
caddies is welcomed and working inside
the pan jus v2 is hassle free however
this case is a perfect example of what
not to do with new 2014 releases as
there is absolutely nothing unique small
details like rubber grommets and proper
power supply dust filter is missing we
also would like full 12 inches for GPU
clearance to become the standard for ATX
cases without any compromises on storage
there's only one thing included and
there's no windowed versions available
which for the price I was kind of
expecting so in this state it's
expensive and uncompetitive now I'm not
out of line here just take a look at
cases within the same price bracket like
the NZXT source 530 cool master and 600
beach phoenix ronin and some corsair
carbide series that offer much better
value with a lot more features I
definitely think we need to see less
clones within the industry and more
emphasis on unique features so let us
