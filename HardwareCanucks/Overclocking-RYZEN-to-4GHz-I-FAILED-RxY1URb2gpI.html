connects and in this video i want to
talk about overclocking your rising
processor beyond the specified Bruce box
I'm using the horizon 70 1700 X I
recently build a system make sure to
check out how is compared to my previous
Skylink machine is a very interesting
result
and with my 17 100x there is Headroom
for overclocking to 4 gigahertz so what
is what we gaining whether they
overclocked that additional 200
megahertz from what I have is now and
what are some of these things that arise
with such an overclock let's talk about
all that rather than this Coolermaster
is hosting an exciting over which
tournament with a $40,000 prize pool
that will go towards one High School
Robotics being you can watch live on
Twitch or visit the eSports arena
downtown Santa Ana for free more info at
Coolermaster invitational calm so I am
over talked to 3.8 gigahertz on my 1700
exit 1.3 3 volts which is pretty good
I'm going to try to bring the voltage
down to bring those temperatures down as
well I'm using the pure raw cooler for
now it's been doing a really good job
with 3.8 gigahertz but the one crappy
thing would
Rison is temperature monitoring so here
real temp is not supported so we have to
rely on the risin master utility which
gives us just that one number right
there
there's no way to log it there's no way
to know what our core temperatures are
you know per 8 cores so that's
unfortunate that we have to rely on this
sort of compromise and try to see how
our temperatures are affected with the
overclock also it's very interesting to
see how one of the threads is occupied
as you can see over here this is with
the rising master utility open and
therefore it has to be shut down doing
veg marketing process so doesn't affect
results because it is actually consuming
a little bit too much so this right now
the idle temperature at 3.8 gigahertz
we're having around 30s but jumps to 35
to 37 sometimes not exactly sure why
there's nothing happy
in the background this is using a pure
are cooler so notice what happens with
the idle temperature when you boost this
to four gigahertz so this is what the
temperature situation looks like now at
four gigahertz we're hovering around 50s
it's sometimes up to 55 it's going to
lower to about 42 and I have increased
the voltage to 1.4 not sure why it's
registering is 1.35 right now but yeah
this is what it looks like when we jump
that additional 200 megahertz we gain 10
plus almost 20 degrees Celsius on the
core the one thing I appreciate about
the a2 is crossfader 6 motherboards is
the fact that in the BIOS we have
built-in overclocking preset so I can do
this manually or I can simply go into
overclocking presets and load if poor
gigahertz or before the profile to my
1700 X in the past that has worked but
it wasn't stable which I'm thinking is
because of the CPU order so we are
overclocked to 4 gigahertz and look what
happens when I try to run the Cinebench
r15 benchmark I think the computer will
crash almost immediately so yeah boom
right there so with this crash two
things are happening the rise in master
utility I can see the temperature spikes
to like 70 plus degrees Celsius and the
computer would read that is 90 plus
because of that temperature 20 degree
temperature offset and number two we get
an error code eight with the DRAM LED on
the motherboards flashing the RAM is
overclocked to 24 hundred megahertz
which is a cold place all the timings
are correct as per specification along
with the voltage and my motherboard has
the latest BIOS updated which i think is
1201 I know there's a beta software
that's floating around to the
motherboards but I'm just sticking with
the official one right now so what I've
done now is load that 4 gigahertz
profile once again so once again let's
run the Cinebench r15 benchmark let's
see if it crashes
now with 2166 on the memory side and the
CPU overclock to 4 gigahertz
oh and there you go now we're getting
the same error code 8 and the DRM
flashing the CPU is fine with that green
LED so that's good to know
so maybe something's just wrong with my
memory so that LED indicator on the
motherboard means there's something
wrong with
memory and I swapped it out for g.skill
trident z this is rated at 3200
megahertz but I kept it under clocked
severely 2166 or 2133 just to make sure
that we are playing in a safe megahertz
own because memory and the Rison
compatibility is still kind of iffy so I
just ran the Cinebench r15 benchmark
right now and the system does not crash
that's a very good sign I've got the
highest score I have ever gotten on my
writing system 17:24 the cpu and without
running it again it's not crashing which
means that I could potentially have more
Headroom for overclocking the the memory
maybe to like 21 2426 66 something like
that and then I can finally swap out the
cooler and be on my way boom everything
is stable
alright so with memory at 2666 let's see
if we crash alright the same air code
yep so now I've lowered the memory
frequency 2400 megahertz I know that
2666 crashes I know that 21 33 is stable
so far we sing about char 15 now let's
try 24 hundred megahertz CPU voltage is
about 4 1.37 nope alright there we go
another crash overclocking Verizon is
not frustrating one bit so the system
shut down once again was memory 21 33 it
was just working fine like five minutes
ago now it's not working now I get a
shutdown and the rise of master utility
gave me a 74 degrees Celsius readout on
the CPU core so I'm thinking it could be
used in the temperatures so it's time to
swap out that cooler so for the CPU
cooler I decided to go with a dark croc
pro 3 from be quiet simply because I've
been using all-in-one liquid coolers so
like last three years and it's like to
go to my back to the roots stick with
airflow and see how that plays out this
one has two fans very large heatsink
so it can take a lot of heat away from
the CPU which is what I want when we
overclock to four gigahertz I have the
aim for brackets included so let's swap
so just looking on with the thermal
paste distribution here it seems like
these corners in the top developer seat
any contact and I'm thinking there was
some mounting error and the same can be
seen here looks like I did not mount the
cooler properly and a little bit of the
CPU was maybe exposed on this side so
we're definitely going to make sure that
the new mounting method has the CPU
completely covered on this block on the
new cooler
and mounting on one's so much easier and
now we have to put this in and secure
the screws from the backside of the
motherboard which is good because you
don't have to deal with it's very
difficult to get to this area but also
you cannot do this with the case lying
down the case has to be standing so you
can have access to the backside of
motherboards it's a good thing that the
CPU cut out in this case is large enough
for me not being able to you know do
this inside the case not needing to take
the amount of work out all right so
that's mounted but now I cannot access
my RAM slots alright so now let's what
to do is insert the GPU hope I haven't
made any Mountie airs with a cooler and
hopefully everything is working just
fine but damn doesn't this look real
good Wow I kind of missed the whole air
cooling direction it's a little bit
chunky but I'm excited to put this into
my next case and just see how that would
look
populate all the fan slots for better
air flow and yeah I kind of don't miss
the the tubing on great leaders this
looks real nice so now with new cooler
3.9 gigahertz our temperatures are very
similar in the proximity around 30
degrees Celsius at idle versus the
previous cooler but check out what
happens at load and now we stressed out
the CPU to 100% for about 10 minutes and
in comparison to the previous cooler
we've dropped about 6 to 7 degrees at
load with all the side panels closed
which is a really good reduction
temperatures and hopefully will allow us
to achieve that 4 gigahertz mark
comfortably all right so let's put in
the 40 enter and let's hope that works
whoo so I think we have successfully
achieved the 4 gigahertz mark without
any crashes after multiple tests so it's
been several hours of me trying to
troubleshoot why exactly we crash at 4
gigahertz the RAM is not an issue I can
easily go at 2400 megahertz
at 3.9 gigahertz on the CPU but as soon
as I push that 3.9 to 4 gigahertz
regardless of the voltage you know I put
it in offset mode I give it more and
give it less trying to figure out what
exactly is crash
system but it seems like I haven't
really won the lottery you would before
gigahertz park because I cannot get it
stable with Cinebench r15 I can to
render a video but as soon as I launch
Cinebench we just crash and we're not
reaching 70 degree Celsius either we're
staying below that around 68 we're just
trying to climb in a kind of state there
when it's the rendering videos it's like
around 65 but as soon as the launch
Cinebench r15 we crash I have
experiencing the same behavior even at
3.9 gigahertz on the CPU if I try to
push the memory beyond 21 33 we crash
and so I'd rather stick to 3.8 gigahertz
on the CPU and that 20 400 megahertz on
the memory just so that we can have a
bit of speed through the memory side and
also in the new and adequate overclock
on the CPU without trying to balance one
or the other so really you take away
here for me would be that overclocking
Rison can be a fun thing to do just to
try to experiment on how much extra
performance you can squeeze out but it's
a little bit finicky right now and not
everything is promised and I think a lot
of the incompatibility and crashes come
through something dealing with memory
because I am getting my CPU and that's
whole tidge everything is under control
in terms of temperatures so I have to
experiment with different memory kits
and it's really because Eber has
identical specifications to mine and he
simply loaded the four gigahertz profile
on the motherboard and everything worked
just fine without any crashes so when
the accepts would be to replace the
power supply make sure that I don't have
any issues with power delivery and from
looking at my voltages on the three and
five and twelve volt rail everything
seems normal
I'm going to also replace the RAM with
different kits and also maybe substitute
new storage I'll reinstall my operating
system just go full refresh to make sure
that there isn't something in there
that's tinkering with that 4 gigahertz
overclock because I want it although it
doesn't give you that much performance
and from what I've seen that three point
a gigahertz with 2400 megahertz
on the memory everything seems to flow
just fine be ready for X 299 but as Rox
flagship gaining I nine-month
Ward's the world's first to feature a
quantity at 10 gigabit per second land
port for extreme bandwidth a 13 phase
power design for smooth power delivery
and reliable overclocking and of course
USB 3.1 type C that can also charge your
devices of up to 36 watts more info in
description below so guys I appreciate
you coming along this journey with me
I apologize for somewhat of a fail
overclock at support gigahertz even
though I reach it I cannot get it to be
stable with all my benchmarking suite
and there fortunately compare them to
stock 3.9 3.9 yards and yeah I'll have
to figure that some more but let me know
if you have had any success with
overclocking your rising CPU and what
was your experience like especially if
you overclock in an intimacy n-- in the
past how does those two experiences
compare so let's end our conversation
