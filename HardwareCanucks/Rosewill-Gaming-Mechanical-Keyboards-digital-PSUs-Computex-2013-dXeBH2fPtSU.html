products what we have here is one of the
first world in the world dual
illuminated mechanical keyboard from
Roseville this is the arcade 9200 series
what's cool though is you can see it
incorporates both the green and the red
LEDs so each key each mechanically key
has two LEDs underneath of them so it
features both the green and the red as
you can see we can switch between
different colors now it's also cools the
it is a gaming keyboard of course
mechanical so you're looking at two
sections that are sort of isolated so
you have the red for your arrow keys and
of course the red for your WASD and they
can be isolated between either green or
the red so it's a little it's a cool
feature Windows key can be disabled for
for doing gaming adjustments for
brightness is also there this is the one
isolates back and forth we have and we
also have three other additional levels
of brightness we also have a detachable
USB cord great for on-the-go gaming plug
that out put that in the back so the
core doesn't kink that's a common issue
with keyboards nowadays good stuff
typical function keys on top with the
function key right here so again so all
the features of a gaming keyboard
incorporated into this nice package
now the release date for this keyboard
isn't exact but it's gonna be released
somewhere in through July or August it's
gonna be priced around 129 to 139
dollars so again a very competitive
pricing for the rest of the mechanical
keyboards that are on the market so
moving on the keyboard front from
Roseville we also have these mini
keyboards here the archein 9100 mini
arcade 9100 and we also have the micro
RK 9000 so they're excluding the numpad
which is you know saves a real estate on
your desk very compact keyboard also
cool both of these feature at the touch
of a USB cable so again great for
on-the-go gaming as you can see this one
is backlit so the the mechanical
switches features on this keyboard are
the black so they offer a bit of a
resistance they don't have any tactile
feedback and we also told that if the
customers want if there is demand high
demand for it
we will be
different types of switches so that's
excellent to see also full backlit
keyboard it's a little bit uneven but it
is there especially during the during
the night it's better to have a backlit
keyboard regardless so moving out to the
micro RK 9000 it's another smaller
keyboard very compact it has a really
cool aluminium finish on here very
elegant
if you do have any other aluminium
peripherals on your desk this will match
in into that environment very nicely
again a detachable USB cable great for
on-the-go gaming unplug this put this in
your back so the court doesn't kink very
good stuff these are the blue keys so
they do have a lot of they do have great
tactile feedback great for typing and
also gaming the blue are very popular
for that so it's a very elegant keyboard
great compact design if you are looking
for that type of keyboard so what Rose
will also has announced here at Computex
2013 are their two new power supplies
will be the silent night is the first
one it comes in 500 and 600 models the
silent night is a completely fameless'
design and it has a aluminum structure
so the aluminum acts as a big heat
saying keeping in the internal
components cool so pretty cool stuff
from Roseville the second one is the e
part comes in three models the 850 watt
the thousand watt and 1200 watt this is
80 plus platinum so 93% efficiency very
good stuff especially for higher wattage
power supplies obviously want to save up
on that energy want to be more efficient
as you can see it's fully modular but
the cool thing about this is it's a
digital power supply so you can connect
this wireless transceiver into the power
supply the other one goes into your
motherboard so you can basically monitor
the entire voltage regulation you can
control the fan speed you can check out
the temperature you can check out the
voltage rails to the 12 volt the 5 volt
the 3.3 volt you can also regulate those
so that's going to be a cool feature
there will integrate some safety
features so you don't mess up your
system so that's a cool thing and it
will have the information such as the
efficiency the total draw power that is
delivering the power supply so that's a
really cool thing to know especially if
you're benchmarking so a really cool
introduction into the power supply world
from Rosewell alright so that was the
Roseville booth really a lot of great
products here cases
gaming peripherals as well so thank you
so much and stay tuned for more Computex
