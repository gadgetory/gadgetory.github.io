and welcome back to another view today
we've got something a little different
from antic a company that has been known
for their closures and power suppliers
and coolers have now branched out into
audio products with this amp lineup this
isn't the sp1 a Bluetooth portable
speaker retailing for $99 and is
available in many color combinations
from the outside frame to the internal
thread on the speaker and I have to say
I really like the brick design the back
is also open to allow a slight rear
projection but the main stereo
forty-minute drivers in the front
deliver quite loud output with
sensitivity of 76 dB
it's simple functional and relatively
compact for travel there's a rubberized
layer covering the four sides that is a
nice touch to avoid speaker vibrations
on harder surfaces but also acts as a
protective layer for the speaker itself
the three buttons and the top control
the volume plus in the center button
acts as a play/pause and when connected
to a mobile device will act as a
speakerphone with the mic placed at the
top now it is a very convenient way to
answer a call when hands-free and mic
sensitivity is actually quite good you
do have to raise your voice a little but
and the mic does manage to cancel out
the echo so the person on the other line
won't get annoyed of listening to
themselves on the other side we have an
on/off switch 3.5 millimeter jack for
this to be used as a regular speaker and
a microUSB port for charging the LEDs on
the power switch also indicate whether
or not you are paired up or if you're
charging or fully charged and we also
have a low battery indicator when
flashing red
overall the sp1 is very well designed
for travel purposes and carries perfect
functionality as a wireless speaker so
before getting into audio quality here
are few situations I found this to be
useful well the first one in filming
review videos this was certainly present
on every shoot I usually wear headphones
but this was a good way for my neighbors
to also enjoy the tunes given the poor
performing speaker on the nexus 4 media
consumption with the sp1 is a lot more
enjoyable when I
didn't want to use my main machine and
check out with video I also found this
to be useful when I'm cooking when I
don't want my headphone wires hanging
over and the sp1 suited my audio needs
in that situation I have also tried
using this as an alarm and this is where
the sp1 came into trouble with battery
life for occasional music listening with
daily charging this would be fine what's
missing with the sp1 is a sleep mount
the speaker is always on even when no
audio is playing and you have to
manually turn off the speaker to
preserve the battery life now the range
with the sp1 is actually pretty good
with up to 8 meters with a few walls in
between without issues which is
impressive the signal didn't get lost
however at longer range even with direct
line-of-sight and finally coming in to
speaker quality while keep in mind that
Bluetooth signal compresses the audio so
we aren't expecting amazing range and
depth but I was actually pretty happy
with the output the sp1 for one can get
quite loud take a listen this is at 100%
volume
but I did always turn it down though
because there can be quite a lot of
distortion and it becomes quite messy at
a 100 percent volume the midbass is
punchy and detailed but for dubstep
lovers the sp1 fails to deliver any sort
of distinguishable lower bass the men's
and treble however our overall detailed
and for a little Bluetooth speaker like
this I am happy and you also have to
take into account the files you're
playing as booth tooth compression is
much more distinguishable with
higher-quality files now this is
obviously not for audio files but I
found this to be quite useful for many
situations around the house with a
pretty decent range for the signal great
build quality and color combinations
built-in mic for speakerphone
functionality actually a pretty good
battery life for a few casual days of
use and overall ok sound quality
despite Bluetooth compression now I do
wish we had forward and backward buttons
on the device to cycle through songs
without with having to reach for your
phone and sleep mode to preserve battery
life would be ideal now this is in no
way supposed to replace your wired
speaker but instead complement you need
for portable wireless audio and you most
likely won't be disappointed but what do
you guys think of wireless audio leave
your comments down below as always
thanks for watching and we'll see you in
the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
