mechanics and we're taking a look today
at the latest gaming product from funk
this is their mechanical keyboard D 460
now the company has always been serious
about gaming with sole focus on
functionality instead of fancy gimmicky
features so that's very much appreciated
the keyboard is released at $120 but
actually it's supposed to drop to 100
but even then the keyboard market is
extremely saturated so we'll see how the
funk handles the competition now let's
get some respects out of the way the 460
features MX cherry-red switches that are
linear and are actually quite light
requiring only 45 grams of force and
these are my preferred gaming switches
we have full and key rollover meaning
there's no limit as to how many keys can
be pressed simultaneously and onboard
memory for your profiles now let's take
it out of the box we don't have some
documentation this is a plug and play
keyboard so it will function without any
drivers but funk software is available
from the website that we'll cover later
it does carry some weight has a pretty
solid construction with very simple and
compact aesthetic plus an armrest is
included that weirdly attaches with
these clips that isn't the most
convenient to mount the armrest has the
same rubber ice coating as the body of
the keyboard it is very pleasant to the
touch and the shape and the angle of the
armrest is very comfortable but I don't
see the point of having these separate
clips as they don't really hold the rest
rest in place and can easily be taken
off almost too easy
the body is covered in the rubberized
layer that is nice to touch but it does
tend to get quite dirty quickly because
of the finger marks but the keyboard
feels nice and sturdy and the read under
play below the keys really helps to
emphasize the brightness of the
backlight so each key is individual it
and the backlight isn't very uniform
because the LED is on top of the key
really not a big deal but we do have for
brightness levels surplus a posting mode
that can easily be accessed on the
numpad using the function buttons plus
all the media controls that are
incorporated into your F keys and there
you can also see the five different
profiles that you can switch between
plus a func button that disables the
Windows key and enables macros there are
two years B pass throughs at
back that is excellent for charging a
phone and just connecting other
peripherals
despite that the keyboard connects
through a single USB port plus the
braided pattern cable is quite thick and
plenty long the keys layout is quite
common with skinny enter key and good
thing we have that large backspace and
shift buttons as some key words feature
has strange and unconventional button
sizes now a func hasn't outdone
themselves as this is just a plain and
simple mechanical keyboard the MX
cherry-red switchers are what I prefer
both for typing and gaming and so I'm
used to the feel and bounce the linear
response is definitely something you
need to get used to at first but the
fast response will sure improve your
gaming abilities now while the keyboard
isn't totally unique I feel funk had a
chance to prove themselves worthy of a
consideration with the driver software
but unfortunately that's not really the
case we do have five profiles to switch
from backup and restore buttons and the
entire keypad to choose for secondary
purpose options or macros so on the left
you select your M key we get ten in
total select the key on the right and in
this case I've assigned my number seven
on the numpad a command to copy and
number eight to paste of course you can
also record your own macro so it's a
very common feature for a gaming
keyboard but unfortunately you cannot
rename these macros so unless you go
back and to check what you pressed you
do not have the ability to see exactly
what each of the macros does and that I
think is limiting also you cannot rename
your profiles so if you have one for
Battlefield 4 and the other for editing
which I would love to see be implemented
another thing I noticed was the funk
that meant button did not do anything so
who we notified funk about this and
hopefully this is as simple as a driver
update of course gaming on red switches
to me is second nature I did end up
removing the armrest just because if I
needed to move the keyboard it was just
wobble around and come off so it
certainly isn't the best design but
there are a lot of great things about
the KB 460 starting with the build
quality and the rubberized finish that
feels good the backlight is awesome with
the red metal under play that helps to
emphasize the color to additional USB
pass-through right new keyboard are
always helpful and the price at $99 is
excellent considering there are a
non-mechanical options that cost just as
much now there is nothing wrong with the
software but it is limiting I would have
liked to see a rename function that just
makes sense when you record your macros
and profile naming would be nice and the
clips for the wrists are unnecessary and
I think it should have been one piece
well that is it for the Funke kb 460
it's a very simple and functional
keyboard that needs a bit more polish
but it's certainly worthy of a
consideration if you plan to go
mechanical so thanks guys for watching
