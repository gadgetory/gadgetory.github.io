searching all the deals have been loaded
make sure to check out our best gaming
peripheral deals video and published
yesterday but today is all about
hardware and other miscellaneous things
and of course everything will be linked
in the description below with our Amazon
affiliation thank you very much
so we have gone through a little pricing
confirmation using price tracking just
to make sure that we are actually
getting a good deal and it's not just
you know the price has been slightly
bumped up before Black Friday and then
it's bumped down so that we perceive
that as a sale within some some form of
discount but everything that you'll see
here is actually like in the lowest
plane possible for the last 6 to 12
months all right so let's begin with the
msi radeon RX 588 gigabyte version so
it's 220 plus $20 million rebates for
$200 this actually usually sells for
around 230 so 200 bucks is not that bad
for this nice cooler as well now moving
on there is a slightly cheaper version
of the msi RX 580 as well the 8 gigabyte
version for 180 so a $20 premium but the
cooler on here is not that great
just one fan so your are two options for
the RX 580 and here i'm bringing up the
Auris RX 580 again a gigabyte version
which is $50 more expensive than the
other two cards so the msi version is a
pretty good deal mandemus is on some
sales street but check this out the RX
vega 56 a gigabyte OC $410 you mail-in
$20 rebate $390 for the Vega 56 not that
bad at all moving on the air Vega 64 now
five hundred and ninety dollars it's a
little bit more expensive probably not
the best deal but if you've been looking
for a Vega 64 now is your time
unfortunately I could not find any GT
x10 60s or GTX 1080s on sale or on good
sales however we found some gtx 1070
this is the EVGA superclocked gaming a6
3.0 so an amazing cooler I think it
comes with RGB $420 and it's usually
around 500 bucks which is you know so
what $80 off pretty nice but check this
out the gtx 1070 TI many in gigabytes
from ZOTAC so this is the TI version for
the same price
$420 amazing you know this is the mini
version so the cooler on
here is pretty capable and it's awesome
for small compact builds but check this
out
the 1070 TI from EVGA as well it's
slightly more expensive it's 20 bucks
extra but I think this would be slightly
beefier cooler so you can push the card
a little bit further in terms of
overclock and also ZOTAC has a response
to that as well with a $450 gtx 1070 TI
amp extreme that is one gigantic card
will definitely cool and overclock well
and if you're really into the higher
higher and the r-tx 20/80 amp from ZOTAC
as well is on sale
not too much 70 bucks off from you know
840 so if you're been considering
getting an RT X card right now this is I
mean some money off moving onto some
motherboards man MSI's on the streak $90
for the z3 78 pro for your coffee like
CPUs going for a budget bill for your
i5s or i3s not bad at all the gigabyte
x4 70 or its ultra gaming is on sale 25%
off so you've been contemplating doing
that rise and build now is the time
previous on board with some I don't
think this is RGB illumination but look
at this
Rison 520 600 X is on sale this is the
price of a regular 2600 the non ex
version so a pretty decent deal here for
the processor that comes also with a
spire cooler and this is kind of the
usual price for the 2700 250 bucks $50
off that's kind of the usual price but
those are your two options for Rison
second generation CPUs for that X 470
motherboard for our thread Ripper
options we have the Asus prime X 399 so
this thing actually sells for $300
standard so we have 30% off $90 off
which is an excellent deal 200 bucks for
this massive amazing motherboard I love
the prime series from Asus that's what
I've been using with my coffee like
processors not bad at all moving on to
some ddr4 memory the Corsair Vengeance
lpx
16 gigabyte kit everybody needs a low
profile kit like that for larger coolers
and this is actually the lowest price in
the last 12 months which is awesome 125
bucks if you want to bling it up a
little bit we have the same price of
$125 for the team
again it's a 16 gigabyte kid it is like
this lower 26 hundred megahertz instead
of 3,000 on that lpx memory but with
nice low voltage and beautiful RGB
nation and that white dim if you're
trying to color match now if you go in
for something a little bit more fancy we
have the Trident z RGB from g.skill so
this one's a 3000 megahertz pretty fast
Ram again 16 gigabytes but an absolutely
beautiful kit this is something that I
have in my system right now for some
extra bling in the storage department we
have the team group Delta RGB 500
gigabyte SSD for $90 so the price point
is actually pretty decent given the
price per gigabyte but it's also a
really unique looking SSD with that
whole RGB illumination on the interior
it looks pretty awesome
however the Samsung 860 Evo one terabyte
wins the show for the best deal for an
SSD it's one terabyte $130 really nice
price there for price per gigabyte and
it's a really nice solid state drive
pick it up I couldn't find many case
deals but here we have the Corsair
crystal 460 X RGB so it has three RGB
fans in the front full tempered glass
front and the side and actually a nice
enclosure in terms of power supply
shroud and on the interior for 110
dollars 32 percent off pretty good now I
normally not recommend the Corsair car
by 275 R because the side panel mount is
absolutely ridiculous you have to use a
hex screw to unscrew it and there are no
pegs to hold it but for 50 bucks the
airflow is pretty decent
it looks nice got tempered glass the
interior is actually quite capable so if
you're going for a budget build the 275
R for 50 bucks
I would actually you know not skip
moving on the EVGA supernova 750 watt
power supply which is gold efficiency is
pretty awesome it is also fully modular
as you can see all the cables are
detachable and it is half off basically
for $70 for a 750 watt power supply this
this I want for some mobile stuff we
have the Microsoft Surface go which has
been receiving a lot of praise for its
mobility and its performance and all
that stuff $50 off not bad for both
capacities as for gaming notebooks we
have the AC
then in light although it's not exactly
thin and light at five pounds and almost
an inch thick but in terms of specs it's
pretty good I 5 GT x 1050 gigabytes of
ram one terabyte sshd so it's like
combination between hard drive and SSD
so in terms of performance it should be
pretty decent for $700 not bad
moving up the notebook game we have the
msi ge62 so a slightly better GPU the
gtx 750ti
full HD display it comes with Intel opt
in as well it's still serious keyboard
and a nice cooler for $800 at $100 off
but then let's move up next tier for
notebooks this is something that Eber
actually uses a fantastic notebook the
gigabyte air of 15 X not only is it
super slim and cool and quiet with a
really good keyboard it's got 144 Hertz
IPS display nice CPU gtx 1070 max-q
which is insane 16 gigabytes of RAM 512
byte PCIe SSD it's awesome and it's
currently five hundred and forty dollars
off so while this almost 1800 dollar
price point is expensive for this
machine it is awesome but then we have
the HP omen so it's similarly priced at
$1,800 right now with the same basically
specifications 144 Hertz g-sync support
but it's got more RAM and basically all
the same specs at $1,800 the arrow 15 X
versus HP omen both of our fantastic
machines for mobile users gain
productivity and everything else and now
let's finish off with some miscellaneous
things in the technology space
here we have a webcam from large tank
50% off so 50 bucks for 1080p webcam I
actually have this one it's amazing then
we have the Panasonic Lumix G H 5 this
is a camera that I currently own and
it's currently $500 off for the body
itself I want the second body I don't
need it but that is an amazing price
you've been considering getting yourself
the gh 5 however look at this price $900
for the a7 - it's a full frame body I
just have the a7 3 a 72 for $900 $500
off an amazing deal if you want to get
into photography and just that whole
full frame look may 7
awesome and so those are my Amazon deals
that I think are worth it
pretty decent options there for memory
for GPUs for storage and for some
motherboard options in there too but now
for our Canadian audience we have the
Canada computers flyers and immediately
something that stands out to me are the
motherboard selections over here for $40
to $50 off for the Asus MSI azrog some
nice options and as you can see again
the same sort of discounts for those
rising processors - then we also have
the gtx 1070 TI super clock from EVGA on
sale $220 off we also have the Trident
CR GB memory which is awesome but one
door crasher so you have to be in store
is the GTX 1080 200 C from gigabyte and
$550 this is the I think the MSRP for
GTX 980 but that is in Canadian dollars
so that is awesome alright so those are
all of our deals that I think are worth
it happy shopping let us know what you
pick up on Black Friday
