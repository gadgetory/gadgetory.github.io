from NZXT and I'm actually really
excited to unbox this thing but before I
get that I do want to quickly go over
what exactly BLD is it's essentially a
it's a short temper build in the first
place and number two it's a pre built
custom gaming PC solution by n ste ste
that lets users configure their system
within a certain budget now personally
speaking I haven't configured a PC for
myself online and have a chip to me
because for the majority of what I do at
Harper connects I review computer
components and I built pcs to showcase
it for you guys
so NZXT reached out to us with an offer
to have us build a PC online and
experience in her service and for our
awesome Canadian followers BLD is now
available in Canada which is amazing I
want to take this time to thank NZXT for
making part of this video possible but
why don't we go ahead and unbox this
thing and check out what's inside and
you guys can take a look at the
components that I've configured which
are actually kind of kind of over the
top but yeah let's let's check it out
all right so NZXT is built service
actually use components that we all know
whether that's based off Intel or Andy's
platform and as I mentioned earlier it
actually allows users to configure and
customize their PC from ground up which
is pretty cool what's really interesting
is as you're configuring your PC NZXT
starts the process with the option to
choose three games that you play the
most from a selection and your desired
resolution so in this case we have 1080p
and 1440p then it brings up the budget
options upon which you can start
configuring you can either go with AMD
or Intel and it will put together a
build around that price point you've
chosen what's really cool about this
configurator is that NZXT displays an
estimated FPS readout you should be able
to achieve with the PC within ten
percent accuracy now they were able to
do this by analyzing over 10 million
hours of gameplay and Counting data
acquired through cam software and it
helps them create a recommended engine
which helps them assess FPS metrics of
the games you love with the components
you choose now customization doesn't end
with just a components they also take
aesthetics into the equation so you can
choose a particular
color for the case and add custom sleep
cables from cable mod and if you want to
add RGB lighting inside your PC you can
certainly add that option as well now
the warranty for system is configured
and purchased through build as two years
for both USA and Canada all components
carry factory warranties too but in this
case NZXT actually taste cares of
managing issues within their own
warranty period and I think that's
pretty cool because it's supposed to be
hassle-free and it gives you peace of
mind okay so what I'm gonna do right now
is hop into let's build calm and
configure our PC I'm looking for
something a little bit more understated
I love matte black so if I can find
anything matte black I'm probably gonna
do probably gonna configure the system I
don't want to go with a lot of fancy
color accents all over the place maybe I
had a little bit of RGB elements maybe
the RAM modules can be RGB the Akula can
be RGB in the graphics card but other
than that I'm not really looking for you
know light strips or anything like that
around it because I kind of want to make
it look subtle nice and sleek but also
perform like a champ so I'm gonna get
started here and as you can see we do
have a handful of titles to choose from
I play a lot of battlefield one or watch
is also something that I do play a lot
and then maybe grand theft 5 I'll choose
my resolution which is 1440p because we
kind of want to crush frame rates here
and for the budget kind of good I'm
going to go all over the top here I'm
going to choose Intel because I do
intend to run maybe a little bit of
video editing on this one as well and
the good thing about switching to an
Intel platform or using an Intel
platform is that premiere actually
supports Hardware encoding with the new
agent CPUs or just Intel CPUs that have
integrated graphics so if you're looking
to build a system that not only game but
also if you want to get into the content
creation side Intel is something that
you should probably look into now as you
can see the recommended engine has
generated a build for around $2,500 but
if you wanna you know if that's a little
bit too much over your budget you can
obviously cycle between different price
points that they have so I guess you
know if you want to spend maybe $2,000
they do have a configuration for that as
well but I'm gonna go top of the line
here so let's see what the highest spec
here is we have an H 700 I case with an
8700 K as otech gaming r-tx at 2080
which is actually not bad we have 16
gigabytes of 36 hundred megahertz RGB
memory and a samsung 970 evil 1 terabyte
drive looks great to me and if you look
at the frame rates whereas opposed or at
the estimated frame rates around 147 FPS
with battlefield 1 and 112 FPS with
overwatch so we're definitely going to
validate that when I put together or
when I test the PC eventually so let's
go ahead and configure the system now
one of the good things about this
configurator is you can obviously go in
and you can check out you can configure
it the way you like so if you don't like
a particular component if you want to
switch the cooler for maybe something
like a neo cooler you can certainly do
that as well so if we go ahead and
configure this PC yeah let's start with
the case I'm gonna stick with the 8,700
case which is good cooling wise the
Kraken x60 to just gets should get the
job done now for the motherboard I'm
gonna go with the ROG Maximus 10 hero
because I think it supports a little bit
better overclocking with the 87 and ok
for the graphics card we've got an RT X
xx 80 amp edition from ZOTAC which is
good CP of choice is the 87 under k as
for the power supply I'm gonna go with
the C Sonic's focus plus 750 one unit
memory wise g.skill 16 gigabyte red and
z RGB modules look great and they're
clocked at 3600 megahertz for storage a
SAM 6 970 evil 1 terabyte nvme SSD
should be plenty to store both the OS
and part of my game library plus it's
really fast you can save some koster and
go with a SATA base SSD and a higher
capacity hard drive again there are ways
to cut down the cost if you so desire
next thing is obviously colors so that's
the good thing that I'm that's something
I really want to configure so again I
wanted to go with the matte black finish
something that looks understated so I'm
going to choose black option for the
case it looks pretty amazing already on
the online configurator
and for cable my extension cables it's
next to $35 I'm gonna go with the black
cables because they are sleeved and they
look a lot better than stock ps2 cables
so it's definitely worth the investment
software-wise we have Windows 10 home
pre-installed and for services there are
two options Sears there's standard and
there's new option called Blitz mode now
standard is the $99 be LDP which is the
premium you pay the professionals to
build and set the PC for you so that
it's ready to go for gaming as soon as
it arrives at your place
blitz mode is a priority option that
essentially ships the PC the same day
you've placed the order provided you do
that before 11:00 a.m. PST but it's an
extra hundred dollars so keep that in
mind and now taking a look at the final
parts list we're looking at a total cost
of just a tad about $2,700 now I did put
together the exact same parts list on
Newegg to see how much of a difference
it is compared to n sixties pre-built
service and the total cost comes to
about twenty five fifty so the
difference here is about a hundred fifty
six dollars and remember that includes
the $19 BLD service do note that pricing
fluctuates on a regular basis with most
of the components so the difference
could either be lower or higher and now
that the build has arrived let's go
ahead and unbox it
and here it is guys the matte black
build that I configured through NZXT T's
build website now I'm actually really
happy with the way how this turned out
the folks over at NCAC did a fantastic
job managing the cables inside and the
cable on sleeve extension cables look
fantastic it looks so clean especially
with the cable combs it just adds that
extra touch when it comes to the
aesthetics it looks so clean and minimal
I love the way how it looks the build
arrives safely without any issues and
out of the box you do get some paperwork
first of being the warranty information
with regards to the bill the service and
of course you do have the QuickStart
guide that just essentially goes you
through plugging things into the rear
eye of your PC which should be pretty
basic but I mean it's a nice gesture
anyways you also get the other
accessories for the individual
components or whether that's extra
cables for the power supply the
motherboard manual the other little
accessories that come with individual
components are backed into this cool
little zip block so that's nice now the
real surprise is behind the PC and oh my
god I have a lot of notes to take from
the folks over at NZXT it just looks so
satisfying to look at cables just routed
perfectly through the appropriate
routing points and it just looks amazing
nothing's really sticking out
everything's just flushed really well
it's properly zip tied and it just looks
fantastic again great job
I certainly have to take notes now you
may be wondering who exactly might go
for a pre-built system like NZXT t's you
know build service and I think it really
is geared towards newcomers who are
trying to get into PC gaming someone who
just doesn't want to go through the
process of building and troubleshooting
individual components and you know not
to mention if something goes wrong with
the component you're actually the
process of getting that fixed it would
be a lot easier when you go through NZ's
warranty program rather than the
separate individual or manufacturer this
will also be a great option if you're
you know starting up you know a land
center or something like that where you
have to configure systems with that
being said let's
find out how this bill performs but
before I get to that I want to mention
that I managed to overclock the 8700 K
to 5 gigahertz on all six cores so
that's pretty amazing but I do want to
point out that you could use software
tools like AI Suite 3 or the respect to
more than one manufacturer tools to
overclock the CPU it necessarily
wouldn't void the warranty and NZXT
clearly states that within their
warranty guidelines I wouldn't push the
overclock too extreme so that's
something to keep in mind because that
could potentially end up voiding your
warranty starting off with Cinebench r15
at stock sayings we've got a score of
1412 with the 5 gigahertz overclock that
bumped all the way up to 1630 which is
quite amazing next up we have blender
rendering the BMW scene and it stock
settings the system took 5 minutes in 12
seconds to complete that task and with
the 5 gigahertz overclock of the system
took 4 minutes and 47 seconds moving on
to Adobe Media encoder test I took a 12
minute 4k project with gh 5 footage and
I exported to the YouTube 4k precent
using Adobe Media encoder and it stock
settings the system took 10 minutes and
51 seconds to complete that task so
that's less than a 1 to 1 ratio again
this is huge thanks to the optimized a
hardware encoding feature that was added
to the Adobe suite now overclocking the
processor to flag gigahertz didn't
really yield a significant reduction in
render times but I'd still take that
extra time saved any time of the day
moving up to gaming performance starting
with 3d mark fire strike at stock
settings the system scored 20 mm 5 16
and with the 5 Gertz overclock that
bumped it up to 23,000 420 battlefield
one at 1440p set to ultra settings at
stock settings we've gone way over 150
frames per second and with the overclock
that obviously bumped it up to 160 point
7 frames per second overwatch at 1440p
set to epic gave us a hundred and
seventy two point seven frames per
second at stock settings and with the
overclock it actually bumped it up just
a little bit to 170 3.3 dumat 1440p set
to ultra settings using the Vulkan API
didn't really yield as high frame rates
with the five gears overclock but still
186 287 frames per second is just
fantastic performance CP temperatures
were pretty good with this build so it's
toxins that Kraken exited to cool dat
k32 see Idol and 75 degrees Celsius
under load but with the five bigots
overclock the CPU did get a little
toasty at around 92 C and this is under
a full 15 minute Ida 64 FBO stress test
the GPU core clock speeds were
surprisingly really good on the RT X
2080 the maximum that I was able to
achieve was just a tad below 2 gigahertz
and the low temperatures on the Arctic's
180 were around 65 degrees Celsius
that's very nice well that about wraps
up my experience using NZXT spill
service it's certainly something that's
targeted towards a particular type of
demographic and what's really
interesting is that they're using
component pricing that's pretty much
identical to what's available with
online retailers like Amazon the only
thing you're really paying extra is for
the $99 service fee or the 1 $99 blitz
mode which is just the priority shipping
option so again it's all about
convenience and if you want everything
ready for you
just on the get-go then this is
something that you should probably look
into let me know what you guys think
about this matte black PC in the
comments down below hope you guys
enjoyed my experience going through this
pre-built system or configuring the
whole process but yeah I mean bear with
