great technology selections and service
hello everyone
Eber here with Harper Canucks and I
think we can all appreciate a variety of
options of gaming peripherals that is
available for MMO gamers but choosing
the right one for you may be tough there
is no doubt Razer has the reputation for
delivering a diverse list of products
but the reason Naga in particular is
probably one of their most popular mites
aside from the Death Adder today we're
going to take a look at a revamped Razer
Naga that follows suits as an MMO style
Gaming Mouse priced at $90 available for
both left hand right hand users so to
kick things off the build quality of the
mouse feels great with an anti-slip
coating that does feel uncomfortable at
times but I would have preferred at
least a premium plastic material or a
soft touch rubber surface finish like my
AV or 7000 at 135 grams the Naga is
heavy but it sports a well balanced
weight system
there's no customizable weights to suit
the users need and I personally would
have preferred that implementation since
a lot of users might feel it too heavy
ergonomically the mouse is well shaped
there is a rubber grip on the right side
that complements a secure fit for both
my ring and pinky fingers but there
isn't a proper conventional grip for the
thumb on the left side due to the 12
different buttons which I'll get to in a
moment I have pretty large hands and
prefer to rest my hand on top and the
Naga is a nice fit for a claw tight grip
you will miss out on the comfortable
support on the right and it might be
difficult to use the mouse if you lift
it too often the Teflon feet at the
bottom of the mouse complements a smooth
Glide and I didn't notice any signs of
peeling nice the Naga is equipped with
the 8200 dpi 4G laser sensor which
delivered precise tracking in-game and I
did enjoy my usual 1600 to 1800 dpi
setting the sensor does track on white
surfaces but not on glass so that's
something to keep in mind there are 21
programmable buttons on the Naga and I
know that sounds like a lot but to put
things in perspective there are 9 main
buttons on the top and 12 buttons on the
left side where you can program the
macros to your preference
the primary left and right click buttons
do provide X
tactile feedback the scroll wheel on the
other hand was difficult to press with
very weak scroll steps which was
disappointing and we did experience the
same issue with the Taipan that we
reviewed recently on the other hand that
tell clicks felt great with proper
tactile registration which was pleasing
the DPI shift buttons were easy to reach
but they're wearing as tactile as the
primary left and right buttons and felt
awkward using them but the option to
change the sensitivity on-the-fly is
appreciated moving on to the main
highlight of the nagas
are the 12 programmable macro buttons on
the left side they do respond well with
great tactile feedback and I was able to
reach all 12 with my thumb easily the
entire layout curves with the body and
each button has a slightly different
shape to help your finger memory but I
would have liked to see even more
significant shape differences between
buttons for easier distinction they are
quite small and sometimes I did end up
pressing two buttons at the same time
the users with smaller fingers this
might not be an issue but for the rest
where you recommend to program only the
macros that you can reach and press
without affecting the others here's a
listen of how all the buttons sound the
cable is braided and it comes with
proper logo on the tip to help
differentiate between other cables that
you may have plugged in great in terms
of lighting we have three zones the logo
at the back the scroll wheel and the 12
buttons on the left side look what the
back comes with a breathing effect but
the rest of the zones don't
alternatively you can turn them all off
and that's it no customization at all it
is a little disappointing for a 2014
release the driver software is done very
well with Razer synapse 2.0 that can
detect all your Razer gaming peripherals
we are greeted with customized tab where
you can store as many profiles as you
want that are saved on the bounce and
thanks to the built-in memory on the
right hand side you have a physical
layout of the mouse with 9 programmable
buttons and up to 8 different key maps
the side view displays the 12 different
macros that you can customize to your
preference the performance tab helps you
adjust the DPI setting along with the
pointer acceleration and the option to
change the polling rate
the lighting tab allows you to turn the
LED lights on or off next you can
calibrate the laser sensor to your
surface and the option to record macros
is also available which might come in
handy especially for gameplays and
thanks to the built-in 32-bit
microprocessor that can store all your
macro recordings so in conclusion the
nagas 2014 edition from razer brings a
lot to the table with its excellent
build quality and proper ergonomics for
full hand support for palm type grip and
allows excellent button reach for
clogged rippers as well the sensor
performance is excellent and the option
to change the sensitivity on the go is
appreciated the 12 programmable buttons
on the left side do bring a lot of
customizable features to gamers that
need to have the ultimate control at the
tip of their thumb and the excellent
driver software is easy to use a few
negatives to point out is I didn't like
the anti-slip coating as it lacks the
premium feel the total lack of
customizable lighting is disappointing
and I wish the macro buttons had a more
significant concave curve to help your
finger memory but with that said the
Naga is an excellent option for those
looking for an MMO style mouse for
gaming that favors palm tight grip for
comfort and claw tide for excellent
button beach but what do you guys think
about the Naga is it worth the 90 dollar
