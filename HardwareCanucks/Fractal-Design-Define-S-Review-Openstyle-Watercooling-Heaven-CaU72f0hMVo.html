great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with Hard
Rock Canucks and the new case has
emerged from fractal design that from
the outside may not look at all
different when compared to their latest
definer 5 but like with any of their
releases in the past they continue to
modify only certain features and not
reinvent the entire wheel because their
cases are already regarded as one of the
most functional ones so the define s
hits the market at an attractive price
of 79 and $89 depending on the side
panel with a particularly focus on
eliminating air flow barriers allowing
users to seriously pimp out a water
cooling build inside the define s and
with sound dampening material spread
throughout so it's not often that we see
all these elements really perfected so
let's take a look the plastic brushed
front frame is closed off as you can see
the lack of an optical slot in here is a
major positive allowing that space to be
occupied by the fans but there is spaced
out with ventilation on each side and
popping that panel off we have a
removable magnetic dust filter with a
fine mesh spending the entire area
there's a single 140 mm fan included for
support for two more with these sliding
strips for extra flexibility for
mounting so this means radiators up to
360 millimeters are compatible without
your conventional thickness limitations
as the inside is completely open so we
finally seem proper relocation of those
mechanical drives but more on that later
the front i/o includes two USB three I
would have liked to see four ports in
here audio jacks a power and the reset
button with that blue hard drive
activity LED now I love that they
expanded the side panel window so it now
spans an appropriate length of the
chassis to properly showcase your
components the panels are compatible on
either side here so I've installed the
window panel at the rear to showcase
cable management but more on that later
and I also want to mention that panels
from the definer 5 are not compatible
because the defined s requires the panel
to slide in these slots while the frame
on the r 5 actually
holts the panel in place now I'm sure
you're wondering if it passed our light
nail swipe well unfortunately this ABS
plastic falls to the victim of the nail
swipe with visible marks so be cautious
when working with it nails are totally
Opie coming to the rear of the define s
we have seven PCI slots would love to
see eight given the target audience a
second 140mm fan included with the
traditional white planes and the side
panels have built-in thumb screws that
are so convenient and I would love to
see this on every case moving forward
only one of the side panels has the
noise dampening the windows side panel
is completely bare as you can see while
the other one is covered with this thin
noise dampening material as to not
interfere with any of the cables it's a
good thing because closing the side
panel on H 440 for example that has a
really thick noise dampening material
turned out to be really challenging the
define S stands on tall rubberized feet
that left dark marks everywhere so be
warned for lighter surfaces there's a
removable dust filter spending the power
supply and the optional middle fan slot
but I would love it if it was removable
from the side or the front as we saw
with the r5 to just minimize the hassle
now to the most part I like the concept
of these monuments up top that allows
users to remove any of the three covers
depending on their top cooling setup
plus they also have sound dampening
applied on each panel however there is
no dust filter and cause the 120 and 140
member fan holes are offset closer to
the side panel to allow better interior
clearance for radiators this is good
thing but this also means that this gap
on the side where dust will easily
infiltrate but on a better note this is
how you design a proper top panel to
accommodate for radiators up to 420
millimeters as we get triple 120 and 140
mm fan support something fractal design
has continued to do is to support the
water cooling community but if only we
had those dust filters though alright so
side by side with our five the frame is
identical in size
you can see the drive cage now is gone
so is the optical cage leaving you with
an empty space to fill any hardware or
water cooling goodies you might desire
and I think this idea most likely was
inspired by the numerous builds where
users would utilize the front portion of
an r5 or an r4 with radiators something
I even did with our our five review and
so the define s was born with reduced
cost but catering to those with that
specific layout in mind because you can
have this directional airflow tunnel
with the front intake and rear exhaust
you can have the entire top panel closed
off if silence is your thing plus
generate positive air pressure to reduce
dust buildup there's a pre installed
middle spacer that helps with
motherboard installation and I'm also
happy to see a proper metal standoff
tool as we saw a plastic one on the r5
the interior wall near the front has all
these strips and they are for
installation of reservoirs or pumps with
these dual brackets included to make
sure proper compatibility for mounting
and this spot on the floor specifically
prepped for a pump with pre-drilled
holes now depending on the thickness of
your radiator and a set of fans some of
these strips will be covered but you
have 12 inches until we hit the closest
strip to the motherboard for cooling I
went ahead with a push and pull setup
and turns out there's enough clearance
in front of the frame for a set of fans
thus giving you more space inside for a
potentially wider tube reservoir but
this means no front dust filter so I
moved all the fans inside got that
filter and the front cover back into
position now you may be wondering where
in the world did they fit storage
options and everything has been moved to
the back with these three brackets for
mechanical drives and SSDs sitting on
rubber grommets plus two dedicated SSD
brackets behind the motherboard tray and
they say this is right on point for what
I would consider necessary and big
thumbs up finding room for those three
and a half inch drives behind the panel
without sacrificing much on cable
management there's still plenty of room
left
I love the velcro straps and various
cable hoops really sealed the
for this build I actually used only a
single cable tie and if you're after a
completely hassle-free cable work you'd
be 100% satisfied as for cable
management internally all the cutouts
around the motherboard tray a grommet
with the massive one by the power supply
and the mother of a tray is actually
slightly indented that helps with clean
their solder routing and I really love
how the build turned out
it's supposed to be spacious with enough
clearance for push pull and thick
radiators and I feel the defined s is a
strong reflection on the trends of
future PC cases eliminating what is
mostly unused finding new ways to clear
airflow and stash away any storage
because with the defined s you no longer
need the r5 unless storage is one of
your priorities I also want to point out
how flexible the frame becomes with the
panel's detached understandably so given
the drive cage support system is missing
but putting on just the rear panel
reinforces the entire structure so you
shouldn't worry and the define S is a
damn good case because you are given a
clean plate for water cooling without
any compromises and if only fractal
design figured out a way to incorporate
easy accessible dust filters to the top
panel while still allowing for mulch
event flexibility and so that concludes
