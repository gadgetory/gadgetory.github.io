welcome to another video review there
are certain trends within the case
industry that we're noticing and that is
things are getting smaller and more
space efficient but also we're seeing
increasing demand for silent designs as
our priorities shift and it's awesome to
see NZXT right on point when it comes to
filling that limited market void so this
is the h4 4-0 an extremely simple and
elegant mid tower designed for her
absolute silence and it is released at
$120 it is also quite compact much
smaller than the previous h6 30 and one
thing you notice right away is the sort
of this entirely closed off design there
are no optical slots and the front panel
is completely bare with just a simple
logo at the bottom the side window is
not tinted but I really love their
approach with the H Series no random
angular designs as we've come to expect
from NZXT and the window is very large
to show off the beautiful internals and
it also reveals the bottom power supply
chamber with the illuminated NZXT logo
that can also be switched off the entire
outer shell is covered with steel so
build quality is totally outstanding
plus the reflective paint job add to
this modern design now the case also
will be available in black and red
combinations which I think would look
stunning now given this is a silent
enclosure ventilation strips are limited
to one side on the front panel so your
front intake fans will have to work
extra hard for adequate air flow and
taking off the front panel we find a
magnetic dust filter and three 120
millimeter included fans with dual 140
millimeter mounts available so right out
the box the cooling potential is mostly
utilized and that's awesome to see now
the panel itself has a slight opening in
the bottom as well to help with intake
and very thick layer of noise dampening
foam plus about two centimeters of
clearance between the panel and the fans
so they're not completely choked but
there will be some resistance it is a
similar scene up top with ventilation at
the rear and on the left side plus the
same layer of noise dampening foam all
the connections are located at the top
with four USB ports audio jacks and PR
buttons all which are attached to the
brain so taking off the top panel is
hassle-free and what we have here in
terms of cooling options is another
array of triple 120 millimeters or do
140 mm air mounts with mounting strips
for a little bit extra flexibility for
maneuver and what makes the H 440
special is the ability to house dual 360
radiators thanks to the absence of the
optical drive cage coming around to the
back we've got standard exhaust with the
same slide amount for the fan IO LED
button for some illumination 7 PCI slots
and then bottom out the power supply the
case stands quite high off the ground
with rubberized feet clusters the
removal power supply dust filter and
some mounting holes on the floor for
some extra drives now let's take off the
panels and explore the internals but
first each panel is covered in noise
dampening foam as well and because it is
quite thick you can see the cable marks
and once fully assembled it was actually
quite difficult closing the panel
because it does limit the clearance the
thumb screws also stay with the side
panel that I would love to see become
sort of the standard and with the unique
design of the H 440 they've moved things
around and first thing you notice is the
complete separation between the three
chambers all the drive storage goes
behind this panel it could have been a
little more clean but since we never
really see it it doesn't really matter
the power supply is completely enclosed
within its own chamber on top of which
we get to SSD brackets with appropriate
cable cutouts for routing there's also a
140 millimeter exhaust fan included at
the rear so pretty impressive out of the
box cooling and moving on to the drive
cage there are five catties that are
well spaced out to allow optimal front
airflow penetration i'm really happy to
see they've moved away from their flimsy
plastic drive caddies to fully metal
ones with rubber grommets from
mechanical drives and SSD support and
regardless of the drive you're using all
SATA ports are lined up without an issue
and also notice the thumb screws stay
with the bracket which is awesome
now the whole idea of this large space
between the caddies is for less
resistant airflow from the front and
what I would have loved to see is an
integration of SSD mounts at the bottom
of the caddies so you can basically
utilize dual drives on each drive caddy
and perhaps remove the one
that you're not using for a more
efficient airflow I'm not surprised to
see a 10 fan hub and the rear plus a lot
of cable tie mounts to secure all your
wiring and rubber grommets for routing
the power supply chamber is closed off
from the front but we do get all this
space at the rear so assembling a clean
system is even possible with your eyes
closed and there are some cable tie
mounts to get you started and additional
drive mounts as well now the compromise
here is that the clearance between the
side panel is limited especially because
the thick foam so really making sure
everything is tucked away and the
cabling is flat as possible is
recommended now coming in to water
cooling options removing all the drive
caddies there is clearance to mount a
360 rad in either direction although I
noticed there wouldn't be enough
clearance to mount a three and a half
inch drive at the bottom with these
45-degree fittings and giving how much
room there is at the bottom it would
have been nice for NZXT to take this
into account
installing a 240 rather the front still
allows two out of the five drive caddies
to be in place and check out how much
room there is for push and pull
scenarios and much thicker radiators now
depending on the orientation of your top
radiator the top drive caddy might have
to come out to make clearance for those
fittings but it is still very impressive
how this thing can handle water cooling
causing the top panel you see there's
very little room for exhaust less than a
centimeter to be exact and that's why I
think ventilation cutouts would have
been more ideal around the entire panel
and not just on those two sides and
finally starting with the assembly
removing the power supply bracket and
getting all those cables in order you
can see how carefree you can be as none
of that actually affects the system on
the other side there's close to three
inches between the top panel and our
memory modules and close to 11 1/2
inches of GPU clearance and tilt drive
caddies of course that can be removed
for additional clearance I also love
those few extra cut outs underneath the
motherboard and the extra routing for
your GPU power cable that really made
sure to make cable work in this case
extremely simple and it looks great and
turning the case around making sure no
cables are loose and it does a fine job
at being one of the easiest cases to
work in
and in conclusion the aged 440 brings a
lot to the market with its outstanding
build quality and elegance and with the
absent optical drive cage very
impressive array of water cooling and
out-of-the-box cooling potential with
four fans included the three chamber
design while not entirely new has been
refined to almost perfection with
excellent cable management new metal
drive caddies along with sound isolation
and price are all positives that makes
this a highly competitive silent
enclosure now there's always seems to be
a compromise when it comes silent
designs and I wish there would be more
ventilation on both the top and front
panels and I would have loved to see
dual drive support on a single caddy at
the same time just to free up some front
intake but aside from these minor
complaints NZXT has managed to yet again
to deliver an excellent all-around
chassis that deserves damn good and damn
good value a word as regardless of what
you're planning to do with the H 440 it
will handle it all and it will do it
silently so this concludes our review of
the H 440 now of course we can't leave
it off without mentioning the extremely
popular define R 4 and we'd like to hear
your opinion which one you'd prefer and
why as always thanks for watching don't
