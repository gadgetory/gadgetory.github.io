well it's a portable backup and editing
system for content creators on the go
you can create edit and share your
photos and videos without the need for a
computer that's really interesting
because content creators including
myself relies heavily on a computer to
edit and share their videos it can be
their desktop workstations or it could
be their laptops when they're on the go
so you may be also wondering why would
you ever take a look at a product like
this instead of reviewing some gaming
accessory or some other gaming keyboards
you know the drill but the simple answer
to that is we are trying to explore in
your gadgets and this is one of them so
let's find out what it is and how it
works right after message from our
sponsor Coolermaster is hosting an
exciting overwatch tournament with a
$40,000 prize pool that will go towards
one High School Robotics team you can
watch live on Twitch or visit the
eSports arena downtown Santa Ana for
free more info at Coolermaster
Invitational comm okay before I share my
thoughts on the non box I wanted to set
a baseline or point of reference as to
where I'm coming from you see I'm a
content creator and I do get the
opportunity to travel around for events
covering products and whatnot and a lot
of that includes filming and if I find
something interesting I would want to
share with the team in high quality
resolution so the only way to do that is
to pop out the SD card for my camera
pull it into my computer open a premiere
take a frame grab and then export it and
send it via email to my team members and
to myself so that I can share it on
Instagram or Twitter that's a
complicated process this is something
where the non box comes into play
because it eliminates the need for a
computer to share your content or your
pictures or a videos so what exactly is
it well it's a pocket-sized device that
comes with an SSD a processor wireless
capabilities a built in battery and a
card reader an all-in-one package which
looks pretty awesome so how does this
work well picture this you're traveling
with your DSLR or mirrorless camera
shooting stills and videos or videos and
you're looking to share something
quickly so you wanted to pull out the
raw file that you shot and you wanted to
share it to Instagram or Twitter or any
somewhere else that you like to or you
want to so what you would do is you
would pop out the SD card from your cam
and insert it on the NAR box then you'd
power on the unit which by the way
creates its own wireless hotspot for
your smartphone to connect to and by the
way I do have to mention that the NAR
box functions with the help of a
smartphones once you complete the
pairing process to the unit via the
hotspot you can fire up the nar box app
which is available for download on both
the Google Play Store for Android and
the Apple Store or the App Store for iOS
as you can see under the devices tab the
nar box recognizes the SD card for some
reason my card showed up as no-name
although I did format my card to Canon
since I shoot on scene 100 speaking of
the c100 the nar box officially does not
support dot mts files which is an ABC HD
codec that the camera shoots with so for
the purpose of this video of using
dimitris g h5 mp4 files because that is
officially supported by the nar box
it also supports MOV JPEG PNG and Roth
file formats from cameras like Sony
Canon Nikon Panasonic Fuji film and
Olympus
you see the c100 is a professional video
camera and I don't think using an R box
with cameras of this caliber would make
any sense especially if you're shooting
on a red or a black magic or even
high-end Sony cameras because those
cameras shoot on different codecs and I
don't think the NAR box would be
efficient enough to transcode and
process those high resolution videos
anyways coming back to the UI the user
has the option to select the required
footage to backup to the 128 gigabyte
internal SSD the transfer speeds are
approximately 60 to 70 megabytes per
second which isn't too bad but there are
also different ways to transfer media to
the NAR box as you can see there's a
microSD card slot USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports
along with a USB 3.0 micro B port if you
happen to use a cephas card you can plug
in your desired card reader of choice
and transfer files that way the NAR box
can even host external hard drives like
the Samsung t3 SSD in my case I had
about 10 RAW files shot on my t1 I and
they were backed up on this Drive so it
was nice to see support external storage
solutions that semi-professionals use on
a regular basis then our box also comes
with a charging cord which is obviously
a short one it's a USB 3.0 cable so you
can plug it into your computer and
charge it that way or it's a battery
bank with a USB 2.0 port would be
sufficient hardware wise there's an
Intel quad core atom
I processor two gigs of RAM along with
Intel HD graphics to process photos and
videos so when you're editing them the
changes happen in real time within the
now box and not the phone it's also
shockproof and water-resistant so that's
nice to have for photographers on the go
let's hop into a quick demo so you guys
are aware of how the app works with
respect to the device
so I've powered on in our box and my
phone is connected to the wireless
hotspot give it about a minute or two
for the gnar box or your phone to search
for non wireless network because the nut
box
takes about a minute or two to
initialize that process but once you're
connected you can just go ahead and fire
in our Box app and as you can see we're
greeted with the home screen and you can
see that there the media is organized by
date so we have two new trees a jh5
footage over here on July the fifth and
the photos that I took before that were
organized which is over here these are
the dot mts clouds from fc100
unfortunately in our box doesn't support
that we have as we scroll down you can
see that I have my older photos so in
terms of organization it's actually
pretty cool
this is interesting that's not right
honestly so media organization within
the app is not that great as you can see
it literally organizes it randomly or I
guess in my case I took this photo way
before October the 16th or way after or
after October the 16th so that seems a
little odd here so this was taken this
year but this was taken last year and
yeah it organizes it the other way
around which is weird the other glitch
is that when when I want to click on
this particular folder so the
motherboard shot it opens the
organization way from the beginning so
it doesn't actually go to that
particular portion where the photos are
which again is another glitch there are
some stock videos and stock photos that
in our box includes within the app but
let's go ahead and edit a photo let's do
that first so let's pick a photo I'm
going to pick this photo over here is
the Samsung Galaxy s8 thumbnail that I
created or that I shot for the video so
this is a dot cr2 file directly shot raw
from the t1 hi let's go ahead and edit
this and as you can see
the editing tab very straightforward you
have controls for exposure contrast
highlights shadows white white balance
or temperatures intensity there isn't
sharpness for summaries no no why they
don't have been included I was also
expecting to see filters on this
timeline or this tab but it's not here
on the Android phone which is odd
because on their website I did I do see
a filters option but on Android app it's
not they're really weird but let's go
ahead and tune this image alright I just
did a little bit of tuning and I think I
like that image but you when you tap
again it shows the edited version when
you unwrap it that's the raw version but
I like how this turns out quick turned
out but that's pretty cool you can also
reset the entire thing if you want to
all the way over there that just resets
the whole changes that you made you can
also undo the recent change that you
made you can also crop photos so if you
want to crop photos you can do that
let's go ahead and export this so here
the option to export it to the NAR Box
directly or you can export it to the
gallery within your phone so I'm going
to go ahead and export it to the gallery
on my phone so give it some time so the
wheel tab is where you can actually
pitch together and you know stitch
together a video if you want to so let's
go ahead so I made this wheel for about
a minute I think it's a minute long but
I just put put in I put in random jh5
clips I also put in a song so let's go
ahead and watch that first
oh wait
okay that didn't turn out that well did
it but let me walk you through what
exactly went wrong with that video first
up there was no way to import footage
directly to the timeline and then trim
them accordingly
I had to go through every shot within
the device and then trim them one by one
and then send them to the real timeline
next up video effects or transitions
there is absolutely nothing built into
the app which is disappointing I mean
how hard is it to include simple fade in
and fade out transitions or even audio
transitions there was no way for me to
fade in audio and then fade out the
audio at the end of the video which is
really bad gnar bucks officially claims
that you could color corrected footage
within the editing tab and I was pretty
excited to try that but I wasn't able to
find any adjustments within the app even
basic controls like brightness contrast
and saturation we're missing the virtual
app overview on their website clearly
shows editing options at the bottom and
that also includes the App Store for iOS
devices but switching to Google Play for
Android reveals the lack of those
adjustment options so there are a few
things that we could take away from this
either naar box is providing us with
some BS marketing features to increase
their sales or this advanced color
correcting option is iOS friendly I'll
be I did test the app on my android
phone and I didn't get a chance to test
it on an iOS device because I don't own
one but the fact that they claimed that
it can be edited on their app alone
itself raises a lot of questions so that
I found it to be a little odd oh and did
I forget to mention its price $300 guys
that's what you'll be paying for a
half-baked product and it only comes
with a 128 gigabyte SSD which isn't that
large to store raw photos and 4k videos
and unfortunately that's the only model
they sell the naar box also gets hot
during idle and load operations like
rendering videos I almost burn my
fingers when trying to turn this off
after rendering that 4k video so that's
my experience with the knob box to be
honest with you I was really excited to
try this out when unboxing this thing
but I'm not going to be happy when
putting this back inside the box because
I don't see a use of this because the
app itself is completely horrible at
least for my Android phone
so yeah I don't think I'll be using this
any time soon so what do you guys think
of the gnar box it's obviously not a
perfect product but I want to hear your
thoughts about it about the design is it
a flip or flop let us know in the
