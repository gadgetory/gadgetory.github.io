great technology selection and service
hello everyone i'm dimitri with harbor
Canucks and uh when NZXT announced doko
their streaming service at CES I'm sure
everybody was surprised a little bit
confused as to why not another case or
another accessory but a pc streaming
device for your living room i guess it's
not totally out of line as we are
currently experiencing some type of
shift towards expanding our options for
gaming in the living room and the $99
the dog who relies on its multifunction
to sell as you can stream anything from
your pc without any hardware limitations
doesn't matter if you have an AMD or
nvidia card however let's make one thing
clear NZXT markets this as your pc
anywhere and that's a little bit
misleading it's your pc as long as a
wired connection to your router and doko
also wired on the same network not
exactly the same as anywhere and if you
can live with a 30 FPS stream the doco
might come in handy sometimes routing a
long hdmi cable from your host pc
upstairs or in a different room might
not be as convenient if you have a
network routed through that space plus
you get the convenience of peripherals
because at the front we get four USB
ports allowing you to connect the mouse
keyboard a game controller utilizing USB
over IP communication so it's like
plugging everything into your host pc
however USB headsets webcams are not yet
supported and in my case none of my USB
media sticks were recognized despite
what it says on the website right beside
it as an activity light to the power
button the rear io includes an AC power
input hdmi output a three-and-a-half
millimeter audio jack for speakers or
headphones and gigabit ethernet port and
to my surprise even at the hundred
dollars an hdmi cable is not included
you only get a two meter ethernet cable
and a power brick so the doco relies on
the local area network connection or
land as it does not have any Wi-Fi
capabilities and 4 2015 release that
came to me as a big surprise and i say
this because the location of my
in my living room is really awkward for
the doco as my host PC is wirelessly
connected so in order to test the
streaming I had to pull the router from
the corner of the wall and spread all
these Ethernet cables so my host PC is
wired and so is the doco and so upon the
first boot I was prompted to update the
firmware and to name the host pc
connection and this strange flickering
also occurred until i switched HDMI
ports on the back of the TV once the
firmware was updated and a different
hdmi port fixed the flickering I could
then allow my host PC to stream to the
doco and each connected pc can also be
password protected for privacy the doco
is locked at 1080p resolution at 30 FPS
only so for my 1200 p monitor resolution
was automatically changed to 1080p for
the stream and the 30fps lock feels a
little bit behind the times I mean the
new nvidia shield will be able to stream
wirelessly at 1080p at 60fps through the
grid gaining service so for a wired
local area network connected device this
doco ecosystem still feels behind the
times with only 30 FPS now NZXT
advertiser's 50 to 80 milliseconds of
latency and that can be felt when doing
anything on the dock Oh mouse movement
has a bit of a delay so any shooter type
gaming is pretty much out of question
you can browse the web just fine and go
through the social media and YouTube
consumption so simple desktop experience
is much nicer than gaming streaming
movies was fine as this latency is not
felt and audio and video are synced
perfectly but there's a particular
stutter effect created due to 30fps that
made streaming any media unbearable as
playback is not exactly smooth and I
also noticed an occasional audio crackle
and i found a particular annoying
stutter that's most noticeable during
mouse movement and where it would skip
frames and you can see that in
slow-motion footage of this game it
would happen randomly but frequently and
then double checked to make sure my land
was completely free of any other traffic
and the same issue was observed with
this mouse movement where it would skip
a large for
of the screen and so perhaps a refresh
cycle on the doco needs an update as for
the image quality color and detail is
good but there is a noticeable halo
effect around the text especially the
cursor when there's any movement on the
screen obviously the doco is trying to
compensate for consistent 30fps but with
variable bit rate now a few things I
found that the worth mentioning is
control-alt-delete stops the video
stream on the doco pressing escape
brings us back to normal peripherals are
not recognized in the drivers when
plugged in in the dock oh you can still
use them tow and most importantly you do
not need to be connected to the internet
as all the throughput of the data is
done over your local area network and
overall the experience is not what it
should be for one hundred dollars sure
the flexibility is there as the system
is not locked to any particular app you
can do anything your pc can do it's
basically like using your pc virtually
in other space and the four USB ports is
a major selling point to connect devices
for the space that you're in however the
input delay the mediocre image quality
for the stream that's locked to 30fps
and the wired only option all accounts
for a non totally satisfactory product
make this fifty dollars make sure to
include an HDMI cable and perhaps a
wireless version and now we're talking
an actual device that could accompany
your htpc type of needs for your living
room without too much hassle but let us
know what you think of the NZXT doko and
whether you'd consider using one knows
for your setup it's a little risky
direction for NZXT to take but as soon
as this latency can be reduced then made
wireless now we're talking and this
could be really attractive product but
that concludes this review thank you so
