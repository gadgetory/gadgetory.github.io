great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
hurricane axe and we see many mini ITX
and micro ATX cases starting to strive
within the gaming community as the
demand for compatible hardware is
growing as we want to build ourselves
you know the smallest yet powerful
systems so today we're taking a look at
the Sapphire r9 285 this is a m-- these
latest tonga GPU and we'll be seeing how
the compact edition of the card that is
significantly shorter at just 171
millimeters compares to the dual X
version of the same GPU and to get the
specs right out of the way the r9 285
has 1792 streaming processors with two
gigabytes of vram on a 256 bit bus
the compact Edition is clocked slightly
lower at 928 megahertz in the core and
1375 big Hertz on the memory while the
dual X is tap higher at 956 megahertz on
the core and fourteen hundred megahertz
on the memory and I really want to see
whether or not you can squeeze just as
much performance out of the compact
edition of the card you know given the
smaller cooler for those mini ITX builds
so you're looking at power without
compromise the cooler on this card looks
quite nice with aluminum accents and
single 85 millimeter fan keeps the GPU
surprisingly cool we'll take a look at
the benchmarks later in the video there
are a total of four heatpipes dual eight
millimeter and dual six millimeters that
are visible from the top but they
complement sort of the compact nature of
the cooler with no significant part
Rouge ins and checking out the dual X
card the purple accents on the shroud
are not exactly color friendly if you
want to color match to your build the
four heat pipes exit through the bottom
of the cooler and dual 85 millimeter
fans give the card quiet with excellent
cooling the cards do not have back
plates unfortunately but at least the
PCBs are black both the compact and dual
X have BIOS which for legacy and UEFI
that's located where the cross five
fingers usually are but these new Tonga
GPUs utilize PCI Express bus for
crossfire communications the r9 285
compact
requires a single
pin for a total of 150 watts of power
delivery while the dual X version
requires two 6-pin for power for display
connectivity they are also a little bit
different the dual X features dual link
DVI I and dual link DVI D HDMI and
DisplayPort 1.2 while the compact is
equipped with two mini display outputs
HDMI and dual link DVI I and now let's
go onto the benchmarks that would be
really interesting to see how the Mini
ITX compact version will play out
compared to the larger duo legs I was
able to seamlessly overclock the compact
to 1039 megahertz on the 4 and 1500
megahertz on the memory that is a
substantial about 11% increase the dual
X card overclocked slightly better
reaching a maximum stable clocks of 1080
megahertz and 1500 megahertz on the core
and the memory respectively and as I was
benchmarking the r9 285 I was so
surprised to find such excellent results
for 1080p gaming everything on high that
I also did 1440p gaming benchmarks and
as you can see the results are right in
front of you and they are really
impressive now the dual X was cooler
both at idle and load understandably so
that extra heatsink real estate and the
extra fan but while did the Sapphire do
a good job on the compact cooler with
just a few degrees harder and because
the fan has to ramp up it was slightly
louder than the tool X and so the r9 25
Mini ITX compact edition from sapphire
is an absolute beast of a card for tight
spaces that perform so well in games
especially when compared head-to-head
with the bigger brother the R 925 dual X
and you can begin to think about you
know building yourself a really tiny PC
without compromising on GPU power so we
hope you enjoyed this performance review
video of the Sapphire r9 285 compact and
dual X
cards and let us know what card you'd
like us to review next Zowie say thank
