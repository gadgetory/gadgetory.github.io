connected good morning Las Vegas alright
guys so we're here live on the show
floor and the sony booth on friday so
this is what day 4 5 10 i I don't even
know but what we did see today is some
pretty awesome new tech including an
85-inch 4k TV now what I can tell you
guys is that in person in front of you
the blocks are incredibly crisp they're
dark and they're just the colors are
vibrant and the screen is just massive
it kind of makes you think what they're
over compensating for but the screen is
pretty pretty nice to look at and I did
enjoy the time that I spent with it
another little bit that I did see today
is a act of going action band or an
active band a lot like what you see with
the Fitbit flex not the forest because
there's no screen but the Fitbit flex it
does have water resistance and it does
track your daily activities but at this
point right now without any firmware
upgrades it's basically just a fancy
pedometer we also went and took a look
at some pretty cool smart glass
technology that Sony is unleashing on
the general public right now and
basically it's got a the first one that
we took a look at was a immersive
experience so basically turns your
living room into like a giant theater
system that has head tracking now I
didn't really like the display that much
it wasn't necessarily as crisp as I want
to I don't know if it's because I'm
blind with my glasses off or if the
screen to send out the greatest
resolution but it gives you a really
good examples to what you can see going
forward in the future and the direction
that Sony wants to go in and I kind of
like it the next thing that we saw was a
basically set of glasses that actually
has an OSD now if you're watching some
sort of a broadcast or even if it's live
in the in the event you can actually
have images blast it onto your eyes but
that's about it it's mostly just text it
gives you updates about the scores of
the games
maybe your favorite players there's a
lot of room for improvement so there is
a lot of opportunity here for Sony
especially like with the the soccer demo
that we saw I would love to see
individual players tracked and maybe if
you focus in on them a little bit you
might be able to see their individual
stats for the game so I think that's a
really really cool opportunity that Sony
has as well we saw a couple little of
demos of some Fitness tech there's a
little sensor that you can plug onto any
type of racket whether it's a tennis
racket a hockey stick a baseball bat and
it tracks each individual swing the
speed velocity and how much power you're
putting behind it so you can tailor your
game depending on what you specifically
need to be successful at your game we
also saw some pretty cool things with
the PlayStation so we saw gran turismo 5
being demoed here today with a basically
a automotive simulator which you sat
into the car and I'm telling you right
now on the PlayStation 4 it looks
fantastic I'm a huge fan boy when it
comes to the GT series and they haven't
let me down at all whatsoever with this
new iteration it looks great the driving
is realistic and I think it's pretty
damn cool last but not least we took a
look at some pretty innovative and will
you know what they wanted a word for it
it's aight notebook that sort of flips
into a tablet so you kind of just turn
the screen over a little bit it flips in
half you can push it down so you have
both your notebook and a tablet but the
really cool thing is the stylist it
basically works somewhat like a y con
Talbot so you could actually design with
the stylus that's included all in all
today guys we saw some pretty awesome
tech here at the sony booth i'm really
excited for 2014 and next year to see
exactly what the doing especially for
that head tracking technology so guys
like the video if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it but most
importantly subscribe to our channel and
make sure you keep on coming back for
more kickass CES 2014 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
