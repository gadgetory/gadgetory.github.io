the new 9 gen CPUs from Intel the coffee
like refresh is finally here for the
mobile so all the notebooks are going to
be getting a nice little speed bump in
terms of frequency and so if you've been
wanting to pick up a notebook right now
should you wait potentially for the
9th gen rollout
I would suggest yes but in this video
we'll be discussing all the things that
they're new in terms of clocks and some
some features stuff that are pretty
exciting and also a little bit
underwhelming so stick around let's talk
about all that right after this for our
Canadian audience memory Express is your
place for all types of electronics and
hardware goodies with fantastic prices
great customer service and uber price
guaranteed with stores in BC Alberta
Manitoba and the new Saskatoon location
everything is linked below
thank you very much so understanding
what this 9 generation calculate refresh
processor lineup for the notebook space
means we first have to rewind so the
first generation of coffee like mobile
processors carry the 8000 series name or
based on the 14 nm manufacturing process
and were released last year and don't
confuse those with whiskey Lake or amber
Lake which are also based on the coffee
lake architecture but are a lot more
power efficient and really targeted
towards the lower more power efficient
ultrabooks and such and then there was
the second generation of coffee Lake
CPUs for the desktop first under the
9000 series name like the 9900k and so
that is the product that is being moved
into the mobile space for mainstream and
gaming notebooks now don't confuse this
with Intel's ice Lake which has been
rumored and stuff so that's coming out
in sometime in q4 and that is based on
the 10 nanometer manufacturing process
instead of the 14 and so the ice Lake is
going to be Intel's 10th generation you
know architecture and processor lineup
but until then we're stuck with the 9
generation on the mobile side and so
with this 9 Gen rival to the notebook
space there are a few interesting new
things like the Wi-Fi 6 module so not
necessarily for faster speeds because
right now the speeds are fantastic but
for reduced latency and like allowing
for simultaneous connections to the
machine the new Intel Optane h10
support so make sure to check out that
video right over here
and also this is an interesting one 128
gigabytes of ddr4 support on the
notebook side of things which is kind of
interesting and kind of insane at the
same time and now let's get into the
processors and this is something that
until obviously wants to really put out
there as the most extreme and powerful
normal processor the I9 9980HK so
eight cores 16 threads 5 G's for tubero
boost clocks and it's also unlocked so
you can go in and overclock that thing
obviously it's for really thick
notebooks I guess a particular niche
that wants something that powerful that
is still somewhat mobile but obviously
is like a desktop replacement machine
then there's also the I9 9980H so it
is locked but they're almost saying it's
for thin and like notebooks but as we've
seen in the past for I9 machines that
cooling is normally not sufficient and
you have throttling and therefore more
performance than what you should expect
from the part now of course these
percentage and improvements and
performance are all attractive until you
look at the footnotes to discover what
they're comparing this unlocked 9980HK
processor to so they are comparing it to
the I9 8950HK it's also unlocked but
there's only a 6 score 12 thread part
instead of the 8 core 16 thread part so
obviously you know the much faster
performance and all that comes with
additional course on the 9980HK and so
here's the full stack for the 9 gen
mobile side of things the i5 9 300h all
the way up to the i9 9900HK so for core
8 threads all the way up to 8 core 16
threads they all support the Intel Optane
H10 modules which is nice they
all still have the same integrated
graphics the UHD 630 we're kind of
hoping for a little bit of an upgrade
there but I'm guessing the desktop side
thing still has the HD 630 so why would
the upgrade dad for the mobile side of
things as you can see the i7 9850H is
partially unlocked which means you can
overclock the memory and I think you
have like some Headroom for overclocking
the CPU frequency but like it's locked
at some point but I'm really excited to
see the performance of the 9750H
because the 8750H the previous
generation is found in so many notebooks
it's almost
seems like it's like the mainstream
gaming processor and that is a two point
two to four point one gigahertz part
whereas the the new 9750h is a two
point six to four point five gigahertz
so much higher base clock and nice boost
in performance too for that tuber
frequency to four point five which is
fantastic and it's still a forty five to
DP part but my concern is that noble
manufacturers right now are not able to
cool the CPUs efficiently to maintain
that consistent clock speeds for the
boost like this razer blade 15 and
super thin and the 8750H here
boosts to two point nine gigahertz while
in the gaming load and so I mean imagine
having 9750H here which is supposed
to boost up to four point five there is
no way as for the availability of
notebooks with 9th Gen cpu's we're told
it's right after launch which is a good
thing and from what we understand it's a
simple drop an upgrade from a gen to get
your new CPUs rolling and like the
gigabyte Aero 15X will have the
same chassis everything identical but
and UCP and also as a filler Intel's
announcing new desktop 9th gen CPUs
most of which are locked so better for
system integrators who are not allowing
that overclock to happen but there is
one interesting CPU in here the i3
ninety three fifty K so it is unlocked
for core for thread four gigahertz to
four point five gigahertz and that
sounds like a really nice little gaming
package for under $200 of course when
compared to value wise against the aim
these side of things it doesn't really
pop but against Intel's own stack in the
i3 department it doesn't look that bad
and so this roll out of nine gen into
the mobile space is definitely welcome
you get a nice frequency boost across
the entire SKU versus the agent and now
we have the i9 craziness that is
happening the ninety nine eighty HK and
the H CPUs which I would say like
they're not fourth in the light stuff
obviously they're for the muscle books
to really thick things that stay in your
desk and replace your desktop but kinda
cool to have that as on the unlocked
front because most likely it will be
crazy expensive but I mean it still
asked for a little bit of
experimentation I'm really excited about
the 9850H and the 9750H because the clocks on that 24.5 and
4.6 sound pretty fantastic on a 6-quart
12 third CPU and in a thin unlike
notebook I mean if all goes well if
cooling is sufficient then we're gonna
have ourselves a nice low power house in
our backpack and if you're on the fence
of getting in your notebook definitely
be slightly more patient just to see
what the prices are like for the ninth
gen SKUs and as with new product launch
of course the discounts will happen for
the 8th gen side which might be a good
time to pick up us like the older but
still very capable notebook then I know
Ebers getting the Aero 15X 9 gen version
so definitely stick around to see what
the performance difference is like and
if we actually hit those turbo boost
clocks I'm Dimitri thank so much for
watching make sure to check out this
other relevant content and yeah I'll see
you guys in next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
