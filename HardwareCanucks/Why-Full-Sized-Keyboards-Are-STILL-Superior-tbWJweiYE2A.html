Tess or they're new as a spectrum and it
kind of got me thinking why did I ditch
a full-size keyboard layout for a tkl
version I mean I only occasionally play
csgo and require a larger surface area
from a mouse to move around and not
interfere with the larger keyboards but
what about all the other times when I'm
not gaming and so today we explore why
full-size keyboards are still far
superior on majority of desks and this
is not a you know debate between
full-size versus t Kyel because that can
be kind of a toxic debate and this is
not what I'm trying to do but simply I
want to express my own observations I'm
switching back to a full-size keyboard
after having used a tkl version for like
exclusively for a year I still love you
G pro but I think it's time to move on
and actually if you're on the fence
about dkl keyboard then check out this
conversation I'm sure it will be helpful
but now here's a spot that you should
probably not skip watching hi I'm
looking for a case well look no further
I got this beauty with Allsteel premium
frame with a side of tempered glass -
beautifully showcase any cooling
adventure you might pursue and cable
management system that you wish you had
earlier the age 709 this one's for you
alright so let's begin one of the
dominant things why full-size keywords
are so popular and common among many
desks is price and variety so majority
of the time a tkl version of the same
keyboard model is either priced higher
or very close to the price of the
full-size keyboard and this is the case
with large tech Corsair still serious
razor and coolermaster based on Amazon
pricing so you'll definitely be saving
money if you're not looking for a teehee
layout so buying a tkl keyboard is like
getting less product from more money the
SC spectrum for example is 120 bucks
which is right in line to be competitive
with others in its class and there's
also more variety on full-size keyboards
granting you more discount deals and
visual options in particular we're now
seeing compact frames that don't extend
to these unreasonable sizes making it
more bearable for gaming purposes if you
angle the keyboard properly and one
trick you can do is to make the keyboard
appear smaller is to not light up that
Nampa area and this actual
has helped me transition from a smaller
keyboard and also we're seeing more
switch types for full-size keyboards
that normally don't enter the tkl stage
so for example on this SE spectrum we
have removable optical switches either
linear reds or clicky blues that are
dust and water resistant so you can
actually wash the keyboard if you'd like
without damaging anything while an
equivalent optical switch on a tkl
keyboard is less accessible and more
expensive like on the wooden one now
granted the winning one keyboard has
analog inputs so they're like on a whole
nother level one comes to actuation
customization but then there's also
bloody keyboards that are one of the
only other brands to have optical
switches on a TTL body so your options
are limited but really the main
advantage with full-size keyboards is to
really embrace the full potential of
that numpad and turn that lovely
collection of numbers into your own
macro Center of course it is extremely
useful for Excel work and use it long
enough for the muscle memory to kick in
and you don't even need to look at the
keyboard for correct number inputs it's
helpful for banking when typing in your
account number or writing out your phone
number to someone and you gotta love
that side enter it's really good for
Adobe applications in particular to
accept changes instead of clicking ctrl
enter and it's close to your thumb and
it's very convenient but the main
selling point should be those macros
most keyboards now allow macro
customization either through software or
on the fly so you can just simply do
that without entering any software which
is super convenient and so here are my
daily favourites for Windows switching
audio sources as I have three inputs
total one for gaming one for editing and
one for music so instead of navigating
into the volume tab and selecting my
source it is now done with a single key
it's awesome opening task manager is now
a macro for me instead of clicking ctrl
+ Shift + escape I can also lock windows
with the press of a single button or
switch between the multiple languages I
have installed on my keyboard and
basically everything has been done with
some sort of shortcut with multiple keys
in the past on my daily basis now has
been condensed into a single key and
it's freaking awesome you really get
embraced the macros because it will
definitely change your workflow for the
better for my editing profile in Adobe
Premiere I've set
my most used shortcuts like I'm linking
footage so I can delete audio tracks or
sync them up when I need to connect the
audio with video I can also enable
selection follows playhead so when I'm
calibrating the clips that are selected
on where the needle is located and I can
move through the grade easier and then I
can also enter the color grade or the
main editing workspace with single keys
on an AM pad and I'm still exploring how
I can fill up my editing shortcuts and
having different keyboard profiles
allows me to basically layer / /
specific macros depending on what I'm
doing and now for gaming I have to admit
that I've never programmed macro on my
keyboard for any title ever and that is
because my most used shortcuts in game
always occupy my mouse instead so
push-to-talk is usually located on the
side for me melee is my middle mouse
button and yeah that's pretty much the
only thing that I record to my mouse
outside of the default configuration but
for example flying in gta5 requires the
numpad right and this one may be a
stretch but for left-handed users
remapping that was the area into the
numpad area maybe more comfortable
depending on how you interact with the
keyboard mouse now coming back to the
size for csgo in particular I miss these
compact nature of the G pro but I have
learned to angle the SE spectrum on a
full-size keyboard so that I have full
maneuverability on my mouse regardless
although the removable cable on the SS
spectrum is a little bit thick and it's
on the right side so I have to sort of
route it with my monitors so it doesn't
interfere with my mouse area and so this
transition from a TTL to a full size
keyboard has been a very welcoming
change in me discovering my inner macro
customization for the numpad that I'm
starting to love on a daily basis
alright so those are my reasons on why
full-size keyboards are superior without
discrediting the advantages of tkl and
smaller size boards and if you have any
sweet macros that you use for
productivity editing or use like Windows
environments let me know in the comments
below because I'm always eager to add
more to mine then you coarser avoid pro
gaming headset is comfortable stylish in
different colors delivers fantastic
wireless performance even for
competitive gaming with an all-new
microphone for clear communications
