great technology selections and service
hey guys this is Dmitry and welcome back
to another Harkness review so I think by
now the most recommended tablet of 2013
is the 2nd gen Nexus 7 because the form
factor the specs but what if you're
trying to stay in budget and cannot
afford to spend $250 on a tablet well
you're pretty much in luck with this
latest and extremely affordable tablet
from Asus
the memo pad HT 7 with a very appealing
price tag of $150 now because of this
relatively low price you might question
the performance the quality of the
screen or the construction but I was
actually quite surprised and impressed
at this latest memo pad HT 7 plus you
can get them in several different colors
so starting off with the specs under the
hood the HD 7 is running an armed v7 SOC
which is a quad-core processor at 1.2
gigahertz one gig of ram and only 16
gate capacity with nothing higher than
15 watt hour battery pack and all the
usual goodies like a gps a miracast
bluetooth 4.0 and running Android 4.2
the displays a 7 inch IPS panel with 16
by 10 aspect ratio and resolution of
1280 by 800 which is really clear and
vibrant viewing angles are really good
but like with any glass tablet it's a
highly reflective also it's very clear
that the blacks are slightly washed out
and not that deep black found on more
high-end tablets or phones so from the
form factor it's pretty much identical
to the first gen Nexus 7 this is the
perfect size for holding it in one hand
plus the slightly concave backing helps
with sturdier grip now you see the
backing is not rubberized but it's not
slippery either so it works just fine we
have front and back facing cameras for
FaceTime or just to stamp pictures we
also have a micro SD card slot to expand
your 16 gigabyte capacity with power and
volume rocker on the opposite side now
initially I was not a fan of
displacement it was quite awkward for me
to reach there but I did get used to it
and it no longer bothered me at the top
we have a micro USB for charging and
data transfer and a headphone jack right
beside it
the speaker is located in the bottom now
these are stereo and actually quite poor
for playback take a lesson and notice
the lack of any loud projection or any
presence of bass of course this was
quite expected for the price performance
wise this is not the most powerful
tablet of course but throughout my
regular use with you to playback
browsing the web Twitter and my favorite
Android games the memo pad HT 7 was
completely satisfactory while it's not
the most fluid experience there was some
lag when opening some apps or pressing
the home button at some time it wasn't a
deal-breaker especially considering the
price the UI here is quite standard with
virtual buttons at the bottom and top
swipe to access notifications that have
been merged with all your quick settings
it's very convenient and of course you
can customise your main screen and the
rest of the four pages the hd7 is
preloaded with a few Asus apps like the
main weather app on the front page power
saver task manager and a few other
productivity apps so I'm really happy to
see no annoying bloatware I also have to
give it to Asus for designing their own
keyboard layout which includes all the
numbers the alphabet and all the
punctuation czar right on the screen
which is much better layout compared to
the standard Android one which is
included but it really is inferior to
the Asus keyboard layout the front
camera is 5 megapixels capable of
producing a decent enough shots for
sharing and also 1080p video the fact
that the camera is included is a huge
bonus but I wonder what the price would
be without it say it was even 30 dollars
cheaper without the camera now that
would make this an even better value
tablet so the hd7 lasted me a few days
of casual use you know to check your
email while away from home play some
games or watch some videos so i've got
about 10 hours of use until i had to
recharge which is pretty good if you're
not constantly on it so the memo pad HD
7 is truly an amazing tablet for the
price with a decent display excellent
form factor for one-handed use both
front and back facing cameras absolutely
acceptable performance with intuitive
custom UI and brilliant asus keyboard a
very good battery life and all four
excellent value of $150 really my main
complaint here are the speakers with
very weak projection and quite poor
audio quality but this most likely won't
be your main audio source anyway and
besides there is also a headphone jack
now after having used a memo pad HT 7
for some time it really has gotten rid
of my desire for the latest Nexus 7
because it suited all my needs for
portable entertainment
it sure has less PPI and weaker
performance but for $100 less the memo
pad offers an incredible value for your
money and we're giving you the
hard-working Long's damn good and damn
good value of words and that was highly
recommended for those on tighter budgets
so thanks guys for watching and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
