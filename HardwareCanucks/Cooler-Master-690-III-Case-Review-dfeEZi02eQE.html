Knox and welcome back to another review
before getting on with review like this
video if you'd like to get your hands on
this not yet released icon from
Coolermaster as we'll be giving one away
shortly now back in 2010 khun master
basically stole the show with the
release of the 692 chassis that at the
time moved the entire industry closer to
all black interiors and modular drive
cages and was actually my very first
chassis that I used to build myself a
gaming rig and today we're going to take
a look at the latest addition to the
very popular lineup this is the 693
released at $120 the 693 is entering a
very competitive market but cool master
sweetens the deal with an included water
cooler something we have not yet seen
from case manufacturers the exterior
design resembles previous two cases with
smooth curves and a chrome panel outline
here we have a windowed version which
looks really clean but a panel with fan
mounts will be available the rear side
panel is also shaped to allow cable
concentration right behind them on the
board that makes closing the panel
really simple and taking a look at the
front here we have three optical slots
the rectangular mesh is a nice change
from my circular and honeycomb designs
and the panel itself has a removable
dust filter in the front for intake we
get a large 200 millimeter fan with
support for dual 120 or 140 million air
fans all the connections are still at
the top now hiding behind this plastic
cover with PR buttons and four USB ports
two of which are USB 3 and I actually
really like this pocket here to throw in
some small items like USB keys or a
phone for example but it is missing
something that was included on the 692
and that's a hot swap Bay a feature that
I really wish wasn't omitted now nothing
unusual at the back we still have an
exhaust fan 7+1 PCI brackets plus that
single thumb screw to remove the top
panel that also has a built-in dust
filter and allows easier access to the
top fans for installation as you can see
both 120 and 140 millimeter fans are
supported and notice how close to one
EML fan holes are to the rear meaning
you might not be able to mount some
radiators with tubing facing the rear as
you can see here but rotating the rod
and we get more room I also like to
point out that the 693 stands are very
large and rubberized case feed that is
always a bonus especially as it allows
both the power supply and the optional
bottom fan intake a little more
breathing room and to top it off
coolermaster includes an easily
removable dual dust filter at the bottom
now everyone loves a clean and large
window panels I personally love the look
of the 693 and taking that off first
let's take a look at the drive caddies
I'm really liking when Coolermaster is
doing with this module design as when
fully collapsed it's an SSD bracket but
it's also backwards compatible with 3.5
inch mechanical drives by simply
widening the bracket in this state SSDs
are also supported so we still have a
bit of flexibility here now the reason
to this modular drive bracket is the
drive cage itself as the outside wall
can be relocated to support more
mechanical drives this is done with a
few screws with no hassle you do
compromise on GPU compatibility at this
state to ten and a half inches while
gaining an inch add stock configuration
the cage wall also supports a single
120mm fan to help with air flow delivery
and another 120mm fan can be installed
at the bottom cooler master also
recognized that this spot can be
perfectly utilized for extra drives
where you can mount either for extra
storage
now of course and wouldn't be a 2013
case if the entire drive cage wasn't
removable for front water cooling
everything removes with ease and a 240
or 280 mm a radiator are welcome the
bottom drive cage can also be
repositioned slightly back that allows
extra two inches of clearance perfect
for a radiator without totally
compromising on drive storage this also
doesn't affect power supply
compatibility as over 25 centimeters is
available now turning the case around
one thing that should strike you are
missing rubber grommets but we have
received a pre-production model and
we've been notified that the retail
version will feature Ram
hakuna Master certainly takes cable
management seriously with the 693 with
many cable tie mounts and a fairly large
cable cut outs as well and while there
isn't much room to work with for spacing
the rear side panel is shaped this way
on purpose to allow thinner chassis
footprint without compromising on cable
management there's also an additional s
SD slot behind them on the board which
are becoming very common and very useful
in beginning with the assembly this
certainly brings back good old days when
I had to read the manual on what to do
with the motherboard standoffs
or what to install first but I am a
little disappointed that we don't have
any cutouts right underneath the mother
port making routing of all the front
panel connectors a little bit more
difficult I just wish that after three
years school master would not forget
about the small details that makes
assembly a lot more user-friendly but
then mounting in our GTX 590 and
cleaning it up the 693 looks totally
fine and even at the back turn the case
around cables are easy to maintain so
really nothing negative to say about the
assembly and coming back inside top
water cooling is certainly an option
with three plus inches of clearance and
I remember doing my very first water
loop inside the 692 which was totally
awesome and I will conclude by saying
that I'm a huge fan of the 693 due to
functional interior innovative drive
caddies and the modular drive cage
system the beautiful side panel window
is a bonus with a cooler included all
for one hundred twenty dollars is a
pretty decent package that is of course
if you are in need of a cooler my only
critique with this tower are missing
cutouts underneath the motherboard I
work with a lot of cases and this was
something that is very helpful for cable
management but other than that I am
pleased to say that camasta has released
another damn good case and giving the
value with the included cooler it turns
out to be a damn good value case as well
now we are unaware of pricing for case
only but it should strike somewhere
below the ninety dollar mark which would
make the six ninety three even more
competitive and as I mentioned earlier
we'll be giving away this tower so help
us reach 1000 likes by sharing this
video and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
