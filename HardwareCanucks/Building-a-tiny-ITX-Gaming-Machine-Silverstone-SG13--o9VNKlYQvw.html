Harry's clear
so I was due for some new shaving
products and after trying out Harry's
you can get a custom engraved handle and
quality blades and I won't have to worry
about shopping for shaving products
anymore
you
sharp blades great handle and smooth
gels visit harrys.com to get started and
get five dollars off your first purchase
using our code HWC at checkout harry's
calm and quality shave for every day
computer cases are getting smaller and
so is the hardware to complement this
shift away from full-size ATX builds
towards smaller ITX or micro ATX systems
it's really an exciting time when
builders can assemble a really powerful
gaming machine with plenty of options
available and today we're taking a look
at what I would consider one of the best
options for a compact enthusiast ready
ITX case this is the silverstone SG 13
that can be picked up for under $50 with
your choice of front mesh with this
unique square slash through angle
pattern which is better for air flow or
a solid front panel for that different
aesthetic pattern this G's 13 is
absolutely tiny at 11.5 liters yet is
attractive because it can fit a
full-size GPU up to 10.5 inches which
happens to be almost the length of the
chassis itself at the front there are
two USB 3 ports with audio jacks a
silverstone logo on the opposite side
and the power switch on the top right
corner unfortunately without a reset
button the mainframe of the chassis
feels solid and the front plastic is ok
too there's nothing really to complain
about nor there's no praise to give for
the build quality all the sides are
ventilated one small area near the CPU
and the larger one on the opposite side
for the GPU which would allow either
blower style or open style coolers to
intake fresh air and as you know me I
love to dust proof every intake and
exhaust which unfortunately is not found
in this crucial spot nor is there a dust
filter for the top panel which is the
intake for the power supply and I think
it's an unexcusable exclusion as both
your GPU and the power supply will
require regular maintenance if you're in
a dusty environment especially since the
outside panel is really challenging to
remove and I would love not to worry
about this for future revisions
I'm happy to say though that the front
panel is fully dust proof that requires
a screwdriver for removal would love for
a tool is designed to be implemented
here especially since the removable
filter is included spanning the main
intake area plus a small mesh is present
for both sides which is awesome to see
the front supports both 140 and 120
millimeter fans I set mine to exhaust
and this would be perfect spot to mount
a 120 or a 140 millimeter all-in-one
water cooler for the CPU or the GPU even
thus taking the heat directly out of the
chassis and notice there's also plenty
of spacing away from the motherboard and
the power supply to fit a thick radiator
also the front panel needs to be removed
in order to fit a ten and a half inch
GPU as there is an appropriate cutout
that lets you pass the card without any
hassle although a 140 mm fan would
interfere without space so keep that in
mind at the bottom we find four rubber
dimples that I think are fantastic
design choice to eliminate audible
vibrations if there are any when placed
on a hard surface plus you don't need to
worry about scratching anything the
impressive thing about the SD 13 is that
it can fit a full-size ATX power supply
this sits right above the motherboard so
you would require a low-profile cooler
up to 61 millimeters tall or go with an
all-in-one cooler that exhaust the heat
directly from the front and the actual
block is very low-profile so it won't
interfere with the power supply inside
we have this drive bracket that is
removable with screws and can either
support dual SSDs or a single three and
a half inch drives so your storage
options are pretty limited for the
bracket even if a single SSD is
installed here you can say goodbye to
the three and a half inch drive luckily
a stashed away SSDs spot is available on
the floor below the GPU which is not
comfortable at all to install but at
least you can utilize the main bracket
for mechanical storage and with our
system put together wiring management is
well basic just making sure that no fan
blades make contact with any cables and
we are using the AR 0 6 low-profile CPU
cooler and
SFX L power supply by Silverstone which
go together nicely inside this ITX
chassis and the last piece is installing
the drive bracket I would recommend
making sure to have your SATA cables
within reach and notice the power supply
fan is facing up to intake air and also
so it doesn't interfere with the CPU fan
right below and for the GPU I decided to
install the Asus GTX 950 Strix so it can
run totally silent when under light load
and have the fans kick and only when
needed which is perfect for any tiny
living room gaming machine and so this
is it
the silverstone SG 13 delivers a
fantastic ITX experience in my opinion
in terms of hardware compatibility and
enthusiast options plus it is well
priced but it is not without hiccups
like the lack of dust filters on intake
vents is really a head-scratcher
and really annoying exterior panel that
is just a pain to reinstall I would
still recommend the tow for ITX built on
a budget we're dealing with the
mentioned drawbacks is tolerable and
that concludes the review of the
silverstone SG 13 let us know what you
