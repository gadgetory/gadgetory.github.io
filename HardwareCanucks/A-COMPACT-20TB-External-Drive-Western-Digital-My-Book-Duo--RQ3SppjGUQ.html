running out of storage every single time
I think it's because I'm a content
creator I'm sure most content creators
are there could relate to this because
we all need storage to pack up our
footage and it is one of those things
where we try to we struggle to find the
right solution but that's why I'm here
for so what's up guys were here with
hurricane axe and I'm currently in the
midst of upgrading my storage sub in
order to archive the footage that goes
into creating these videos now typically
every project that I've worked here for
hurricane acts ranges between 15 to 30
gigabytes depending on its complexity
but most importantly organizing the
footage the After Effects log files
Premiere files and other miscellaneous
items takes time but one of the key
factors to consider when upgrading sword
setups is particularly finding a
one-size-fits-all solution that can host
previous projects but also being able to
access them instantly is crucial now
initially I started with a one terabyte
Western Digital black drive which housed
some of my games and footage but over
time that kept filling up so I had to
add another one terabyte drive and then
another one and then a four terabyte
drive almost to a point where you know I
would be looking for spare drives in the
studio to offload some of the footage
and continue with my project it really
was a hindrance to my workflow I was
using this external drive bay from
Silverstone that featured four
three-and-a-half inch bays which
obviously were populated plus they were
running at USB 3 speeds which was great
but the drives were slower to access
plus I wasn't able to configure a rate
set up given that I've been mixed
matching hard drives so yeah not really
ideal for content creators finally
Western Digital reached out and asked us
to check out their new my book duo
desktop raid storage system and given my
current dilemma this was just perfect
timing so let me walk you through the
setup process and of course the
performance gain that I was able to get
after switching to the system right
after a message from our sponsor
it's time to try something new with the
key 900m mechanical keyboard by Zalman
with kale brown switches on board macro
recordings and absolutely gorgeous
RGB illumination with the white frame
even your dog will go nuts check it out
in the description below alright so I'm
not exactly sure if
you guys care about design for an
external storage system but if you do WD
has done a fantastic job in that
department the chassis is primarily made
out of plastic materials which really
isn't a bad thing since this is meant to
be stationary at your desk plus it helps
bring down the cost of the system which
I'll go over shortly the bottom half of
the Bay features these streamlined
textures which looks similar to the my
passport SSD I looked at a while back
and here's a quick comparison plus you
can check out that video right over here
the subtle white LED indicator spans
across the front side of the unit which
looks quite unique in my opinion but I'd
love to hear your thoughts on the design
in the comments price-wise you're
looking at 260 dollars for the 4
terabyte base model adding another 2
terabytes will cost you an extra thirty
dollars the a terabyte variant goes for
three hundred and thirty dollars at an
extra four terabytes you're looking at
420 bumping that up to 16 terabytes will
run you $600 and finally the
top-of-the-line 20 terabyte model which
I have over here costs $800 the dual
comes with the rate optimized WD red
drives which are well known to deliver
high-speed quality storage to rely on
and this model has 210 terabyte drives
now when you compare that to the
standalone price saying each Drive would
run you around $400 so from a value
perspective the dual makes a lot more
sense since you're getting a solid
enclosure and the necessary software to
get you up and running ask for ports the
dual features 2 USB 3.1 genuine type 8
connectors but be mindful that this
interface is simply a rebrand of USB 3.0
plus you can use these ports as a hub to
connect other USB devices so that's
awesome there's also a single 3.1 gen
one type-c connector which is the main
USB interface to connect the device to
the computer and there's the standard 12
volt power in do you note that this
protocol is reverse compatible with USB
3.0 and 2.0 standards and thankfully out
of the box WD includes USB 3.1 genuine
type C to type C cable a type C to type
a cable and the power adapter
West midgel has built a solid reputation
for themselves in the reliability
department and that includes taking
proper security measures there's a
built-in 256 bit AES hardware encryption
module and when you set it up with W DS
security software your data is secured
so for instance if someone decides to
walk
the dual containing your personal files
well they'd be out of luck because they
need a password in order to unlock the
drive in the first place but most
importantly I'm glad that Western
Digital has included this feature
because obviously having these drives
inside your main PC is a lot more secure
than having it externally but at least
we you know we have something like this
to keep our data secure the dual is also
cross compatible with both PC and Mac so
users who are invested in both
ecosystems are not left out of the
equation which is awesome the dual is
user serviceable if you need to replace
or add storage later on to access the
drives you will have to open the top lid
from the rear edge of the unit with the
included disk replacement tool each hard
drive is held in place by a tray and it
features a latch which can be gently
pressed to unlatch the drive and you can
easily slide that out just be mindful
that the duo does not support the
hot-swappable function when removing or
handing a hard drive while it's powered
on WD highly recommends that you powered
down the unit and proceed with the
teardown process before I wrap up this
review I wanted to show you guys a
little bit of issue that I've been
experiencing with the dual system so
essentially it's kind of weird so what
I'm gonna do is actually gonna restart
my pc and let's just wait for it to boot
up so the problem is ever since i've
connected that to my pc my meme or
obsession PC my system takes a while to
boot up so let's say you normally you
know I have an already 400 which is an
nvme SSD so typically my boot times are
roughly like 10 seconds to get it up and
running within to the desktop but after
connecting that guy my boot up times
have prolonged significantly which is a
bit of a problem and I think part of
that is due to the i/o being initialized
on my Rison PC so I think it's you know
every time when you boot up your system
it has to initialize the i/o the the
memory the CPU
I think the GPU as well so yeah as you
can see this is this is kind of what
I've been experiencing ever since I've
connected that not even sure if this is
a common thing with external storage
solutions so yeah there we go
I think we're booting into Windows but
it's a good thing to note since I have
the 20 terabyte Varian the 210 terabyte
WD red drives were configured in raid 0
out of the
box to deliver maximum speed and
capacity and that's kind of what I need
if I want to edit off the duel within
premier but the user always has the
option to configure the drives to raid
one for redundancy or use it as two
independent drives and all of this came
managed through the WD utility software
so the setup was pretty straightforward
I connected the system to my PC
installed the utility software the
security software and the backup
software and the first thing I did was
run a few benchmarks to see how well it
is compared to my previous setup
starting with synthetic benchmarks I
fired up crystal disk mark and tested
the duel by setting the number of tests
at 5 and a file size of 1 gigabyte and
the results were pretty darn impressive
now as you can see the dual dished out
roughly 336 megabytes per second on
reads and roughly 300 megabytes per
second on writes whereas the single blue
drive dished out 120 megabytes per
second on reads and 118 megabytes per
second on writes moving on to a tortoise
benchmark a program that tests that
drives read and write speeds using
incremental file sizes the duel as
expected takes the lead once again
dishing out well over 380 megabytes per
second in both read and write
performance whereas the single WD Blue
Drive scored 125 megabytes per second on
read and 118 megabytes per second on the
right test on to some real-world tests I
transferred a 47 gigabyte folder packed
with 4k videos back and forth between
the desktop and the drives so starting
with a duo that whole folder took 2
minutes and 42 seconds to transfer
averaging between 280 to 300 megabytes
per second right performing that
backwards was a bit faster because the
read speeds were topping at 366
megabytes per second so that shaved like
30 seconds compared to the write test
and to give you a little bit of a
perspective I perform the same test on
the my passport SSD from WD and believe
it or not the duel and the passport were
almost neck to neck with those read and
write tests which was fantastic raid 0
for the win guys
lastly the single blue drive took a
while to complete both tasks but that
was expected considering that drives of
specifications well the results really
do speak for themselves and I'm glad
that I switched the duo from Western
Digital because now I can instantly
access files and also given the terrific
read and write performance of this
system I can edit directly off of this
system within premiere which is
fantastic but most importantly I have 20
terabytes to work with so it is great to
have so much space and not worry about
that in the long run now eventually when
those 20 terabytes fill up I have to
replace both drives at the same time
because they are configuring raid zero
so you can only work with two drives at
the same time but it's but the upgrade
process is actually very straightforward
you can just use the disk replacement
tool and just swap it out and swap it
back in with the new drives and you're
good to go so I'd love to hear your
thoughts on the dual external RAID
storage system from Western Digital what
do you guys think about it I'd love to
hear your thoughts in the comments down
below most specifically would you
consider going this route versus picking
up two separate Western Digital red
drives let me know in the comments down
below any Burghardt connects thank you
