that are awesome and affordable like the
Rd 400 TR 150 and vt1 80 that are backed
by advanced warranty program now
stronger than ever
under Toshiba so what's up guys I'm
Dimitri with Hardware Canucks and Gears
of War 4 is one very important game to
be released with native dx12 support and
you know the expectations from the pc
community have been high considering
it's coming out of microsoft studios and
say what you will about the gameplay but
the launch has been extremely smooth
with day one drivers both from Nvidia
and AMD performing extremely well and
there are no horrendous frame locks like
on other day one launches Mafia 3 for
example and the amount of graphics
options we PC users have in the settings
is pretty incredible and we can
fine-tune how the game looks with little
description on each setting so we know
what we're tweaking plus its impact on
CPU and GPU and V RAM in the Advanced
tab for video settings we have two
specific dx12 settings the child
resources and a sync compute toggle that
lets CPU and GPU work more in harmony
together during draw calls and you'll
see how they impact performance in just
a little bit and there's also dynamic
resolution scaling which is an
interesting setting that lowers the
resolution in particular parts of the
game to maintain better frame rate which
was disabled during our benchmarking
session so first of all the game
received a patch a little bit after
launch that boost performance about 5 to
7 percent which is great as it's already
very well optimized those on lower and
hardware would be fine to play at 60
plus FPS with medium to high settings
and with everything maxed out Gears of
War 4 actually looks pretty damn good
the first few levels are a little bit
boring with lighting and gave me a
mediocre impression of the graphics
itself but as soon as we get into the
darker atmosphere with rain and stuff in
the air it really picks up visually to
be quite enjoyable
keep your eyes open now the gameplay is
repetitive but as you progress through
chapters new enemies are thrown at you
and I am playing on the hardcore
difficulty to keep things challenging
and to test performance we've got the
full Pascal lineup from Nvidia with
Titan X all the way up to GTX 960 along
with the RX 480 and the arcs 470 all of
which perform extremely well at 1080p
what all setting is maxed out as you can
see bumping the resolution to 1440p
gives us roughly a 35% less average FPS
across the board but still the middle
cards are handling it quite well with
except aluminum steel and then at 4k
it's very tough on the hardware even the
Titan X struggles to keep up with 60
plus fps and so now check this out with
dx12 specific features disabled we have
these frame rates but then turning them
on actually improves performance by a
good margin and we notice that less vrm
usage when child resources and async
compute are on our AMD card gained quite
a lot more for the minimum frame rate
while nvidia cards remained a little bit
ahead on the averages if you're playing
gears don't be afraid to increase those
graphics settings as the game looks
better and it's optimized fine for lower
end hardware and also don't forget to
enable the Explorer features which
really shine for improved framerate on
the cards be tested I'm Dimitri with
Harbor Canucks thanks for watching let
us know what games you'd like tested in
the comments down below and we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
