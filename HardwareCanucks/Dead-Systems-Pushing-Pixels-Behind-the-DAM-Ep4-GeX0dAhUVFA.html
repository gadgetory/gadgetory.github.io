what's wrong with you why are you not
purring on what's up guys Eber here with
hurricane axe and welcome back to
another behind the damned episode so
this week has been pretty frustrating
for me I have I was supposed to test out
a new bare-bones system from asrock and
also test out a new cool from an ER max
both didn't turn out that well so I'll
talk about that shortly
so I just decided to actually make this
vlog scene just discussing some of the
frustrations I've been experiencing with
two of those products but also give you
guys some updates as to you know what's
sort of going around the studio some of
the upcoming projects or kind of some of
some of the upcoming reviews I'll be
coming to the channel and give you guys
an update on my setup and you know my
studio so let's get into it the new be
quiet dark based 700 packs a fully
modular spacious interior with an option
to invert your motherboard tray with
excellent radiator support and an
outstanding fan controller it also comes
with a Type C port RGB lighting and a
tempered glass side panel check it out
in the description below alright so
first up I want to give you as a quick
update on the LG Graham notebook so if
you watched my recent on my previous BTS
episode I did mention that my Graham
notebook displayed some screen problems
so I did send back that unit the
defected unit back to LG they sent me
back the replacement unit and it all
works out great by the way this is not a
rice and PC I just had to so if you may
recall I just recently did a video on a
rise in mobile processors explained and
so I thought of a cool idea of probably
putting one of those rising stickers on
this laptop and then creating a thumb
out of it I think it's all pretty well
so yeah anyways screen works great it's
all functioning Justices should but I
haven't used this notebook in a really
long time here's why I've been using the
nine point seven inch iPad pearl as my
portable I would say computing device
because I'm starting to use this to
write my scripts listen to music watch
youtube videos
and that's pretty much kind of all I
need in a portable form factor this does
a pretty good job I mean first of all
it's a nine points image display so I
can easily edit scripts off of and
interestingly enough I can use the
chrome app extension or the remote
desktop control that's built inside the
chrome and control my desktop PC with my
iPad which is great all right so a few
months back I did a video comparing air
versus liquid coolers on socket tr4 and
a lot of you guys brought up some good
points as to you know why didn't include
AIO solutions that were dedicated
towards a thread Ripper specifically you
know some of you brought up the fact
that enter max came up with their custom
design ai yo cooler and I actually have
that over here so anima we did reach out
to enter max and they happily sent over
their lick lick lick tech I might be
anyways I will be making a dedicated
video on this a IO cooler and of course
I had the results to my previous test so
comparing the Noctua coolers and the
ones from NZXT but the problem is that I
just can't get this to work with my
system so let me explain what I've been
dealing with alright so here's the
problem I've installed a stand outs
actually installing the NMX chorus
pretty straightforward you install the
included standoffs on the socket and
then you just mount the pump the problem
is that the actual bracket doesn't go
through the standoffs actually so I have
three of them that are already hind'
but it's just this one over here the
bottom right hand side that just doesn't
get in it's just not compatible I feel
like the the actual bracket is offset it
just a bit north or bit south so you
know it's probably just a misalignment
or I could just do our maybe there's
another boarding compatibility not
really sure I have reached out to our
max about this and the replacement floor
is actually on its way so hopefully I'll
be able to get it sometime next week and
figure out this problem because it's
it's kind of frustrating I've never
experienced this with an AI or cooler
before no I did swap the standouts to
see if you know that would solve the
issue but that was not the case it was
certainly the pump bracket I tried
multiple times so I'm
waiting for replacement cooler let me
know if you've experienced a similar
issue with this particular AIO cooler or
just any air coolers in general have you
experienced incompatibility issues let
us know in the comments down below so
this is the asrock desks mini GTX it's a
micro STX based a desktop PC and it
comes as a bare-bones get directly from
asrock so the user has to populate you
know his or her choice of CPU Ram and
you know storage options now in terms of
specs
I mean I've loaded it with an i5 7600 K
16 gigabytes of ddr4 so dim memory kit
and I've also installed a two and a half
inch SSD that's actually behind the
system so you'll have to pull out the
motherboard tray and populate the two
SSDs over here it connects via a
proprietary SATA connector but long
story short I'm having a really tough
time powering this guy so it uses this 4
pin connector I did plug in the included
power brick and the cables and stuff and
it just doesn't power on so I'm not sure
what the issue is I tried a few
troubleshooting steps so I checked my
CPU installation so I made sure if it
was installed properly I reset at the
RAM we swap the RAM modules even you
know uninstalled oh I removed the MXM
GPU and I reinstalled it again
double-check my SATA SSD as well I also
removed the front panel connector try
jump-starting it with my screwdriver no
luck guys and of course there's actually
I'm not sure if there is an option to
clear the CMOS on on this system so I
tried everything but I was unfortunately
out of luck so I did reach out to asrock
I did send him an email they are sending
me a replacement unit one of the things
that interests me the most about the
destiny GTX from asrock is the power
that it packs in such a small
form-factor
so the model that I have over here comes
with gtx 1060 but the user can also pick
up another model that comes with a 1070
or even a 1080 and God knows how much
heat that's gonna output but I'm excited
to test out the replacement model
obviously to see you know what kind of
performance can it bring to the table
when you put it against a laptop or even
desktop class PC just so you're aware we
actually teamed up with LG to give away
a two thousand dollar gaming PC and one
of their recent ultrawide monitor is a
34 use
89 gee you can actually check out the
review for that monitor right over here
and yes the contest is international so
anyone is eligible to enter good luck to
the contestants and yeah super excited
to announce the winner for this contest
next up I wanted to give you guys a
sneak peak on some of the smart phones
that I have lined up to review in the
upcoming months so currently I'm testing
the pixel to not the excel so this is
the baby brother for the to excel and I
just I just triggered Google assistance
the squeeze feature is is interesting I
mean it's sometimes get annoying but
you'll obviously have the option to turn
it off but I'm just too lazy to do that
yeah I'll be testing the two or the
pixel two for the next little while and
then I'll be switching gears to the V 30
which is again a very underrated
smartphone for this year not a lot of
people have been talking about it but it
seems like a really good option
especially for someone who's looking for
a solid Android smartphone but I'm
excited to test it out can't give you
guys my full verdict on that yet this is
the Q 6 from LG it's a budget oriented
phone but it does feature pretty much
all the essentials that you know you
would require like a good camera go to
screen edge to edge actually and yeah
that'll be pretty interesting well that
pretty much concludes this behind the
dam episode I hope you enjoyed and feel
free to let me know your thoughts on you
know some of the stuff that I've been
dealing with like the NMX cooler the
problems that I've been facing with that
and of course the asrock desk mini GTX
what do you guys think about that do you
think it's something that a lot of
people might be interested in especially
for its compact nature and performs that
it packs I can give you guys my full
verdict yet because a my current sample
isn't powering on and I'm waiting for
the replacement unit but I'm curious to
see how that performs I'm also really
excited to test out the new camera on
the new pixel 2 smartphone because it's
been receiving a lot of praise online so
definitely stay tuned for the review
also stay tuned for the review of the V
30 from LG underrated smartphone of 2017
but I'm sure I'm gonna enjoy my time
with that but that pretty much concludes
this episode hope you guys enjoyed i'm
