we just finished Computex 2013 this is
the last day that I'm here and so we
want to do a little recap but what
happened in our pre-show analysis so we
talked about aim these come back aim D
vs. Intel we talked about Firefox
tablets and thunderbolt and of course
Windows 8 so where is gonna be so let's
just start off with aim d vs Intel there
strive towards mobile chipsets where
what did we see here at Computex yeah so
both companies and their keynotes wanted
to showcase their mobile offerings for
an the at CPU they want to make your APU
available on the PC platforms as you
found out now in on the gaming consoles
and also in mobile consoles platforms
rather yeah for Intel Haswell which was
the highlight of their keynotes that's
on Tuesday I started the show I it was
how pasmo can work on mobile platforms
as well as really claim has a very low
power draw it has a very low heat
pattern and it'll be perfect for tablets
and mobile platforms so both companies
are pushing for mobile things arguably
asked well is an EPO by any other name
it's an SOC it's taking cues from AMD
which is fun to see because for a while
it was the opposite Intel would set the
conversation for mobile chips and do a
follow up with that continue on with aim
these come back I mean they really you
know what they were almost in bankruptcy
just a couple of what the year ago
that's right yeah so now that aim these
really shown us that they're very
aggressive in the gaming market in the
gaming world again pushing towards the
APU and APU is being integrated not just
on mobile machines but also on the
desktop so that was actually quiet fun
to see now speaking out with Windows 8
where was Windows 8 well
Windows 8 premiere in 2011 at Computex
Windows RT so that's Windows 8 on arm
platforms was supposed to be Microsoft
saving grace that was been put the
windows ecosystem on the growing mobile
platform so when
those on tablets windows on smartphones
so and so forth however the problem is
it wasn't at Computex yeah
aside from Microsoft booth on the third
floor of one of the show halls there
weren't any Windows RT platforms at the
show there was me those eight platforms
but they were on x86 not Artie Artie
wasn't at the show it was a no-show
so moving on Thunderbolt we've pulled up
with Thunderbolt with Intel also when to
talk to USB USB guys
so where is Thunderbolt well Thunderbolt
came out on the PC platform last year
Computex so it's been a year since the
first came out in the in that time
they've announced its follow about 2.0
it still is the fastest connectivity
platform out there it's designed for
high end stuff so you know high-end
computers high-end devices like cameras
this drives and also 4k monitors the
problem is though it's not making the
splash on the PC platform we didn't see
that many mobos with Thunderbolt on it
it's a niche platform Intel says they
like it that way they want to contain
they want to have that high ends high
margin premium side of the markets the
problem is though USB can easily scale
up and try and conquer that they can
easily create USB 3.5 or 4.0 which has
the compatibility of prior years B
devices and that market share and take
on Thunderbolts high speed high margin
high power it's nitch now moving on
Firefox tablet so we we mentioned that
in our pre-show analysis we were excited
to see it we were hoping to see it was
Firefox also in those show like when
those eight maybe Firefox were supposed
to debut a tablet at Computex this year
with Hong hi a odm from China but we
couldn't find a keynote for that on the
show schedule we looked and we looked
who can find anything
eventually we saw a guy with Mozilla bag
and I asked him you know is there gonna
be a keynote and launching of a Firefox
tablets at Computex he didn't give me a
straight answer
that perhaps maybe I'll let you know and
give me his business card aside from
that chance encounter I could not find a
Firefox tablets on the show floor and
that was it let's transition to some of
the cool things that we saw on the show
ground well starting off with some of
the cases so in win had amazing really
interesting and unique cases on the show
ground like the towel the mirror case
you have a lot of views got a lot of
comments about it everybody's excited
but problem is it's $700 right so but
then again you're thinking that a lot of
people are spending five ten thousand
dollars in their hardware right so
spending a thousand dollars on the
graphics card then why not spending $700
on the case right it's something that
will house all your expensive components
of course it's a - to each their own but
it was a cool thing to see
Leanne Lee has a lot of new cases coming
out all aluminum and we also visited
their factory so that was a quite cool
thing to see first-hand experience on
how and where the cases are made the
Rose will rise was a really cool product
again it's giving us the full tower
capability in the mid tower package and
also of course their Corsair is known
for their cases so it was awesome to
speak to George about their air 540 and
their new 330 are again really cool
things from coarser also another cool
thing that we noticed in the show was
that companies are expanding into
foreign territories so so big Phoenix a
case company manufacturing headphones so
where did that come from
now g.skill a memory company expanding
into headphones and it actually seemed
like it was a memory company looking to
when you're looking towards expansion in
the gaming market and starting with the
headset it was actually I think it's a
pretty bad idea because they were very
bulky uncomfortable very poor audio
quality now across the floor we also
came up with some knockoff which was
pretty interesting yeah we saw a few
companies from the mainland they were
what's called ODM original device
manufacturers and they had a one
computer in particular that looked a lot
like a certain Mac computer I believe
the new iMac
as you see here that is 9mag it's not
yeah
but it ran windows I mean it looked a
lot like an iMac yeah it had the same
sort of design and form factor as an
iMac but it wasn't it was a cheap
knockoff we looked at the build quality
it was terrible
UBC I bought glue from hot glue gun or
something on it yeah it looked like
garbage
it was probably full of cancer-causing
chemicals now also we got a lot of
comments from from our viewers when we
spoke with Roseville because the
Roseville representative their global VP
was there just happened to be there when
we were interviewing some of the guys
for the cases so we wanted to shoot a
video with him and his enthusiasm and
his really really aggressiveness was
infectious but it was also a great case
of you know marketing vs I'll give the
guy props for his enthusiasm and his
power but isro's well in the clunker the
world's will be all scream rose well
when we game I don't think so no
speaking of loud and boisterous people
here is a clip free love booth babe
shows we saw at Computex take a look
so now you guys saw some of the booth
babes but we also want to share a day in
a life of hard knocks covering the event
