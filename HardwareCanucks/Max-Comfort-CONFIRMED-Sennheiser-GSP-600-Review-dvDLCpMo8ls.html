this is the GSP 600 from San Heiser it's
their latest and greatest and most
premium gaming headset at $249 it better
be and I'm really happy to see slight
refinements that you definitely will
appreciate once you start using them
based on their whole gaming DMA so let's
see if this headset is for you right
after this the new OC CTR 200 from
Toshiba is a great value SSD if you're
considering upgrading a hard drive and
get a nice boost in performance with
cutting-edge 3d flash memory and ultra
reliable controller with built-in power
management available in different
capacities check it out below alright so
the GSP lineup was born with the GSP 300
and I think it was made because they
were trying to shift away from the
traditional headphone design that was
found on their gaming series which by
the way I still use on a daily basis but
as you can see this is a gaming product
and this is their standard headphone
with a microphone attached and what's
exciting in this lineup is there's
currently nothing in the middle between
the $99 pair and into $49 pair so I'm
excited to see if they can squeeze in
the product that balance out the price
point and the features between these two
headsets now my immediate reaction was
to compare the two and see what's
different the GSP 600 feels sturdier
it's heavier it's bulkier compared to
the more plastic GSP 300 and I think
that's to make sure that it's durable in
the long end and I dropped this thing
multiple times I dragged it across the
floor with my chair accidentally and
this thing feels like it can take a hit
so there is no creaking when you're
trying to flex it or extend it which is
nice I do love the combination of sturdy
plastics and this aluminum hinge that
not only looks fantastic but also
provides mobility for the ear cup on
both sides and this red accent
absolutely looks awesome and it kind of
hides this kind of discreet volume knob
that has such nice density that when you
turn it you can definitely tell that
they've kind of learned their ways from
really loose
volume wheels on the GSP 300 or the
incredibly loose volume dial on the game
series and the volume wheel at the
lowest position actually mutes the
headset unlike on previous ones where
you could still hear a little bit of
audio at the lowest position and the
microphone falls in the same sweet
really smooth rotation
nice density so it just Neal holds in
place very well and there's a nice
tactile bump to let you know when the
mic is muted when it's in the upright
position the cable is removable from the
left ear cup and I don't normally like
braiding on cables because it adds
additional weight but this one is very
light it does not kink and I think it
absorbs majority of cable noise because
if it brushes against your shirt you
still hear it in your ear cups but it's
heavily muted and so we have a standard
splitter cable for PCs and this 90
degree connector for consoles and your
smartphone because it's a four pole
connector so the microphone will still
work now with regards to comfort the ear
cups are incredible so there's still the
same long and deep and memory foam ear
cushion so regardless of the clamping
force the isolation it creates is
awesome but also there is a two types of
materials on the ear cup so on the
exterior we have leather for best
isolation of the sound but where your
skin makes contact with the ear cup it's
suede so it's super comfortable and make
sure there's no heat concentration in
those areas and the padding on the
headband is thick enough to make sure
there's no force concentration on top of
your head and also it is kind of
separated into two to make sure you can
get these pressure sliders so let's talk
about them now alright so initially I
did not find these comfortable because I
was approaching them from a standard
headset a sort of configuration in terms
of expand them to your head size put
them on and let the ear cup swivel do
their thing in adjusting to your head
shape but I always found that there was
too much clamping force at the bottom of
the ear cup at the top it feels perfect
but it feels a little bit unbalanced and
that's exactly where the low adjustments
sliders at the top of the headband come
into play so they release the pressure
from the headband and now the bottom of
the ear cup doesn't feel like there's so
much clamping force and feels a lot more
balanced throughout the entire ear cup
now I realize this comfort approach is
unconventional but it's pretty genius
because it accommodates four different
head sizes different head shapes see if
you have more narrower and like a trend
interface at the bottom this additional
clamping force from the ear or lower ear
Cup would be perfect for you and so it
allows you to kind of configure it based
on square head
triangular head and larger heads -
because they do expand quite a bit and
because of this additional slide
you can untighten the the the headbands
so that you know right now like this is
this is a huge huge headset look at this
look at this I do like that these
sliders have like these tactile steps so
you can configure them on both sides
equally but for me I always keep them on
the very top so the headband is as
flexible as possible so that the
clamping force at the very bottom is
more balanced than before so yes this
headset expansion is awesome but what I
find odd are the lack of any levels on
the headband to let you know how many
steps you've expanded the headset on the
GSP 300 has those little indicators so
you can make sure to match them on each
side but the GSP 600 doesn't have that
and so I wouldn't say this is the most
comfortable headset that they've created
I actually preferred the game series
style and format because they're just
you know there's not this bulky for
example like I could fit my whole hand
the whole design of the headset whereas
with the game series to just hug your
head and they don't feel intrusive at
all but in terms of isolation these are
incredible especially given the ear cups
are quite thick and so pressing them in
I can feel the sound pressure the air
pressure inside the ear cups kind of
forming so that means that the seal is
fantastic so when you're gaming there's
absolutely nothing around you that can
give you any distractions because you
will not be able to hear anything and
because they're so bulky you cannot
leave them around your neck it feels
like you're about to get choked by
something ya know they're not good for
the neck you have to take them off and
here's me wearing the GSP 300 the actual
isolation on these is not as good as on
the GSP 600 because the clamping force
here is tighter which explains the need
for this pressure adjustment at the top
now I can see a lot of people being
turned off by the physical appearance of
this headset because you know it's got
more gamer aesthetic with the the red
accents and you kind of bulky microphone
there's been the staple for son Heiser
but now we have this additional control
with the headband to adjust your
pressure but the compromise of it
looking kind of bulky and heavy it's not
heavy but it's not as light as the game
series and now microphone quality this
is what the GSP 600 sounds like I
is going to become my new benchmark for
good microphone quality among gaming
headsets it's the most powerful sound
it's got some noise cancellation
properties built-in but as you can hear
I mean we start typing on an expressway
and you can clearly hear them being
picked up in the background so noise
cancellation is present when it will try
to mute everything in the background but
don't expect completely everything being
isolated and now you listen to game one
headset which has been my favorite
microphone on all gaming headsets which
is now being replaced by the GSP 600 so
it's got the same characteristics in
terms of noise cancellation you can hear
them but they are muted but this one is
now not as loud so the actual power on
the microphone pick up it's not as good
as on the GSP 600 so yeah game one and
this will the GSP 300 sounds like it's
not as loud it's not as detailed there's
more compression compared to the other
two headsets so the actual boom arm is
identical in terms of its flexibility
and its rotation with mic when it's in
the upright position but the actual
sound quality of the microphone yeah
it's just not as good as the game one or
the GSP 600 now in terms of sound
quality the GSP 600 has a few
interesting characteristics let me
explain in comparison to GSP 300 which I
still think is the best $99 headset you
can buy right now the GSP 600 had a lot
more power in the bass Department
without overpowering anything in there
so they felt more full and the higher
end was a lot smoother so you could
listen to these at maximum volume
without introducing any fatigue whereas
these felt more harsh in comparison but
in comparison to the game one which is
an open style headset with fantastic
stereo imaging and really nice roomy and
airy soundstage the GSP 600 in vocals
felt like they were pushed farther away
making your audio environment a bit
bigger but this is already an open style
headset so it makes sense that son
Heiser is tuning their drivers to kind
of open up the soundstage because of its
close back nature to simulate a larger
environment without introducing any
surround sound gimmicks so we have
really excellent isolation fantastic
sound signature across the board in
terms of smooth high-end
really nice mid-range although it is
pushed back a bit to expand your sound
environment and really deep bass it just
completely blows anything that I
currently own out of the water in terms
of that like really good power that you
feel like it's there it's not like
rumbling your vibration but it's like
air movement it's awesome and that kind
of makes it for the perfect sound
signature for games because you feel
everything in the lower end the treble
is fantastic so you can hear all the
details in the mid-range a slightly push
back to allow you to you know kind of
sense a larger audio environment and
that is one of the reasons why I love
open bag designs because you feel like
you're in the larger audio space but the
GSP 600 delivers a really nice open
sound environment so that's awesome
but for competitive games or any game
where you require to use the microphone
because of the closed-back nature you
cannot hear yourself when you speak
unless you enable some like mic feedback
in your software but I don't have that
on my motherboard so when you're
speaking to your teammates you cannot
hear what you're saying and that's kind
of like an odd feeling for me which is
another reason why I prefer open-back
headsets because I can hear exactly what
I'm saying because I can hear the
exterior environment perfectly fine now
I will say I'm using my onboard audio on
the motherboard which is perfectly fine
to drive this headset at a really
powerful volume without any quality loss
and so the GSP 600 to me feels like a
really good direction for Sennheiser to
take in order to establish their budget
entry at $99 and then $250 for the most
premium things and then hopefully we'll
see something in the middle to
accommodate like this like balance of
features to price and I think this is
the headset that will last the longest
out of their entire gaming series
because it's built so well and the sound
signature is absolutely perfect the
drivers awesome and you'll definitely
have a damn good time with the GSP 600
alright so that's all for the GSP 600
review I'm impressed
on all fronts the microphone quality the
comfort the fit you know the whole
adjustability for the pressure and I
think they're taking this approach in
terms of reshaping the frame versus
something like this the game series
which is also a 2 $49 product is for
durability I think this will last a lot
longer
than anything that you know this is my
second pair actually in two years so
let's see how these stack up in the long
run so that's it make sure to subscribe
