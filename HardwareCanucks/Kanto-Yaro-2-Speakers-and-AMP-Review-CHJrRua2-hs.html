great technology selection and service
hello everybody I'm Aiden with Hardware
Canucks and today we'll be taking a look
at the yarrow tree system from Kanto
this stereo system is priced at 449 for
the set which includes the two passive
speakers and the yarrow 2 amp
the set is aimed desk use as well as TV
and home theaters with Kantor marketing
the arrow too as being a simple and easy
to use system with a small footprint the
system has a gloss black finish with a
soft rubber finish on top and the design
language is very reminiscent of the
Apple TV and overall Ethel's of this
look very well however both the glossy
surface and the rubber finish so we're
very quickly the gloss will show dust
and is a fingerprint magnet and you'll
notice any dust or wear on the rubber as
well if you're keeping the speaker
stationary without touching them like
most people will be this probably won't
be an issue but if you're moving them
around frequently be ready to bust out
that microfiber cloth something which
would have been nice to include I can't
really lay into them on not including a
cloth however as they've done really
well with accessories included batteries
for the remote is a nice gesture and the
inclusion of true optical cables at
different lengths is awesome as most
companies don't even include them and
most people don't have them lying around
also in the boxes the included remote AC
adapter speaker wires USB cord for
connection to your PC and a 3.5
millimeter cable and I guess on the note
of cables we should take a look at the
available ports since all the speakers
are passive all the inputs and outputs
are handled directly on the arrow to app
on the back your left and right speaking
connections as well as a port for an
optional sub you also have your power
port with the included power brick and
your three outputs aux optical and USB
these are probably the most versatile
ports they could have included as it
covers use with mobile devices PCs TVs
and game consoles the one other
connection that would have really made
this amp would have been Bluetooth like
on the wire three speakers as having an
amplifier which you can pair with any
speakers to make them bluetooth
paddleball would have been awesome
however Kanto decided not to include
that on the arrow - you also have a
headphone jack on the front and while
Kanto didn't market this the arrow too
has quite a powerful headphone amplifier
built in as well to control all of these
connections you have an infrared remote
with source selection 12 stops of bass
and treble adjustment balance control
playback control for use with USB
connection as well as volume adjustment
the remote takes 2 included triple-a
batteries and has a similar finish to
the amp and speakers on the topic of the
speakers they feature a one-inch silk
dome tweeter and a 3.5 inch paper dome
woofer houston an acoustic grade MDF
cabinet the we ro true puts out a fair
bit of power as well considering its
size pushing 35 watts RMS per channel
with all of these specifications and the
physical overview done I'll start to
talk about how I found the system in
day-to-day use now I initially placed
and test these speakers at my desk
however the more I used them the more I
realized that the feature set tends to
lean itself towards sound system use as
well so I also tested this in a TV room
and home theater scenario so I'll start
with usability at the desk I found
myself using these like any other
speakers I used the USB connection for
my PC and while it's nice to have a
large volume control in front of me I
didn't end up using any other inputs and
I didn't really use the remote it just
feels clunky for desk use it stayed in
my drawer most of the time besides
occasional bass and treble adjustment
the yaro 2 has a built-in standby mode
so if you leave it on without any signal
coming through it it will go into
standby and then wake up when it detects
a signal again this can be nice to save
some power and if you're coming back to
it later you can leave it on personally
I fully power off everything when I'm
not using my PC so this meant that when
I came back I was powering it on from
scratch this was frustrating as it
wouldn't remember settings so I would
have to change inputs volumes and adjust
bass or treble again which was really
frustrating on a good note however
having the headphone jack on the front
is nice as it allows for easy connection
of your headphones to a high-quality
source it has the benefit of going
through the arrow throughs deck as well
which means that you're getting cleaner
audio and the
- also has a very powerful headphone amp
my PC needs about 70% volume to drive my
k7 xx headphones at a comfortable volume
whereas the yarrow too can pump these
way further to the point where it would
blow your ears out by the time the ro 2
is maxed out these cans distortion has
hit them to the point where you can
barely recognize the music I would feel
comfortable with this driving headphones
we are much much higher impedance and
not feature set is one that's quite
appealing having a powerful headphone
amplifier makes the arrow to a much more
two-in-one system and it's a great
feature now in terms of sound
these speakers sound pretty decent at my
desk but I wasn't super impressed they
are for a fairly flat response with
pretty good soundstage however I found
that they lacked in bass and especially
fell short in very low register sounds
the mid-range was fairly strong but the
high range fell flat in certain genres
and overall I found that speakers were
lacking in clarity and punch
I found the turning of the bass on the
remote helps to fill this out a little
more but even so it was still fairly
underwhelming they also sound a bit thin
by themselves and they lack warm with
the high register being a little harsh
at times on a volume perspective they
can very very loud which is due to the
powerful yaro 2 amplifier and a branch
on that a little more later that's not
to say they're bad but I don't think
they're that competitive on a pure sound
perspective when they're competing with
speakers like the audio engine a 5
pluses they're not what I would call fun
speakers and they're not flat enough
with enough range to be studio monitors
either so they're left in this weird
middle ground if you're planning on
having speakers live solely on the desk
these might not be for you but part of
this system is the expandability and
features and if you're moving the
speaker's around this feature set might
appeal to you this brings us to the next
area which is a TV room this is where I
think the arrow 2 is excel the small
footprint and design lends itself well
to an upgrade to the inbuilt TV audio
and the optical port on the RO 2 means
that this can work with your TV or other
devices like a
console DVD player or something like the
Apple TV for most TV programs the
speakers perform really well they're
clear and they sound great and for TV
watching which is more reliant on the
mid-range and is less critical in terms
of sound they will provide a much better
experience the remote also comes into
play here as being able to switch inputs
easily if you're changing devices and
controlling volume is really handy and
overall it works well now the last area
I tested this in was a home theater /
movie watching experience I was
simultaneously impressed and
disappointed in this area I was really
impressed by how much power the ro 2 can
push I could get these speakers to
volumes which were way beyond
comfortable listening levels even in
this really large space which is really
impressive even with larger speakers the
ro 2 could push them to be much louder
than I could ever want and it did really
well for that speakers also sounded
really good for movies with clear and
detailed sound with very good soundstage
and they performed really well except
for one element which is bass as I said
earlier adding more bass via the remote
helps listening in almost all areas but
you don't really get any Rumble which
you especially need in movies the
amplifier does have a sub port and once
I added in a subwoofer the sound became
fuller then I was extremely satisfied
with the sound if you're going to be
using this for a home theater movie
watching experience subwoofer really
helps in other scenarios the speakers
most definitely benefit from offer but
you can get away without them so my
final thoughts are mixed for me the
yarrow 2 amplifier is certainly the star
of the show a range of features built-in
high quality DAC powerful headphone and
speaker amplifier and the small
footprint makes it an awesome portable
amplifier it seems versatile and
high-quality and I can see the range of
use cases being really appealing to many
people however I can't help but feel a
little underwhelmed by the accompanying
speakers they're by no means bad but
they seem a little lackluster compared
to the arrow 2 amplifier
the poor base and generally average
overall range and clarity of the
speakers doesn't really impress me which
is a shame if you're not a supercritical
listener and you just want to matching
pair of speakers for the outer - that
sound good enough these will certainly
do but for anything more than that you
might want to look elsewhere so that
