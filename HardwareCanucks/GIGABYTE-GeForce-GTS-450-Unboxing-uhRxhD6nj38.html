the g-force GTS 450 now like with most
manufacturers they are overclocking the
cart from 783 megahertz up to 810 now
it's by no means the highest overclock
we've seen but it is still one hundred
and twenty nine dollars so very good in
the price the other thing it has a three
year warranty what you're gonna see is a
lot of these manufacturers are not
giving lifetime warranties with the GTS
450 so actually three years is at the
higher end of the spectrum the other
thing about the gigabyte model is it is
using a copper core on the cooler and
we're going to take a look at the cooler
when we open it up which I don't think
there's anything too special on the box
just all of the standard materials
otherwise this card is actually the
exact same in terms of specs besides the
graphics clock it still has the same
amount of memory one gig 192 CUDA cores
and a hundred and/or 1804 megahertz
memory clock alright accessories we have
the PCI 2 molex adapter VGA to DVI
adapter in this little gem mini HDMI
into regular HDMI which is going to be
one of the outputs we also have the
driver CD and the user manual Nvidia
comm download the latest drivers read
through this that you're not familiar
with the setup I really curious to see
gigabytes renditions of this because
they usually do pretty good with their
aftermarket coolers and hopefully this
won't disappoint it has the blue
gigabyte PCB that you see on a lot of
their products if it the power plug in
the back we have dual DVI on the front
as well as mini HDMI an exhaust point
which looks like you're going to get a
bit of exhaust out there but because the
back isn't covered it's probably going
to blow a little back into the case now
as far as the cooler goes just looking
at the heatsink through the plastic
shroud on top it is fairly similar to
the standard 450 heatsink design but you
have the addition of that copper core
which you can see is going to be right
over top of the GPU chip now the GTS 450
is going to be cool already but the
addition of this copper core should help
to keep things in check it'll be great
for a media center or maybe a system
where you don't have quite as much room
inside
so there we have it make sure you check
out the full review on the GTS 450 video
