episode of the hardware connects product
showcase we have a really great case
today for those price-conscious
enthusiasts or just for somebody looking
to do a build on a budget and zxd is
introducing their new bata classic
series lineup starting off with the beta
chassis now the simple design of the
beta may not jump out and scream
revolutionary it's relatively modest
looking steel mid Tower but it's focused
on value is what sets it apart the beta
can be found at online retailers for 59
or $49 and the beauty is even at that
price it's not just some simple computer
enclosure it has a ton of features so
let's take a look starting off we take
our usual look at the dimensions the
case is 7.9 inches wide stands 16 point
nine inches tall and is nineteen point
seven inches in length and partially due
to its steel construction it weighs only
16 pounds as you'll see on the outside
there is a very nice matte black finish
and there's a vents on the front panel
that sort of add a little bit of simple
Flair there's 120 millimeter fan at the
front and we have LED power and reset
buttons as well as four vented drive
bays quick skip up to the top and we
have the usual layout of audio jacks to
USB as well as the added bonus of an
eSATA connector underneath we have a
rubber feet and sort of keeping with the
simple theme of the beta the front panel
can easily open up in order to clean or
change the included dust filters at the
back we have seven expansion slots open
venting holes for water cooling space
for 120 millimeter fan the i/o area and
a top mounted power supply in fact this
would be the first top mounted power
supply case we've seen in our product
showcase most in the enthusiast chassis
czar moving to a bottom mounted power
supply for convenience but NZXT pulls it
off well opening things up the side is
held in by thumb screws and taking off
the side panel reveals an absolutely
gorgeous black interior a fully black
interior is a rarity even amongst the
high-end cases so this is a real treat
to see it on such a low cost case
unfortunately there is no side window so
it's kind of a hollow victory
quick glance at the accessories which
include the brackets for
screwless strive design as well as the
other basics the beta's supports both
ATX and M ATX form factors with the
added bonus of some great cable
management spaces on the tray the
spacing is positioned so that it will
suit any size of motherboard leaving
room to route wires from behind it
really is quite impressive the amount of
great stuff NZXT is packed into this
case the basic interior layout is better
than some of what you see in cases twice
the price and the exterior really isn't
planned nor all that board it offers
potentially good airflow with the
capability for up to 420 ml fans and one
other case in this price range really
offers any sort of water cooling options
starting off on our installation we put
together the usual components the drive
setup is completely screwless and hard
drives use a simple rail system which
slides in and is surprisingly secure
there are five three and a half inch
bays in the beta as well as four five
and a quarter and the external drive
bays are just as simple slide the drive
in twist on the lock I must say it is
quite impressive that such a value
oriented case offers what the beta does
for cable management you'll notice the
inset drive baits to run connectors out
of you as well as the openings in the
tray from other board connections
there's also a small amount of
separation between the motherboard tray
and the back panel so that large wires
aren't going to be causing problems it
makes for super quick and easy wiring
and encourages great cooling now the
beta has the potential for an effective
airflow design however with just a
single stock fan at the front of the
case
you really shouldn't expect much in the
way of cooling right off the bat the
outside panel has two spots 420
millimeter fans positioned right over
your major components and also an
optional area at the back for another
120 ml exhaust fan adding fans is going
to increase the initial cost and
possibly the noise level but if you're
running some decent heat producing
hardware it is highly recommended now
quickly before we sign off I have to
point out another great asset to the
beta the case was specifically designed
to fit 10 and a half inch video cards it
also has no issues fitting aftermarket
heat sinks like this true 120 there is
roughly 16 centimeters of space between
the motherboard and the
side panel so it should fit a majority
you have large coolers great for those
with beef your hardware now we don't
typically give out awards or blow smoke
but the NZXT beta is one of the best
value cases we've had the pleasure of
filming it has some great features such
as its black interior and quality
construction as well it has really well
laid out cable management and the
screwless drive system is a huge plus on
the flip there's no side window so you
can't really enjoy your handiwork and
the stock cooling leaves a little to be
desired but all in all it's definitely
worth checking out and that's a wrap on
the NZXT beta if you do wish to leave a
