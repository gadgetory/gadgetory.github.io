great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with haruka
Knox and recently we published a
workstation upgrade video that you can
check out in the description or in the
eye where I like the Leon lead PC zero 8
case so much that I decided to put my
own editing system into it and see how
it handles the assembly process the
usual little details that can only be
found when working fully with the case
knowingly enly and how premium their
product is the PC zero 8 is a no
exception with a strong aluminum frame
that feels incredibly light and that's
awesome plus the tempered glass panels
is that final touch to make the build
more of an art piece then an editing
machine priced around $400 though it is
a showpiece with the entire front and
left side totally exposed to reveal
whatever hardware that you put inside
the mounting method for these side
panels could be better toe there are no
rubber dampers on any of the four
mounting points and the tiny lip below
the panel is what's holding it in place
which means you have to be super careful
when putting the panel's back on and
like with any glass handling marks are a
pain and make sure to not touch the
inside of the panel as those
fingerprints are not fun to clean out
size wise it's shorter in height and
length compared to my anthro locks full
tower but is wider due to this dual
chamber design now the front intake is a
bit strange because there's a piece of
glass there so the intake ports are
actually on the right side running down
the panel which actually creates really
cool illuminated pattern if you install
the lighting these three 120 member fans
deliver air only to the rear chamber and
thus your main components receive zero
airflow and that is actually by design
to encourage installation of a radiator
in the rear chamber and we'll talk more
about water cooling later on I'm not
sure why they only left these massive
white stickers on the fans that doesn't
totally benefit the front face of the
case now one of the coolest features on
this enclosure is built-in lighting hub
with rotating knobs to adjust the
you I don't particularly like the
location of these knobs as it's not that
easy to reach back here but once you
find your desired color you can set it
and forget it at the top we find 4 USB 3
ports audio jacks and the power button
surrounded by beautiful brushed aluminum
and the power plus hard drive activity
LEDs are located inside which is fine
but in my opinion the LEDs are a little
bit too large at the top we have dual
120mm fan ports which I highly recommend
you utilize but a cover plate is
available if you don't want to use any
top fans removing the large aluminum
cover grants you access to a dust filter
which is awesome plus the side dust
filter which is very important as your
main chamber will most likely have all
fans set up as exhaust creating negative
air pressure and attracting dust that
will not be fun to clean with all this
glass take a look at the back you can
see the chamber separation with 8 PCI
slots rear 120mm exhaust fan which is
included with a guard mesh and with only
a single spot for mounting so you cannot
move the fan up and down just in case
you have a thick radiator installed at
the top and that isn't fortunate because
in this build where I mount a 120mm rad
at the back and a 240 for the top it
initially did not fit is there's no
clearance the 120 mil rod was only
secured by a single screw on the fan
grill and I think sliding strips would
make more sense for the rear fan and
also the top dual fan bracket is
removable for the fans or the radiator
mounting outside of the case but it is
held in with seven tiny screws which
made mounting the bracket back in place
really inconvenient
for the main chamber hardware
installation is straightforward and
here's the end result after spending
some time trying to find room for that
rear radiator for the GPU but in terms
of cable management PC zero eight is
equipped well to pass cables from the
rear chamber into the main one with
appropriately placed rubber grommets to
clean everything up inside for the rear
chamber this is where all the drives the
power supply and cable mass will be
power supply is mounted on the side
which one removed reveals the lighting
hub which you have to pre route and
connect all the cables before mounting
the power supply as being on the other
side of the power supply well it's not
accessible at all it should have been
relocated to a more open spot that would
not require power supply removal if you
need to get access to those connections
the hard drive cage here has two more
120mm fans totaling the rear chamber
cooling to five fans and none for the
main chamber the drive cage supports
only two SSDs mounted on top and the
bottom of the cage and up to six three
and a half inch drives we have two
screws on each side if only we had a
tools mechanism as replacing any of
these drives means taking out the entire
cage disconnecting everything which I
actually had to do when filming this
build log and it's just such a time
waste I would prefer individual drive
caddies for cable management in this
chamber it's really up to you if you
want to clean everything up I'd suggest
you do so because it's difficult to tell
what is what and what is running where
especially if you'll be using the space
for a custom loop so it has to stay
organized for lighting inside I've
mounted two adhesive LED strips that are
included and the total four strips are
included on each front column that
illuminates the fans a little bit and
also the main hardware and I think this
is one of the most beautiful cases that
I've worked with especially when those
side glass panels are on to create this
really stunning looking effect now if
you want to do a custom loop one of the
top cutouts is open meaning you can pass
tubing through the main chamber to the
back and I've gone ahead and rerouted my
two
40min radiator to the rear chamber
installed it in the bottom two slots
because to my surprise because of all
the i/o cables i couldn't fit the
radiator to the top fan mount so this
means if you are serious about creating
a custom water cooling system inside the
PC 0-8 it will be challenging unless you
mod or make more cutouts where needed
this does clear out the top fan slots
perhaps for intake and would make cable
routing easier but I wasn't expecting
all the little hiccups along the way a
case that looks this good and costs this
much should not cost frustration
especially when assembling a very common
system with an all-in-one cooler so the
Leone PC 0-8 is a pretty sight probably
the best looking enclosure for this year
but there are definitely questionable
design choices regarding cooling the
lack of user friendly water cooling and
drive installation and I would love to
see valiantly to implement flexible
mounting rails for all fans so users can
adjust the exact position of each fan
based on all on the factors in
particular for that rear fan and if top
radiator is installed but the end result
is absolutely gorgeous and the best part
about this case is it has so much
potential in the right hands this can be
made to be the perfect showcase water
cooling system without a doubt so guys
this concludes this review of the leonie
PC zero 8 let us know what you change
with this cube case and make sure to
check out our workstation upgrade video
