the host for the high recognized YouTube
channel and today will not be reviewing
anything hardly related and that is
because we'll be taking a look at a
recently released software from a cyber
link this is their latest version of UK
M which is a web-based software webcam
based software allows you to play with
different visual effects different video
enhancements and some tools that could
be utilized in a business or an office
setting so let's first take a look at
the software lay out some of the
features that are available and the
overall user experience that I've gotten
from it so let's dive right into it so
the layout of the software is very basic
we have our effects panel on the right
you can this attach it you can close it
you can minimize it you can expand it as
you can see right here this is our very
standard layout we see the preview
window here with a camera lay the
timeline of all the images on all the
videos that you've captured in the past
two buttons for photo and video capture
and we have some settings and video
enhancements so the highlight of this
program would be these effects here we
have multiple categories first let's
start with the scenery so basically
positioning yourself into multiple of
scenes as you can see here
happy birthday girl
lovebirds okay so next time we have the
frames different visual effects again
happy birthday multiple ones and you can
see they are fairly cool a lot of
variety and the end do provide you with
a lot of default ones next we have our
particles so you can set yourself a
number of number of different effects
you can do now the particles are quite
cool as you see they fall down and they
text some kind of a texture in the video
and so you can get rid of diamonds by
just brushing them off like that quite
fun you can download flower petals which
is also cool next we have masks and they
as you can see it it takes your face and
it puts masks on one thing to note is
that it doesn't scale down the mask
really well if you move on an angle for
example as you see here but if you
aren't from the camera just head on
straight and you move your head it's
fairly it's really good in terms of face
tracking sometimes the face mask would
be enlarged so to get rid of that you
just press on it you just restart the
effect and it will go back to normal and
as you can see we have multiple effects
here all right so let's go next into
avatars here you see the Avatar is well
it basically records where your face
tracking moment is your eyebrows your
lips and your face movement you can
create your own avatar which is also
cool
and quite a realistic dog here next we
have emotions BAM
and one of the last ones which is
probably I think would be the most fun
feature would be the liquify effect oh
yeah wow this is cool
obviously the as you can see this would
be a lot of fun for kids Oh mirror
effect don't you just love this one
whoa this is very strange so as you can
see it liquefies the image and do all
these fun features and you can actually
move the thing on the on the screen and
that would liquefy a different areas
I really like this one and so they as
you can see it works flawlessly it works
really well we can and there's also the
last one I want to mention is the oven
three allottee which basically if you
have the CL you can print it off by by
yourself or if you get the retail
version they will include this with the
package but basically it registers where
this plane is the square and the CL and
you can put a different graphic on it
and it acts it's actually not not so bad
it's like in just a tiny bit we have
cake flowers you have a spaceship and
the spaceship as you can see it has
different frames inside of it and so you
can put different pictures on it so you
can personalize it and that is it for
the visual effects so let's first let's
go into the drawing effect which
basically gives us that pops up this
different brush sizes and different
colors and you can draw on the screen we
have also stamps you can erase to
everything and you can also pop in you
can put antique drawing board choose the
different color for drawing board and
you can draw on the board with you kids
or whatever so let's raise everything
next one is the presentations tab you
can create the presentation you can
import your own presentation in here and
this is will be very useful for business
meetings for example and you can see I
imported it for a PowerPoint
presentation insight you can cycle
through slides
you can also capture your desktop
however capturing desktop is only
available at twenty twelve eighty by
nine sixty resolution and the avi file
is gets extremely large and the quality
isn't that great and we also have a dual
video option which means that you can
connect two video webcams and have a
split screen one showcasing one camera
one choking to see the other
all right so taking a look at some of
the utilities that are available we have
face login which capture in which you
capture an image of your face you can
either log into Windows or into multiple
web sites which are the more some of the
streamlined websites like Google Amazon
and Facebook and you can set the
accuracy setting and this is very useful
for very quick logins and you can
capture more people and that will detect
them just as well okay some more until
ease we have faced out this is when the
camera does not detect your face in
front of the screen it will either do
the following three things it will lock
the screen sleep or hibernate and this
is a very useful thing for the office
for example if you're going out for a
lunch break and you can set the timer
for up from five seconds all the way up
to sixty minutes
surveillance is one the cool features
are available as well we have we can do
motion recording where it will detect
motion on the screen and will start
recording right away you have continuous
recording just set the timer when it
will end and you begin
and time lapse which just basically
takes a snapshot every amount of time
that you specify
and you can see auto email these images
or these movies to you and it records a
WMV file so they are quite small even
after hours of recording so there would
be no problem okay so another highlight
of this program would be downloadable
effects there just just under two
hundred thousand effects available to
download from direct directors own and
they are free when you sign up so that's
great you can browse through them and
choose whatever you want choose
whichever you like
and one more features that available
would be the video enhancements and all
the lighting is actually not bad it
boosts up anything that's underexposed
and leaves out all the exposed areas
quite lit Barry well you have truthy
written
theater enhancements
which you can sharpen the video and
brings out a lot of detail in the shot
and you can reduce the noise and that is
good for webcam especially because in
low-light conditions it has to boost up
its sensitivity to light and therefore
creating grainy images and noise
reduction will smooth out that grain and
it's very very useful for a dark and
dark situations we have also brightness
contrast and exposure also available to
control everything with manual folk with
manual settings and we have camera
control you can do a manual focus you
can do zooming in panning and tilting so
it's very useful now when going to the
settings tab this is I want something
that I need to mention because you can
only record with all the effects at 640
by 480 resolution or lower so if you're
going to a resolution higher than that
you will not be able to use any of the
effects that are available in the
software and that is quite ok because if
you do use the effects you'll probably
be webcaming with some friends and it
was for software like Skype or anything
that supports webcaming and 640 by 480
resolution will be adequate enough to
see you exactly what is going on with
the effects and it's where you choose
your capture device and your audio
device and we have some more settings of
choosing the capture format your capture
folder
how many burst shots you'd like to take
when you press the photo button and the
last one would be the user interface
settings where you choose a skin color
your language and some more options so
to summarize this you can 5 software is
actually really cool is a lot of fun it
has great face tracking when you're
using different masks it will track down
your eyes and your mouth and you know
it's very well it has some sometimes it
the effect would not work at loot it
would lose face tracking but restarting
the effect usually resolves the problem
we have tons of free effects that are
available to download from the website
and that is a really good feature
because you can download many more the
ones that you want and obviously this is
a lot of fun for kids and for any web
cam chatting and some of the business
utilities that are included with the
software are really useful and they were
flawlessly I did enjoy using them and
someday it has great video enhancement
options like all the auto lighting and
some truth it enhance Minh and really
brings out the best in the image quality
and some of the more cool features like
face login face logout surveillance and
mirrors is that it was actually a good
addition to the program and I did enjoy
using the surveillance while I was at
work I had a lot of fun with this
program I would definitely recommend it
probably the only disadvantage to this
program would be the effects usage only
at 640 by 480 resolution or lower would
have been nice to see these effects be
included also at high resolutions just
for the fun of it now the main
difference between standard and the
deluxe edition is not major the standard
edition misses out on some of the
features like augmented reality you
cannot download any avatar face features
and true theater enhancement is not
available on the standard edition
furthermore creative video presentations
this is where you import the PowerPoint
presentation is not available on the
standard along with dual video input
support and face out is also not
available in the standard edition but
everything else is just like on the
deluxe edition in terms of supporting
all the effects and the rest of the
features and that is it for this episode
