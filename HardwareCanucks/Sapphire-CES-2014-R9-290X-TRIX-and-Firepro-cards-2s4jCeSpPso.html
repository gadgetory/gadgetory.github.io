is brought to you by NCIX technology
connected so we're here with South fire
in the beautiful Radha hotel and resort
and they wanted us to take a look at one
very very beautiful and specific GPU
today they're showing off a custom
cooler for the 290x the r9 290x now this
is the XXX cooler that has some pretty
innovative and awesome features and
they're right underneath here so this
cooler is absolutely beautiful it
features triple 92 militant they say hey
there's only three that's because
they're running well basically
horizontally through the card rather
than vertically which actually has a
pretty cool application to it now the
old style of heat sink used to have
copper heatpipes that would basically
protrude underneath the fans so they
wouldn't actually receive any air flow
or any air pressure so they wouldn't
actually touch it so it's kind of wasted
dispensation but with this specific type
of design all the heat pipes are hit by
the fans so you're going to get better
dispensation now one of the really cool
things if you can see it right here is
the center pipe is 10 mil that's the
first I just want to do as a sink that
ends it's absolutely massive it's a huge
heat pipe as well one thing to mention
is that the 10 millimeter heat pipe is
forty percent more efficient at
dispensation heat than the eight
millimeter heat pipes which is a huge
jump in performance now this is a
reference PCV however we have heard that
there is a possibility that other ones
will be in development but we can't
really speak of exactly which model
under which branding but what we can
tell you is that this Triple X cooler is
absolutely beautiful now one of the cool
features about this specific sapphire
card is that it does still feature the
dual BIOS but it doesn't actually switch
between uber mode and silent mode it
actually switches between a UEFI bios
setting and a legacy setting so you're
going to be able to get into the bios
with whichever setting it you need to
use for your specific
system so wrapping up about this card is
that it is full of innovation even
though it's got just a reference PCB it
does have a lot of possibilities for
integrating custom PCB options and
further improving what we think is going
to be fantastic performance in
conclusion there are five heat pipes in
this specific card now one of the
drawbacks to the original reference
design was well the blower fan it didn't
really do a great job of dissipating the
heat but one of the things that this
specific cooler does is that it keeps
the card twenty percent cooler which
means you're going to get more stable
clogs you're not going to have it
throttling now it does this because it
keeps the card on average unload at
around 70 degrees which is relatively
impressive if you consider the fact that
it is just a slight factory overclock
another piece of news actually has to do
with firepro so this card right here
basically is a representation of what's
a fire has been able to do and that has
become the worldwide distributor for
channel so in other words basically
anything that you see in store that you
see that has a or any card that you can
buy with fire pro that is a fire pro
card is going to be distributed by
sapphire which is another big piece of
news so guys this has been our sapphire
sweet tour because well we're in a
beautiful vrata suite here at CES 2014 I
like it'll like the video if you liked
it don't dislike it because what you can
dislike it if you want but it doesn't
really matter it's you're engaging with
us and that's all really really care
about so make sure you subscribe like
the video and keep on falling back for
more hard-hitting CES 2014 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
