you'd like us to review next from any of
the items they dropped recently enjoy
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with
hurricane axe and welcome to another
review so if you're not familiar with
the brand feel they specialize and
they've actually established a strong
reputation among dax and amps that are
portable so you can carry with them
along with things that you actually put
on your desktop but the Pheo e18 Kunlun
is a very unique device that note
everybody needs because it's got a
certain weird functionalities built into
it but if you're not totally satisfied
with the audio out of your smartphone or
adapt this is where the e18 comes in so
this thing acts both as an amp and a DAC
depending on how to use it and we'll
talk over audio quality later but it
basically a middleman between accepting
either an analog or a digital signal
from your smartphone or adapt into the e
18 and passing that through the
headphones the e 18 Kunlun is not a
cheap device it ranges from 150 to 200
dollars and you really have to question
whether or not you value such an
investment in your portable audio
equipment in order to justify such an
investment into your audio and before we
get into the functionality of the Kunlun
let's do a quick physical tour shall we
now it's quite chunky it's much thicker
and wider and longer than my iPhone 5s
that I carry so this is not a super
low-profile device in fact will be very
difficult and uncomfortable having the
entire system in your pants pocket for
example as the basic mounting premise
requires your smartphone to be held in
with these rubber bands the exterior
show is made of attractive anodized
aluminum and trust me this thing has
traveled with me with pretty much no
signs of wear although it does come with
a carry pouch to protect it so I use
that whenever you can but regardless
the frame is solid and resonates only
quality-built the chrome outline and the
slightly indented top portion strikes a
good balance between style and also
allowing you to recognize which side is
up or down therefore making it easier to
use the device and this is where you'll
find the volume dial that also turns on
the amp and DAC with the front red LED
indicating power and the rest three LEDs
for battery life the knob has a good
amount of resistance on it so you don't
accidentally turn up the volume just by
sliding your finger on it and this is a
good thing for sensitive headphones the
number on the dial corresponds to the
sensitivity or the volume level of the
amp and I found that the using those
numbers is very good if you use and you
switch different headphones for example
with my in-ear monitors the shure se215
I always set it to four so it doesn't
blast out my ears and I lose half my
earring but when I switch to something
that requires a little bit more power to
drive them like the dt9 90s I always set
it to eight and I know it will be
perfect volume every time here you'll
also find game toggle for low and high
the high switch adds over plus 6 DB to
the signal allowing you to really blast
the volume without introducing any hiss
and in fact that the L toggle when there
is nothing playing but things are
plugged in turning the volume all the
way to maximum does not introduce any
noise whatsoever
that means the amp is doing a good job
and amplifying the signal without
introducing any noise however you do
hear a little bit interference in the
high toggle when nothing is playing but
obviously that's going to not going to
be audible when you're actually passing
some type of audio through it there's
also a base toggle that deuced the lower
frequencies and I only switched it on
for open style headphones that really
emphasize the body of the bass and it
made it a little bit more enjoyable
however for closed headphones it was a
little bit too bumi my shure se215 s and
the son Heiser the HD a DJ's did not
favor the bass boost it was very very
Bumi I do not appreciate that type of
sound and that's sort of the premise of
this e 18 it is a very basic amplifier
and the bass when not
is deep and rich but lower but boosting
that base does introduce a little bit of
Bhoomi into the lower frequencies but
you know it could be what you're looking
for exactly but I do prefer a more flat
balanced sound so I left the base off
pretty much all the time unless I was
using open headphones on top of that is
your three-and-a-half millimeter input
for the amp and the headphone jack and
you would use this to input the analog
signal from your smartphone and output
that through the plug with headphones
the three side buttons are extremely
sturdy with excellent clicky
registration to be used when plugged in
via a microUSB and the buttons are
arranged as back forward and play/pause
so you'd assume that the play/pause
functionality would remain in the center
but it's not so just keep that in mind
and so looking at the bottom this is
where the e 18 gets a little bit
complicated
first there's the s/pdif output that can
be used with an included cable to pass
the audio to your home theater speaker
system for example then we have two
micro USB ports the one on the right is
strictly to charge the e 18 with a
flashing indicator for the battery
status the middle microUSB port however
has multiple functionalities first you
can use the device to charge your smart
phone or adapt via a microUSB by
switching a toggle all the way to charge
out it has a thirty-five hundred million
power battery pack inside so battery
life on the e 18 is very good a couple
of days no problem listening however you
can also use that battery pack to charge
your device your smart phone but only
those smart phones that have the micro
USB connection so you can't charge your
iPhone with this thing because you can
only the only cable that is provided is
micro USB to micro USB and moving on the
middle option is phone in using the
included micro USB to micro USB cable to
connect two compatible smartphones that
support OTG or digital audio output with
this option you are utilizing the DAC as
well inside the e 18 to transfer a
digital audio signal from your source
device into the e 18 and output that
through the headphones and only when in
this USB mode you can use the side media
buttons
the list of compatible devices is still
very short my Nexus 4 does not support
OTG unless it is rooted and therefore I
was not able to test out this feature so
the last option is PC in allowing you to
connect this to a Mac or a PC there are
no drivers needed and utilize the USB
DAC and the headphone amp for your
computer now as for sound quality I used
my iPhone 5s via an analog cable and I
used multiple of headphones to hear the
difference and the most evident audio
element that really stood out is the
opening of the soundstage listening
through the shure se215 s that are
really isolating and closed off give me
a massive sense of environment this is a
huge positive that I think improves
listening but for open headphones that
already expand the soundstage it is not
as beneficial I would say the major
benefit you get with the e 18 is the
flexibility our devices that can be used
with a 18 both IEMs open headphones
closed headphones high period headphones
something that has a lot of resistance
on the electrical input and you can
still drive them all with this thing
because you have the dial and you have
the high gain to really boost up the
signal for high impedance headphones
also it opens up the soundstage I really
love the feeling of putting on on my IMS
and really feeling like you're in a very
large environment something that is not
possible being replicated by the iPhone
5s
even with equalizer settings that you
can play around with on the iPhone
the bass is improved it's not it's just
slightly more bassy it is punchy so you
kind of have to like that type of bass
the mid-range of vocals especially for
male vocals is much improved there's a
lot of detail separation there's a good
clarity and the high end is smoothed out
it's not a sharp as with the iPhone 5s
for example and all that ties in into I
would say an acceptable and very
enjoyable listening experience with the
e 18 versus just your standard Android
or an iPhone device of course you have
to take into the price into account and
whether or not you are able to
you know make sure that you have enough
space for such a contraption with these
two devices sort of clunk together and
the uncomfortable nature of them using
your iPhone or your Android device when
they are just strapped together kind of
accessing buttons and stuff I found my
way to work pretty good and I don't find
that as a big one wins anymore just
because I figured out the optimal way
for me to plug everything in and to
combine everything so that I can
actually still use my phone while using
the EEA team adjusting the volume and
etc so guys this is a concludes
basically our review of the e 18 Coonan

not you are willing to make a purchase
