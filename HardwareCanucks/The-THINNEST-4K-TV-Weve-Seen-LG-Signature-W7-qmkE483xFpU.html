who knew they had an HQ in Toronto to
check out their signature OLED TV super
excited but you know can go with this
hair yes this is that let's go guys say
hello to the LG 65 w7 signature OLED TV
boy it's a mouthful and while that
sounds metaphorical there is a little
meaning behind that after Demetri and I
got a chance to experience it for a
while and with a price tag of $8,000 you
are paying for the ultimate content
consuming experience blow on it right
after this
it's time to show off your elites I
wouldn't HP for starters let's take a
quick science lesson regarding this
technology because OLED is essentially
an LED layer that emits a light in
response to an electric current without
the need of a backlight this results in
a much thinner and lighter panel
compared to an LCD TV but most
importantly OLED can achieve deeper
blacks and richer colors than the
slightly washed out images found on
plasmas or LCD TVs taking a look at raw
specs this is a 65 inch TV with a
resolution of 3840 by 2160 so 4k would
support for all major formats of HDR
including Dolby vision HDR 10 and hybrid
log gamma there's also a 77 inch variant
of the w7 that's coming to the market
soon but the price is yet to be revealed
my guess it's probably going to be a lot
more expensive than my car now 99% of
consumers might find the w7 to be part
of their league's and if I were to be
really honest with you guys I have much
better things to spend eight thousand
dollars for but I just took a moment to
admire this beautiful creation by LG it
is a remarkable combination of precise
engineering and craftsmanship you're not
paying eight thousand dollars for an
aggressive design that shines with
glitter all the time to make it stand
out from your living room but you're
paying for that seamless blend between
simplicity and perfection the w7 can fit
in within any environment whether that's
your living room office lounge heck even
your basement home theater setup
mounting this TV is just as simple as
securing the panel to its back blade
that features secure points which then
magnetically aligns the corners of the
TV the most important part about the w7
was its thin profile I mean this is the
dream TV that everyone was looking
forward to a few years ago and as you
can see this is meant to be wall-mounted
and it looks like it's floating in space
at least for me and that's exactly what
LG was aiming for being able to
seamlessly integrate a television that
looks simple yet stands out from the
competition LG also showcased a few
other features that adds an extra layer
of immersion that looks pretty awesome
in my eyes one of them is this window
mode that simulates a window and there's
also a picture mode that cycles through
different landscapes but what's also
interesting is
displays a frame camouflage that looked
pretty amazing
now all these pixels have to be powered
by something in fact when you look at
the w7 from this angle you won't notice
any cables from the TV well both power
and data are transmitted through the
single proprietary cable that's
connected directly to this home base
station where it offers multiple inputs
plus it also acts as a premium sound bar
when you turn it on the upward facing
drivers rise up gently from their
respective hideouts which I thought was
a cool presentation it's a four point
two channel speaker system with a total
output of 60 watts and it comes with all
the bells and whistles like support for
Dolby Atmos DTS decoder surround mode
and the list just goes on in terms of
i/o the unit comes with four HDMI ports
that are hdcp 2.2 compliant and a few
other connectors that you see here so
what was it like watching content on the
w7 it was he one-of-a-kind experience
coming from my seven-year-old samsung
LCD TV that I have at my home talk about
immersion and this thing draws you into
that the first thing I noticed right
away where how deep the blacks were and
in contrast the colors were so rich take
a look at the shot for instance we had
the lights turned off for a while and
got a chance to watch a few samples
provided by LG and what's fascinating
about this was the fact that there was
nothing standing between me and the
content this includes the super thin
bezels of the screen to the lack of any
backlit bleed I was trying to pick my
jaws off the floor after experiencing
the w7 it's that good actually let me
rephrase that
it was captivating and it's hard to move
away from that HDR is the hot topic for
this year and companies are starting to
implement support for this technology
behind every flagship panel the w7 cover
is a wider spectrum for content that
supports Doby vision HDR 10 and HL G
that's more broadcast friendly of course
content availability is pretty limited
at the moment but this is a cool feature
to have for the long run the processor
inside the w7 can apply an HDR effect on
top of standard content and from what we
saw it boosted the shadows slightly
while reducing the highlights also the
built-in OLED master engine upscales
native 1080p content to 4k we even got a
chance to play horizon zero dawn which
was
completely ridiculous on an $8,000 TV
but it was a good presentation of native
HDR game support there is a game mode
built into the w7 that reduces the input
lag slightly but from a technical
perspective I really can give you my
honest opinion about it since I only got
to spend a few hours with the TV webOS
3.0 has made its way into the w7 it's
LG's custom operating system that's
designed to run on smart TVs and this
version adds support for 360-degree
videos and photos the app store is quite
limited compared to Android TV but LG
does include the majority of most use
apps like Netflix YouTube Amazon Prime
and a few more so there you have it the
LG 65 w7 signature OLED TV Demetria and
I had a great time playing around with
this beauty and I want to emphasize
something important here this was all
about our experience trying out the w7
and we're not recommending you to go out
there and spend $8,000 on this TV but
rather we wanted to give you a little
glimpse into what could possibly be the
ultimate content consuming experience
and I want to hear your thoughts about
the w7 was this the dream TV that you've
been looking forward to five or six
years ago and where are you surprised
when I revealed its price tag let us
know in the comments down below I'm here
with how it connects thank you so much
for watching and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
