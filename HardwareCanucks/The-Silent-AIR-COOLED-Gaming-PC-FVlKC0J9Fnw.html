recently I did a silent system and the
Cylon base 801 enjoyable experience I
had six fans in there the total DBA at
load was under 35 which was amazing but
today we're gonna try to do something
different and so in that system I used
all be quiet components to silent look
360 with silent wings three fans and
silent way straight friends for the
cases well overall very happy with
temperatures and noise levels and the
pump here is practically inaudible but
people recommending hey if you want to
go with silence why not try knock to us
and since I have this nice collection of
coolers over here including the nhd 15
which is this massive Tower
lots of cooling capacity for the 9900 K
and the new NF 812 fans that I'll be
replacing inside the case so I'm really
decided to see how quiet we can get the
system to run all on there
gotta get those accessories
well looks like all the components are
here let's start the build right after
this so you're saying this is the most
colorful way to cool I'm telling you the
master liquid ml 360 our RGB is the way
to go
cooler masters new three sixty
millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler is
all about performance in style with a
custom low resistance radiator and dual
chamber pump wood sleeve tubing for that
premium look while being totally
flexible the fan strike your balance for
air pressure and airflow with
transparent blades to perfectly match
the colorful combination of the pump
then you can sync via its own controller
or through various addressable and
12-volt RGB connectors alright perhaps
you should check it out in the scription
below alright so the interesting thing
about these two enclosures is the sound
base 601 and 801 are basically an
identical frame like I could literally
just swap out this glass panel for here
and it would fit perfectly fine but the
801 is slightly larger at the bottom
because of the included case feet so you
can take them off and I actually forgot
about this in my review you can pick it
up by the bottom versus the keys feed on
the 601 are kind of built into the frame
we still have the push button to release
the side panel I love this approach it's
to us and like I said I could simply put
this panel on the 801 and it would fit
and the other difference would be as the
price so the 601 is $30 cheaper so this
guy sells for $130 versus 160 for the
window version of the 801 now the
internal is very similar both support ei
TX motherboards the 601 as you can see
slightly smaller because the ADA 1
allows you to invert the motherboard
tray so there's a bit more height
clearance over here we also have an
additional intake fan on the 801 versus
having only a single one for the 61 and
a single exhaust the power supply child
is also different so this one is fully
metal with only the front modular pieces
that you can move here through mount a
fan or here to insert that your radiator
verses on the 801 so we have four
modular pieces the front and this
plastic piece so it is slightly
different and I do prefer like the fully
built-in power supply child on the 601
things of the back also look pretty
similar but the 801 has a fan control
for six fans whereas the 601 does not
and finally the i/o is pretty much
identical with two USB 3 power reset
buttons audio jacks a single USB port
and a little fan control over here but
it is controlling the included fans and
you cannot add to it it is powered by
SATA and we have no pwm fan control and
as for noise reduction we have this
really thick 10 millimeter noise
absorbing form on the rear panel and on
the front panel everything is dust proof
protected so a nice giant dust filter
for your front fans and removing the
bottom dust filter from the front nice
and convenient there's also the noise
absorbing material for the top that is
kept clear of your ventilation space at
the back as for a fan and radiator
mounts you can do a 360 or 280 up top
and the same thing goes for the front so
pretty good water cooling and airflow
options alright so now that we are
familiar what this case is all about the
61 is basically an 801 with a slightly
shorter power supply shroud and less
height above the motherboard for all
your radiator stuff I think it's time to
do our side
all right so I think that would be a
first for me you know having that
classical relaxing music for a building
matazo computer but that represents my
mood perfectly with the silent bass 6:01
say what you will about the brown nacht
offense but once they're all together in
the system and it's not just like one
cooler it's all the fans in the system
it makes total sense and they kind of
like bring it all together I didn't have
to replace the front fan on the CPU
cooler because the RAM modules are
slightly too high for it and yeah you
got five fans in there let's make sure
that this thing is running silent as for
cable management as you can see
everything is perfectly clean I'm not
running multiple drive so I just stashed
away my SSD right in here I secured my
24 pin and the PCI cables right behind
here also connected the eight pin so
yeah everything is clean the side panel
closes without any force and we've
plenty of space over there for more
going to need to close the mister window
because of that lovely construction
noise outdoors I'm probably gonna have
to wait for after they're finished to do
my DBA measurements but for now let's
actually go ahead and set this thing up
and configure all the fan profiles so
they're just whisper quiet but also give
me the enough cooling because of that
hot hot hot 9900 kay a few moments later
oh all right so after some tweaking I'm
happy with everything that I've
configured here all my fans are running
about 1200 rpm and they're incredibly
quiet I'm a press talk to a well done
except for the middle large fan that's
running around a thousand rpm because
that one gets slightly louder if you
push the rpm higher now mic target DBA
for anything silent for my own sort of
preference would be under 35 DBA at load
and so this system right now is running
about 34 DBA at load this is with the
GPU at 44 percent and the CPU running at
4.7 gigahertz so very happy with the
result it is slightly just a tiny bit
louder than my sound bass 801 system and
I think that is because all the noise in
this system is coming from
back so all that exhaust air and if I
reduce the RPM of the rear fan the
system is basically completely silent
but then we kind of lose on cooling
because that is the only way to exhaust
air versus on my sound based 801 machine
I had three fans exhausting hair and I
think the noise was there a little bit
more distributed versus here where it's
all kind of concentrated in that rear
section as for temperatures the CPU ran
at 80 degrees Celsius this is the 9900 K
at 4.7 gigahertz so it's bit hot I could
tweak around with the voltages to reduce
that temperature there the GPU was
running at 76 degrees Celsius without
44% fan speed so the system is
practically inaudible but it is slightly
hot inside of course I can increase the
speed of the front fans and that
definitely pushes a lot of that air out
it helps with intake as well but
interestingly when I removed that front
panel so when I remove this front panel
you can hear a lot more noise is being
escaped from the front but we dropped
our CPU temperature by 10 degrees so it
looks like there's always that balance
of trying to make a machine silent while
also perform good with airflow and you
know 10 degree drop with a simple panel
removal yeah I guess that is our
direction when it comes to silent cases
now for all of you who are saying hey
that brown color scheme on the fans is
absolutely ugly and I was one of those
people as well but knocked what makes
black fans and when they're all together
they can't make sense and they look
pretty good but if you're brave enough
to maneuver yourself into the RGB
direction definitely check out color
orange that I think complements the
brown very well I'm not going overly
crazy but here's an example with the
leonie streamer cable something that is
becoming a lot more popular with those
individually colored 24 and 8 pin cables
so that's something to keep in mind
alright so that concludes my second
adventure into the silent territory I'm
happy with the sound base 601 of course
cooling is a big compromise especially
when you remove that front panel north
even the best filter leave the dust
filter in but that front panel is a
major hindrance for air flow so you got
to balance out certain things when it
comes to
making sure that your system stays
silent all right guys I'm Dimitri hope
you enjoy this content
there's more right over here our new
boot sequence channel is over here to
snow is here the main and we'll see you
in next video I guess I will conclude
like last time as always stay quiet my
friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
