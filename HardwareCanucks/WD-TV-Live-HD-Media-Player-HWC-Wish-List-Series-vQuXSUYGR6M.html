Canucks wish list segment I know I
promised this a few days ago however
here we have the Western Digital TV live
media player now what this does is
basically replaces the entire
functionality of your HT PC or media PC
into one very tiny little set-top box
the great thing about it is that it will
do Full HD 1080p now if you think about
it in order to be able to play you know
blu-ray quality video on your media PC
you need at least a mainstream low-end a
dual-core processor or a motherboard
with integrated graphics and some RAM
and I guarantee you that is going to run
you much more than the hundred thirty to
$150 price tag that this little thing
carries with it sold tight we're going
to unbox it we're going to take a look
at the GUI interface and we're going to
make sure that this thing can in fact
play the 1080p video all right so we're
gonna take a quick look at the box and
read off some of the specs because
there's so many of them I don't know
them off the top of my head first thing
this is the live version of the media
player there's actually a non live
version what that signifies is that it
is network capable so it can connect
your home network and get files off of
there now in terms of file support it
has your typical avi MPEG formats as
well as MKV things like mp4 and MOV
formats you also have photo support JPEG
PNG etc audio files that supports things
like mp3 your WMA but it also has
support for things like slack and OGG as
well as your Dolby Digital and your DTS
support now the other cool thing about
this is they partnered or asume
partnered with live 365.com
and Pandora which are both internet
radio sites so you can stream your
internet and radio straight from this
into your home theater system other
things we've already been to the 1080p
the other thing it will do is it will
stream directly from YouTube so if you
have one of these you could be watching
this video straight from it alright so
we're going to open it up to a very
quick unboxing here you have your
typical manuals driver CDs etc now this
was what really impressed me you know
when I first looked at the box I figured
okay you know it's a fairly large unit I
open it up and this thing is incredibly
tiny you know it's about well devote
passport-size
in fact you look here we have a 3.5 inch
a typical hard drive and you look at the
size difference in terms
thickness it is a little thicker but
just the physical size of the unit it's
very small it's going to be very easy to
hide behind your TV or right next to it
it's a sort of a classy looking device
you also have your remote basic
functions which is also very tiny then
you have your audio/video cables now
they don't include an HDMI cable you're
going to need to purchase that
separately you have the AC adapter and
then well you have some complimentary
batteries excellent so let's dive in and
we'll take a look at the actual unit
itself alright so on the back you have
your power input the rear USB HDMI
connection your s/pdif optical connector
rj45 network connection and then your
your composite in your component outputs
and then you have a second USB on the
side here as well as I believe it's a
reset switch and you'll also notice some
venting and around here I assume I don't
know the hardware specs but it would
probably get a little toasty when you're
playing that that 1080p video on the
front you have your power and your USB
indicator lights alright so we plugged
it in hooked it up through HDMI and then
put the power in as you can see it is
very very simple just to if you have a
receiver you can hook it up through
there so you don't have to have audio
cables running out well it was supposed
to boot up that was the intention
however it's looking oh there we go -
excellent now what you'll notice is that
the GUI interface on this unit is
actually very slick it's well designed
it's a little it's a little dark except
for the center and it's very very smooth
in terms of how it operates I put some
batteries in the remote and we are going
to take you have some very basic
settings here there you do notice the
occasion a little bit of lag however
that may just be the batteries in my
remote dying you can have the you have
your basic adjustments to video settings
including subtitles it has a whole bunch
of support for other subtitles we have
your basic photo settings you know I'm
not going to go through all of these
however they are just very simple
settings that you would expect to have
on nearly any sort of media style of
device network settings system settings
let's pop into
system settings okay so you can change
that screensaver autoplay there's really
not too much exciting in here but it
just sort of shows you that they've
thought of everything you're not going
to be without any features so let's play
a video now what you have to do in order
to hook up or in sorry in order to get
your media you will either have to have
an external hard drive plugged in you
can plug it directly into the USB or you
can hook this unit up to your network
and you can host your files elsewhere
you know if it's on a home server on
another computer etc and you can access
it directly from there or you can do
what I'm doing and use a USB key and
plug it straight into the side now
you'll be able to use the USB key and an
external drive at the same time because
there are a couple of USB ports and you
go to your section here for that's the
other thing you'll be able to browse
YouTube straight from here let's go to
there scroll down as you know see a
little bit of lag on occasion but it's
really not too bad I don't notice it at
all
USB - this is where it'll show your your
other files folders etc and let's take a
look this is a 1080p video provided by
Microsoft is sort of a sample file
beautiful colors there's no lag I'm
looking now no lag whatsoever in the
video
zooms board perfectly you have some
really really high high color situations
here it displays well displays perfectly
I'm quite impressed now if you stop your
DVD you also be able to restart where
you left off so just boom there we are
playback original fast-forward it goes
out you have two times four times eight
times I assume up to 16 times there we
are there and you can play again
excellent and plays flawlessly when you
start it off again little flying scene
here lots of colors lots of things going
on and flawless flawless video
so that is our look at Western Digital
TV live there are a few other options
out there ever that I should mention
there's also the ASA so play and the
Patriot Patriot box office I believe
it's called hopefully I will I may have
a chance to take a look at them but
they're all going to offer the same sort
of functionality that the Western
Digital TV Live will and also don't
forget to send in your suggestions for
future wishlist episodes we want to see
and review what you guys want to see
before Christmas so send them in leave
them in a comment in the YouTube section
and we're going to try and get through
as many of the popular ones as we can
and don't forget to subscribe guys so
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
