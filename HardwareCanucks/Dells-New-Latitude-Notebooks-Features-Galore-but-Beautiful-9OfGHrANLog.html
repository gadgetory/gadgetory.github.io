possible by our partner nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to corsair
phanteks and NCIX without them we
wouldn't be here so Dale had some
interesting announcements at CES last
week they introduced the latitude 13
7000 series which is targeted towards
business enthusiasts who like to have a
portable well-rounded ultrabook from a
physical standpoint the latitude 7000
looks exactly like the XPS 13 laptop
with just the same carbon fiber lid and
the strong magnesium chassis which feels
solid and durable plus it's an amazing
surface to hide handling marks it only
weighs about a kilogram which is perfect
for those who travel around a lot the
bezels display is such an outstanding
feature for belts ultrabooks these days
and they do come in both matte and
glossy finishes which is cool specs wise
you're looking at a dual core Core M
processor paired with 8 gigabytes of ram
and a 256 gigabyte SSD one cool feature
we found is a fingerprint reader which
is a nice added security feature for
those confidential documents and files
stored on your latitude 13 dell also
announced their new two-in-one windows
pc called the latitude 12 7000 this
windows-based machine is meant to be a
surface pro 4 competitor as the unit
comes with a keyboard and it's attached
via the magnetic pins on the bottom the
kickstand comes built in with the tablet
just like the surface pro and the rear
comes with a nice textured finish that
also acts as a grip if you're using it
one-handed the screen is a 12.5 inch
display with a resolution of 3840 x 2160
which looks absolutely stunning the
device also features two USB type-c
ports for faster expansion and we can't
wait to give you guys our full review
soon but one thing that really stood out
is the responsiveness and the absolutely
smooth trackpad on both the latitude 12
and 13 we are really seeing
windows-based ultrabooks catching up to
the quality of the macbook trackpads and
this is fantastic news thank you guys
for checking out our CEOs coverage and
stay tuned for more content</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
