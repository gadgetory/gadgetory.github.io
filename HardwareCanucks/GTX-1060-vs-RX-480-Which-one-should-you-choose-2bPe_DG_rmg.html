Canucks and as much as I and you guys
love to see the progression of
enthusiasts flagship graphics cards and
the trickle-down improvements for the
lower end skews as well the mass market
isn't interested in purchasing a $600
plus a graphics card instead the sales
volume is so much stronger between $1.99
and a two $99 product that that is a
very interesting market a segment in
itself and that is what we're talking
about today and so this price range is
crucial that has seen AMD pushing strong
with the RX 480 and now being challenged
by Nvidia with the gtx 1060 and so if
you're in the verge of an upgrade which
one of these two should you choose yak
cable mod configurator allows you to
select only the cables you need with you
Joseph mod flex leaving that is very
flexible or mod mesh that is more
vibrant then you choose your length and
color combination custom cables just got
more custom with the cable mod
configurator so invidious pricing
structure with 1060 follows in the same
footsteps as a 1080 and the 1070 having
a substantial price premium for the
founders edition or the reference guard
at 299 which is the card we have here
while promising cards from board
partners starting from 249 at launch
this does shift the price to aim these
favors since the 4 and 8 gigabyte
variants on the are X 480 are at 199 and
239 respectively that grants the 480 an
immediate value advantage but still not
too far from the custom 10 60s at 249 on
paper the gtx 960 is a massive upgrade
over the 960 with 1280 CUDA cores 6 Higa
bytes of ram its gddr5 vram base clock
of 1506 and boost of 7000 8 megahertz
and the TDP of 120 watts and it's super
interesting to see the cooter core count
in this Pascal line so if a GTX 1050 was
ever to be released how many CUDA cores
will it have seven
20 now in comparison with the rx 480
which has a slightly high GDP but more
vram and a faster memory bus the gtx
1060 looks like a strong competitor
especially since Nvidia claims of
compete with performance of a GTX 980
both cards require a single 6 pin for
power and AMD has addressed the power
delivery issues over the PCIe so no need
to worry then comparing the i/o on the
reference cards we have three
DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 plus the
1060 has a DVI while the reference 480
doesn't but custom 480 cards will seem
to include a DVI connector the PCB on
both cards is about 7 inches with a
heatsink extending further that paves
the way for even shorter GPUs with
custom coolers can't wait for that ITX
versions on the rise one significant
difference between the two cards is
multi GPU support amy has framed the RX
for a to be a worthy competitor versus
the GTX 1080
when the 4 80s are in crossfire however
the gtx 960 has no SLI support this is a
single only GPU solution this could hurt
nvidia in the long run since dx12 and
multi-gpu scaling is becoming better but
this could be one of those things where
they try to see if no SLI compatibility
hurts the sales of the gtx 1060 we'll
just have to wait and see
now NVIDIA has made sure to separate the
1060 from the higher-end SKUs like the
1070 so let's jump into the benchmarks
and see how it stacks up against the RX
488 gigabytes
first let's start with 1080p at dx11
keep an eye between the purple bar which
is the gtx 960 and the orange bar which
is the arts 480 and their respective
positioning within our full stack and as
promised for the gtx 960 is very
competitive against its own gtx 980
while the arcs 480 is more in line with
the GTX 970
bumping the resolution to 1440p and the
gap between the two cards closes with
the gtx 1060 still taking a close lid
and there are a few titles where the gap
widens again as older gtx 980 and the
390x meander and between
now what about the x12 at 1080p here we
see the RX 480 squeezing some muscles
but keep in mind this sample size for
games is still quite small with Tomb
Raider showing advantage on Pascal cards
at 1440p the trend continues with the
arcs fluidity taking the lead over the
1060 especially in hitman but once again
we open Tomb Raider and it shows much
better optimization on the green side
and with gaming out of the way the gtx
1060 is a much more power efficient card
which could really benefit anyone who
wants an easy drop in upgrades while the
arcs for any slots well between hit and
the 1070 comparing reference coolers for
noise levels the gtx 960 is both quieter
and cooler staying at 71 degrees celsius
at load while the our X 480 was at 83
degrees Celsius and the final graph of
this comparison is a price to
performance chart with the arc spray
doing very well at 239 for both the X 11
and 12
while the gtx 1060 spans a wider price
bracket and therefore the founders
decision $50 premium makes the card way
too expensive
while the cheaper 249 makes it a
fantastic option the dark base 900 may
be the most innovative case of the year
with a built-in Qi charger interior
lighting tempered glass that can be
installed on either side and a fully
modular interior that can be inverted if
you so desire be quiet
stepping up their game check it out in
the description below and so where does
it leave us the arcs for you right now
is in short supply which you know allows
invidious gtx 1060 swoopin to be in good
timing with healthy performance and good
price as long as retailers for both
sides don't mark up the cards based on
low stock or hide them in or whatever
else - 49 - the gtx 960 is a fantastic
value especially with dx11
in DX 12 it suffers versus the 480 but
again our sample size was so little that
it's not totally conclusive and we'll
have to wait and see for more dx12
testing come
in the future but which one would you
choose again come back to that question
the 480 or the 1060 let us know in the
comments down below
now meant to meet you with our Canucks I
hope you guys enjoy this video and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
