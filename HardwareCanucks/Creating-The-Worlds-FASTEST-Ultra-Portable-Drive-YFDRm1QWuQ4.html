just got to Silverstone and a little
surprise they have on the table that we
were not expecting we have Samantha
we got the Samantha plane right over
here we got what is this one what do we
sir this is Sandra so big shout out to
Silverstone for this flow hookup I don't
know do you think Fred will be jealous I
hope not
yeah but huge thanks to our sponsors
thermaltake fantex and coolermaster for
making this trip possible all right so
first let's start with the MS 11 and
Silverstone is one of the few companies
who's actually thinking about external
storage solutions that match the market
demands for fast capacity beautiful
enclosures and appropriate cooling and
so this is the new MS 11 enclosure which
will allow you to populate your own PCIe
nvme SSD inside so you can literally
build your extreme speed thumb drive
sized
external SSD and this is exciting
because one where our most popular
videos involves the Silverstone MS
online enclosure into which I put a SATA
based and that to drive so I can have
you know 500 gigabytes of capacity in my
pocket wherever I need it and because
you build it your own you can choose
whatever and not two SSD you want to put
in there and whatever capacity to so the
same thing applies here but now we'll
have a PCIe nvme drive instead and so
with the MS 11 and the type C Gen 2
connection we have enough power and
bandwidth to take advantage of nvme
speeds on the PCIe connection and
internally you can mount up to a 20 to
80 drive the enclosure itself is fully
aluminium with some ventilation on the
sides and thermal pads inside and it's
actually quite small with a Type C
connection on one end and USB 3.1 gen2 a
on the other now the controller they're
using is not yet announced so we cannot
really show you the interior pieces but
of course will do once this thing is
launched but we are told is going to be
incredibly fast oh and I do appreciate
that it's an elegant solution plus
because it's fully aluminium it will
help to dissipate the heat from the
really hot and vme PCI and the two
drives but now it's more to some
exciting case developments we have the
Silverstone LD o three mini ITX tower
and closer so this one's got vertical or
I really like the design language on
this one like the angular glass panels
with complementing ventilation at the
bottom it does look different it somehow
reminds me of Silverstone that's perhaps
because the top panel it is fully mesh
using a high airflow dust filter with
high density mesh but thinner thread so
air flow can exit without any
restriction the i/o is basic so there's
no type-c on here just yet just dual USB
three the glass panel spends three sides
and I love the angular layout with a
dark tint and you can light up the
interior Hardware to have that showcase
pass through the mount for two side
panels are standard using long thumb
screws so they don't fall away when open
with two sided rubber grommets on the
glass which is awesome so they don't
fall out when you remove it while the
main panel sits on clips and is easily
removable so you can access the interior
perhaps change up and your new GPU and
stuff you don't necessarily need to take
off all the panels in order to work on
the interior now this layout may look
familiar because the frame is based on
the s g14 enclosure it's compact it
allows for dual 120mm fans one up top
and one below and Silverstone was
showing us this dual 120mm out of
radiator potential now because the GPU
sits so close to the side panel they
have added an additional 80 millimeter
top exhaust fan that eliminates the heat
buildup on top of the GPU plus if you
install an exhausting 120 motor fan up
top you have this nice vertical column
of air from the bottom to the top the
case accommodates SFX power supplies
nice removable dust filter and this
removable bracket up top to help with
power cable pass-through installation a
little details like that that matter I
appreciate it and for storage we only
get to SSD mounts and you'll probably
want to utilize em that to storage for
your motherboard anyway but yeah I TX
you obviously have a little bit of
restriction and compromises in
compatibility and not too much hardware
but the case I mean that's the nature of
ITX and I personally love the format of
the LDO 3 not just on the interior
because all that cooling capacity but
also on the exterior it does look unique
and I'm quite happy that Silverstone is
designing cases that have that visual
appeal and not just completely focused
on just simple
action ality so after the case I mean
Silverstone they do power supply's in
every year they're like here we've done
broken some record and other SFX l SFX
power supplies that breach or exceed our
expectations of the water so this is a
700 watt SFX power supply it's
absolutely tiny and it's fully modular
as you can see it's super short the last
one was 650 watts the one before that
was 550 watts and so you know we're just
expecting now for the next Computex
maybe in a thousand watt SFX power
supply or maybe at CES but yeah
increasing the wattage the size remains
the same well done and of course this is
80 plus platinum efficiency so you get
the best of the best in a small
form-factor tons of power modularity oh
and this tiny little they've modified
the power button and I think that
actually allows for better compatibility
in cases because we have had experience
where the power button did actually
cause some clearance issues for frame so
I'm gonna conclude my night here with
Sandra alright guys so we're gonna
conclude our visit here with Sandra
thank you to Silverstone for putting
these out highly appreciated so let us
know what you guys think about that new
ITX enclosure the whole towering effect
you know we've seen something like that
from fantex with the shift enclosure
which is a highly popular thing so the
price point we are told would be 100 to
120 dollars so let me know if either of
those ranges is suitable for you and
your ITX addiction because for some
reason ITX
enclosures are so expensive but anyways
we're also excited to check out that new
little enclosure for the PCIe nvme SSD
so that you can have that really fast
storage in your pocket with a Type C Gen
2 connection so really happy that
Silverstone is going about that so make
sure to check out other relevant content
for Computex coverage and we'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
