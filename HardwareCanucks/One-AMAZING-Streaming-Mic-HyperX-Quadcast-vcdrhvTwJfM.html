my voice but I know you're here for the
bureau so let that resume at last this
is the HyperX quadcast
I'll write you people so the HyperX quadcast has received a lot of height
because of its looks and I think it is
one of the better-looking microphones to
have come out from a gaming company even
though it's not necessarily a gaming
microphone it is targeted towards
streamers so kind of like a two-in-one
but in terms of sound quality thing is
great feature set is fantastic but at
$139 is it worth it so I have a few
microphones around and particularly the
blue Yeti and the blue Yeti Nano we'll
see how it compares in terms of sound
quality towards those and also many
other gaming headsets and their
microphones to see if this thing you
know is worth your time let's begin by
the way all the microphones will be
linked in the description below thank
you very much alright so let me get a
few things out of the way first this is
not an RGB microphone it is red and
black only keeping to the true color
scheme of the HyperX branding you know
the red string on the shock mount and
that beautiful soft ambient red
illumination inside the honeycomb mesh
now the thing is you cannot turn off the
illumination unless you mute the
microphone so that is a good visual
indication when the microphone is off by
lightly tapping at the top right here
very nice implementation there is no
popping sound when it is muted I mean
when it comes back up so I love that but
how cool would it be to have a black
microphone with RGB illumination I think
that is the next step for HyperX for
sure now the mesh built-in inside the
honeycomb is a built-in pop filter so if
you're recording on an angle like I am
doing now you'll avoid any pops
however it's not like a super nice pop
filter so if you are actually breathing
into the microphone your wind will be
picked up the microphone capsule here is
metal and the whole contraption is
pretty light with a slightly heavier
base to have stability and despite the
shock mount I think that's more of a
visual thing because anywhere you touch
on the microphone all the handling noise
will be picked up unfortunately
at the bottom of the microphone we have
our gain control so you could adjust
that on-the-fly it's super smooth but
there's no way to lock it and you could
accidentally brush against the bottom of
the microphone if you're like reaching
somewhere and change your game so for
example if I want to be slightly further
back and increase my gain all the way to
100% as I can see my levels are almost
peaking or if I want to come in a bit
closer and reduce it if you want to be
come a little bit more intimate how you
that's creepy and because of the name we
have for recording patterns to the back
so stereo bi-directional cardioid and
omnidirectional so cardioid is my
favorite pattern to use for voiceovers
it's pretty much what I keep all my
microphones on but the other modes are
pretty good if you want to podcasting if
you want to have the stereo output and
if you want to just have the
omnidirectional which records everything
right now for example I'm in stereo mode
if you're going for that seperation
between right and left channels
omnidirectional is pretty good if you
try to pick up everything around the
microphone like the really annoying dog
outside that will not stop barking hey
it stopped the microphone worked and
finally bi-directional is good if you
want to be recording anything from the
front and the back I guess it's good for
interviews and now we're back to the
cardioid pattern which is my favorite
and I asked you guys on Twitter what
you'd like to hear tested with the
microphone so let's do some keyboard
clicks and mouse clicks - all right so I
have MX brown switches over here now the
thing is the microphone has no built-in
noise cancellation so as I'm typing
everything as you can hear it will pick
up all the keyboard strokes which is why
I would suggest for streamers in
particular to use a quieter switch or
reduce the gain on the microphone become
a little bit more intimate with the
microphone like this so I'm not peeking
and then start to type so it will still
be semi audible but definitely muted
versus when the gain is boosted like
this and so it sounds like HyperX has
removed that noise cancellation that we
heard at CES which is a good thing makes
it more natural but then you have to go
about try to cancel out a mute those
background noises now what about the
mouse
it is audible unless you reduced the
game get really intimate with the
microphone like this still audible tone
you power the microphone with the
microUSB cable at the back and there's
also a headphone jack so you can monitor
what you're recording however there is
no volume control for the headphones
only the gain control for the microphone
itself we also have a microphone stand
adapter which is quite nice it's what I
used in the intro and if you want to
position the microphone on a boom arm or
something but on its own base it has a
little bit of angle adjustment and so
that is the feature breakdown of the
HyperX quadcast now let's compare it to
other microphones and for the sound test
let's do some reading now let's consider
IBM's famous Watson an artificial
intelligence system that won the
Jeopardy television game show in 2011
beating humans former champions Watson
is currently groomed to do more serious
work particularly in diagnosing diseases
in the eye such as Watson has enormous
potential advantages over human doctors
firstly an AI can hold in its data banks
information about every known illness
and medicine in history it can then
update these data banks daily not only
with the findings of new researchers but
also with the medical statistics
gathered from everyday LinkedIn clinic
in hospital in the world secondly Watson
will be intimately familiar not only
with my entire genome and my day-to-day
medical history but also with the
genomes and medical histories of my
parents siblings cousins neighbors and
friends thirdly Watson will never be
tired hungry or sick and will have all
the time in the world for me but if
you're entering medical school today and
expectations of still being a family
doctor in 20 years maybe you should
think again with such a Watson around
there's not much need for Sherlock's
alright so that is the reading test let
me know which one sounds best to you in
the comments now in terms of digital
noise the microphone is super clean
regardless of your gain setting here for
yourself
the only thing picked up is my computer
absolutely no noise great stuff you
gotta appreciate the smooth and engaging
sound with master up and - an H e 4x X
planar magnetic headphones that sound
amazing without a fancy amp and they're
built to satisfy your ears and not
destroy your wallet check out the drop
down below alright so that's it for the
quadcast let me know what you think of
the sound quality I think it has
fantastic neutrality to the vocals not
too much bass not too sharp on the
vocals just super natural and clean and
again the the cleanliness factor is
amazing the fact there's no digital
noise even at the maximum gain but of
course the downsides the fact that there
is no noise cancellation so you have to
just play around with the gain to
eliminate the keyboard noises eliminate
the mouse noises and you know get really
intimate with the microphone in order to
just have the vocals and not any
distractions in the background now mitri
