two-time case of the Year winner fantex
the always incredible Corsair and NCIX
so razer has been on a roll for past few
years with announcing some major new
projects products and initiatives in the
past two years at CES they have a flair
for the theatrical and this year proved
much of the same
first off Razer is taking on VR but not
in the way you would think they don't
view other manufacturers like oculus as
competition but more or less partners at
bringing VR to the masses they presented
the OS VR which is open source VR
Hackett retail prices are going to be
fairly inexpensive at 199 they believe
strongly that they have good tools
needed to help to facilitate the growth
and investment into this platform and if
needed in the future Razer can take what
they've learned so far and compete but
for right now they're just looking to
push the innovation into the VR category
forward and get more people on board so
this is a bold move Razer also showed
off the slow streaming box based off
Android TV this is Razer forged TV it's
small but allows for pretty decent
streaming of your PC games a lot like
the console mode with the Nvidia shield
but with no GPU restrictions that's very
important from what we understand the
streaming will be limited to 30 Hertz
only so you can imagine the type of
gaming this will be limited to it's got
a Snapdragon 805 Adreno 420 GPU 2 gigs
of ram and 16 gigabytes of storage
running Android lollipop so with the
included Android controller this is an
attractive android console you know if
you're into that it connects to your
router via ethernet drivers software
automatically picks up the connection to
your source PC and the output video
stream is routed through the HDMI to
your desired TV it is designed to live
in your living room there is a single
USB port included to connect your
peripherals plus an ambient green light
in the front to indicate its power state
coming a little later after the launch
is an impressive low lap path keyboard
and mouse set there both wireless and
can hold a charge longer than anyone can
really game consecutively the keyboard
has a charge of four months that's
pretty cool the
most impressive part though is both the
mouse and the pad are both magnetized
this matters a lot because you're not
always going to have a perfectly flat
base to play with and this magnetization
will allow you to move freely without
sending the mouse flying but because the
mouse sensor is in the center you
effectively gain an extra inch or so of
movement around the perimeter of this
very small pad and so from our
experience it was plenty we really look
forward to testing out both of these
products with samples become available
so please stay tuned to our Channel and
Hinrich knocks comm for more upcoming
videos and articles on its razor forge
