great technology selections and service
hey guys this is Dmitry with Jairo
Canucks and the set up tour is long
overdue and we wanted to give you some
insight as to what happens behind the
scenes here at Jairo Canucks for our
video content so this is my set up tour
with some ins and outs of how I do my
work you want to film and edit on a
daily basis so first let's begin with
the desk it's a plain white top to
maximize the light whenever I shoot
something inside it's large enough to
fit everything and at one point I've
actually had dual monitor setups there
but since it has changed to properly
accommodate for my speaker setup that's
right I sacrifice one monitor for these
speakers now starting with the display
this is an IPS 12 bit full sRGB color
space 1200 P Asus Pro are 246 q that was
a mouthful monitor that served me
extremely well with excellent color
accuracy and uniformity across the panel
however I'll definitely be making a
switch towards something higher res
maybe 4k as soon as it carries onward
the same color specs for appropriate
color work on our videos and I love this
monitor so much that I've got a few
hearts on the quarter that some of you
have noticed over time it this monitor
has made an appearance once in a while
on top is my 1080p Microsoft LifeCam
Studio webcam that I'm about to utilize
to stream the damn good show while I'm
away in Germany moving on to the
peripherals I've recently switched the
Poseidon Zed from thermal take from my
previous Corsair k70 as I do love the
blue tactile switchers for typing and
especially my maneuvering in gaming has
improved this is complemented by the my
onyx nail 7000 by far my favorite
optical mouse with excellent ergonomics
and outstanding sensor that is on top of
my in win mouse mat that I got at
yes which is fully aluminum with a nice
rubber base so it doesn't a slide it
cleans very well and so far has provided
the most consistent tracking with the
mouse and I just can't think of a more
perfect combo for the mouse sitting
beside the mouse is my only tablet this
is the shield tablet that I always have
plugged in and charged and mainly use it
for Twitter feed and extra content
running in the background whenever I'm
doing all my write-ups some other few
things on the desk is a soft carry pouch
for my additional CF and SD cards and
decided are my earphones nicely tucked
away in their own carry pouch these are
the shure se215 s that ii have my total
approval as they sound fantastic for
external storage i'm running a few
drives all USB 3.0 with one of them
shockproof this is from a data and it
gets put into my backpack whenever I
need backup whenever I travel and lastly
the Kingston USB thumb drive with a
hundred twenty eight gigabytes of space
in such compact form and it usually
holds my most important files for backup
now probably the most interesting part
is my audio setup starting with the
large and powerful audio engine a 5 plus
speakers that are in gorgeous bamboo
housing that look fantastic and they sit
down iso acoustics speaker stands that
allow an appropriate isolation from the
below surface plus an adjustable angle
to direct them at your ears and not in
your stomach and i have recorded a
little sample from my daily position of
where i said so you can also experience
for yourself and how much fun
our community
so I hope you enjoyed that for the rest
of your audio setup they are routed into
the GDS labs o 2 + o DAC and amp combo
for DAC pass-through only as the
speakers already have a built-in amp
decided is a pretty common preamp from
Focusrite the scarlett 2i2 with a
gorgeous brushed red aluminum housing
with clean audio pass-through so that
keeps me happy all of my review videos
are recorded on this audio technica
at2020 and adobe edition to really
perfect to what you're hearing now now
we still get many questions about our
headphone stand this is mr. bubble from
in win looks a little bit like a
wineglass but it has a solid aluminum
base and mouth-blown tempered glass
shell so it has some imperfections in
there and internally and every single
piece is unique and I think it fits into
my setup quite well as far as headphones
go my most recently used pair is
Sennheiser HD 800 with an interesting
build quality and a really pleasant
sound signature that makes them one of
my favorite headphones with an
absolutely magnificent low-end
reproduction for an open style design
that's really tight and controlled
although I will be honest they don't sit
quite as comfortable as the HD 650 s
that are my next go-to headphone that
I'm not afraid of taking with me on
trips and such now my last pair is the
HD adj that can withstand being thrown
in the bag without any worry plus they
are the only closed back headphone that
I own and when sound isolation is needed
they make an appearance every time and I
also use them when recording so they
just stay plugged in into my Scarlett my
two companions on my desk if you can
call them that are my buddy Dave because
who doesn't love a minion and this
little guy who's made a few appearance
in the past and a few videos and it's
just nice to have and some of you have
been asking of why that exists but it
was just a gift from a friend and
station beside the mini dinosaur is a
Kingston USB 3.0 multi card reader so
that's about it and now let's move on to
the video equipment
with the lenses that I use source
starting with the macro lens that comes
in handy for at least 30 percent of the
shots is the Sigma 105 millimeter F 2.8
OS for one-to-one macros for those
really close up and personal shots it's
an outstanding piece of glass that goes
wherever I go and my latest addition is
the same young 85 millimeter F one point
four that serves me well for shots where
I need to compress the background but
it's not as tight is 105 millimeter and
everyone should have an 85 millimeter in
their camera bag next is my kit lens the
24 to 105 f/4 that's by far the most
versatile given the availability for the
wide-angle and the zoom plus you have
image stabilization in there and it's
the lens that I use for most trips where
I only need to take one lens and not
worry about the rest however my most
used lens is actually this guy the power
35 millimeter cinestyle lens at t 1.5
with d clicked aperture and incredibly
smooth focusing ring with very nice
optics and this is the lens that most
people ask about and here's an example
of what this lens can do so this is
fully open at 1.5 ISO 320 with gorgeous
bokeh and incredibly clean shadows due
to such low ISO next is a 2.8 with iso
640 still clean and we have a wider
focusing plane in a slightly sharper
image now move this all the way up to
f/4 with ISO 1250 and we do get to see
some visible noise and that is
introduced due to such high ISO and move
this up to F 5.6 with 2500 iso and the
footage becomes almost unusable due to
such high noise and actually thanks to
this lens I never have to push my iso
over a thousand to keep the cleanest
possible footage so this lens is a total
beast in low-light situations now the
star behind the show is the full-frame
DSLR the canon 5d mark ii it's quite old
but it's still a damn workhorse and i
love it
it is running magic lantern so I get
audio meters on-screen and many other
proper video camera functionality that's
built in
and I've been thinking of adding a B
camera to my set and I'm feeling the
Panasonic gh4 has gained everyone's
recognition but I would love to hear
what you guys think and your input as to
what should be my next camera investment
with a comment below of course many of
our viewers have requested to see my
personal machine and what I run to edit
all these videos and here she is sitting
silently below the desk housed inside
the h4 40 from NZXT so this case is
elegant and I find it fitting in my
setup I haven't changed any fans just
kept them at stock and the large side
window reveals the color matched cooler
and the graphics card and what we have
here is the latest NZXT cooler this is
the ex 61 with a 280 mm a radiator that
is secured up top to keep my 3930k fully
under control this is a 6 core chip with
12 threads and I have overclocked that
to 4.5 gigahertz I have 32 gigabytes of
Corsair Vengeance memory that is fully
utilized whenever I render anything and
I'm running a reference GTX 770 you know
it's not the most powerful kid on the
block but as soon as I make my next
upgrade towards an X 99 chipset I would
like to hear your opinion on what GPU
would complement the build all this is
plugged into the Asus x79 Pro
motherboard with an intel SSD for my OS
and my Adobe applications with over 6
terabytes of storage spread over four
mechanical drives all this is for backup
and cache to keep all the files
separated and the nicely backed up in
case anything happens I do have a sound
card that I don't utilize anymore as I
do have a desktop DAC to drive my
headphones and the speakers as well but
this is the Asus DX 7.1 channel sound
card that has served me really well up
to this point everything is powered by
Corsair 1000 watt power supply that is
totally overkill for this type of system
but I will be swapping it for a lower
wattage unit down the line cable
management is fine I didn't spend too
much time on it but I do want to show
you the side panel in case you are
considering the H 440 as due to thick
form on it this
does limit your total space at the rear
and the consequence is the challenging
process of actually closing the side
panel plus you can see all the little
marks that are left on the foam from all
the cables that are sort of pressed
against it but that is about it we hope
you enjoy the detail inside as to what I
work with to produce the quality content
on a daily basis that we put up on this
channel so let us know if I've missed
anything that you'd like to get covered
and throw in your suggestions as I am
planning on moving towards the x99
chipset as this machine hasn't really
seen an upgrade or a major upgrade in
over two years
and if you'd like to get more
information we have reviewed most of the
items on the channel here so click to

watching don't forget to subscribe to
get notified on more setup tours to come
