brought to you by NCIX technology
connected i guess i'm here at a data's
suite at CES 2014 and we're here to take
a look at some of the new and innovative
SSD controllers as well as a couple
other little secrets and i'm going to
show a little bit later on but the first
thing that we want to take a look at is
two different pcie ssds now this one
right here is the native SSD that is
running the lsi griffin 3700 controller
and if we go down a little bit further
this is the m2 version both using pci
express and they both use the griffin
3700 controller now one thing i want to
tell you is that these are not available
as of yet we're hoping that they're
going to be available in mid-2014 so
make sure you keep your eyes out for
that now one of the really awesome
things about these drives is how
insanely fast they are as you can see
here they can read and write up to 1,800
megabits per second this completely
blows away standard SSD Qatar SSD speeds
now they're not only going to have these
PCI Express SSDs we're also taking a
look here at the sx 930 which should be
available as soon as the controllers are
available and they have up to two
terabytes for the capacity but you're
still limited to the standard USB or not
USB SATA 3 speed constrictions which
means you're only going to be able to
get up to 500 reads and writes now it
doesn't stop there we're also be taking
a look at a brand-new product it is they
micro SSD which actually has capacities
up to 128 gigabytes now these are
specifically going to be used for mobile
solutions like laptops or possibly even
tablets i'm assuming correct okay so
this is a tiny tiny little chip that
packs quite a powerful punch with the
amount of capacity that you can have on
such a small form factor
now I know that I teased you guys a
little bit of one of the cool things
that a data is gonna be coming up with
later in the year we're looking at
mid-2014 I'm assuming and this is ddr4
now we can't show you it working in a
system mostly just because we just don't
have the boards available to us right so
what we can tell you is that the dems
already the ready and good to go so the
second that we do have the boards
available to the general public a data
will be one of the first ones to be
releasing these steps to you be
beautiful public that's not to like
alright guys so a data also has quite a
few different mobile options that center
around power and your battery capacity
so one of the first things that I
noticed when we came over here so we
took a look at the sea e700 which is a
height-adjustable wireless battery
charger wireless cell phone charger I
should say so a couple Samsung devices
will work with it an Okie will work that
and its height adjustable depending on
where the contact point is so you can
see now we put the for the nexus 4 down
on the charger and it does accept the
charge moving over a little bit we have
the PV 100 which is a very slim 4200
milliamp hour battery pack now guys it's
perfect you can fit it in your pocket
throw need a laptop bag if you want to
and it comes in multiple different
colors and MSRP is going to started
around $32 now moving on to the PC 500
which is a little bit more targeted
towards women and it has a five thousand
million of our capacity and this one
does come a little bit of a premium
price so we're looking at $35 for the
unit moving over to some of the xpg line
of heat sinks for it out of dems we're
going to be taking a look at the xpg v2
heatsink now guys the bottom two colors
are already available but they have
seven other color options that you can
choose from and what I would like you to
do is I'd like you to leave a comment on
the description aren't a comment on the
description I want you to leave a
comment in the comments below so you can
actually let us know which colors you
guys would prefer which ones that fit
your belt which ones would you like to
see and you know what a data might
actually end up reading these comments
listening to you and making these into
the production models
so guys thanks for taking a look at the
a data sweet here at CES 2014 and what I
want you to do is I want you to like the
video and I don't want you to dislike
the video because I know that you guys
obviously love every single bit of
content that you've seen here today but
if you want to dislike it that's that's
fine I mean you can go ahead no please
don't but subscribe and make sure you
take a look at all the other CS 2014
coverage that we have here and you know
what we're live from Vegas</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
