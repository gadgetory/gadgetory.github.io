great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
hardware conducts and today we're going
to take a look at what I would consider
one of the most appropriately complete
mobile gaming machines and I say
appropriately complete because the
entire feature set of this eurocom m5
pro notebook hits all the right notes at
an affordable price point of $14.99 with
of course configurable hardware if you
have the means of spending more cash so
in our machine we are equipped with the
i7 quad-core 47 20 HQ with 3.6 gigahertz
in turbo mode eight gigs of ram a really
powerful nvidia gtx 970m
with three gigs of VRAM and the only
bottleneck with this setup is the 500
gigabyte 7200 RPM mechanical drive i
also want to mention how much I
appreciate the inclusion of 802 11 AC
Wi-Fi for better signal strength during
multiplayer and this was the only
machine in my possession that actually
had any connection in the farthest spot
away from my 5g router the eurocom m5
pro is not a particularly unique looking
machine but this strikes a utilitarian
approach with brushed aluminum body on
the outside that does not hide handling
at all and I would have preferred some
rubberized surface or a non brushed
aluminum I would consider this to be a
thin machine given the specs as that 25
millimeters and a fairly light body - at
2.6 kilos the screen lid is perfectly
balanced to open with just one hand
without tipping over and this is where
we find an anti glare math 15.6 inch
display with 1920 by 1080 P resolution
this is an IPS display with really good
viewing angles and accurate colors high
resolution models are available but I
wouldn't consider them necessary for
this form factor the brightness range is
okay but a little extra brightness would
have been nice and because the screen
lid is so light there isn't a solid
frame to reinforce it and you can see
just how much flex the screen may
experience and that makes me a little
bit uncomfortable on the left side the
ports are look for
together would have liked to see them
spaced out we find an HDMI out USB 3
with supercharged and dual DisplayPort
1.2 output with support of 3840 by 2160
at 60 Hertz on the other side there's a
king's interlock killer LAN ethernet
port 2 more USB 3.0 a SIM card slot
that's a bit unusual a 6 and 1 card
reader and lastly headphone microphone
and spdf digital output the AC power
plugs at the back that I initially
thought might be uncomfortable however
it suits the m5 pro well given the
already loaded side ports and vibe aside
it is an eSATA and USB 3.0 combo port
for more stationary peripherals the
ventilation system on this machine is
pretty impressive with CPU and GPU
cooling on different sides with two
individual heat sinks and separate fans
the CPU vents are on the left while a
larger venting port at the back is for
the GPU and I find that really awesome
to separate where the heat is coming
from plus make sure the fans are
optimized for more silent operation the
interior of the m5 throw to the most
part is excellent without standing
stereo speakers right below the screen
with just a slide angle for proper
projection for the user let's take a
listen
moving on the keyboard is backlit with a
surprising amount of travel time and
quick bounce with the wos the gaming
zone highlighted with the red arrows and
is extremely satisfactory to use for
both typing and gaming really the only
hiccup that I've discovered is a
slightly loose backslash button below
the backspace but as otherwise all the
buttons are stiff and in place lastly
the trackpad on this machine is one of
the best windows trackpads that I've
used the actual tracking surface doesn't
have a physical click but recognizes a
single and double tap just fine it's
super smooth not exactly glass smooth
but very close with responsive finger
gestures and separate physical left and
right clicks right underneath that are
like to use do not require any hand
readjustments and this is the first
machine that I've used with a
fingerprint scanner that works really
fast actually faster than my iPhone I
love it signing into secured Windows has
never been easier if there is one thing
that I'll change though is replace the
brushed aluminum piece at the front
where any contact is visible right away
with perhaps the same metal chassis that
is found on the rest of the Interior
removing the bottom cover we are
presented with customization options in
case you'd want to upgrade your RAM with
two slots available replace your two and
a half inch drives that are stacked on
top of each other it's an awesome
space-saving technique or add up to two
m dot two SSDs for this machine and once
again I really love that the CPU and the
GPU cooling is separated allowing fans
to stay idle with life usage and during
my gaming tests both the CPU and the GPU
were well under control
with maximum temperatures of 85 and 69
degrees Celsius respectively
while on the idle we are looking at 49
and 38 degrees Celsius which means the
Machine stayed dead silent and the fans
kickin only if needed the thermal
footprint of the m5 Pro looks excellent
with most of the heat originating
between the speakers and while it looks
like the entire keyboard is also hot and
then the rest of the body because the
keyboard platform is slightly indented
your hand never makes contact with the
platform as the front portion of the
body helps to isolate your hand from the
heat it's an awesome chassis design and
now coming on to the best part of this
review that performance and I am
genuinely impressed with what a single
970m can do on this scale launching into
gta5 on very high at 1080p gets us an
average of 51 frames per second and with
40 at minimum and that is totally
playable
battlefield 4 on ultra preset and depth
of field at 85 we are averaging at 70
FPS and dipping into low 30s for our
minimums Metro last light is a demanding
title but on high preset with high
tessellation and advanced physics on we
are averaged at 50 frames that is
playable but with occasional dips into
the low 20s for less demanding titles
like dota 2 getting the settings maxed
out and we averaged at the solid 90 FPS
with excellent minimum to at 74 frames
per second and I have been playing
natural selection too often just to test
my reflexes and maxing out those
settings gives us a 64 average and a bit
of a low minimum of 33 but I rarely felt
a dipping below 50 now as for battery
life the m5 pro is equipped with a four
cell 60 watt hour battery lasting me
well over three hours for our
standardized mixed usage scenario as
this an impressive result for this form
factor and throughout my time with the
eurocom m5 Pro I've got to thinking that
there will be always some type of
compromise with today's gaming notebooks
whether they're not thin enough they're
too expensive or poor performance but
the m5 pro is one impressive chassis
that that's cooling right without jet
engine fans
it's totally loaded with i/o ports and I
love the hardware customization that is
available to the user the keyboard the
trackpad I think is one of the best I've
experienced on a Windows notebook and
proper IPS display is a must although
that is one compromise the framing of
this display feels really poor
performance is totally acceptable for
gaming machine in this price range and
we're giving it the Harwick nuts
damn good award so make sure to
