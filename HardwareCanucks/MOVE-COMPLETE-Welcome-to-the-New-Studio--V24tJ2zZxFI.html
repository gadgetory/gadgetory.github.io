really don't have a good system to
transport hardware but I am improvising
with a nice large box foam and we're
gonna layer creativity is fueled by the
best instruments it doesn't always come
easy and in the process you often
realize how important quality is the Rd
400 by OCC gives you quality and speed
with M de tu interface the schieben and
flash and a PCI bracket making it
possible to focus on what matters
invest in storage that makes a
difference with a 5 year advanced
warranty so what I'm thinking is having
graphics cards in the very bottom of
this box and then nice trusty foam
and so what we have finished from an
almost empty shelf is a nice stack of
boxes little pyramid over there which
includes all my motherboards my coolers
and all the boxes because there is
products in there these are kind of my
electronics you guys know about the bag
of cables you guys also might have seen
the bag of peripherals so it's headsets
mice and you know their mice like kind
of like stashed inside there they're
nice and safe and this is my other box
with all the things all the little
things that came from the shelf I still
have a little bit of things to sort out
but yeah it's coming along also a little
bit of an update as you guys can see
behind me that's my balcony I finally
have about me for about another week
until I move out but many cases that
were on the balcony have found new
owners you guys know who you are
so thank you for being a part of this
alright and as safely packaged you guys
probably already know this but the best
way to pack all your hardware that's
already in boxes is obviously to put it
inside the suitcase I still have a few
more boxes to put away but check this
out suitcase full of hardware how do you
think again this stuff in the first
place
so we have no more curtains I luckily I
have these shields on the windows so I
can block out all the light but check
out I'm using the ladder this event they
give me ideas for when I have to set up
the new space and I kind of want to take
the ladder
t-brain
and so now begins the inevitable part
deconstructing myself not completely
just taking off the monitor off it
stands removing all the cable stuff in
the back here so that I can have
everything ready to go in a moment's
notice today is Friday we're moving out
on Sunday so it was actually a good
thing I did such a terrible job with
kale management in the beginning around
the bracket because I was able to easily
contain all the cables because I stood
Shoney's of stuff and I have to shoot
and a spot for a test or keyword which
is right behind me
it is actually super beautiful but
because I need to set up a nice clean
space for the ad spot to to show like in
its natural environment that encourages
me to be as clean as possible and I mean
where I am shooting right now is clean
but the rest of the office is a little
bit here especially right there the
Graham spectrum keyboard bite this Sorel
comes with a new mechanical agile switch
with low profile key caps with super
fast response and shorter actuation
distance plus all the customization
included with RGB lighting and macros
for a premium user so today is Saturday
I am moving tomorrow and I'm going to
the new place now to yourself a few
things so here's an obligatory change
spinny shot from my current space
alright so I am now in the new space
check out the sunlight behind me that's
that's gonna be fun thing is we are
facing east where the Sun is rising so I
should know
too much trouble with the Sun the thing
is this office is a little bit smaller
than my previous office and right now it
might seem even much much smaller
because there's no furniture because
once you've no furniture everything
looks completely out of proportion but
check out that view I'm really loving
the blue color in the kitchen too and
check out this beautiful tile they're
actually from Ikea this whole countertop
but I am super excited to utilize this
tile in future of the deals
all right so IKEA just arrived the desk
is going to go here say after that and
only the finest part is also and so
obviously I have to install my first leg
wrong
so this is the lemon and you guys know
that moment of truth
once you unpack in brand-new desk looks
great and the next deal of business is
Alex there you are yeah it's a moving
day I need to pack my PC now I am not
worried but a little bit cautious
because this is a glass I just realized
because I have the hue plus in the back
of the the case that is screwed from the
inside I have to remove it because this
is actually the sight because on this
side of the case now so the case isn't
traveling far but just in case I put
this foam here so that the GPU doesn't
constantly sort of rattling if case
there is any vibration stuff I think
this is safe to transport
well it's been quite the move all the
boxes would think I moved like over 30
boxes to get everything out of this
office but it is now legitimately
emptied obviously a sign from my router
so I can still have wine Frank but look
no more stuff on the shelf I will miss
you shelf oh I have to not forget my
poster desk you have served me very well
I start to take my nice shelf obviously
cannot forget my plans closer iconic and
people have been wondering about where
that giant Thermaltake case is well it
is here I have to bring it downstairs
now good thing it disassembles because
it's all metal it's all steel I mean and
it's quite heavy but that's it my
backpack one more case more parts for
the big Thermaltake case and I will be
done with this lovely space all right I
am in the office now finally everything
absolutely everything that needed to
come with me into this new office studio
space is now here so we went from going
from a huge mess to something clean
because everything was out to something
that is a huge mess once again so not
bad today for an exercise 13,000 steps
to get all the stuff in and I'm pretty
sure I walked minimum 50 flights of
stairs today for the entire duration of
this move but move-in successful I am
very happy to report all the GPUs are in
order all the boxes that have to come we
are in order and obviously the first
thing to establish in a new studio space
is where does the plant go and I think I
found a nice little spot there and it
wasn't very long ago when we received
the 100,000 subscriber a play on play
button that it's in silver we are now at
over 500,000 so hopefully within the
next year we will reach that nice 1
million in gold making happy people make
it happen I am so happy that everything
is finally finished
next order of business will be to set up
my editing station here and I'm trying
to do something different something that
I didn't do in the previous studio and
if you have any feedback on what I
should do leave them in the comments
down below but thank you so much for
watching a little support I'm a teacher
in how it connects we'll see you in next
