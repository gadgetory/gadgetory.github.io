easily be the coolest gaming peripheral
we've seen to date the company is a mad
catz a tech subsidiary which specializes
in some pretty unique and innovative
products but the rat gaming mouse
definitely takes the cake now this is no
ordinary Mouse it has a very impressive
list of features which will go through
in the review but its most notable is
the ability to almost completely adjust
itself to fit the way you hold it the
idea is that it can be uniquely adjusted
for any type of gamer whether you use a
finger grip a full palm grab or just
about anything in between there are four
different variations of the rat mouse
all at different price points but the
rat 7 offers the most amount of features
for its mid-range price tag of
ninety-nine dollars this is one product
showcase you should definitely stick
around for so let's take a look at the
rat 7 gaming mouse now aside from all of
the other goodies cyborg hasn't stiffed
on the basics the left and right primary
buttons have excellent response and the
scroll wheel has very solid tactile
feedback it doesn't just spin free the
most features a four-way dpi adjustment
button that you can set yourself as well
right by your index finger there's this
mode button that allows you to change
the most profile on the fly looking
right under the palm rest there is a
second sideways scroll wheel that can
easily be used by your thumb and is open
for custom settings okay and this is
definitely the number one button it
enables precision aim mode when you hold
down the button the most will actually
drop to it ever sensitivity you've set
in the software making it ideal to line
up the perfect headshot unfortunately
it's also likely to increase the
population of sniping campers yeah you
know who you are and then as well the
two other forward and back programmable
buttons underneath you can see the solid
metal skeleton that the most design is
based around as well the dual 50 600 dpi
laser that tracks up to 6 meters per
second and then top it off with rubber
feet that make this Mouse's movements
incredibly smooth
and so the fun begins of customizing our
rat now of course nobody actually reads
directions well hmm as I found out
pretty quickly for this mouse you're
going to want to starting off they've
hidden the tool needed for many of the
units adjustments on the back and it's
just a typical hex key socket now
probably the easiest adjustment for this
mouse is actually the palmrest it's held
in by a little lever underneath which
when pushing it in allows you to slide
the piece back and forth and take it off
depending on your hole there are three
different palmrest options the stock is
for just typical users there is a
patterned rubber rest which improves
grip and then a taller piece for more
support and probably larger hands moving
on the next options are all about the
adjustable thumb rest using the included
adjustment tool the thumb piece can
actually be fine-tuned forward and back
to fit the length of a user's thumb also
under the palm rest area a screwed
loosens off the thumb piece allowing it
to swing in and out and be tightened in
at any interval so now that your palm
and thumb have been attended to we move
on to the little guy on the left the
pinky well it doesn't have any important
button mashing roles he gets pampered
either way aside from the stock piece
there was also a textured rubber grip
and a scoop piece in case he's feeling a
little lazy besides simply unscrews the
new piece put on and obviously screwed
back in
and so our final mouse adjustments wait
underneath about two-thirds of the way
back we have a not holding back a rather
springy spring there are 56 gram weights
usable in any combination and for those
that you aren't using they can be stored
in a handy container so they don't get
lost so that's our look on the cyborg
rat 7 it really has been a while since
we've seen all-new true innovation in
mouse technology for the everyday user
something like this is way beyond what
you need but for gamers the rat 7 is
definitely at the highest echelon of
performance and customization the rat 7
provides an incredible amount of freedom
to perfect the design and functionality
that suits your style but they haven't
done so in a way where they hand you the
blueprints and tell you to come up with
it yourself still at a hundred dollars
for just a mouse it is a bit of a heavy
investment but provided the features
meet your needs it's worth every penny
the only beef I have with the Brad seven
there's no left-handed version and for
some of us that kind of sucks thanks for
