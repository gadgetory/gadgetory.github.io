video because over the past year or so
I've been collecting these little
knickknacks when I would call them not
necessarily something that I use every
day but these are some cool PC
components you probably never heard of
that could potentially be useful for
your next build now the interesting
thing about this entire collection is
that you all tried to solve a particular
issue when it comes to PC building so
whether it's cable management lighting
you know spacing for the GPU additional
IO and USB ports etc so I'm hoping that
some of these items may be beneficial to
you and not really waste of time so
let's dive right in
alright so let's start off with
something for cable management this is
the EVGA power link this adapter is
quite old but it reroutes the power
inputs for your GPU for a cleaner look
from the top so the PCI cables exit on
the back of the card so keep in mind the
added length of the whole GPU because of
power link and also compatibility since
the pegs must face down so it will work
with EVGA cards and founders Edition
cards as well and there is a 6-pin
connector included so you can swap that
in it is a $15.00 accessory so quite
inexpensive but it's very basic so the
EVGA logo does not light up and in my
configuration the cables exiting from
the bottom of the cards it doesn't look
very good but it still might sue to some
systems next up is the 24 pin
motherboard 90 degree adapter from
coolermaster that's a no bling accessory
as well that is actually quite genius
since let's say 99% motherboards have
the 24 pin facing up and this way you
avoid bending the cable for a slightly
cleaner exit now the thing is I don't
get why it's so expensive at 25 dollars
with the built-in capacitor and that
personally would love for companies to
include something like that for high-end
motherboards or high-end power supplies
I also wish that these adapters were
slightly lower profile known as bulky
plastic pieces because they do introduce
their own sort of compromises and by the
way everything will be linked in the
description below thank you very much
next up is a device you probably don't
need this is a wireless power and reset
switch from silverstone so you plug this
into your motherboard USB ports reroute
the power and reset
connections while also linking the case
io here so Ches buttons will still work
and using this remote you can wirelessly
power on and reset your system the range
is actually quite good because of the
2.4 gigahertz receiver the setup a
simple and pretty clean too and this
might be handy for wall-mounted PCs and
really hard-to-reach systems and might
be handy for you it is twenty dollars so
not too expensive and fills in that
interesting void of wireless accessories
moving on we have something all ITX
users will appreciate a magnetic
internal USB hub from NZXT now I say I
TX users because many I TX motherboards
only have a single internal USB header
so if you're connecting in a OH
that requires USB for drivers and many
other accessories this thing will save
your build so it's got three USB headers
plus one you connect to the motherboard
and two-years be two ports for whatever
accessories you might want to plug in
there it is powered via molex that seems
to be a common complaint but it supplies
more power than Sodom and it's only
twenty dollars that I'm sure many people
will appreciate and they'll turn it into
that is a thermal tech h200 internal hub
that has basically the same
functionality with three USB motherboard
headers and three USB 2 ports for
standard accessories but this one is
SATA powered and is designs that
differently so the magnet on here is
much stronger and because it's magnetic
and has all the parts around you can
integrate it behind the case or in the
main chamber as part of you know all
your visual hardware it is around $23
and will definitely be handy for systems
when you're adding multiple all the one
coolers other accessories that need that
the whole USB drivers support from the
motherboard this is the way to go
alright this next item is quite bizarre
120 millimeter in one fan called Mars it
comes in red or black with a quality
aluminium body and that's quite unique
because of this transformative nature on
the frame allowing you to angle and
position the fan towards usually
unreachable spots either delivering air
or exhausting air and this particular
arm allows for 360 degree rotation plus
the fan has some ability as well you
just have to be cautious with spinning
blades and whatever on location you
install this thing it has a pwm cable
for control view your motherboard
or you can plug this into a USB port
thus opening opportunities for
installation of Mars outside of the case
the only crappy thing is of course the
price at $60 it's quite steep for a
single fan and speaking of fans if
you're all about giving your system some
illumination without going overboard the
fan takes halos RGB fan frames are
actually quite awesome so the more
premium Lux frames are made of aluminum
and there are $20 a piece while the
normal plastic ones are about 12
but the illumination is the same they
light up fan blades and the effect looks
really nice with white blades but also
not bad with my brown Noctua fans - they
can be daisy chained together or
connected directly to the fan --tx case
lining or via addressable headers on
your motherboard and then we've got
these interesting fan dust filters from
silverstone i don't like the color
options but functionally they're perfect
with the magnetic frame so you don't
need to screw them on with anti
vibration padding included and a super
fine dust mesh that has very little
impact on airflow but will collect all
the particles they're only available on
120 Miller sizes but might be an
excellent choice for some ITX systems or
replacing existing dust filters and you
can pick them up for around $13 and the
last item on the list is a vertical PCIe
GPU bracket for your case from cable mod
it should fit in most cases with seven
plus PCI slots and its paces the GPU
away from the side panel thus
temperatures should be lower versus
traditional of vertical GPU alignment it
comes with two angled DisplayPort cables
and a short riser cable to get
everything set up so you can showcase
you know the full body of your graphics
card and the only disadvantage here is
that you're essentially blocking the
rest of your PCI slots on the
motherboard and it's also a $60
accessory pretty steep alright people so
that is my list of weird than cool
knickknacks that I've collected over
time when it comes to PC components that
might be worth your time but if you've
discovered some strange components along
your journey of PC building definitely
share them in the comments below I'm
