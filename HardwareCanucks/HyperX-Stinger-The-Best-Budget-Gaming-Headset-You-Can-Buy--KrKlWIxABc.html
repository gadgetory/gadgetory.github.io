axe and if you're in the market for a
gaming headset you'll most probably go
through a lot of options with varying
price points but if you're willing to
spend less than hundred dollars on this
gaming accessory and if you want the
best bang for your buck there's a new
kid on the block from Kingston HyperX
and it's definitely worth checking out
but before that quick look at our
sponsor
this could be you maybe time you turn on
your PC super-chill CPU happy you
crackin x61
ye NZXT purchase discount in the
description below
meet the HyperX cloud stinger a $50
gaming headset targeted towards gamers
who are on a budget but not willing to
take a significant hit on built quality
comfort and the last piece of the
equation sound this happens to be the
lowest price offering in the cloud
headset lineup but that doesn't mean you
should ignore it compared to its bigger
brother the HyperX cloud that retails
for $80 it comes with a much better
build quality detachable microphone
included accessories and better sound
signature the cloud 2 gaming headset
that retails for $100 just add 7.1
virtual surround sound which I'm not a
fan of generally and finally put it up
against the flagship cloud revolver that
retails for $120 the only improvement
would be a much better sounding
microphone compared to the original
cloud but can the Stinger offers some of
the best elements found on other
headsets
we'll find out let's start with the
design the matte black finish throughout
the body along with the HyperX branding
on both ear cups won my heart over
typical glossy plastic finishes that you
get with other cheap gaming headsets
I'll be the bill Connolly is pretty darn
impressive for the price it's made out
of hard plastic material that
complements a much lighter body but the
durability factor is minimal so be aware
of that
it won't survive mini temper tantrums
after you've been killed in your
favorite FPS comfort wise I have to give
this to Kingston because for $50 I was
expecting some sort of discomfort
somewhere in the headset but that
actually turned out to be the opposite
the signature memory foam has plenty of
cushion to prevent your ears from making
contact with the drivers plus the
headband also features appropriate
padding and given the close-packed style
I was genuinely satisfied wearing this
for long gaming sessions and even
watching content the clamping force was
also minimal and I didn't notice head
fatigue during my use which is so much
appreciated you'll find adjustable steel
sliders to adjust the headband depending
on the size of your head these steps are
well defined and tight enough to prevent
slipping the ear cuffs feature 90-degree
rotation and
this is hands-down my favorite feature
because when I'm resting these around my
neck having them laid out flat gives me
more room for my head to move around
which I couldn't have with my dt9 any
premiums the microphone arm uses a
swivel type mechanism with a little bit
of flexibility to move around once you
swivel it all the way up it mutes the
mic which is a smart feature in my
opinion and we'll get to the testing
shortly do note that it's non removable
if you're wondering about adjusting
volume don't be afraid Kingston has
built an intuitive volume slider on the
rear side of the right ear cup it's a
much better solution over standard
inline volume controls that I'm
typically not a fan of the cable is non
removable and it's not braided but
Kingston has reinforced it well enough
on the headset to accept rough use also
you won't notice much of the
reverberations found on the revolvers
braided cable so basically you won't
hear brushes against anything when
you're using the Stinger the cable that
comes with the headset is 1.3 meters
which is pretty short if you decide to
route it behind your PC but they do
include an extension cable that splits
the stereo and mic plugs and it gives
you an extra 1.7 meters so that solves
the issue
Kingston has also targeted the Stinger
for multi-platform compatibility which
means you should be able to hook this up
to your Xbox one or ps4 controller or
any mobile device that accepts a 3.5
millimeter headphone / mic input once
again pretty smart approach for making
the included cable shorter the
microphone quality is surprisingly good
for the price I'm actually recording
this directly to my phone so you can get
a rough idea of how it sounds like on a
mobile device it doesn't sound too harsh
or muffled or as it's more clear and
audible so the person on the other end
won't have an issue hearing you they
have built in some noise cancelling
characteristics and it works as it
should I have my office fans along with
my system fans running in the background
and it does a pretty good job isolating
them let's move on to sound quality and
right off the bat I was not expecting
such a great sound quality coming out of
these headphones especially since they
cost $50 there's more emphasis on the
bass which is perfect if you're into FPS
titles
I played overwatch and the newly
released Gears of War 4 for PC and I'll
admit I felt like I was immersed in the
game because of the wide soundstage and
extra low-end power from gunshots the
high ends were fine-tuned for casual
listening but the mids were taken over
by the low ends this is strictly a
gaming headset and once again I can't
emphasize how great it sounds for the
price
the z9 neo-byzantine all the right
features on a budget with a large window
side panel five included fans and the
excellent interior layout with super
simple cable management get it now link
in the description below so there you
have it those are my thoughts on the
Kingston HyperX gaming headset they nail
the design the build quality and sound
for the price plus the added features
like 90-degree rotating ear cups
adjustable steel sliders comforting faux
material on both the ear cups and
headband plus built-in volume controls
is much appreciated but they don't have
any built-in lighting controls which is
totally fine with me because I'm not
going to be looking at them while gaming
the multi platform support is a bonus
feature and for those of you looking for
a pair of gaming headsets that can go
along well with your Xbox one or ps4
controller should consider this in fact
as I mentioned in the beginning if you
have less than $60 to spare on a gaming
headset the Stinger will not disappoint
any bar with hurricane axe thank you so
much for watching and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
