hard-working ox review the most
anticipated 2012 chassis is finally here
starting the year with cool masters new
addition to the cosmos series here is
the cosmos 2 ultra tower the aesthetic
design still maintains the cosmos style
with some slight refinements to keep up
with the current market demands but it
still feels and looks like a cosmos case
with its smooth curves and an elegant
appeal just like the rest of the cosmos
series this cosmos 2 is made for gamers
and enthusiasts who want to utilize most
of the available features and functions
to build a high-end Xtreme machine the
cosmos 2 is being released at a whopping
price of $350 and should be available in
early January with cool masters
excellent reputation within the
enclosure market let's find out if the
cosmos - deserves the attention it has
been receiving the primary construction
is a mix between aluminum mesh and
plastic for the exterior and a steel
frame for the body and as you can tell
the case is gigantic and weights a hefty
47 pounds however it's very simple to
transport with the aluminum rail handles
at the top attached directly to the
steel frame and are able to withstand
the weight of a fully loaded system the
case is also elevated by similar
aluminum rails at the bottom to keep the
style uniform now starting on the front
panel the integrated fan controller and
the power buttons are purposely hidden
behind this light cover this where we
have the power and reset buttons with
hard drive activity lights and a fan
controller for dedicated fans around the
system now the button layout and design
reassemble a cell phone pad or a
high-end remote and looks quite unique
for the front panel of a case with this
metallic finish it supports up to 9 fans
with all the cables labelled to aid
during assembly however we would have
liked to see these cables and black with
small colored tabs to distinguish from
one another just to keep things uniform
and you also have the LED cables that
allow you to control the lighting from
the front panel however not all fans
have the LED connector leaving
unnecessary cables in the back to deal
with the LED on each of the buttons
indicates the speed of the fans blue for
slow purple for medium and red
for high-speed right below that is our
audio eSATA port 2 USB 3 &amp;amp; 4 USB 2 port
the USB 3 ports connect through an
internal 20 pin cable and unfortunately
cool master does not provide the USB 2 2
USB 3 and after leaving the ports and
used in case you do not own a compatible
motherboard now we've seen a lot of case
manufacturers leaving this adapter out
of the accessories and we believe it
should become a standard to include the
adapter if the case is USB 3 ready
moving on the aluminum front cover is
held on by magnets and slides down to
open sort of a cool feature to create
this robotic look this is where we have
three five and a quarter inch removable
base allowing excellent addition of two
hot-swap base with a locking mechanism
and a removable dust filter for the
front intake fans next up the side
panels on the cosmos are covered in
brushed aluminum and have plenty of
venting on either side now the side
panels don't slide off as usual and
require no fiddling around with screws
but instead they open up to 90 degrees
and side panels can be completely taken
off just by lifting them off this is
something that works really well in
practice if you want to do a quick
modifications for the inside without
taking off the side panel but needs
extra room for the door to open and if
the chassis is placed on the desk or in
small confined space it is not very
ideal and may get frustrating at the
back of the case we have water cooling
holes exhaust fan IO area 10 PCI
expansion slots plus an extra vertical
one for any additional accessories and a
bottom mounted power supply with the PSU
bracket with a removable dust filter
right underneath the top panel has a
built in dust filter and this is where
the chassis would be appealing to water
cooling enthusiasts the cosmos 2 has
native triple radiator support with
enough room for push and pull
configuration something expected with
the case this size alright enough with
the exterior let's check out the core of
the cosmos first the optical drive base
used to list mounting mechanism below
which to hot-swap base are mounted
next up is the hard drive cage which has
support for five drives with support for
2.5 drives as well below that dual 120mm
fan bracket is installed to cool the
second hard drive cage for support of
additional six drives the power supply
platform is raised and has rubberized
surface to reduce vibration the PSU
bracket is removable with four thumb
screws which aren't exactly easy to get
to and is attached on to your power
supply and back into the case ok and
finally a fairly large CPU cutout with
plenty of cool Master's rubber grommets
for an easy and organized cable
management which is needed to sort out
all these front panel connectors now
being such a large case the airflow and
the cost must do is well thought out for
any enthusiast set up and included - 100
millimeter front intake fan to cool the
top chamber mounting for and optional
120mm fan onto the hard drive cage for
extra cooling potential with included
140 millimeter exhaust fan for the back
and either triple 120 millimeter fans
set up for the top or dual 140
millimeter or a single 200-million air
fan is supported and the bottom chamber
is really well ventilated with included
dual fans for the bracket and if needed
another 120 millimeter fans can be
installed as front intake for the bottom
chamber now the fans on the bracket are
held on by clips to reduce the hassle of
working with screws however the clips
allow the fan to wobble a little bit and
may cause unwanted noise if high speed
fans are installed look in the back of
the chassis with plenty of room for
wiring with cable tight mounting spread
out in just the right places alright
let's see some of the modular options
for the cosmos first the top hard drive
cage can be removed either to have less
resistance for the airflow or
installation of water cooling components
next up is the bottom chamber which can
house a dual radio first we need to
remove the fan bracket and after several
screws remove the bottom cage completely
as part of the accessories radiator
brackets are included which are needed
for mounting the rod onto the bottom
chamber it is mounted vertically with
plenty of room for
simple configuration and tubing can be
passed through the rubber grommets into
the top chamber now speaking our
accessories an 8 pin cable extension
along with some cable management zip
ties and clips are included with two
pairs of keys for the hot-swap base
alright we are almost ready for assembly
but one more thing to mention more
cooling can be added through the side
panel this isn't a tool approach
requires to remove screws and mounted
dual 120 millimeter fans onto the part
of the side panel these sit directly the
Bottomley motherboard and they're meant
to cool your graphics cards now as
expected assembling a system into such a
large case is no problem we really like
the tools hard drive bays and the
optical drives support for long video
cards is no sweat either with top hard
drive gauge in place 15 point 5 inches
is available which is more than enough
to house the longest video card on the
market at the time of this review also
the cable measured making sure you can
get your system up and running fast and
most importantly clutter-free is the
case here absolutely breeze and can be
completed in no time the cosmos chassis
have always stood out with its elegant
appeal and enthusiasts craving
possibilities as the enclosure market
gets more and more competitive those who
have the edge in design and really
understand what makes a practical yet
unique case will attract consumers
interests with that said Coolermaster
seems to be heading into the right
direction with the cosmos - alright
let's wrap this up the cosmos - has
class and we love the stylish and
elegant design the chassis that speaks
quality with the steel frame and
aluminum accents on the exterior with
much of the possibilities to suit many
needs for both air and water cooling
especially the native triple rad support
at the top is absolutely a must and
lastly the cable management with rubber
grommets and separate chambers for
hardware division is well-thought-out
and any user will appreciate it however
a couple of useful functions backfire
like the opening in the side panel while
useful for quick check ups they require
to be at least at 45 degrees before they
can be lifted off and may require more
work than intended and we also found the
PSU bracket thumb screws placement a
little awkward and
hard to get to but for the overall
package cool masters new cos plus two is
a damn good case and that wraps up a
review of the cosmos - thank you guys
for watching a we'll see you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
