great technology selection and service
the gtx 980ti was announced eight months
ago and since then we have seen
countless custom designs one of which is
the gigabyte gtx 980ti g1 gaming this
card is actually priced within a few
dollars of a reference design which
could make it a good value for those
looking for an alternative to an
expensive Titan X or a different higher
priced gtx 980ti
specs wise you're looking at a GM 200
core with a base clock of eleven ninety
megahertz that boosts to 1279 megahertz
six gigabytes of gddr5 memory and a
memory speed of seven gigahertz having
looked at these numbers we are expecting
to run the neck to neck with MSI's gtx
980ti gaming 6g which is about the same
specs but costs a bit more from a
physical standpoint gigabytes lineup of
gtx 980ti cards may be a bit confusing
in order of performance there's the
reference version the wind force the g1
gaming in today's review and the extreme
cards we saw at CES this year however
the overall design and component choices
on these cards share a lot of
similarities the heatsink is the same
Albie Utley g1 receives some metallic
finishes on the frame and like the other
gtx 980ti is in the Gigabyte line-up it
also happens to be one of the longest
980ti is on the market the wind force 3x
cooler makes a comeback here with 380
millimeter fans blowing air onto an
extremely long heatsink the reason why
they expanded horizontally is pretty
straightforward it offers a much greater
area where air can freely move through
the heatsink which in turn allows the
car to remain within dual slot
tolerances on the side you'll find the
word wind force and two flanking stop
indicators gigabyte has implemented
start/stop fan technology so when the
card is utilized in low load scenarios
the stop areas will glow a dull blue to
indicate the fans are adult meanwhile
when the workload switches to something
like gaming the fans spin up and the
wind force logo will begin to glow with
any color chosen from within gigabytes
OC grew to software sweet
the g1 backplate receives a thicker
aluminum cover with a few strategically
placed ventilation slots this blends in
perfectly with the rest of the cards
design and provides an extremely clean
look for any builds with a windowed case
this card takes power we had to eight
pin connectors which have been
seamlessly blended into the heatsink as
the gabite wanted to achieve an optimal
heatsink design the IO consists of a
pair of DVI outputs along with three
full size display ports and a single
HDMI port gigabyte calls it their Flex
display interface since it gives users
the ability to push a display signal to
as many as five monitors without
adapters or daisy chaining basically
you're getting an extra DVI port but one
that only carries a 1080p signal since
the second DVI connector is not dueling
compatible gigabytes revised OC guru ii
software is nothing that exciting except
you get a complete set of LED controls
these adjust the color brightness and
behavior of the windforce logo on the
side that we talked about earlier from
our testing the fans on the g1 gaming
card idle for about two minutes during
full load and then ramp things up but
they never reach extreme levels or even
particularly audible levels in fact the
speeds never go too far above the values
from the Strix OC that's pretty
impressive I have good news for
temperatures as well the trial fans kick
in when the heat rises up under load but
it levels around the sixty six degrees
Celsius mark this not only allows plenty
of room for overclocking but it shows
how efficient gigabites design really is
acoustics have always played well with
gigabyte cards as it keeps quite well
with the competition as you can see the
g1 gaming hovers around 33 decibels idle
and 41 decibels under load it also
consumes less power compared to the
monstrous ZOTAC 980ti app and the Strix
980ti
OC which is great news and now on to the
best part gaming performance we see it's
sandwiched right in between the MSI
980ti 6g and the EVGA 980ti superclocked
plus in most of our 1440p tests this is
to be expected as the specs that come
out of the box are again between both of
these cards
switching to 4k and the results are here
and there the g1 does a little better
than the MSI and EVGA cards in most
games but surprisingly it got closer to
the zotac amp as well we have been able
to overclock most gtx 980ti cards to
somewhere between the fourteen hundred
megahertz and fifteen hundred megahertz
marks
however gigabytes cards does happen to
move itself into the upper echelons by
attaining a core speed of fifteen ten
megahertz while the memory topped out at
close to eight thousand megahertz but
what's really interesting are those
temperatures at 60% fan speed which is
ridiculously quiet the GM 200 core hits
just 58 degrees C and sat there for the
entire time that is phenomenal we have
come across a lot of nanni DT eyes and
the g1 is just another addition
performance wise it keeps up quite well
with the competition to name some the
msi 980ti 6g and the EVGA 980ti super
clock plus but what surprised us was the
thermal and acoustic performance the
wind force cooler is still one of the
best around and it's totally worth
considering over the reference card from
Nvidia in the grand scheme of things
this card also provides a pretty good
value if you're looking for a ultra
high-end gaming solution and for that
we're giving it the Harbor connects damn
good award so that concludes our review
of the gigabyte gtx 980ti
g1 gaming graphics card let us know your
