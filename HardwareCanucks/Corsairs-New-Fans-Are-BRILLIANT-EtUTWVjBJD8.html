we have some some insider information
about what's coming oh my goodness look
who we find always fun to run into
people J and then we're like hey my
condolences ya see or you quickly ran
away they were discussing how I Love You
Jay
don't hate me so we're about to go into
this room to look at some amazing
Corsair fans okay so this is an
interesting fan wall from Corsair so
these are the new light Lube ll RGB fans
the cool thing about these first of all
they use you can see the stickers are
not misaligned and I did double check so
they just ordered 40 fans to have this
sort of fan setup and none of them are
misaligned it's beautiful everything is
centered in the fans it doesn't look
like the blades are wobbling so they
come in both 120 and 140 mm letter sizes
and ll stands for light loop so they
have two sets of Paley RGB LEDs one
interior and one on the exterior so you
can create so many multiple color
effects and that's why we have this
giant fel fan wall over here and so you
can basically light up the interior in a
different color and different speed and
different effect and do the same for the
exterior for really like total control
of your RGB nests inside a case looks
really awesome and I would say like one
of the better fan integrations when it
comes to RGB so one of my questions
regarding the connection of the fans is
that you don't want to be dealing with
too many connections and hubs and wires
but these ll fans come with
two hubs so one like a fan controller
with two which you can connect six fans
and then another hub that will actually
control the lighting and then we'll go
into the motherboard so you need these
two hubs in order to have the full
control of the RGB so just keep that in
mind an aside from this giant fan wall
we have another one so these are 120 140
Mills and these are the mlpro RGB fans
which are using the magnetic levitation
bearing so the magnetic bearing reduces
the friction of the fan so they're more
high-performance they can spin faster
and they're more quiet and they only
have the four RGB and these also
launched recently so it seems like this
whole fan configuration from Corsair you
can really go all out of regardless of
how you see pleased how you how was that
sentence hold on a second how can I save
this regardless of how you see fit
ah there we go that's the one and guys
check this out this is their new h1 15 I
Pro they're our new all-in-one color so
this is a two eighty millimeter radiator
with that nice and thin pump that has
360 RGB and obviously RGB in the front
too and the second one that's like the
bigger one that you guys already see in
the vlog this is the H 150 I Pro so a
360 mono all-in-one cooler and again the
features the same RGB design on the pump
quite flexible tubing and as you can see
over there it does not interact with the
RAM slots so that's awesome and so the
the 360 element are cool slightly better
than the 280 by a few degrees but
obviously these this new series is
targeted more for a slightly bigger
sizes so you notice there's no 240 or
smaller radiator sizes but I'm expecting
that to happen sometime in the future so
what would be the reasoning behind the
naming scheme so we're going from H 159
through H 150 how was that where's that
jump what happened there well we have a
three sixty millimeter radiator since
our largest radiator ever
to be a higher obviously gonna remove it
he's almost dead you've got the red
battery flash of death go okay we got
the coolers done we got Paul in the
video I'm Rachel to sleep me too
are you gonna go to car no it's not a
bed
MindTree more cultured all right so
that's all the cooling from Corsair all
these individuals are in this frame as
well so let me know what you think of
the RGB frame frames and our full review
on the new coolers the 360 all in one
and Tweety are coming very soon so
subscribe for that thanks for watching
this short Bowl CES coverage of Corsair
we'll see you in the next video it's
better than going like going like this
you know it is it is a fun suite because
three people working you
where your manners</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
