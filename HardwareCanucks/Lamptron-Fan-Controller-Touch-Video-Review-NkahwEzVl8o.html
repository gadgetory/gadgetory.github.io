Tron fan controller touch now fan
controllers have been around for a long
time and up until very recently their
general design and functionality hasn't
changed all that much but more recently
the touch screen trend has been catching
on and fan controller makers like lamp
Tron have seen this as an opportunity to
be able to update and expand a very
stagnant market so here it is the lamp
Tron FCT as you notice on the front of
the box there are six channels and each
is able to handle up to 30 watts which
means you're gonna be able to hook up
just about everything in your case some
of its other key features are the CNC
milled aluminum faceplate so it's not an
ugly eyesore on your case and obviously
the touch screen capabilities now this
device retails for $69.99 which makes it
a little bit of an expensive way to
control and monitor your fans and
temperatures so let's open things up and
see if it's worth it lamp tron has
included a product catalog and you can
see they're not new to computer
accessories or fan controllers for that
matter there's a lot of other options if
this one you know doesn't suit your
tastes they've included everything
you'll need to get the controller setup
including screws a molex power adapter a
half dozen fan extension cables six
temperature probes
and of course the head unit now the unit
fits right into a single five and a
quarter inch drive Bay you can see the
solid aluminum front plate
very classy looking the fan screen
itself has a bit of a matte tone and
this helps to reduce noticeable
fingerprint marks and it's also
partially due to the durable material
used at the back you can see this will
be a pretty easy setup on the right side
we have all of the temperature probe
connections as well as an alarm function
jumper and the power connection you can
also see the six fan connections all
have very serious capacitors tied to
each individual channel moving on to the
actual setup of the controller it is
actually very simple obviously users
will be doing this inside of the case
but this is just for demonstration
you'll need a molex power connection
which you can attach to the extension
cable if needed also make sure you
install the temperature probes into the
corresponding channel of the fan you
want to control there's a good foot and
a half of length to these so you should
be able to fit them anywhere and if you
need there are fan extension cables
otherwise you can just plug them
directly into the head unit now if your
fan has a molex connection just make
sure to use a simple molex to three pin
fan header adapter which should come
with most fans or just pick up one from
your favorite retailer so now that we
actually have everything hooked up it's
time to explore the lamp Tron FCT touch
interface it's both simple looking and
simple to use just a monotone color
scheme and the primary screen here
allows us to individually select any of
these six attached fans starting off
with our first one the bar adjustment at
the bottom lets us set the speed in
increments of 1% using the touch slider
however the touch controls can be a bit
difficult to master especially when
attempting to set the speed within its
top or bottom 10% depending on what kind
of stats you're looking for the RPM
display can be changed to show volts and
the temperature switched from Celsius to
Fahrenheit
one of the highlights of the lambtron
device that you won't find on a lot of
more basic units is the automatic
control option for each fan we can
individually set profiles based on
temperature when we set a fan to
automatic mode we can go in and set the
temperature threshold that we want
detected by the corresponding probe then
we adjust the fan speed which will act
as the default so our fan will operate
at its set default speed until the
temperature goes over what we've set
after that the fan ramps up to a hundred
percent until the temperature drops back
down in this way we can control the
temperature of the PC without any
interference and because it's done on a
fan by fan basis we can even set
different cooling zones for different
areas of the case lastly a very welcome
improvement is this controllers
exceptional viewing angles whether it's
from a vertical extreme or a complete
180 degree sideways angle in fact
probably the only time you won't be able
to see the screen is if you're behind it
and that is the lamp Tron fan controller
touch there is no getting around the
fact that it's $70 it's a pretty hefty
investment for a fan controller but for
your money you are getting one of the
more powerful and intuitive devices on
the market it's constructed very well
and the features like having six
channels with 30 watt outputs definitely
justify the price
unfortunately the key aspect of the
device was also where it had its one
strike against it while the touch screen
was amazingly quick and very responsive
it could have used a little more
refinement because the controller is
utilizing a small screen it has
relatively small function buttons found
it a bit difficult to make adjustments
and more often than not I would wind up
having to repeat my actions a few times
over trying to pull up the right fan or
adjust speeds then again once you have
the automatic mode set up everything
becomes very hands-off and that's our
look at the lap tron fan controller
touch I hope you enjoyed our product
showcase and make sure to subscribe we
have plenty coming up
the next little while that I'm sure
you're really going to enjoy see you
