hurricane axe welcome to another video
based on the many many comments I've
received and also wanted to do this
myself is to compare the SV for the
elite from ends XP with a p400s tempered
glass Edition from fan bags but in order
to make this a little bit more
interesting for the Battle of the best
mid tower
I decided to include two more cases the
defense fee from fractal design and the
be quiet pure base 600 so let the battle
the best mid tower be again raster
message my sponsor of course
Coolermaster master keys keyboard lineup
is now available in three sizes to fit
within your space with large medium and
small boards with either beautiful RGB
or pure white LED illumination a little
something for everyone make it yours
with the master keys Pro by Cooler
Master alright so I chose these four
towers because they share a similar
price points which is define see being
the cheapest of the bunch but without a
tempered glass so take that into account
while the p400 STG is very old priced to
be competitive 89 bucks and yesterday
for the elite alongside the pure bass
600 TG are both $99 only two of the
cases have value-added accessories so
the NZXT puck is included on the s3 for
the elite I love this thing as the
headphone stand its magnetic it's
awesome or if you think of creative ways
to handle your cables while the p400 STG
comes with a magnetic RGB strip that
connects directly to the case lighting
and matches the illuminated text at the
front either the fractal no the be quiet
case offer any goodies but the pure bass
600 is the only case in this round up
with five and a quarter inch drive bass
rest in peace
it is a mobile tow and needs to be off
to make room for a 2-14 or radiator the
glass melt does not vary they all use a
similar for thumb screw method with
rubber protectors the perimeter of the
glass on fantex and NZXT cases are
blacked out to hide the frame and help
to conceal fingerprints which is a major
positive while the glass on the be quiet
case is fully transparent throughout so
you can see the frame underneath
however the be quite glass panel is the
only one backwards compatible with non
TG Edition cases I would consider that a
positive however you know they don't
sell the panel by themselves so
yeah it's a shame that fractal design
hasn't released anything with glass yet
as the fine see is still one of my
favorite mid towers but design wise
there's something for everyone from this
pure boxy frame on the s340 with the
matte surface on the metal panels that
look super clean
to this Iron Man mask look on the p400s
with some character with those accents
and ventilation ports while both the
pure bass 600 and fine C are basically
derivatives of their predecessors with
brushed plastic texture on the front on
both cases with a staple blue LED on the
defined C and orange outlines on a PB
600 when it comes to color ends exp is
leading the pack to offer diverse
interior and exterior styles fantex is
catching up with a slightly different
approach with accident pieces like DCI
brackets and Drive covers while be quiet
sticks to their orange brand color with
the rubber pieces standing out also
available in black and grey while
fractal design is limited to black only
size wise there is some variance as 340
being tallest your base 600 being the
longest and defined C is the smallest
case which is super impressive as it can
do as much as the others a simple trick
here what they've done are to create
shorter K speeds that allows the main
frame to be slightly extended in height
there are seven PCI slots per case and
neither of them are too large and should
comfortably fit for on desk use the IO
also varies they all cover the basics of
2 USB 3 ports and audio jacks
but the s 340 is superior with 4 years D
ports and an HDMI pass-through for VR
and other things and you route that
cable through the opening in the back
nice and simple the p400s has a fan
controller in the front for three fans
alongside a color switch button for case
lighting still this is one of the best
implementations we've seen spork'
sliding the be quiet case also has a fan
controller with three speed settings but
nothing special on defined C aside from
those blackouts USB 3 ports now let's
start cooling each of these cases comes
with two fans only the be quiet case has
a 140 member fan all others are 120
millimeter the front intake is almost
identical so by default each case
supports dual 120 and 140 ml fans with
their respective radiators and the
framed here very open with flexible
mounting strips and only recently we
start seeing the removable front piece
on a shroud for installation of larger
radiators at the front so both the p400s
and the define see have this feature to
support 360 level radiators with this
option to slide the drive cage on define
see away from the front to create that
clearance without compromising on the
drive cage itself while you can only
remove the drive cage on a p400 if you
go this route the front desk folders are
also set up quite differently
so both the SP 40 elite and define see
have large dust filters right against
the fans but with side ventilation
openings on define C and top to bottom
of things on the s 340 while the big
wise and fantex cases have filters on
the ventilation force themselves and
we'll see if that makes a difference in
cooling later on as for airflow at the
top the s 340 has a single mount no dust
filter here while the p400s has the
standard dual 120 140 mounts with either
plastic covers or dust filters the same
that is found and defined si but with a
single piece spanning this area with
dust filter included while the be quiet
case has a different approach altogether
with that top panel letting users raise
it without removal so you don't need a
dust filter here and airflow can exit
freely giving you used low rpm fans and
although all these the top fan mounts
are really meant for fans only as height
restrictions on these mid towers with
limit radiator clearance especially if
you using
tall Ram Kim's I do appreciate the
captive some screws of all the metal
side panels but the define see is the
first case in a really long time where
all the thumb screws were tightened just
right without me needing to you know
take out my screwdriver
unlike the impossible to remove by hand
some screws on pretty much all other
cases power supplies s daughters are all
here removal from the back except for
the defined see that conveniently
removes from the front on the inside
we've got some similarities with regards
to the power supply shroud except for a
more traditional layout on the be quiet
case and they sure need to add a shroud
on their neck
case the most functional shroud lives on
the s340 because cable cutouts are all
in the right places including the ones
for the GPU cables there are three SSD
caddies to show a few drives with a side
mount that is oriented properly with
good spacing for SATA cables while the
shroud and define C is a bit more simple
with a bit of this angular frame near
the top with just ventilation openings
from the bottom chamber the lack of
cutouts for the GPU cables might have
been on purpose but in some instances it
might look cool and we find the same
thing on the p400s with just ventilation
holes no additional cutouts except on
the ones underneath the motherboard the
s340 is the only case that doesn't have
any rubber grommets because the frame is
supposed to hide your cables and these
plastic clips are fine to hold small
cables but they surely are not good for
tightening your 24-pin for example or
just bundling up a mess in there the
p400 is better as it comes with velcro
straps that are easier to use and let
you tighten things as much as you want
be quiet case is less fun because you
need to do more work with King bowtie
hoops and define C by far handles cable
management the best because of these
dual loop velcro straps and a clever
angled frame on the side of the
motherboard that creates this additional
space where all your cables can fit no
problem for storage the p400s is okay we
have dual SSDs and dual hard drive
brackets on the back with optional drive
bracket to the front where those white
plates are I love the spread of SSDs on
the s340 but the cage underneath is for
hard drives only let sit directly on
metal so it's metal and metal contact
kind of disappointing the pure bass 600
with a more traditional layout fits more
three and a half inch drives that are
removable but they do block the front
intake and the defined C for the size is
amazing with the clever drive gauge and
triple SSD bracket to avoid storage
compromises so the assembly process
between all four is pretty similar all
have the extended moderate standoffs in
the center it's easier to work when
there is power supply shroud in the case
just to hide those cables but there is
one major oversight on a pure base 600
with rubber gram
as my standard ATX board covers up the
main catalyst so I had to route the 24
pin through a different hole but even
worse that SATA area is not even
accessible unless you pull the cables
through the rectangular cutout on the
right and it seems like these rubber
grommets are tailored for slightly
smaller motherboards where they align
perfectly fine so for temperatures I use
my workstation system with a 980ti
6800 K at 4.2 gigahertz cooled by the
coarser h100 I be - with maglev fans in
the front for intake and I kept the two
default fans for rear exhaust so the GPU
remains at 83 C about 52 % speed we just
slight fluctuations around 1,100
megahertz
while CPU temperatures remain basically
the same on a faint extract all and in
the xt cases but with a pretty
significant spike on the big quiet case
most likely due to a more restricted
front intake oh hey there NC XCOM is
Canada's leading etrailer for anything
your mind desires just keep within those
categories which are plenty and be
attempted by the weekly deals visit ncx
dot-com for all them sweet deals and so
there you have each case their own
unique strengths and weaknesses in the
relatively close price bubble so that if
there are sales going on it might not
you is the right direction on what makes
our to choose you know for your next
system make sure it's checkout
individual reviews for all these cases
alongside our case trends video for 2017
on what we want to see from the case
industry moving forward all that is
linked in description below and also I'm
curious to know what you guys feel would
be the winner from this roundup and I
particularly didn't want to label
anything because I would like to see
what you guys want to from a mid tower
so yeah let me know in the comments down
below
I'm going to beat you in our connects I
hope this has been helpful and we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
