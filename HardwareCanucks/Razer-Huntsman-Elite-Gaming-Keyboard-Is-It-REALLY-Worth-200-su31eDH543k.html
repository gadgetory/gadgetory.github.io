Hardwick Canucks and this is razor's top
align most expensive gaming keyboard to
date
it's the razor Huntsman elite let's
check this out all right so judging by
that b-roll you may or may not have
guessed the price tag of the razor
Huntsman elite and if you haven't well
allow me to spoil it for you guys so
this keyboard or this thing right here
costs two hundred US dollars take them
over to swallow that because that isn't
cheap and interestingly enough it
competes head-to-head with Corsairs key
95 RGV platinum mechanical gaming
keyboard for the same cost and if you're
interested in learning more about that
keyboard I've actually done a full
review on the channel and you can check
it out right over here okay so why did
razer come out with such an expensive
mechanical gaming keyboard in 2018 I
mean if you think about it the market is
way too saturated at this point that
makes it quite difficult to
differentiate one keyboard from another
unless if you're looking for a specific
feature well Razer is launching the
Huntsman Elite by focusing on three key
areas and that is speed and performance
with the help of their newly designed
Razer optomechanical switch the second
being comfort and aesthetics and the
last of course being a little bit of
flair with chroma RGB lighting so while
I was testing the Razer Huntsman elite
gaming keyboard I got another
interesting package from Razer in this
large Pelican case not exactly sure what
use it would have been to me but
regardless this is what it is it's
another gaming keyboard but this time
it's their standard Huntsman keyboard
when compared to the elite so the
difference between this keyboard and the
elite is that it doesn't come with
dedicated media playback buttons and it
also does not come with a detachable
wrist rest with the underglow which
we'll talk about later on in the video
but rest aside it's basically the same
keyboard and it comes with the same or
the brand new Razer opto mechanical
switch the
in price one hundred and fifty dollars
versus obviously $200 so let me walk you
through my experience testing out the
razor Huntsman elite right after message
from our sponsor the new OC CTR 200 from
Toshiba is a great value SSD if you're
considering upgrading a hard drive and
get a nice boost in performance with
cutting-edge 3d flash memory and ultra
reliable controller with built-in power
management available in different
capacities check it out below first
things first the design and run at the
bat the Huntsman elite does look like a
typical mechanical keyboard there are no
signs of aggressive design elements
throughout the chassis and I like that
it is a full-size keyboard with a numpad
and they've tried their best to make it
as compact as they can in fact it's
about the same size as the Logitech G
513 keyboard that I looked at recently
now when you compared this to something
like the kii 95 platinum it's obviously
a little bit smaller because with Razer
you don't get dedicated macro buttons
which is disappointing and the top side
of the frame is a bit extended on the K
95 because you've got the RGB logo
interestingly enough I was not able to
spot any Razer branding on the huntsmen
elite apart from the subtle and great
implementation on the wrist rest which
I'll get to shortly on the top
right-hand side of the board Razer has
included dedicated media playback
buttons which is good use of space but
to be honest I'm not happy with the
button mechanics they feel very cheap
when compared to the K 95 platinum and
they're not backlit seriously Razer I
mean there are subtle LEDs under the
keys but they don't shine through the
sign to illuminate them it just doesn't
make any sense
Corsair does a much better job with
their playback buttons the volume down
on the huntsmen elite lacks definition
in terms of scroll steps
I went adjusting the volume it doesn't
feel consistent and feels like scraping
the plastic underneath which might sound
odd but again it just doesn't feel right
to me now by default the dog can be used
to control the volume but razer calls it
the multifunction digital dial and it
can be customized to another function
like switching between apps or zooming
into windows or even launch apps of
utility focused applications like
snipping tool notepad calculator or even
task manager remember this has to be
done through synapse but I did wish a
razor gave us the option to assign
third-party applications needless to say
this
is a cool feature that you might be
interested in but personally I still
prefer the default volume adjust and I'd
love to hear your thoughts on this
multifunction dial in the comments down
below this keyboard also comes with a
wrist rest and it is an expectation of
this price point the plush a leather ID
material is really comfortable to type
with in fact it's very similar to the
one found on the g5 13 by Logitech
Albion the one on the Razer is just a
bit bigger than the g5 13 it's like
pillows for your wrists and who doesn't
like that and if you're looking for a
WOW factor check this out the wrist rest
features under glow RGB lining and it
syncs up with the lighting on the
chassis to give out this cool subtle
lighting effect in the night and it
looks amazing
seriously Razer has always amazed me
with chroma lighting on their
peripherals the color shift gradient is
so smooth and it's quite mesmerizing to
use at and during the night now for
those of you wondering the wrist rest is
detachable and it connects to the shaft
C via proprietary pogo pins for power in
fact the Razer had to use a separate USB
cable to just power the keyboard and the
underglow at first I thought that this
cable was for a USB pass-through port
but that's not the case here speaking of
USB pass supports there are none to be
found on the huntsmen elite which is
unacceptable for a two hundred dollar
gaming keyboard now coming back to the
Pogo pin connectors located at the
bottom of the chassis and of course the
wrist rest razor is actually working or
they're planning on working with
third-party vendors to create other
accessories like a wireless phone
charging dock or perhaps a tablet that
could just connect your keyboard again
I'm not exactly sure where they're
taking this approach with but personally
I'm a little bit skeptic about that
because the fact that you might have to
attach or if you're looking to attach
accessories underneath the chassis would
obviously result in clearance issues
with your wrist or your hands and of
course reaching those keys because you
want to be able to get your you the most
important thing when you're gaming is
just having a comfortable space to game
on and if you start adding accessories
especially you know in the middle of
your hands then it just doesn't make any
sense it might be a concerning factor
for some of you but again I'm more
curious to see what they're going to be
coming up with in the future if they do
the cable is non durable it's super
thick and
abraded it was actually a little bit
difficult for me to brown on my desk it
kind of feels similar to the Corsair k95
platinum RGB mechanical keyboard so
don't expect you know removal cable
coming out this keyboard because
obviously there's a lot of bandwidth to
drive the chroma lighting on the
keyboard and of course getting that
information passed back and forth
between the controller and so yeah
that's something to keep note of the
build quality on the huntsmen elite is
really good they've used a matte black
aluminum frame on top of hard plastic
materials it's pretty durable for
long-term use and the body itself is
quite heavy and I noticed that right
away after switching from my G pro Tek L
keyboard now this isn't something to be
worried about because the keyboard by
itself is going to be stationary at your
desk for the most part so I don't see
this as a problem okay so let's talk
about razors new optomechanical switch
the technology behind the switch design
is pretty interesting they've
essentially harnessed optical light
instead of traditional metallic contacts
to make keystrokes actuate so a light
beam passes through the switch stem and
when a key is pressed the corresponding
signal is being sent to the computer at
that instant this yields in 45 grams of
actuation force and an actuation point
at 1.5 millimeters not put this in
perspective the Cherry MX speed switches
requires the same amount of force but it
actually it's at just one point two
millimeters so it's 0.3 millimeters
faster than the Razer opto switches and
they're linear too with the razor's new
offering you're getting a satisfying
tactile click kind of like MX blue
switches but expect a faster typing
experience that them so if you're
someone who owns a mechanical keyboard
with cherry MX blue switches and if
you're looking for something a little
bit more faster without compromising on
that tactile feedback the clicky feel if
you get then the Razer optomechanical
switches should be a great option to
look into simply because you still get
that tactile feedback and they're a lot
lighter to actuate when compared to MX
blue that's for sure Oh
another cool advantage is that the
keystrokes or they're actually lot more
durable so razor claims that these
things can these new switches can last a
hundred million keystrokes compared to
50 million on the Cherry MX and
offerings so that could be taken as
admitted as an advantage for long term
use but again that's something to be
tested over time now having tested the
key
95 RGB platinum here in the studio I can
still watch for the fact that the MX
beat switches are by far the fastest
switches ever made if you're someone who
is looking for a keyboard with the
fastest possible switch with all the
exclusive features that you need like
dedicated keys and stuff like that then
looking into MX speed on the K 95 is
obviously your best bet because they're
fast I don't think you can find anything
I mean the Optus which is come there
were nowhere closer to the experience
when you're using the K 95 platinum or
mxp switches in general razer also
claims that the new optomechanical
switch can save up to 20 milliseconds of
delay for each keystroke due to the
optical light that it uses to actuate
now I can scientifically test that but
in real world use it just performs like
a standard mechanical keyboard I was
pretty quick at getting used to these
switches and the tactile feedback is
certainly satisfying here's a quick
sound test
okay so gaming on the huntsmen elite was
good I was certainly not mind blown by
the performance of these new switches I
like I mentioned before they feel very
similar to Cherry MX blue offerings with
the exception of requiring less force to
actually so finger fatigue shouldn't be
a problem
over long-term use I was easily able to
not get through my gameplay and overall
it was a pleasant experience Razer
synapse actually recognizes certain
titles and eliminates the lost keys
depending on the type of play
it just helps differentiate your primary
keys with the rest ok so I do want to
spend some time and talk about Razer
synapse 3 software that comes with this
new keyboard or just any Razer
peripherals first and foremost I really
hate the fact that you're supposed to
create an account and be connected
online in order to create this whole
initial set of process and the fact that
you need to be connected online just to
access controls is a bit weird it's so I
mean it doesn't make any sense in the
first place
again it's a sloppy job by the software
team by Razer I'm not sure why they
require users to create an account with
synapse I mean I get the fact that you
can get to sync your staff
across all these devices but give us an
offline mode I mean give us the give
users the option at the very beginning
of the setup screen where you can choose
to either use online or offline because
I certainly wasn't able to find that
with synapse so that's a little bit
unfortunate next up the UI it's
definitely improved in terms of visuals
over these years but unfortunately I had
difficult time customizing lighting and
macros on the huntsmen elite a with my
main pc lighting would stop functioning
at times synapse would crash if I change
in effect the keyboard wouldn't do
anything it was pretty frustrating but
thankfully everything just worked fine
after I plugged the keyboard into a
notebook again this could just be my PC
but I just wanted to bring it up
navigating through synapse is fairly
straightforward the user is greeted with
a physical view of the keyboard along
with different modules like being able
to integrate Phillips hue lining once
you click on the keyboard you do have
the option to reprogram each key and
also customize the multifunction dial
that I talked about earlier the lighting
tab allows you to cycle between eight
different lighting effects including
breathing fire reactive ripple spectrum
cycling star light static and wave which
is my personal favorite you can also
just a brightness by either turning it
off or dimming it to a minimum setting
here but that can also be done within
the keyboard through the function keys
speaking of which you have the G key
that disables the Windows key and
on-the-fly macro recordings as well then
there's chromis studio which is a custom
lighting effects control space that
allows the user to create their own
lighting effects and explore their
creativity with RGB lighting do note
that if you have other razer gaming
peripherals like a mouse or set of
speakers with chroma synapse will
automatically detect those devices and
you can sync lighting across those
devices as well which is pretty cool
join the wireless club with Corsairs new
dark core Mouse play the way you want
with nine programmable buttons aligned
in the comfortable shape and fantastic
sensor you can trust and crazy-good
wireless performance plus qi wireless
charging built-in focus on the game the
dark core will do the rest so to
conclude the huntsmen elite by razer is
an odd entry in 2018 in my opinion for
one you can get a lot more for $200 with
a k95 RGB platinum because
there are a few things that I find lack
lasting or just that I find doesn't make
any sense
on Hunt's belly or the fact that they
haven't included for one dedicated
programmable buttons I'm fine that
missing on this keyboard I mean for $200
at this expectation a USB pass-through
port they decided to not include one on
the huntsmen and he dedicated media
playback buttons kind of feel cheap it's
like you have you know a Ferrari of a
keyboard but then you kind of have like
a Prius on our Prius maybe like a Civic
attached to it
I'm not sure if that made a good analogy
but I hope you get the point so that's
something that I found to be really odd
with the hunt smelly it's certainly a
good keyboard for Razer enthusiasts out
there if you're looking for something a
little bit more innovative if you're
looking to try out new switches the new
Optima chemical switch is certainly
interesting because it gives you that
tactile feedback without having to
actuate or put a lot of force into it
compared to MX blues definitely not as
fast as MX beats which is but I'm sure
that you'll have a great time gaming on
these new switches the lighting is of
course fantastic you cannot go wrong
with chroma lighting of course the
detachable wrist rest features RGB
lighting that's next level when it comes
to lighting on a keyboard speaking of
the wrist rest it is super comfortable
to stank with I mean this plush leather
red material is again that's this is
exactly what wrist rests were supposed
to made in first place but I'm glad that
companies like wasteful he's trying to
approach wrist rest with this material
we first saw that with large 6513
keyboard again a fantastic keyboard for
the price at $150 so if you're looking
for something you know within those
lines then again you have the option
within the Logitech G 513 keyboard the
regular razor huntsmen keyboard that
also cause the same price but you don't
get a wrist rest so that's a little bit
behind and of course you have this $200
expensive elite huntsmen keyboard so I'd
love to hear your thoughts on razors new
huntsmen elite keyboard what do you guys
think about it is it worth $200
are you disappointed with the fact that
razor's forgot to included a USB pass
report or dedicated macro buttons or
things like then I'd love to hear your
thoughts again
I mean bar with Harvard Canucks thank
you so much for watching and we'll see
you in the next one
