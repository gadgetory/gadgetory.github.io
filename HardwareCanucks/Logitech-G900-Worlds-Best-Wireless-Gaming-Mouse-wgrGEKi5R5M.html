intro from an older video that applies
to our conversation today perfectly
while wireless mice may not have the
best reputation in the gaming industry
because they simply cannot give us the
same contents as wired nice for gaming
but that soon might change because they
are improving latency is decreasing and
it almost feels like we are gaming with
a wired mouse and they might be coming
good enough for these sunny competitive
arena that's right another gaming
wireless hype surrounding the new
Logitech G 900 I'm positive many of you
are curious if the $149 price point is
justifiable or is totally crazy and I'm
also curious to see if this is the
product that will break that skeptical
barrier for wireless professional gaming
without the wire well let's find out but
first this video is brought to you by
mass job check out an insanely awesome
deal for beautifully crafted and
sounding FASTA headphones each pair will
be unique thanks to the Purple Heart
woodgrain and this is a fantastic way to
enjoy some serious audio sign up to mass
drop comm below and now back to the
mouse review
and so my immediate reaction when I
received the mouse was to compare the
shape and the weight to my daily driver
the g502 and I gotta say the Jean 900
being an ambidextrous Mouse it actually
fits better for good FPS games and
supports more diverse grip styles I
myself having more of a hybrid grip
style so kind of a claw and palm grip
sort of combined together and this fits
me much better for FPS games then the
g502 does especially since the weight of
this mouse is only 107 grams and that is
very important and impressive because
the thing is this has a battery built-in
yet it still weighs 61 grams lighter
than the G 502 and this is possible
thanks to Logitech's new prototype
manufacturing where they they simulate
the weight of the product before things
go into production and I think they were
within one or two grams within margin of
error and that's really cool because
allows them to see exactly what the
materials will wait before production I
would say that lighter mice are
generally more common within the
competitive arena or rather than heavier
mice and to put things in perspective
the G 900 has almost 50% less mass than
the G 502 and this is all things that
new prototype manufacturing where
they've shaved off a bunch of things
where material is not needed the scroll
wheel is the perfect example of that it
still maintains the very nice middle
click which is light enough to press and
very these things scroll steps which I
think is the best scroll wheel on any
Gaming Mouse and infinite scrolling man
still present yet the the mouse wheel is
whole so they were able to remove all
this material that is not needed without
compromising on the quality of the
product now the plastics here are not
anything fantastic they feel ok I do
appreciate the aluminum like additions
at the front here but if anybody is
going to complain about the material or
the cheap feeling Mouse don't because
107 grams with a battery built in they
had to do something in order to make the
mouse feel lighter because you all care
about performance and not exactly how
the material compares to let's say other
cheaper mice now for an ambidextrous
body this is really nice
I still prefer the Zoe fk1 shape-wise
because the primary buttons curved down
a little bit more whereas on the G 900
the buttons are more elevated and
something about that middle finger just
doesn't sit right with me
it's a little too high I wish the
buttons curved down more on topic of
buttons the side buttons are magnetic
letting the user switch between left or
right only operation then you can
populate all the buttons if you prefer
that style or no buttons at all and this
magnetic approach is genius that doesn't
compromise on any of the quality of the
switches and allows proper physical
customization of your play style then we
have the 2 DPI buttons with an LED
behind the scroll wheel then the hyper
scroll enabler and at the bottom there
is the profile switch along with a power
switch for the wireless mode now the
primary on run switches here are
interesting because the switch itself is
installed on a slight angle to
accommodate for the shape of the button
surface allowing you for consistent
click force registration so that means
that they are tested before leaving the
factory to make sure that you have click
force registration that is consistent
across the production of the G 900 where
normally on a standard Mouse you would
have the switch that is flat and you
have the button surface that is angled
pressing a switch on an angle and that
causes inconsistency in click force and
potentially we're wearing out over time
but having said all that the click force
is a bit tougher than the g502
especially with the right click that
makes me you know when I have to double
zoom in cs:go
I cannot do it as fast as I can on the G
502 and that's probably because the
travel distance here is a bit longer
than the G 5 or 2 and also the placement
of my middle finger because the buttons
are not s curved down as I'm more used
to me trying to zero in on a target the
sniper rifle by double clicking the
right button is a bit more difficult
than on my other mice
and there's one thing that I would
change about the body design it would
make the front face of the mouse
slightly more curved so the buttons when
you have your fingers on them or not so
flat but more curved down I think that
would allow you to put less pressure in
order to actually activate the switches
but really the start of the show here is
that sensor so Logitech is using their
own BMW 3366 which is the same sensor
found on the g502 and it actually was
designed to be used for wireless
operation so that's interesting to find
out and they've thrown a bunch of tests
into it to make sure that the wireless
custom 2.4 gigahertz signal isn't
interrupted by anything else to make
sure that your 1000 Hertz or 1
millisecond response time is always spot
on the cable included here is braided it
plugs into the mouse for charging and
data for Wired mode if you prefer that
and I'm really happy that the wireless
receiver here is very tiny this tiny USB
stick that comes with a brick :
that's supposed to ground the USB
receiver but unfortunately it does not
have any adhesive so it will not be
stationary and after calibrating my
Zowie surface to the G 900 I jumped it
to CS go to see if I could feel the
difference between wired and wireless
mode and luckily I could not
and that is very good news because my
aim felt very natural there was no
acceleration there was no weird behavior
in the wireless mode and I'm positive
that this is the mouse that we've been
waiting for that would feel like wired
mouse but without the wire now when it
comes to battery life the mouse is
intelligent enough to go to sleep when
it's idle so with one full week of use
with my macbook pro while traveling I
only dropped to 50% and this is what the
main logo turned off and large the
estimates about 32 hours of battery life
without any lighting and 24 hours of
constant use with lighting turned on
luckily I did not notice any sensor
degradation or signal degradation at
lower battery status so the mouse
performs exactly the same way at 5%
battery as it does with 95% battery and
the signal range is about 5 meters past
that I noticed sensor was not tracking
well there was weird behavior so within
5 meters between the USB receiver and
the mouse you call them moving on to the
gaming software it is wonderful all the
common customization is here even your
layout selector is very handy
then there's the lighting settings for
different profiles even a battery tab to
see how much power is being consumed by
all the components and the remaining
life of the mouse and surface tuning
which is very important so do that right
in the beginning and all that is saved
onto the memory of the mouse so for
concluding remarks the G 900 is the best
wireless mouse on the market right now
which puts sensor performance first
without compromising on the weight the
shape the button customization being in
that memba dextry is designed and the
switchers and scroll wheel is fantastic
the range is great the battery life is
good and the only thing that doesn't
fully sit well with me is the little
curve of the buttons I wish it was
slightly more curved down because I feel
like they would allow to apply less
pressure because my fingers would be
more curved to press them then
- my other mice but that is really the
only little drawback that I can find
otherwise I'm pretty happy and very
comfortable on the G 900 and the price
is also right in line with competing
wireless mice and to me this definitely
deserves the Harbor Canucks damn good
innovative award and so that concludes
the review of the G 900 based on
everything that you saw in her today and
all the gameplay footage that had
provided to you would you trust a
wireless mouse for a competitive you
know arena for shooter or any gameplay
