still getting more and more popular and
guess what that means in 2018 there will
be much more hardware released that
targets the miners who are buying up all
our precious graphics cards now Animax
is launching this the max Titan 1250
watt mining version we don't normally
cover power supplies but the max Titan
is something special but before we get
to that I want to give a huge shout out
to fantex Corsair and coolermaster for
sponsoring our CES 2018 coverage without
them this just would not have been
possible there are a huge number of
challenges when setting up a dedicated
mining rig and the max Titan 1250 want
is meant to address a number of them to
actually make a profit you will need to
carefully balance power consumption heat
and the mining components you end up
choosing the PSU plays a big role in
that equation since using a higher
efficiency unit will lower your
electricity cost and could also increase
the longevity of other system items by
delivering cleaner power the max Titan
addresses the efficiency question by
offering 80 plus titanium certification
which means it is able to deliver about
a hundred percent of the incoming power
to components that's a huge deal for the
mining community provided the initial
buying cost is low enough to make it
worth a while every miner wants to be on
the top of how their components are
behaving and enter max has thought of
that as well by including a power meter
that displays the logs real-time energy
usage with it you'll be able to better
tune a system to deliver a maximum
output while optimizing electricity
needs with eight eight pin GPU
connectors enter max is obviously
targeting minors who are using
power-hungry graphics cards and just in
case things start to get too toasty the
max Titan 1250 has a turbo mode switch
to crank his fan up to 3100 rpm if that
still isn't enough all the components
being used are rated for continual
operation at 50 degrees Celsius enter
max doesn't have a price for this beast
coin yet but I expect it to cost a small
fortune and that will properly lower its
appeal for some miners the max Titan
wasn't the only thing that caught our
attention in the inner max suite they're
also showing off two new all-in-one
coolers the lick tech 2 and lick fusion
240
let's start this off with the lake
fusion the entire intent behind this
thing is to light up your build since it
incorporates 2 TB RGB and more RGB
surround the pump area which have a
control box 10k
your motherboard doesn't have an RGB
header our only concern is the TB RGB
fans are supposed to be tuned for
silence rather than pushing air through
a dense radiator that could cause some
performance drop-offs but we'll know
more once we test it in our lab finally
MMX has their new lick tech 2a i/o on
display as well this is followed up by a
second generation design to the flagship
lick tech that I tested on AMD's tr4
socket not too long ago and it was
pretty impressive back then supposedly
it has been improved even further by
using the shunt channel technology to
boost thermal conductivity and eliminate
heat search the radiator and pump have
also been upgraded
so we expected performance to be even
better personally I like the fact that
AeroMax decided to go with a bit more
subdued RGB LED design on this one it's
well integrated and doesn't scream at
you like the elec fusion does it also
happens to be available in three sizes
240 millimeters to 80 millimeters and
360 millimeters but final pricing hasn't
been announced yet so that wraps up
things here at the animatics booth and
I'd like to know if you are willing to
give their mining power supplies or new
liquid coolers a try as usual stay tuned
for more content from CES 2018 I mean
with hurricane axe thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
