great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
Herick NOx and today we're taking a look
at the thermal take enclosure this is
the Commander g41 this is the windowed
version priced at $69 at initial glance
this looks like it has potential doesn't
it so we've got a large window panel
revealing the entire internals while you
can see a lot of it so like your drive
cage I do still think that it suits the
styling of the g-41 both side panels
protrude slightly allowing additional
clearance for cable management and the
back and symmetrical form on the
opposite window side the top also has a
protruding part that would allow a
little extra clearance for internal fans
so as you can see we have dual 120mm
fans or a single 140 and the 200
millimeter mount one thing to point out
are the dual 120mm ounce the ones
directly in the center would not allow a
240 radiator to be installed as they're
not properly spaced out Howard the
mounting holes offset closer to the side
panel would allow a 240 radiator to be
installed no problem this is an awesome
consideration from thermal take to take
into account for any cabling or tall
motherboard heat sinks one pro moto here
would be the lack of a dust filter so
keep that in mind we have two inches of
clearance before hitting the memory
modules and even the frame itself is cut
to support a top radiator with a set of
fans the front panel continues with this
aggressive appeal with the thermal tech
logo in the center three optical bays
and up top with two USB 3 ports audio
jacks and PR buttons the panel is fully
covered with a dense filter inside so
removing it reveals a single front
intake and here's where I raised a few
eyebrows trying to figure out as to why
thermal take decided on this approach so
we have just one fan intake slot this is
for the bottom drive gauge only it is
heavily restricted so front intake will
be heavily limited and this is where a
second intake fan would come in handy
but unfortunate to us the g-41 does not
support a sec
and front intake fan the top drive cage
is removable
that opens up clearance for longer GPUs
as otherwise on the 11 inches is
available so again a fan mount on the
actual frame would have been perfect to
boost the cooling potential coming to
the back we do have an exhaust fan
included with eight plus one PCI slots
and each side panel is secured with
these thumb screws that are attached
through the panel so you don't displace
them and I would love to see this become
the standard the g-41 stands on quality
tall case feet and underneath the power
supply is a filter that I would love to
see get extinct and updated with a
proper dust filter also notice there's
an optional bottom intake that I would
strongly suggest to utilize as front
intake is non-existent and here's the
strange thing Thermaltake thought to
include a three and a half inch pay
converter and instead omit the things
that actually matter so notice again
missing the s' filter for that bottom
slot with our 117 millimeter power
supply unit a 120mm fans fit no problem
so at least Thermaltake has worked out
the spacing here right as I said earlier
the top drive cage is removable no tools
required we have three draft caddies per
cage with standard mechanical support
and centered SSD mounts a couple of
things I appreciate are the
pre-installed motherboard standoffs that
are always nice to have Plus all the
black cabling for cleaner looking built
there are many cable tie mounts behind
them on the board tray even in the
center there with a full inch of space
to work with and the sleeve at the
bottom to tuck away any of the smaller
cables however there are no rubber
grommets the very bottom cutout I think
is just way too large and the eight pin
CPU cutout is sort of in its wrong place
that is covered by our standard ATX
motherboard completely instead you have
to route the cable through another
cutout up top that is offset in the
center and might actually not have
enough reach for your 8 pin cable as you
can see though the build looks fine
regardless I mean it's easy to work
around the flaws of the case for a clean
system and also the back cables are
under control and this is definitely one
of the things the g-41 does really well
I'm very disappointed that the missed
cooling potential for the front as we've
so gotten accustomed to seeing dual
front intake fans so this case has a lot
of missed opportunities that I honestly
wasn't expecting even at this price
point and so to conclude the command of
g41 is not the complete letdown
I love the large side panel window and
properly thought out top water cooling
support both quality of the frame is
excellent without the severe flexing
we've been seeing in cases lately I'm
talking to you through 30 T from Corsair
and ntek T 100 modular drive cage is
appreciated especially for the extra
clearance for those long GPUs however I
can't stand the fact that there is no
support for a second intake fan and the
front and the one included for the
bottom drive gauge is completely choked
by the frame there's no proper dust
filters neither on the top nor the
bottom plus the missing rubber grommets
and that 8 pin CPU cutout is in a poor
location I get this as a budget oriented
enclosure that you can pick up for as
little as $50 in some instances and for
that situations you may look past the
compromises but for $69 I'd say the g41
deserves to stay in the box is there's
just way too many issues that I consider
deal breaking even for a value enclosure
and I would actually recommend the
source 530 from ends XD or the N 600
from Coolermaster that are both within
the same price bracket that just offer
such a better value but what do you guys
think do you agree with me on this or
when you consider the g-41 awardee
