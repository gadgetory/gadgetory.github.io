about an $800 gaming notebook but Dells
new Inspiron 14 and 15 7000 series
gaming notebooks show that you don't
need to spend a fortune for great mobile
performance now before I get too far
into this it is important to remember
that this is an affordable product which
aims to target people who will use it
for much more than just gaming that
means the inspiron gaming series doesn't
have all the features you would expect
from a dedicated gaming system but it's
also far more portable and a lot less
expensive the show coverage is possible
thanks to Nvidia gigabyte fantex and
NCIX the Inspiron 7000 gaming series
will be broken into two different models
one is a 14 inch and the other one is a
15 inch model both of which have some
surprisingly robust specifications for
their price range the 14 inch mount
starts with a quad core for thread KB
Lake I 570 300 HQ processor 16 gigabytes
of 2400 maegor's memory a gtx 1050 4
gigabyte graphics card in 1080p TN
display and a dual drive 128 gigabyte m2
SSD plus a 500 gigabyte hard drive Dells
slightly larger 15-inch model has most
of the same specifications but adds a
gtx 1050 TI 4 gigabyte which grants
about 30% better gaming performance a 1
terabyte hard drive a keyboard numpad
and a slightly larger battery this is
the 799 configuration which means the 14
inch version may actually cost a bit
less when it's officially launched the
option list is actually quite long with
the 14 inch model receiving the
possibility of a gtx 1050 TI for $100
more meanwhile both models will have
configurations that include an 8 thread
i7 7700 HQ processor expanded storage
options higher-end IPS screens in both
1080p and 4k and a backlit keyboard they
will also be available in two colors
matte black with red accents or matte
red with black accents both look amazing
the Inspiron 7000 gaming's exterior is
pretty straightforward with a
well-designed integrated hinge that
keeps thickness 2 under one inch and
gentle curves so the typing and gaming
experience remains comfortable the
finish on the black model does tend to
pick up a few fingerprints but it's
easily cleanable I love the fact that it
looks so stealthy without any loud
colors that you normally
on other gaming focused products the
front edge has two front firing speakers
backed up by downwards fine subwoofer
which sounded pretty acceptable in the
environments that we're in meanwhile the
spill resistant keyboard is pretty basic
with good feedback but don't expect
anything gaming oriented here since
those kind of features are reserved for
Dells Alienware lineup Adele does have
an option to have red backlighting on
some 7000 series gaming configurations
the i/o ports are pretty straightforward
too but I would have loved to see a USBC
connector
however the configuration of three USB
3.0 s
a media card reader a headphone jack and
HDMI 1.4 output and a Gigabit Ethernet
should be more than enough for this
laptops internet market around back
there isn't much happening but there are
two ventilated areas that hide the in
spawns advanced copper heatsink and
allowed for clean air flow after using
the Inspiron 15 7000 gaming for a little
while at the show it seems to perform
very well and even higher in games like
Forza horizon 3 operating at good frame
rates on the 1080p screen it seems like
the GTX 1050 and the gtx 750ti
have more than enough power for these
notebooks it really is amazing to see
how much power Dell has been able to
pack into an inexpensive and pretty
compact design it isn't exactly
lightweight but it's still a great
option for people who want an affordable
notebook they can take to class or use
for portable productivity but also game
on their spare time we expect to have
the Inspiron 7000 gaming for more
complete testing in the near future for
the time being this looks like a very
promising notebook that could help drive
down the cost of entry level gaming
while also increasing the performance
expectations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
