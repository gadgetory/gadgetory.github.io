look slanted to you it's because I
pulled my neck over the weekend so I'll
potentially try to correct it and post
my weird posture but today let's talk
about AMD Radeon because during this
interesting position where the rx 580
which was launched in 2017 is basically
a rebrand of the 480 that is about two
years old now but then the Vega 56 and
the 64 were launched of August of 2017
so almost a year from today but you know
if you were to potentially buy an AMD
card in 2018 does it make any sense
and what's interesting about this lineup
is that we have the RX 580 which is
around $300 and then we have the Vega 56
which is around $500 so there's that
giant gap of $200 and literally nothing
in between from the red team to satisfy
that entire gap price-wise and
performance wise which is where the gtx
1070 comes into play at around $400 so
price-wise it slides right in between
the RX 580 and the Vega 56 I have all
three cards in-house let's do the
benchmarks right after this the new t46
caliber ddr4 memory is one unique RGB
kit with awesome light spill from each
module and the special edition has a
cool totem design on the light bar you
get lifetime warranty up to 4,000
megahertz speeds and full lighting
control through the software check out
the t46 caliber ramp down below now the
reason why we're having this
conversation is because prices for GPUs
have come down the market is stabilizing
prices are still inflated versus launch
prices but they're not as inflated as
they were a year ago because of mining
and so if you are rooting team red then
the RX 580 and the Vega 56 are kind of
like your obvious choices so we have the
Vega 56 pulse from sapphire it's a two
and a half slot card so it's got a beefy
cooler the fans don't spin it has eight
gigabytes of HBM to memory and it is
slightly overclocked verses reference
and then the RX 580 this is the phantom
gaming from azrog so this one's also
overclocked out of the factory by round
95 megahertz
not significant but still nice to have
it's got eight gigabytes of gddr5 memory
and it's a nice compact
cooller so hopefully they perform well
no I will say the dual offense on a Vega
card are located in one of the worst
spots right in the center so routing
your cables in a clean manner is almost
impossible and for the gtx 1070 and have
the founders edition and i'm running all
these cards at stock so let's begin with
the benchmarks now just to cover my
bases I'm only running the benchmarks
for the game stead I'm currently playing
and we're running this on 8700 K at 4.2
gigahertz so there is no CPU bottleneck
with 16 gigabytes of RAM at 3600
megahertz let's begin so starting with
csgo I'm running everything at 1440p and
highest settings you probably won't be
running high settings with this game
because you want to maximize your
framerate but we are achieving almost
250 frames on the GTX 970
but look at how much better the lower 1%
is on the Vega card versus the green
team moving on to Far Cry 5 so the GTX
970 is faster and average but again we
have the same behavior with much better
lower one percent on the Vega card we're
seeing the same behavior with squad so
better lower one percent on the Vega
card but it matches to the GTX 970 for
the average frame rates jumping you to
The Witcher 3 the GTX 970
easily beats the Vega card the same
thing with overwatch so much higher
averages for the GTX 970 and look at
that lower 1% it matches to the average
as the Vega card so yeah and the only
game I play right now where Vega pulls
ahead is doom so about 9 frames higher
an average but the lower 1% are
basically identical and the one
interesting observation is that giant
performance gap between the arcs 580 and
the Vega 56 and there's literally
nothing price-wise and performance wise
from AMD to fill that space which is
where the gtx 1070 comes in because it's
priced cheaper than the vega 56 but
slightly higher than the RX 580 but it
outperforms both those cards and pretty
much every title but the one thing you
have to consider is freesync versus
g-sync freesync monitors are much
cheaper so if you're going towards the
start of free gaming experience with the
aim these side of things you are
spending less money overall I would say
versus going with g-sync display that is
more expensive but getting it slightly
cheaper GPU that is more powerful
so they kind of balance each other out
but the one thing that really surprised
me is adobe premiere performance with
AMD cards and how much worse it has
gotten after the latest updates you can
watch the full video here but Adobe
added quick sync support which can use
the integrated graphics on your Intel
CPU to accelerate encoding and so my
8700 K has an Intel HD 630 so that can
be used while you're outputting
rendering a video file so it can use the
CUDA acceleration on the Nvidia card and
OpenCL acceleration through the
integrated graphics but the aim these
side of things use OpenCL acceleration
because it doesn't have CUDA and so the
premier uses the integrated graphics
instead of your GPU when you have
hardware acceleration enabled through
OpenCL therefore making things much
slower to export because the AMD card is
not even utilized at all whereas the
integrated graphics is being used for
that OpenCL acceleration and so that
really sucks for premier users who are
on AMD cards with an Intel CPU because
premiere will not use your graphics card
they'll just use the integrated graphics
on the processor instead and looking in
the big picture I feel like aim the
Radeon is going to be in a difficult
position
you know I included the gtx 1070 because
it's cheaper than the vega 56 so it
slides right in between the 580 the arcs
580 and the vega 56 but it outperforms
those two cards and the roaming rumors
of potentially a new Nvidia card launch
soon you know that really kind of
corners aim D to a really bad value
proposition market wise one of the best
gaming headsets is now available through
mass drop the PC 3 7 X has fantastic
drivers incredible comfort and the best
microphone in the class plus they look
awesome for a gaming headset check out
the drop link below alright guys I would
love to hear what you think about this
whole aim D Radeon situation they are in
a little bit of a pickle but if you were
to stick with team red the RX 580 is a
good 1080p card to find it on sale you
won't be disappointed it's pretty
powerful for 1080p stuff while the Vega
56 so this thing is
the beast for the price point the
unfortunate thing is that gtx 1070 is
more powerful than this guy and it's
also cheaper but if you are going for
team red then the very 56 is kind of a
no-brainer alright guys I hope you
enjoyed this one let me know which card
you're rocking right now and potentially
are thinking of upgrading are you
looking forward to new in video cards if
they come out or you're looking to buy
something from existing AMD pool let me
know in the comments make sure to check
out this other relevant content check
out our new boot sequence channel and
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
