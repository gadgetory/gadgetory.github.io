their graphics cards but at Computex
2017 that continue to focus equally on
their pre-built mini pcs and graphics
cards in this video we're more
interested in some of the cool
innovations that they're bringing to the
PC market with some small but powerful
systems but first a message from our
sponsors our complex trip is brought to
you by fan tech schoolmaster and MSI so
Tech's magnet series have been around
for a little while now but they're now
showing some revised designs with some
very interesting component layouts
remember the Z box Magnus is a
bare-bones system so you are expected to
populate it with memory and storage
options while ZOTAC has pre-installed
the CPU GPU motherboard and other items
not only is a chassis more streamlined
and better looking than before but the
internal layout will now accommodate
support for a full size graphics card
and desktop class processors for up to
65 watts of TDP now before these
bare-bones systems use notebook
components to achieve pretty good
performance but the bumping capabilities
will definitely be noticed in real-world
scenarios it's also a great move for
buyers since they should now be easily
able to upgrade their systems over time
there's also a pretty drastic change in
components being offered in different
Magnus configurations there are the
usual KB Lake I 5 and i7 versions but
now ZOTAC will also be adding rising
processors into the mix there's no water
exactly which AMD CPUs will be in the
options then but that 65 watt TDP number
leads us to believe the bison 7 1700 and
risin 5 1600 or below could all be
likely candidates with that being said
both AMD and Intel based systems will
come with either a ZOTAC gtx 1070 Mini
or GTX 1060 mini graphics card
pre-installed at this time there's no
word on pricing or solid availability
dates but we're hoping to have one in
hand soon for testing purposes so I'm
pretty excited about that now this
little guy is the Magnus 1050 and it's
supposed to be a perfect affordable
system for eSport use while ZOTAC has
already introduced an option with a GTX
1060 in this range the 1050 version is
still supposed to provide excellent
performance for 1080p displays but cost
much less supposedly it will be priced
under $800 but would like to see it
coming well under that do
there being plenty of great entry level
gaming notebook options in the same
price range now switching gears a bit we
come to ZOTAC solution for people who
don't want to build their own pcs from
the ground up or populate a bare bone
system with other components this is
their brand new Mac gaming PC and boy
does it look so good to the eye but it
also enters a pretty crowded market
remember we already reviewed competing
solutions like the MSI pride and three
Arctic of course they're one and the ACS
g20 eye links to those are in the
description below every one of them had
some challenges so what is ZOTAC doing
to stand out well for one the max design
is certainly distinctive with a
perimeter RGB lining around its face and
an extremely narrow footprint zolteck
will also be including an i7 7700
processor which means a lack of CP
overclocking but that's understandable
since this is a proven system there's
also a gtx 1080 mini graphics card and a
450 watt STX size power supply some of
the other specifications are still to be
determined
since there will likely be different
combinations of MDOT - SSDs and
secondary hard drives for storage we'll
likely see the mech on store shelves
before Christmas so that wraps up our
coverage of Zoet axe new PCs and while
there are plenty more coverage of them
they all can fit into this video however
stay tuned to the channel for more
Computex coverage and ebert with horican
axe thank you so much for watching and
we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
