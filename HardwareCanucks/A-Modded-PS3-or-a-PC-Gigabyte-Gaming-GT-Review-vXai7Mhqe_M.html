I mean it really does to me at least but
anyways let's cut to the chase and talk
about this PC that's right my friends
this is a fully powerful desktop
computer it's loaded with specs so meet
the Gigabyte Gaming GT if you recall we
did get a chance to take a look at it
during our time at CES and so now we
finally have one in the studio so allow
me to walk you through what gigabyte has
done to the GT to make it a more
compelling option for gamers right after
this choose be quiet to join the silent
revolution designed and tested in
Germany they're meticulous passion for
quiet PC components ranges from premium
power supplies CPU coolers and fans and
innovative PC cases all of which aim to
achieve one thing is this thing even on
that's right totally quiet power
supplies even under load silent winged
explains the other awesome airflow with
noise that doesn't reach your ears all
enclosed in the package designed to be
quiet alright so the first thing that
stands out about the gaming GT is its
design just take a moment to gather your
thoughts about it and don't forget to
leave a comment down below
personally I have mixed feelings about
this PC it's quite distinctive
especially when you look at the oval
shape of the chassis from every angle
you possibly can but they did lose me
with those green fan grills its ugly in
my opinion but you might not feel the
same way in terms of build quality it's
mostly plastic but it's put together
really well and I appreciate gigabyte
for approaching the slim towel route
since this might fit in really well as
an HTTP C given you're ok with the
design it's only 10 liters in volume so
it's slightly taller than the g20 ci but
it packs some serious horsepower under
the hood the model I have here costs
$1,700 and it features a core i7 7700 K
processor 16 gigabytes of ddr4 ram a 240
gigabyte m2 SATA based SSD along with a
one terabyte hard drive and a gtx 1070
so for my price to performance
perspective the GT competes head-to-head
against the g20 ci from Asus also I feel
like I'm repeating this every time
I'm reviewing a compact desktop PC but
guys I'm very much aware of the fact
that you can build a much powerful rig
for less but think about this way you
can't flex the engineering muscle like
gigabyte did to make this as compact as
it is right now so with that out of the
way let's move on the i/o situation is
actually pretty interesting on the
gaming GT remember gigabyte had to
design their own custom motherboard to
house the unlocked cabling processor but
at the same time connectivity was a key
concern and they didn't want users to be
left out of the whole desktop class
experience that being said there is a
hidden cover at the back that once
remote exposes three USB 3 ports a
single USB 3.1 type A and type C port
with support for Thunderbolt 3 HDMI 1.4
B for the onboard graphics chip and if
you're wondering about display i/o it's
actually located at the bottom in this
case the g1 gtx 1070 features three
DisplayPort 1.4 ports a single HDMI 2.0
port and a dual link DVI you'll also
notice a Gigabit LAN port 7.1 audio
jacks along with the AC power connector
beside the video card so the power
supply is actually built into the unit
which is awesome now routing cables
underneath the chassis might be a little
concerning since not every cable can
bend 90 degrees thankfully gigabyte
includes a handful of adapters
extensions and cables including this 90
degree DisplayPort adapter and this is
something I have to give gigabyte credit
for they've not only managed to make it
relatively simple to plug in cables but
also integrating a single cable cut out
at the back for exiting them in my eyes
is just awesome the front area was
fairly limited
you only get a pair of USB 2.0 ports
dedicated headphone and mic jacks and a
power button opening up the GT was
pretty simple all I had to do was
unfasten these screws at the bottom and
gently pull out one of the side panels
which then revealed the two two and half
inch hard drive brackets with one of
them preoccupied and the g1 gtx 1070
video card getting access to the other
side requires additional screw removals
as you see here but once that's done you
can spot the two sodium Ram modules
which by the way can be upgraded up to
32 gigabytes there's also a single
inductance LAN which has already been
populated but I wish they offered an
additional one for faster storage
expansion
a little curious to see what gigabyte
schooling strategy was for the 7700 K
remember this is a desktop great
processor with 4 physical cores that are
hyper threaded and as you can see
they've directed these aluminium heat
pipes towards the top of the chassis for
better thermal efficiency but we'll have
to check that out in benchmarks so the
gaming GT is a pretty flexible machine
when it comes to upgrading components
like the GPU hard drive the processor
which I don't think you'll need to worry
about for a few years plus kudos to you
by for not including a warranty void in
frame wood sticker its 2017 so PC
vendors can't compromise on RGB lighting
gigabyte has added a ring of LEDs at the
top that can be controlled via software
and it features seven different effects
and the green fan grill mixes up the
color output and the uniformity between
the colors were inconsistent I also
found something interesting while gaming
with a GT see those top louvers well
when system is undergoing a stressful
scenario they lift up automatically in
order to maximize airflow I found that
to be really cool but let me know what
you guys think about this implementation
in the comments down below do note there
is an option within the LED app to
manually open the louvers apart from the
weird design choice of the gaming GT I'm
pretty impressed with the specs packed
under the hood but how does that
translate into performance I did put
this up against the ACS g20 CI and the
Corsair one so let's get started
Cinebench r15 running these CPU tests we
see that the GT scores right in between
the Corsair 1 and the g20 while both the
1 and the GT feature the 7700 K the near
40 point difference between the two can
be neglected due to the hardware
combinations but they're really close
switching to OpenGL and things start to
get a little interesting you see the g20
sports a GTX 1080 and an i10 and 7700
non K CPU with lower clock speeds
compared to the unlock 2 brother
the 7700 K which is why it bottoms out
of the chart the GT on the other hand
features a gtx 1070 and a 7700 k which
resulted in a 10 frames per second
difference between it and the corsair
one that boasts the same cpu and a 1080
surprisingly Premiere Pro rendered our
standard 1-minute 4k h.264 video a lot
faster than the corsair one and the g20
again these was
rely heavily upon software and hardware
optimizations and in this case the GT
takes the lead the 240 gigabyte SSD
inside the Kanan GT digital respectable
read speeds compared to the g20 and the
one but I was disappointed with its
light performance the same story goes
for its included one terabyte hard drive
not thoroughly impressed with both the
read and write speeds even though it's
backed at 7200 rpm all right game time
battlefield one at 1440p set to ultra
averaged just over 70 frames per second
overwatch at 1440p set to epic discharge
aim rates any high 70s doom at 1440
peace to ultra using the Vulkan API
completed really well against the g20
averaging just a tad over 100 frames per
second finally Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon
wildlands which is a heavily demanding
title averaged around 56 frames per
second with all that hype around the
automatic louvers to maximize thermal
efficiency the gaming gt-r and the
hottest among the three as you can see
under load the 7700 K got to a whopping
90 degrees Celsius while the idle temps
remained around 36 degree C the g1 GTX
1070 was not choked up by the slim tower
design of the GT luckily the crippled
fans don't spend during idle situations
but under load it ran neck to neck to
the 1080 inside the g20 averaging 80 to
C which brings me to my next point
acoustic performance guys just for
reference the microphone is right above
the GT is actually right above the frame
but let's take a look at how the GT
sounds during idle
so from that sound test it is very clear
that this is not a quiet machine Minard
load so definitely recommend headphones
if you're planning on using this for
heavy-duty purposes like gaming or your
productivity in general so guys in
conclusion I really have mixed feelings
about the gaming GT it's an awesome
machine in terms of performance of our
performance especially since the GTX 770
is overclocked out of the box because
it's a custom card the unlocked cable a
processor might seem a little bit of a
weird choice especially since you don't
have an option to overclock the CPU and
you know priced at $1,700 I think that
you might be paying a lot more for what
you're actually getting
I would prefer gigabyte to include a
7700 processor that way they can reduce
the price and also we could expect a
much thermal efficiency from the 77th
under K processor or the non 77th edit K
processor so I want to hear your
thoughts about the gigabyte gaming GT
what do you guys think about the design
and its performance packed under the
hood most importantly I actually want to
hear your thoughts about the
automatically opening lowers do you
think that's a cool feature and the
gigabyte pick the right choice for
putting a 7700 K inside this PC because
first of all you really can't overclock
this chip so that loses a lot of value
and it just runs super hot like it goes
all the way up to 90 C which I don't
think is that great for a processor let
us know in the comments down below
I need more with how it connects thank
you so much for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
