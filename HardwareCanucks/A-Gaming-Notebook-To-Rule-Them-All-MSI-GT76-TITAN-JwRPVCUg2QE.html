here in Taipei to check out their
upcoming x570 motherboards some desktop
PCs and some notebooks I was
particularly interested in the notebook
section while Dmitry and Michael were
taking care of motherboards cuz you know
it's the more interesting stuff and
they're drooling over it whereas I was
just drooling over some of the notebook
hardware so this is the GE65 writer and
the GT76 Titan two extreme ends of
gaming laptops that you can find at the
moment from MSI so let's check them out
right after a quick message from our
sponsors fan Tex and SteelSeries without
them Computex 2019 would not have been
possible alright so the design on the GE65
Raider at first glance is pretty good
I mean they've certainly cut down on a
lot of the aggressiveness that MSI have
been known for in the past I mean you
still get some red and black elements
here and there but what really surprised
me with the GE65 is the build quality
the chassis is mostly constructed out of
aluminum and the display fields
rock-solid when opening it up and when
you take a look at the interior layout
it's very clean and minimal there are no
fancy stickers or dragon-themed layout
going on which I really appreciate but I
do want to mention that there are no
front facing speakers which is certainly
a bummer but rest aside the design looks
really nice taking a look at the specs
and this is where things take an
interesting turn around the g65 can be
configured up to an 8 core 16 threaded
core I 998 a th CPU and remember this is
inside a 15 inch form factor so cooling
is certainly a question mark the memory
can be configured up to 64 gigabytes
there are 2 m2 nvme slots and a 2 and
1/2 inch hard drive so great flexibility
in terms of storage now the Wi-Fi card
on the GE65 Raider is from killer in
this case it's the Wi-Fi 6 module that's
supposed to offer up to 2.4 gig is per
second of theoretical throughput
although you know most of us or at least
as most of us are aware of killer
networking cards haven't really been
that well in terms of offering you know
stable networking and if you're someone
who's actually using a notebook with an
a killer card what has been your
experience like has it improved or is it
doesn't still you know have a lot of
issues let us know in the comments down
below I'm pretty sure most of them will
actually swap this out eventually for an
Intel card moving on to the display it
features a 15.6 inch IPS panel with a
refresh rate of 240 Hertz which is just
insane
the form factor and when you pair it up
with something like you know the RTX
2017 on max-q GPU I guess the whole
experience would just be pretty awesome
the keyboard layout is pretty
straightforward
SteelSeries has been a longtime partner
of msi and they have one of the best
keyboards in the industry there's good
amount of travel distance plus it
features RGB lighting I have to say I'm
not a fan of the letter design as it
does look a bit dated but what'd you
guys think the trackpad does feature
Windows position drivers although it's
not a glass surface so it didn't feel as
nice as something like you know what's
found on the blade 15 the IO consists of
Gigabit Ethernet HDMI mini DisplayPort
USB 3.1 gen2 type-c audio jacks a couple
more USB 3.1 gen2 ports and a full sized
SD card reader which is really nice now
the lack of a Thunderbolt 3 port is
really odd especially in a notebook of
this caliber and when I asked MSI about
this they mentioned that when they
connected a survey they realized that
most gamers don't see Thunderbolt 3 as a
benefit which is really really
interesting because I would have liked
to see Thunderbolt 3 especially in
notebook of this width in this price
range because you are paying a premium
for it speaking of that pricing for the
GE 65 Raider starts at $15.99 for the
base model and it can go all the way up
to 20 $1.99 for the expect out eight
cores 16 credit Cory 9 processor and an
RTX 2017 on max-q GPU next up is the GT76 Titan this is the big boy the
all-in-all desktop replacement notebook
that you'd want to get if you're in the
market for one now the design is
actually very minimal I actually like
what they've done here the chassis is
primarily constructed out of aluminum
with this sandstone grey finish that
looks amazing it actually reminds me of
the msi titanium other boards to be
honest there are some facing speakers
designed by Jane audio which is nice and
there's also a cool halo lighting strip
at the bottom that's well diffused
keyboard is once again designed by steel
Suites and it's really identical to the
one found on the g65 Raider and I'm
really glad that they didn't go for a
full sized mechanical keyboard layout on
the Titan model because it would have
just added a lot more thickness to the
notebook I mean first of all this
notebook ways you know about ten pounds
so if you add mechanical switches to it
it just would add more to the weight
and like I said it just wouldn't look
that great to be honest now in terms of
specs expect the absolute best of the
best so you can configure this laptop
with up to 1/4 nine and ninety nine
hundred K processor and while there
where some thermal challenges MSI does
seem to have that thing sorted out
pretty well I mean as you can see I did
get a chance to crack open up the bottom
and poyo boy what a work of art there
are 11 heat pipes to cool the unlocked
CPU as well as the GPU which in this
case can be up to in RTX 20 18 on max q
variant msi does claim that all 8 cores
can run up to 5 gigahertz and they'll
actually ensure to make sure that every
unit that leaves the factory hit those
clock speeds in terms of memory you can
spec this out to up to 120 gigabytes of
RAM and the highest-end skew does have
that option there are four slots in
total two of them can be easily accessed
to the back whereas the other two are on
the other side which might be a little
bit challenging to get to in terms of
storage there are three m dot two PCI
gen3 slots which have heat pads built in
as well as a two and half inch hard
drive the battery in this case is 90
watt hours which in this case wouldn't
really do that much because I bet that
the system would probably last for an
hour or two under idle scenarios moving
on to the display MSI will be offering
two options with the GT 76 Titan so you
can configure it with a 1080p 144 it's
IPS panel although it doesn't feature
g-sync which is really odd especially on
notebook of this caliber but you can
also opt for a 4k option that is 60
Hertz and has 100% Adobe RGB coverage
and finally wrapping things up with the
i/o it is just loaded guys so there's
HDMI mini DisplayPort type C Gen 2
couple USB 3.1 gen2 type
and oddly enough a micro SD card reader
that's right my folks a laptop that
weighs 10 pounds has a micro SD card
reader instead of a full-sized one I
mean they clearly had the room for it
it's just that they decided to go with
something that is totally unrelated well
especially for content creators
switching over to the other side you get
audio jacks couple more USB type 8 ports
Thunderbolt 3 port Gigabit Ethernet and
power in speaking of power you'll need
two 240 watt adapters to power this
beast
especially the top-of-the-line model and
MSI has this too and want adapter
that comes included that can take both
units and as you can tell the GT76 item
from MSI is certainly not a portable
solution MSI is really gearing this for
a certain type of demographic people who
are looking for the absolute best in
terms of performance in a notebook
chassis although I really don't know if
I can call this a laptop considering the
size now pricing for the GT76 starts at
$3,500 and goes all the way up to $4,800
USD so pricing it is expensive it is an
expensive notebook that is obviously a
thing but I want to know your thoughts
about the GT76 Titan from inside as
well as the g76 Raider or the GE65
Raider what do you guys think about it I
mean are you interested in something
like you know a 15 inch form factor with
an 8 core processor like the Raider or
you know the GT76 that has the absolute
best in terms of specs let me know in
