connection since 2010 I've built
building computers and it's been
exciting seven years in the making I've
had to learn as I go and that you can
check out multiple tutorials online on
some tips and techniques for building a
PC but here are my main tips that I'd
like to share with you something that I
wish I knew back then and Fred knows
what's up let's talk about all that
right after this cool master master keys
keyboard lineup is now available in
three sizes to fit within your space
with large medium and small boards with
either beautiful RGB or pure white LED
illumination a little something for
everyone make it yours with the master
keys Pro by Cooler Master all right so
let's begin with the gear a magnetic
screwdriver get it you won't regret it
there are plenty affordable kits that
you can buy online through Amazon and
through other means it's not going to be
harmful if you're a sane person and
handling your components with respect it
will save you some nerves from trying to
you know find that little screw that has
fallen in little crack of the black hole
that is some crevice inside your case or
underneath the motherboard magnetic
screwdriver is a must the best way to
organize your screws is to use something
like this a little compartments to
organize your thumb screws your drive
screws your motherboard screws very
handy I know everyone wants to peel off
the protective film off the acrylic side
panels I know the sound is really
something but don't keep that on until
you're finished with the build to
prevent unnecessary scratches and
essentially ruining your day of finding
giant little scratches everywhere after
your assembly if you're not careful and
if you own a tempered glass case still
keep the protective film on not to
prevent scratches but to prevent finger
marks so that you can peel that thing in
the end and it will look shiny and
beautiful something I do with every
single new case that comes into the
studio is to loosen up all the thumb
screws that I know I will remove
eventually because they're tightened way
too hard out of the factory and it just
helps with the assembly process static
discharge is a big deal
make sure to ground yourself either with
like one of those grounding straps or
touch the metal of the case before
handling your components to avoid any
unintentional damage to your hardware
remember that placing the CPU inside the
CPU socket does not require any force
both on intel and AMD platforms so
double check to make sure that triangle
alignment is correct and you'll be good
an easy way to remember which memory
spots to occupy if you're not occupying
all of them say you're using 2 out of 4
or 4 out of 8 is to occupy the non-black
dims first or refer to your instructions
manual for clarification a common
practice for new builds is to actually
assemble everything outside of the case
load into the BIOS and make sure that
all the hardware is recognized if you
also want to install Windows that's also
good to do before inserting everything
inside the case to avoid any
troubleshooting headaches another common
practice is to visualize your build and
how things will be structured inside the
case potentially might highlight some of
those red flags for compatibility a few
things to keep in mind is not all cases
have 140 millimeter fan support at the
rear and if you're installing radiator
and stands at the top for most mid
towers you might run into compatibility
issues with hide them for the memory and
most ITX motherboard have only two fan
headers so keep that in mind for smaller
builds and the airflow direction and
it's totally okay to use a non modular
power supply for fan installation I
recommend rubber fan screws there are
multiple variations of them and they
have benefits like easier installation
and also anti vibration properties and I
just don't like to deal with those
annoying stock fan screws so yeah
rubber fan screws for cable management I
would pre wire the eight pin cable and
your i/o cables usually because 810 is a
kind of awkward corner spot and having
that cable out there before inserting
the motherboard I find it easier plus
pre-wiring the i/o cables first before
handling your power supply cables just
makes it much easier kill management job
and my main kill measurement tip would
be to route and assemble cables by areas
and only then secure allows you to
visualize how cables are sort of spread
out through the back and then allows you
to bunch up certain cables in those
areas so kale management becomes
year remember that the standard SATA
cable has four connections and they all
spaced out perfectly to allow for four
drives to be connected simultaneously if
they are located one above another so
concentrate your drives in that one area
in order to avoid adding more SATA cable
double check all your mounting points
even a slight screw fixation that isn't
aligned properly might cause the system
to short out and cause some other issues
so use the i/o shield and double check
that the motherboard stand off the
extended one that usually catches the
motherboard is aligned properly in hope
to avoid any shorting due to improper
mounting if you are using an all-in-one
cooler double check how you want the
radius to be mounted inside the case and
rotate the radiator accordingly for the
CPU block to remain horizontal on
orientation otherwise you might have the
block that's like skewed and the logo in
the middle might not align properly and
won't give you the best visuals remember
that hot air rises so set your fans
accordingly perhaps need rotating the
CPU heatsink to exhaust air upwards but
remember it's totally okay to also have
horizontal air direction it's time to
take illumination seriously with
vengence RGB ddr4 memory buy Corsair
with incredibly bright LEDs and uniform
color spread add a touch of classic
color that is fully software
controllable and compatible with a wide
variety of intel and AMD platforms more
info in the description below so I think
that's pretty much it for my side share
your own hidden gems for PC building and
remember when in doubt check out the
Huracan xforms for more tips and stuff
and they have such an awesome community
