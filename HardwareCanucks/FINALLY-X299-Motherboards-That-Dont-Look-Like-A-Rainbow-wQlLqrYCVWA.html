stopping by the EVGA booth at the Grand
Hyatt in Taipei so let's check out some
of their cool motherboards right after
this our complex trip is brought to you
by fan tech schoolmaster and MSI all
right so let's kick things off with the
X 299 dark which is meant to be EVGA
flagship but it's also very narrowly
targeted towards extreme overclockers it
actually uses what ebj calls an
optimized EAD X form factor which we
sense is certain onboard connectors with
cut out areas on the PCB the end result
is unique looking layout that is
supposed to optimize cable routing with
that taken into account you can actually
see a lot in common between this Lord
and the asus apex series including that
unique PCB there's a pair of eight pin
connectors to ensure the CPU gets
sufficient power during extreme
overclocking adventures and a single
bank of quad-channel memory that's been
wired to the CPU socket with reinforced
traces to promote extreme speeds to back
that up there's a fourteen phase digital
vrm layout EVGA expects this to be the
best overclocking x 299 board on the
planet and it shows what you won't see
with the dark series this fabulous
add-ons that overclockers and gamers
won't use for example reinforced PCI
slots extensive RGB lighting back plates
and the overuse of metal are completely
pointless for a motherboard of this
caliber in EB J's eyes instead of
spending money for those things that
instead invested in key locations that
actually lead to meaningful benefits for
the end users overclockers receive a few
other interesting things too there's the
usual onboard power reset and clear CMOS
buttons support for triple biases and an
advanced ten zone temperature monitoring
design one thing that caught our eye was
actually the onboard voltage display
which will definitely come in handy for
overclockers who are used to needing a
multimeter to accurately log voltage in
terms of connectivity the x-29 and arc
has everything an overclocker could
possibly want and most of what gamers
need there's dual you two connectors
support for quad graphics cards and
three m2 PCI and eme slots two of those
slots are actively cooled with onboard
fan and heatsink design while the other
one is vertically mounted meanwhile the
board's bottom edge has a dedicated six
pin power connector
that's used to push additional current
towards the PCI slots basically this
board looks like an absolute beast and
it will surely be competing with the
ravage six apex as the best public
locking motherboard around now if you
don't need the overclocking might of
EVGA is dark then the x2 99f dwk might
be a perfect fit it actually has many of
the darks basic features but eliminates
the ones which are later focused on
extreme speeds and replaces them with
sensible mainstream items for example
even though the color scheme remains
very neutral EVGA has added a cool LED
lighting scheme but despite those
mainstream features the FTW case still
targets enthusiasts with a large e ATX
form factor in many ways we think that
this motherboard is ready to go
head-to-head with the likes of Asus
Rampage and gigabytes a gaming 9 Series
it has an advanced a channel audio
design and an ultra efficient 14 phase
digital vrm layout it also supports
memory speeds up to 40 133 megahertz and
higher through the use of a new
dedicated 4 layer key routing design now
oddly it does feel like the FTW falls
behind a bit when compared to some other
designs even though it has a killer
networks a 2500 chipset for Ethernet
connection
there's no Intel LAN or Wi-Fi
capabilities also even though there are
single rear connectors for the USB 3.1
gen2 type a and type C there are no fun
panel hookups for those next-generation
formats with that being said in other
areas this motherboard has it all
through there are 6 SATA 6 gigabits per
second headers 2 u 2 connectors and 3 m
dot 2 slots for running rate setups
through Intel's vrock technology EVGA
has included an onboard CP temperature
monitor as well so that's awesome and
now let's talk about the last
motherboard that EVGA was showcasing in
the both this one's actually quite
unique while many manufacturers are
either sticking to an ATX or ultra
compact ITX form factors the X 299 micro
is actually one of a handful of micro
ATX x-29 boards we've seen not many
windows will be supporting this form
factor going forward so it's great to
see EVGA sticking in the game since n8x
boards are still compact but they
support a ton more features than ITX
does let's start off with the most
important thing about this particular
motherboard it supports a dual card
configuration at full 16 X by 16 X
speeds
now there are only four dimm slots and
they support up to 64 gigabytes of
memory in total and EVGA has managed to
cram a very capable 8 channel audio
solution onto the board there's also six
SATA 6 gigabits per second ports 2 m dot
2 slots of which one is vertical and
even a Utah two connector for good
measure honestly for the space savings
it is hard to recommend an ITX
motherboard over this one but we will
have to see how many cases end up with
only M ATX configurations in the near
future so there you have it
all of EVGA x2 99 motherboards that will
be available at launch what do you guys
think would you buy one of these or a
competing Asus gigabyte as rock or MSI

I'm Eva with Haruka knacks thank you so
much for watching stay tuned for more
complex coverage and we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
