great technology selection and service
which done what livingroom gain full 5.5
inches in all that game this is 8 inch
game oh yeah
fifteen point six inches I didn't think
it had come down to this let me show you
what real living room gaming is like
got enough food intro already just do it
how they stay five inches why do you
believe me
I said 65 hello everyone I'm Dimitri
with Hara Canucks and my face after in
boxing this giant TV remain the same for
the remainder of the time that I've
spent with it the goal was to see how
something of this size in my tiny living
room would work as a daily driver for
content but also explore all types of
possibilities for gaming so the first
thing to cover with the samsung series 8
65-inch 4k Smart TV is the physical tour
and Here I am next to it for scale it's
like a mini theater in your living room
and notice that it is a flat panel and
if you want to check out our experience
with the curved 55 inch TV it will be
linked in the description below now I'm
absolutely impressed with just how thin
these high-end TVs are not a little bit
thicker closer to the center with this
thin edge effect the brushed aluminum
frame at the front is beautiful that's
also curved around the bezel and it's
completely plain without any unwanted
stamps but a simple Samsung logo at the
bottom Center without any ambient power
lights and that s UHD indication in the
top right the TV stand also falls in
line with a beautiful simple design with
that long front aluminum support that's
incredibly low profile and the base
extends all the way back because the
front rail is more forward it kind of
helps to sort of visually elevate the TV
so it doesn't look like it's right on
the surface
now this su HD indication doesn't mean
better resolution of UHD the native
resolution here is 3840 by 2160 with
support at 60 Hertz the su HD format is
Samsung's way to promote their
higher-end models with this extra
marketing inclusion to say that 4k
content looks more vibrant clearer and
just process better with their su HD TVs
this is an LED backlit TV which means
black and white pixels won't compare to
all a T
but Samsung has done plenty to
compensate for proper viewing experience
with UHD dimming that controls
brightness and contrast in multiple
sections of the screen and viewing
content with native color profile
delivered natural colors with perfect
white balance and I can say that because
I made the video that I was watching so
I know exactly what to look for in terms
of connectivity at the back the ports
include a USB 3.0 which is perfect to
playback media off a USB storage below
that is a one connect mini port that is
a super convenient way to connect to the
hub so you don't need to handle any
connections behind the TV and just plug
and play stuff off this hub furthermore
we have a LAN port if you prefer to
choose that over smart built-in Wi-Fi
and finally components and video in
Jack's with audio out for speakers back
to the one connect mini that is covered
with brushed aluminum nice touch and
this hub is pretty small here is next to
d1 plus 2 for scale on the side we find
a pair of USB 2.0 ports and on the back
or HDMI 2.0 that are all hdcp 2.2
compliant then there's the optical audio
and mini connect port for the TV but it
was time to start gaming on this thing
and I hooked up the shield Android TV
which is capable of 4k video streaming
and has got some pretty awesome titles
running off the shield itself like
half-life 2 that was a pleasure to play
through although I'm no good with the
controller but here the 1080p signal off
the game was up scaled with no artifacts
that I could see and so for any console
players 720p upscale signal will look
fairly sharp from a couch distance but
for optimal detail 1080p or higher is of
course recommended Talos principle just
came out on a shield and getting try
that game up scaled look fantastic and
here the framerate wasn't so great an
enabling game mode on the TV allows for
slightly smoother picture and it
actually reduces import lag that is
otherwise felt but to experience true 4k
gaming I had to pull out the big guns
my SLI gaming station that you can check
out the review of in the description
below now I want to find out
how the TV would handle itself and that
PC environment and enabling game mode
and jumping into gta5 the world inside
the game was truly beautiful at 4k
resolution plus at 60 Hertz it helps to
achieve good enough refresh rate for
this game although I still could feel a
little bit input lag from the controller
so I won't be playing any first-person
shooters with this TV in my living room
and I'm not talking about any
competitive shooters but the mouse aim
is just not what I'm used to
however racing games on the size is
fantastic letting me enjoy the
large-scale environment and the view
from the cockpit like I'm right there
plus the slight input lag wasn't much of
an issue here my gaming experience both
on the Nvidia shield and the PC were
satisfactory for the refresh rate vivid
colors and rich contrasts and watching
native 4k YouTube content was absolutely
beautiful
the anti-glare coating on my setting in
my tiny living room that is struggled to
keep off the reflections and in a
brightly lit room the TV brightness was
fine and reflections in the dark areas
of the screen were muted but still
noticeable and so what I wanted to get
out of this experience is whether or not
we are ready to start talking about 4k
gaming in the living room utilizing a
multi-purpose smart TV like this one for
entertainment which i think is the
future of living-room gaming and while
very demanding still to drive games at
4k the upscale engines in these TVs is
really good with satisfying results and
everything about this model indicates
sort of future proofing your investment
in the way everything is handled from
the convenient mini Kinect hub the
amazing uniformity of such a large
screen the multiple ways to handle color
presentation and the Smart Remote that
lets you interact with all the menus
seamlessly plus the built-in smart hub
is there although in my experience it
comes out disappointing with just lack
of content and apps and so the way we're
noticing these TVs to emerge with
multi-use is fantastic and I thoroughly
enjoyed the Series eight model and I
cannot wait to try out the next
Generation TVs so guys I hope you
enjoyed this video all the relevant
content will be linked in the

want to see more videos like this I'm
