hello everyone this is Dimitri with
hardware canucks and this is the new
Nvidia shield alright so let's take a
few steps back and review how the shield
ecosystem has a ball so we first got the
shield portable and awesome and your
gaming device that introduced us to game
stream or the ability to stream PC games
to the portable a year later we got the
shield tablet following in the same
footsteps as the portable delivering
even more features taking directly from
their desktop class GPUs like shadow
play allowing you to video capture your
screen with minimal impact on
performance and streaming to twitch we
got grid gaming invidious proprietary
game streaming service and even improved
console mode allowing you to play
Android games at 1080p with a controller
connected to a TV so the latest shield
Android TV takes this Android living
room experience even further being the
first device in its class capable of
streaming 4k now designed to be a
stationary device in a way the shield
Android TV will be available in two
flavors a 16 gigabyte model for $1.99 or
a 500 gigabyte model for $2.99
incorporating a two and a half inch
hybrid drive inside that model for
proper storage of all of your media and
games the Tegra x1 processor makes an
appearance with 256 CUDA cores three
gigabytes of RAM dual band Wi-Fi and the
whole load of other impressive features
like 10-bit color output at 3840 by 2160
unboxing our 16 gigabyte model inside we
find the shield itself a controller with
now redesigned Android capacitive
buttons to complement the shift to
Android lollipop 5.1 and the rest are
HDMI and USB cables along with the power
prick and with a new shield come new
accessories so a $29 base and the $49
shield remote sold separately and are
not exactly necessary for proper
experience but I do appreciate the
consistency of the design language I
think the base seems a little bit
overpriced but it's a hefty aluminum
piece designed very well for insertion
of the shield Android TV to keep the
device standing in the upright position
the bottom adhesive fab can be uncovered
for a more permanent mounting solution
the shield itself is a great looking
device with glossy parts some brushed
plastic and matte pieces it's
surprisingly thin here is next to my
iPhone and you can see the effort that
has been put to design a discreet device
if needed allowing both vertical and
horizontal orientation that would depend
on your setup the green LED on the side
is very subtle non distracting and the
angular shape helps to identify the
power state regardless of which side
you're looking at it from given the
shield is laying flat
the spacing from the LED is a capacitive
power button allowing a really seamless
power on process without needing to
handle any physical buttons the
diversity of the ports of the back is
excellent with power input HDMI 2.0
Gigabit Ethernet 2 USB 3 ports and the
micro USB to get access to the internal
storage on the shield and the micro SD
card slot for expandable storage
definitely useful for the 16 gigabyte
model and right above the port's is your
exhaust that's right the shield Android
TV is actively cooled with a fan inside
that has remained completely silent
throughout our testing and further take
a look inside the chassis you can see
where the two and a half inch drive
would go and one thing to notice is the
lack of any SATA ports so if you thought
of adding in your own drive to the 16
gigabyte version you're out of luck
and before we talk about the experience
let's check out the shield remote I'm
very excited about this this is very
unique so I love what Nvidia has done
here it feels very solid with aluminum
body it's light enough for comfortable
holding and buttons have a satisfying
clicking registration the circular wheel
is a four directional trackpad don't be
confused it does not rotate like you
would think from your iPod experience
maybe but instead there is a capacitor
strip available to change volume it is
responsive but it could be smoother the
button inside the wheel acts as your
enter and the two buttons below are back
and home for Android plus we have a
dedicated voice command button thanks to
a built-in microphone that is sensitive
so you don't need to bring this up to
all your face
all the time plus we get a micro USB at
the bottom for charging that lasts up to
four weeks where in my case the battery
status went from good to low in just two
days
but it's got capacitive sensing that
automatically turns off the remote when
not in your hands so that's pretty cool
and decide that is a headphone jack for
private listening so there is plenty of
functionality built into the remote the
only thing I would say is missing is
cursor like navigation but that's more
of a limitation on the Android TV sign
and on the shield itself and because the
remote is Bluetooth direct line-of-sight
of the shield is not required and so now
let's talk Android TV UI and how it
handles as a livingroom edition what's
the weather delay in Celsius today's
forecast for Toronto is 24 degrees
Celsius with scattered thunderstorms
show me my calendar
nope
open Leo's fortune
all right so there are two is to turn on
the shield actually using the remote or
pressing the button on the shield itself
there we go it woke up so the top row is
all your trending things it feels kind
of random and it doesn't fully tailor to
your usage history
it displays commonly used apps top TV
shows you get the idea the update cycle
feels kind of slow and these were the
exact same cards the night before below
is the shield hub you can access Nvidia
grid cloud gaming and their current
massive selection of PC titles that
requires a good connection for 1080p at
60fps service with low latency in my
experience playing a racing game was
acceptable with great framerate and
jumping into fear 3 maintained a good
quality image but the latency was quite
high for a first-person shooter and I
realize how terrible I am with the
controller as well but not to worry
mouse and keyboard input is fully
supported and you can properly enjoy
shooters through grid heading into
download games or Google Play games
opens suggested or featured games and I
think the coming soon tab was just a
huge tease something Nvidia has shown
off to run off the Tegra x1 with games
like Talos principle borderlands series
half-life episode 2 but here's the
caveat not all Android games are
supported on Android TV and thus titles
like half-life 2 that are available on
the shield tablet are not yet supported
on the Android TV and just to be clear
this is not a limitation of the shield
but the lack of Google's compatibility
rollout moving along here you can access
game stream streaming games off your
GeForce powered local PC on the same
network and finally Netflix capable of
4k streaming on a premium account making
the shield the first Smart TV box to do
60 FPS at 4k video the next line gives
us install
games and I would be lying if I didn't
just jump into bomb squad because the
game is a lot of fun with multi
controller support which means
multiplayer equals fun
so the last line our apps organized an
order of use all the standard Google
Play stuff but wait a minute no Chrome
and no Google Drive yeah so that's the
biggest limitation of Android TV it
seems to lack useful apps like a browser
or any social media integration and
check out this hilariously bad browser
app not a fault of Nvidia but Android TV
is just not a fully developed ecosystem
just yet and it will get better for
example here are my android games on my
account that would be amazing for living
room entertainment but not available for
this device not available for this
device it's an on TV app and you'll
stumble upon many of these in the
initial stage of this rollout even the
Google Play Store feels kind of limiting
but we have to remember the sole purpose
of the Android TV ecosystem and that's
TV features with apps like Netflix Hulu
Plus Google's live channels when
combined with an antenna and a stream
box
there's sling TV and some others so
further incentivizing users to cut the
cord and jumping into YouTube app the
voice command says sure comes in handy
and is much faster than typing on the
on-screen keyboard from our experience
4k playback is absolutely gorgeous and
most importantly no hiccups here with
loading and they're processing the
footage Plus Google cast integration
means easy streaming from an Android
device that supports that or an iOS
device as well for quick and convenient
content sharing and if you are wondering
about performance Tiger x1 does not
disappoint especially compared to the k1
on the shield tablet that is already a
very powerful device and the shield
Android TV scores significantly higher
on all fronts and so the release of the
new shield should pave the way for
proper integration of Android TV and
they've done an excellent job with the
form factor complementing accessories
albeit a little bit pricey the hardware
is very strong for this rollout
handles 4k streaming like a champ all
the Android gaming was I really can't
wait for all the coming soon titles that
are demanding but the x1 should handle
that as well we have the 500 gigabyte
option available to future-proof your
media and games unfortunately you cannot
install an additional drive if you get
the 16 gigabyte model and it really
comes down to further refinement of
Android TV ecosystem for this to become
more in sync to what we already have
with standard Android and that means
better game support the social media
integration and Google Chrome please
that would turn the shield Android TV
into a future-proof TV box that has all
these other features just in case and
while that concludes our review of the
new shield let us know what you think of
this iteration and your thoughts on the
Android TV ecosystem as a whole I'd love
to hear if you would consider cutting
your cable cord and use your Android TV
as a full-time replacement so make sure
