great technology selection and service
hey guys you were here with hurricane
axe and the gtx 980ti has earned its
spot as the GPU to have for 4k gaming
when overclocked it offers even better
performance but not every gamer is
comfortable enough to take a reference
card and boost its clock speed to the
max this is where cards like the gtx
980ti superclocked plus a CX 2.0 plus
comes into the equation it offers higher
out-of-the-box frequencies an upgraded
cooling solution and EVGA excellent
customer service in many ways EVGA has
taken things to the next level with this
card but that's not to say it's overly
expensive compared to many reference
base examples at 680 dollars it's just
$30 more than nvidia standard cards and
with that in mind we certainly have some
high expectations to give the specs out
of the way this card comes with a much
higher base clock speed of 11 20
megahertz which will get you an even
better boost clock of 1190 my cards on
paper the Supra clocked version of the
980 TI has about a 10% higher clock
speed but in videos GPU boost technology
alongside Nvidia's a CX 2.0 plus
heatsink our sample consistently hit 200
makers taking a quick glance at the
physical aspects of the card it may not
look all that much different compared to
the GTX 980 superclocked
but there are some subtle differences
here for example the heat shouts it's a
little lower than the PCB giving the
whole card a sleeker look than the
previous generations at 10.5 inches in
length compatibility shouldn't be a
problem with almost every non itix
enclosure on market EVGA ACX 2.0 cooler
is incredibly one of the best custom
aftermarket solutions around but in
order to ensure lower temperatures for
the hot running GM 200 core while still
being able to provide room for
overclocking some revisions were
necessary the plus in the AC ex 2.0 plus
designates a new fan design with a
highly optimized straight heat pipes
which allows the design to run about 5
degrees Celsius lower temperatures and
standard ATX 2.0 the two fans above the
heatsink utilized double ball bearings
for significantly improved life span and
the decibel noise inverter which powers
them down when the GPU temps are below
60 degrees we were also surprised by the
higher efficiency of these fans which
lowers them to consume four times less
power than the competing solutions this
can hypothetically boost overclocking
Headroom the card only takes standard
eight plus six pen input which is more
than enough power for a heavily
overclocked GM 200 core and still leaves
room for manual overclocking EGA has
also included a backplate with this card
I personally love the stealth black
finish with complements the rest of the
design and provides a cleaner look than
the bare PCB it should also lead to
lower component temperatures as for the
IO plate you get the same reference
layout with a single DVI and HDMI 2.0
output and three DisplayPort connectors
so moving on to the fun part the
performance our expectations were not
led down in the least the GTX 980
superclocked a CX 2.0 plus performed
just as expected overtaking the tight
necks in pretty much every triple-a
titles at 1440p at Ultra settings
including GTA 5 battlefield 4 tomb
raider and others this card
absolutely dominates the new fury acts
in every way jumping to 4k at very high
settings and we pretty much see the same
trend with the tight necks getting
crushed in some games while the fury X
is trying to keep up with the pace but
ultimately fails we were able to
overclock this monster to a whopping
1404 megahertz and to put things in
perspective we lined it up against the
overclocked r9 fury X and the numbers
really do speak for themselves
the ACX 2.0 plus cooler certainly does
an outstanding job keeping the GM 200
core under control with temperatures
hitting about 75 degrees under load this
is quite impressive considering how EVGA
has pre overclocked the super clock plus
by a little over 10% in comparison to
the reference card but that awesome
cooler still provides near silent
operation this is one of the quietest
cards we've tested thumbs up EVGA
despite being quite a bit faster than
the fury x the gtx 980ti Super Comp +
tool consumes less
power so in conclusion EVGA has made one
of the best GPUs you can buy right now
the gtx 980ti super clock plus a CX 2.0
plus video card has surpassed our
expectations considering how well it
performs against the Titan X and the r9
px I would easily recommend picking up
this card over the reference design and
keeping in mind the price to performance
ratio we're giving it the harbor
connects damn good award so what do you
guys think about the gtx 980ti super
clock plus a CX 2.0 plus GPU would you
pay an extra $30 for better cooling
extending performance and a card that
runs nearly silent leave us your
