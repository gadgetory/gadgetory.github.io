great technology selection and service
hello everyone I'm Dimitri with
hurricane axe and can a $200 smartphone
off-contract the actually any good in
2015 when we were first approached by
ZTE to review this latest phone the
grand x+ this is the first handset to be
designed in Canada that's an important
distinction we were honestly a little
bit skeptical given the fairly scattered
reputation that clouds ZTE smartphones
so we questioned the supposedly
added credibility of this design in
Canada label to the actual quality of
the smartphone based on their new
research and development office in
Ottawa but despite initial doubts with
the Grand x+ I must admit that so far
I've been fairly impressed with what
this has to offer for the price
especially since its carrier unlocked
the display is 5 inches with 1280 by 720
p resolution nothing groundbreaking but
it is an IPS panel with outstanding
viewing angles there are no color
shifting excellent brightness range and
for the value smartphone we think that's
possible under the hood we are running
Snapdragon 400 quad-core chip at 1.2
gigahertz with adreno 305 GPU
disappointing limiting 8 gigabytes of
internal storage with 2 gigs of ram LTE
support that's an awesome thing it's got
a beefy 2300 million power battery and
these specs are pretty much identical to
the Moto G from Motorola the phone that
was released at the end of 2013 so this
is designed in Canada for Canadians a
statement is a little bit washy because
it's a spec loan from the Moto G and the
design element I'm sorry to say but it
looks like the Nexus S which is you know
dates all the way back to 2010 now this
is not to say that ZTE s Canadian branch
is in the wrong track but the truth does
serve as an incentive to be more
innovative
then back to the grand X bus the body is
nothing special it's a little chunky
individuals who want that five inch form
factor would be happy this is definitely
a phone for two-hand operation not sure
how people would feel about capacitive
buttons but that's there with really
old-looking icons nicely done designers
the power button is on the right with
perfect reach for your thumb and
individual volume up and down on the
other side that offers outstanding
clicky registration there's a microUSB
at the bottom and headphone jack up
above the rear shooter is 8 megapixels
with a single tone flash and the 2
megapixel front-facing cameras are find
for a $200 phone but you better shoot in
HDR to preserve color and dynamic range
but this would also test your patience
as the low-end specs really reveal the
aging processing of every single shot I
love the small blinking LED in the top
left corner to indicate unread activity
with a green color and a dying battery
with the red LED there's a tiny speaker
the bottom that actually is very loud no
missed calls on this one now the one
thing that that truly dislike about this
phone is the plastic back luckily it is
removable to get you access to the 2300
milliamp hour battery there's your SIM
card slot and the micro SD card slot for
expandable storage so that's a huge
bonus for media but the cover does not
have any texture the reflective nature
reveals all the handling marks and any
physical wear but the main thing is how
slippery the phone is I've dropped it a
few times because of it you better put a
case on it I'm happy to say this is
running very close to stock Android with
KitKat 4.4 point 4 I installed the
Google launcher here and aside from the
slow camera everything is very snappy
and loads fast there's an occasional
Google now hiccup but the experience is
very close to my own Nexus 4 I was also
very surprised to find no preloaded
bloatware only their own camera app with
the built-in time-lapse feature there is
really cool plus 1080p video capture and
what you see now is recorded with the
grand X plus there's a built-in Power
Save mode with the grand X plus and
disables the data and Wi-Fi reduces
brightness
and all the other things that are
running in the background and only
powers on the essentials that would turn
the last 10% of the battery into four
plus hours of additional runtime
standard battery life lasted me a good
day and a half without needing to
recharge throughout those times so
that's very good to see but it is when
we get down to the nitty gritty stuff
all the compromises surface like the a
gigabytes of internal storage capacity
that only equates to 4.5 gigabytes of
usable storage system updates must come
through ZTE and who knows how frequent
those are Wi-Fi range on the Grand X bus
was very poor the poorest out of my
entire phone collection in my bedroom
about eight meters away it would not
pick up any Wi-Fi signal whereas my
Nexus 4 my BlackBerry z10 and my iPhone
5s
had at least two bars and had no
connection to Wi-Fi no problem call
quality passable satisfactory I could
hear the other person on the other line
just fine actually reduce the volume a
little bit there's a little too harsh
they could hear me just fine through the
microphone nothing to complain about
plus a huge bonus built-in LTE and over
all it is an attractive handset for $200
that plays all my games without hiccups
the display does not suck and in fact
it's one of the strongest elements of
the granik's bus it is very close to
stock Android but with support for
Google launcher that shouldn't really
matter for 2015 at this price there's
still many Oh seriously moments like the
extremely slippery back that isn't very
good for handling and only eight
gigabytes of capacity that translates to
4.5 gigabytes of usable storage that's
pathetic might be a reason why the
design and Canada label is almost
invisible and so tiny and muted because
there's clearly more work to do I'm not
saying the Grand x+ is a bad smartphone
it's not but it's not exciting either
drop that price by 50 bucks and now
we're talking you're golden and super
competitive so guys let us know which
phone you're rocking at the moment and
if you are looking for budget options
exploring your value phones does the
Grand x+ excite you in any way and for
us Canadians does this design in Canada
label matter to you do you care that
this
was designed in Canada let us know in
