brought to you by and cix technology
connected hey guys I'm here with Michael
at the Intel booth preview and we're
here to talk about Edison now can you
give us a basically a brief description
and see what exactly is that ISM so
Edison is a new computer system so it's
a complete computer system with with
Wi-Fi Bluetooth flash and DRAM and it is
the size so this is a 50 card form
factor it actually fits in an SD card
slot you could but it actually runs
Linux and you can run arbitrary
applications on it so you can do things
like stick it in the camera and have it
automatically post books your Facebook
page you can use to control a robot and
actually it's actually a dual-core quark
buster
and it actually runs to operating
systems a real-time operating system and
legs and the the reason that we have the
real-time operating system is because
control devices so in addition to the
ordinary SD contacts we also have a set
of programmable IO defile pins and these
can do pulse width modulation to control
motors they can do general purpose i/o
tutors to digital i/o in and out for
buttons in the sort of thing you can
also do I to see there's a serial
communication lets you talk to display
lets you talk to all kinds of other
sensors like motion sensors or whatever
so it's a full system designed to do
used for device control that can include
wearables they can also include home
automation robotics all kinds of I've
seen things and what's up applications
are we looking at here Anna right so
this is a couple demonstration
applications so this is basically an
internet-enabled mug so you know you
have a display embedded in the mug and
this small enough this can go inside the
wall of the mug and so this display
could show tweets it could show the
weather it could show the temperature in
your house it could be it could be as a
showman keynote last night you could
have a motor sensor based on Edison
measuring temperature and transmitting
that here so we've a baby with a
temperature model
and you can see that information being
displayed here or you know you could
have your friends work out and you know
all conformationally displayed here this
is one possibility of course there's
many other things you can do with it so
we've also looking at user interface
devices like handheld devices so guys I
think this is a a big stepping-stone in
the revolution in not only wearable tech
with small computing devices so thanks
for taking a look at our coverage of
what is an impressive little I don't
want to call it a chip because it's a
complete system Edison at the Intel 2014
CES booth preview now guys I want you to
like it if you like it don't dislike it
because there's nothing here to dislike
and make sure you hit that follow button
and keep on checking back for more
Hardware Canucks hard-hitting kick-ass
