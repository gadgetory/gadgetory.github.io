accent hello on the train what's wrong
the hype train so yes no man's sky may
be the biggest steam launch for 2016
it's a little bit crazy to think that
but it sure has crushed so many
expectations of many loaded with
complaints red thumbs from the community
so today we're gonna take a look at the
two latest mid-range GPUs the Ark's 480
and the GTX 1060 and see which camp was
more prepared with day one drivers for
the game and which one gives us better
performance this video is sponsored by

HWC I normally listen to podcast and
read sci-fi novels but the massive
selection of books and someone reading
them to you it's quite appealing I've
been listening the brain maker which is
a fascinating story that connects the
science of microorganisms in your gut to
the health of your brain it's quite
fascinating to listen to while I edit

to get your free audio book with a
30-day trial happy listening in our
previous video with the gtx 1060 versus
the RX 480 we determined that the gtx
1060 on average was 8% faster at 1440p
versus the RX 480 and this is based on
10 games in total so let's launch no
man's sky and here's the run that I
completed on both cards so I start by
destroying these two lovely trees jump
over to this mighty tree beside me laser
these crystals for some more isotopes
jump to this rock and activate my
scanner and basically form a perimeter
around the building using these large
trees as my reference points of where to
go then I jump into my Gabor Ã«okay s340
seriously who comes up with these stuff
and proceeded to fly across this body of
water until we hit the observation tower
and fire some photo cannon into it
then we'll exit the atmosphere facing
the a little distant planet then turn
towards the closest larger planet and
activate my pulse Drive
- which turning the ship around and
observe this water planet so I feel this
run is pretty fair giving us a good
representation of the range in the
performance realm we are on the planet
on foot then we are in the spaceship and
then we're in space and then we're doing
the hyperdrives which basically
surrounds your entire gameplay for no
man's sky graphically it feels like this
game should not be demanding as textures
are basically non-existent draw distance
is pretty poor so I ran to presets at
1440p with everything on high and then
everything on medium as well the game
was restarted to take effect to see how
the cards would handle no man's sky and
so at medium settings I was pretty
surprised at how poor the game ran on
average with the gtx 1060 giving us a
whopping 40% better score with much
better minimums some frame fluctuations
are present on both cards this is not an
optimized game in any way with much
better performance while in space
instead of the planet turning everything
on high and on average the gtx 1060
performs 38% better but look at that
minimum and how it lines up with the
arcs for a DS average while experiencing
smoother frame rates over time on the
NVIDIA GPU another interesting test was
VRAM usage for the gtx 960 consuming 3.7
gigabytes a full gigabyte more than the
2.7 on the rx 480 and so the conclusion
is simple no man's sky is a poorly
optimized game especially for aim the
hardware giving us 40 percent less
performance on the RX 4 80 versus gtx
1060 now hello games has hired the
quality assurance team that is a larger
than their developers team to solve a
bunch of problems and here's hoping that
we'll get a better driver update as no
man's sky continues to be in the top 10
games by Steam player count so it's
still fairly significant fairly fresh
but I feel that you know excitement may
dip quite significantly if it's not
fixed for optimization so I hope you
guys enjoyed this short video if you are
playing no man's sky let us know what
performance you're getting and if you're
enjoying the game at all I'm a Dimitri
with our Canucks thanks much watching
we'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
