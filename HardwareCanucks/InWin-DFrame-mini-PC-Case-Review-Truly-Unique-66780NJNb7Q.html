great technology selections and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
hurricane accent from our own
experiences in wind has gained a
reputation for incredible quality for
their chassis designs their 900 series
like the 904 and the 901 are some of the
best build cases out there full
aluminium frame done extremely well with
tempered glass side panels the
compromise we found on each of those was
the lack of functionality as internal
layout on both cases wasn't the best it
could be plus the incredibly expensive
price point limited the overall target
audience and so today we're taking a
look yet another truly unique chassis in
our eyes at least that follows the same
formula of Wow built quality but is the
internal layout doom dysfunctional has
with their other chassis so let's find
out this is the D frame mini a totally
open air concept with a staggering price
of $350 now before jumping off your
seats let's quickly talk for whom this
case is for as it is far from ideal for
your standard build first this is mini
ITX only having a rotated motherboard
design you can see the tool only PCI
slots up top there's no dust filters
anywhere and you know how I feel about
dust filtration air flow options are
limited to your CPU cooler and the dual
120mm fans at the bottom with the
bracket channeling airflow up so there
are no other fan options here
the sturdy handle up top may indicate
potential use for land parties it sure
is easy to carry and perhaps even to do
your morning workout I'm not even
kidding it is difficult to showcase how
sturdy the entire aluminum frame is but
it feels like one solid piece with
really confident joints the red rubber
padding on all the sides means softer
and non-slip landing
what's the ability to rollcage this
thing on whatever side you prefer even
laying it down works just fine the
tempered glass is tented it's definitely
one of the unique features of in wind
designs they are reflective on there are
certain angles and that will hide
internal hardware of course given this
is glass and microfiber cloth is
included to get rid of any handling
marks and you will have to try really
hard in order to scratch the surface as
the glass is fairly resilient the panels
are also interchangeable and are held in
by four thumb screws plus in win has
made sure to put appropriate amount of
padding on the inserts to avoid any
direct contact with the glass the front
i/o panel includes dual USB three
awesome PR buttons now the power button
on our sample was a bit wobbly and
there's no way to access the reset
switch unless you poking it with a pen
or something thin the power supply spot
is in the back users have the
flexibility for installation on either
top or the bottom slot depending on your
build and how you want the cables to
exit plus there is a large opening on
the side to route the cables behind the
motherboard tray and given the limited
amount of ventilation potential on the
frame itself where the D frame Mini is
cut you'll want the power supply fan
facing out to avoid any potential
overheating also this slot is plenty
long to allow for 200-plus millimeter
units to be installed without any
problems and so getting inside the case
there are a few things that I want to
mention regarding in wins attention to
detail on all levels of quality first
all black cables are appreciated to make
sure the system stays clean every single
edge on this piece is refined like the
side panels are completely smooth so
there's no worry of cutting yourself
same with the internal aluminum plates
the motherboard tray is clean without
any defects and just slide the rounded
edges means completely safe handling the
same translates over to all the cable
cutouts so you can be sure that anything
that passes through will remain uncut
and I say this because we worked with
many aluminum cases in the past where
this wasn't addressed so this is really
good to see moving on the three plates
sticking out are your drive plates
removed with two thumb screws at the
bottom that stay with the plate awesome
to see compatible with both three and a
half and two and a half inch drives
meaning you can only have three drives
installed at once and
the frame mini a couple things to
mention there are no rubber pads for
mounting the mechanical drive that I
would have liked to see to minimize the
noise plus the SSD mount is slightly
offset so the SATA connections aren't as
close to the edge of the bracket as the
mechanical drive is that will require a
straight SATA connection as the
90-degree SATA connection will not fit
as I mentioned before the only airflow
option here is the dual fan bracket at
the bottom that removes in a similar
fashion with dual thumb screws that stay
on with the panel as well
this will allow easier installation of
fans and a 2-14 on the radiator if you
do mount one but I would have liked to
see additional support by the edge of
the bracket for complete confidence in
the hold when transporting the case the
one thing that in when did take into
account is the length of the bracket as
it's not on the way for your graphics
card and that's considerate with over 30
centimeters available for your GPU
clearance and with the build assembled
here's what the D frame Mini looks like
with a system inside it was a less
conventional process but nevertheless a
pretty straightforward one they were a
few hiccups though now first mini ATX
board layout do vary significantly with
each brand our 24 pin connection for
example is off to the side on our MSI
board without a cut out on that side to
route that large cable so that means
slightly more difficult routing for that
massive cable for the rest of the
connections while they do seem a bit
crammed in I was able to clean up nicely
with only the 8 pin CPU cable going over
the motherboard tray connecting the GPU
was actually pretty simple there is a
large cutout on the frame right in from
the power supply but there is no way of
dealing with this cable mess at the back
and I would have loved to see some type
of cover that would hide them and
collect them all for a clean and lock
now overall I'm actually quite happy
with how this turned out but I did
remove the fan bracket at the bottom as
our motherboard only has two fan headers
one of which is already occupied by the
CPU cooler and that's something you
should keep in mind once considering to
build inside this case
getting things prepared behind the
motherboard tray was also a bit tricky
as you have to make sure the cables are
as flat as possible in order to avoid
any bending on the glass panel in when
does supply several large and small
plastic loops that you secure to the
case that would contain the cables and
that work beautifully as you screw the
hoops in place and no need to glue
anything and avoid potentially an
attractive cable ties the problem was
that not all holes at the back of the
motherboard tray have the thread I'm not
sure if that's intentional but this does
limit some areas for cable routing as
you can't secure them to the tray also
be aware of the exiting cables from the
top io do to flip motherboard design but
it's actually great for me as I switch
peripherals so often for review so
having this access is very convenient
and one last thing to mention before
conclusion is it actually functional you
can clearly see that not every inch of
this internal layout is utilized even if
the fan bracket was installed I don't
think having those drive plates is the
most efficient system but I don't hate
it
this would work really well for a
showcase system and I think that would
be the intent given the obvious list of
drawbacks that you would consider for a
casual dil now first let's outline the
positives it is unique there's no doubt
about that with the best quality for
chassis in this category that is also so
portable there's so much attention to
detail when it comes to refinement of
edges all black cables Tula's Drive and
fan brackets rubber padding on all the
sides and interesting cable management
system that really works but the
question is is the internal layout any
good I would say to the most part it is
I would have liked to see more threaded
mounts on the motherboard tray for cable
management loops I really don't want to
mention the spoofing as that's a given
considering it's a totally open air
concept I can't even think of how you
would implement fooled us proofing while
keeping this form and design of course
price comes to mind as it is an
expensive showpiece but what makes the D
frame mini so unique as it breaks all
the rules but
manages to hold its own ground probably
for 99% of the builds it won't be
suitable providing the drawbacks yet
there's something so interesting about
this frame that could potentially lead
to even more refined enclosures taking
functionality to the next level and so
that concludes our review of this really
awesome little case is always leave your
thoughts in the comments below we'd love
to hear what you think of this
unconventional enclosure thanks for
