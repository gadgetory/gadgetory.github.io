at AMD and Markham Ontario my name is
Vincent tang I'm a graphics applications
engineer for AMD at this location today
we're showing off our ultra workstation
this is a workstation running four of
our new W 9100 graphics cards the W 9100
features 16 gigabytes of gddr5 vram runs
at five teraflops single precision
compute power at its peak it also runs
two teraflops of double precision
performance and it retails for $4,000 so
the W 9100 is based off of our newest
hawaii architecture in the system we're
running four w 90 100 s each can support
up to six displays and each card can run
six 4k displays simultaneously without a
DisplayPort 1.2 MST hub it's very
impressive for what we have today the
system is designed to be used with CAD
apps animation 3d modeling and other
professional-grade applications and with
the W 90 100 we really see great
performance especially with open CL 2.0
support as OpenCL 2.0 is rolled out
we'll continue to see the benefits of
running the W 90 100 our system here in
total cost about $25,000 accounting for
four GPUs at four thousand dollars each
and our two CPUs which retail for about
$3,000 each were running Intel Xeon to 6
9 7 s altogether as I said it's $25,000
roughly and as we see many apps are
moving over to open CL this is a great
system and a great card for any
professional or lousiest
our vector 150 Drive this is our current
top align client SATA drive
it's got industry-leading performance
industry-leading endurance the one thing
that we like to harm about our</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
