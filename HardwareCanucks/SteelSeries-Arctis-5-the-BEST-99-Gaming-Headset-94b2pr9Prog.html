are finally here we have received so
many requests to take a look at these I
have the 3 the 5 and the 7 today we're
taking a look at the 5 simply because
it's a Matsui price point of $99 let's
see how it stacks up based on all the
claims of the best microphone on the
gaming headset and other claims that
they're related in eSports that we are
going to ignore so let's see how they
stack up right after this explore your
future with the cosmos 2 case and
celebrate 25 years of ambition the
drives cooler master forward enjoy the
familiar yet still forward-looking
character of the frame with solid
aluminum handles it may be the most
physical you'll ever get with the
computer case but it's all worth while
or get creative with any of the 13
storage options that encourage outside
the box thinking meanwhile the curve
temple glass panels on both sides
ensures a lasting impression classically
trained but still ready for anything
the Coolermaster cosmos - let's
celebrate the past by building for the
future
alright so it's $99 the arctas 5 is
competitively priced compared to like
the GSP 300 from Sennheiser which are
awesome and they're priced also the same
as the newest number of the G series
from Logitech the g4 33 or the very
well-known HyperX cloud 2 so the body is
very light and it's made entirely of
plastic but nothing creaks which is good
and I do like the matte coating there's
this one visible joint point though
between the two plastic pieces on the
headband that I wish was smooth you know
but it's not a big deal the headband is
a two-piece design with an adjustable
fabric that is available in multiple
colors and it supports the headset
pretty well for small to medium sized
heads but for example if you expand the
fabric piece for a larger head it will
be the plastic headband that will hold
the headset and not the fabric for me
personally the size adjustment is fine
even with lots of hair but because the
ear cups swivel to sit on your neck like
this it's a bit tighter than I want and
the fabric could be slightly smoother
because if there's any
it's just not pleasant also you have to
get into a habit of removing the headset
with both hands otherwise the joint on
one side or the other absorbs the weight
and the rotation of the headset which in
the long run I think might cause the
joint to fail the ear cups however feel
quite nice on the skin
unlike the fabric on a headband they can
breathe and there's the angle drivers
inside the ear cup for better audio
direction my only point of feedback
would be to add more padding in the
center of the ear cup to avoid any
contact with the plastic housing
underneath it on the left side we get a
mic mute button that sticks out and is
easy to find plus a red LED is visible
on the mic itself for new muted which is
awesome there's also a volume wheel
right here that has very little travel
but it completely mutes the volume at
the - position then there's the USB
connection and a 3.5 millimeter input
Jack that is used for audio sharing
which is kind of strange so you can plug
in a set of headphones and that person
will hear what you hear I cannot think
of a situation where I would personally
use this feature to like audio share
with a buddy or something but let me
know what you think of this in the
comments below alright so this is what
the microphone sounds like on the arcus
v I think it sounds good
good low and pick up it's not nasally
clear vocals there's only a tiny bit of
digital noise in the background when
noise reduction is disabled so right now
it's on medium and if I stop speaking
there's only a tiny bit of this noise
that you can hear also keep in mind the
microphone will still be on even if it's
inserted inside the headset and to avoid
bursting any eardrums if your volume is
maxed out and people are listening to
you avoid handling the microphone
because all that is severely picked up
it's just unpleasant
keep the distance to the microphone
because it is sensitive you know don't
keep the microphone but yeah very happy
with the mic now let's hear how it
compares to the GSP 300 so this is the
GSP 300 another $99 gaming headset now
the input for the microphone is
different this is going directly into my
motherboard versus the arctas five
handles all the processing and its own
USB DAC so take that into account there
is more digital noise here because I
have not applied any noise reduction
in the motherboard software but I think
I prefer the sound of this one that a
bit better it's more natural it's more
clean it's not as processed as what we
hear on the arcus 5 but still very
acceptable your microphone on both
headsets and I would prefer the
convenience of a single port like a USB
plug it into your computer and you're
good to go in the package we get the
headphone cable a 3.5 millimeter adapter
and the USB sound card that also acts as
your chat on your mixer so if you use
teamspeak or Skype or other
communication applications while gaming
there's a very good way to either say
mute your chat so that all you hear is
the game or you can just go directly
into your communications muting the game
completely or go into that middle and
play around with that balance so it's a
nice thing to have plus it's a very
fitting feature to have for a gaming
headset just double check that your
playback devices are configured properly
I do like the modularity aspect of the 5
but this also introduces many points of
failure and the main headphone cable is
using the not so common USB mini-b
8 pin cable so if you're plugging this
into your phone or a game controller you
need to use the 3.5 millimeter headphone
adapter that is a 4-pole plug and will
carry the microphone signal as well and
because of both USB and analog
connections it is cross-platform
compatible but the RGB lighting of
course requires that USB connection
which by the way is very tasteful I know
it's totally unnecessary on a gaming
headset and I wish I could disable the
SteelSeries logo but the sin ambient
strip around the ear cups is uniform so
it's very visually appealing and can be
configured with a few motion effects and
Perseid color control or they can be
completely disabled in terms of audio
performance I think it's a fun headset
really nice detailed sound signature
without any harsh treble the bass is
fine still allowing those deep hits to
come through without overpowering the
rest of the frequencies and because this
is run through USB there is enough power
so that you don't have to worry about
all is the volume too low and plus the
very good thing is there's no distortion
at high volumes plus we have very good
stereo imaging for spatial orientation
the soundstage is a bit small compared
to what I get on my game one
so in battlegrounds for
sample you can pinpoint where the
distance fire is coming from but you
don't get that sense of that super large
environment so I could hear that player
sneaking below me and waiting for me to
come down and I knew exactly where he
was but then my aim failed me and so for
competitive play it's very good because
the stereo spatial detail is excellent
but as soon as you enable that surround
sound with DTS X it just completely
falls apart in the audio department so
DTS X enabled we lose all details
separations so there's no longer these
elements that you can pinpoint and hear
exactly what's happening it's like a
super audio without those distinct
elements many important audio cues like
your footsteps other people's footsteps
incoming fire Direction gets completely
destroyed you lose positional awareness
you do gain a bit of that larger sense
of the environment but with the
compromise of completely destroying the
proper sound signature and this makes me
angry because in mind the only one who
thinks surround sound should die you get
much better positional accuracy and much
better soundstage and much better detail
element separation in your audio cues in
stereo mode and there's no need to
cripple very good drivers on this
headset with virtual software surround
sounds and in the week I've been playing
around with this headset I've
experienced a few hiccups such as this
connection issues from the main USB port
where the headset would light up the USB
sound card would light up but the
headset would not actually show up in
the software nor in the properties until
I restart my system I've also
experienced this weird volume glitch
where the volume both on the headset and
then the software was maxed out but I
was not able to hear it maxed out it was
kind of low and quiet and it was only
fix itself when I would move the slider
back and forth and then back to 100%
both of these issues luckily seems to be
software related so the volume glitch
only happened once while the headset
disconnection issue happened to me twice
in the week I've had this thing be ready
4x to 99 with as rocks flagship gaming
eye 9 motherboard the world's first to
feature a quantity at 10 gigabits per
second LAN port for extreme bandwidth a
13 space power designed for smooth power
delivery and rely
overclocking and of course USB 3.1 type
C that can also charge your devices of
up to 36 watts more info in description
below
so for conclusion I think still series
have done a good job making sure to
check off as many of those marketing
points as possible for that sweet $99
price point really tasteful RGB
illumination nice design matte black
coating aside from this a weird little
joint point they're comfortable multiple
headband colors you know little
customization options really good
microphone also because it's going
through USB nice - noise reduction and
they're you know the only concern would
be for the size because they don't
expand and they only rely on this top
fabric headband for size expansion which
might be an issue for larger heads but
for $20 less the arctas 3 may be a
better option simply because it's an
identical headset in every way aside
from not having that USB sound card that
also acts as your chat sound mixer thing
so if you want to save yourself 20 bucks
and get really good stereo sound get the
artist 3 if you don't care about the RGB
elimination because this is just plain
$79 good sound good microphone recommend
it and so that's it I have enjoyed my
time with the artists 5 the RGB
illumination ask yourself if it's worth
the $20 and also because of that USB
connection it is more convenient for
laptop users and maybe for those who
don't have good onboard audio that is of
course your best bet but it's not
perfect and I'm not giving it in the
word because they're selling it as a
surround sound headset without the
proper maybe software equalizer tuned in
to make sure that it delivers but
inferior mode let's say if this was just
a stereo gaming headset it would get my
award because in stereo is just
fantastic and surround sound it's not so
