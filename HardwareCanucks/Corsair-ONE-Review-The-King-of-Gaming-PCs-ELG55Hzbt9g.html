Canucks welcome to another video I am
genuinely excited about the courser one
which is not just a case it's a fully
pre-built system by course they're
combining as many of their own products
as possible and this is not a test
system either you will actually be able
to go out and buy the Corsair one now we
add our economics it has a bit of an
interaction with Corsair one from its
infancy stages back at Comdex 2016 where
we have to build in one give some
feedback to Corsair then in CES they
also showcase the coarser one in this
maturity and now we have one Eber
received this in this beautiful Pelican
case which by the way is only for
reviewers I wish the consumers would
also get that but ya know secure the
full details on the coarser one we were
taking away right after message from our
sponsor you can only rely on the pros do
the job with every keystroke satisfying
like the millions before it
quality feels every key regardless of
your faith kula master master keys bro
take it with you make it do it India
tree wonderful pre-roll and thank you
for that intro the guys this is the
Corsair one I say you need compacts
pre-built system with passing liquid
cooling inside it's really designed for
a refreshing and quiet plug-and-play
solution specifically for gamers we
really appreciate what Corsair is done
with the one you know it's pending from
their typical product lineup beyond
components and teaming up with MSI to
create this awesome showcase of
engineering I can't stop staring at this
thing it looks really good despite our
hopeful requests the enclosure will not
be sold separately apparently due to
extremely complicated assembly process
in such a tiny form factor that's kind
of disappointing because ITF users
always faced a challenge regardless and
for size comparison the one is 12 liters
in volume pretty compact at only 38
centimeters in height here sitting next
to the s3 40 for reference externally
the one plays an excellent balance of
appealing to gamers without being overly
aggressive while still holding
simplicity points to be considered an
attractive piece of hardware with a
dark-gray aluminium shell and this cool
ventilation pattern on both sides
although the white imprint of the logo
and the model name visually complicates
the front panel a little too much the
two LED strips on the front are a
perfect example of Corsairs wanting to
preserve the character by not making
them RGB I'm actually totally okay with
that decision and you should be too it
helps to separate the one versus similar
machines like the msi vortex or the ACS
g20 with pretty significant variances
between the three the front IO
includes a power button HDMI 2.0 and USB
3.0 but we see no audio jacks on one
hand this helps to minimize cable
clutter at the front but the one is
meant to sit by your side on the desk
and leaving the rest of the i/o at the
back is less comfortable here we get a
full range of us be including 3.1 gen2
type-c standard 3.1 gen 1 and 2.0 ports
with ps2 Gigabit LAN and AC Wi-Fi
antennas and finally audio ports with
digital audio out display connectivity
is
from the GPU inside with two DisplayPort
1.4 and a single HDMI 2.0 plus notice
the AC power connector the thickest
cable is at the very bottom that is much
appreciated there will be three models
of the one the base model starts at
$1,800 with an i7 7700 non K CPU which
is liquid cooled a blower style gtx 1070
a 240 gigabyte SSD along with a one
terabyte hard drive and 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 ram at 2400 megahertz next here is
the corsair 1 pro with an unlocked 7700
K and a gtx 1080 both of which are
liquid gold 16 gigabytes of ram and
double the storage for $2,200 the most
premium system is the corsair 1 pro
webstore which can only be purchased
through Corsairs official website and
not regular retail stores that doubles
the SSD capacity to 960 gigabytes and
drops the spinning disk for $100 more
and each corsair one comes with an FFX
80 plus gold power supply Windows 10
home 2 year warranty with phone support
and dedicated service finish to handle
pre-built system troubleshooting so
obviously a question of value is
important and piecing together an
identical custom system as the one pro
we arrive at roughly nineteen hundred
dollars plus or minus thirty five
percent when taking sales and price
fluctuations into account so as with any
fully built PC you might purchase and
ask yourself if the $300 premium is
worth in now all the components are
industry standard meaning if you want to
replace anything aside from the coolers
you are able to do so but the one shifts
with a Z to Sony motherboard with a
custom BIOS from Corsair so for example
XMP memory profiles will not engage as
the BIOS was designed for these specific
lpx modules and frequency there are no
pre-loaded overclocking BIOS and any
updates surrounding the motherboard will
come exclusively from Corsair so let's
take a look at the most interesting part
of the one pro the interior layout it is
mind boggling clever
Corsair does not recommend disassembling
the one due to the complexity of wiring
everything inside this home factor but
accessing the interior is made simple
there's a button at the weird to unlatch
the top cap that houses a PWM controlled
140 millimeter maglev fan the interior
separated by two chambers walls of which
you remove with two screws as seen here
on each side this will unleash these
side panels and reveal be cooling magic
both CPU and the GPU have a slim 240
millimeter radiator attached there are
no fans on the sides except for the
blower fan on the GPU so the entire
system is cooled with a single 140
millimeter mangle F an exhausting from
the top this creates negative pressure
and the air is drawn from the side
ventilation which is why the system can
be so quiet at idle the system is dead
silent while I'd load you here the top
fan ramped up but the main noise
generators are the power supply fan and
the pump let's take a listen
of course there's link software monitors
component temperatures in real-time
which then sets a fan curve to provide
additional cooling now while gaming
things change up a little bit because
the power supply fan ramps up quite loud
which shouldn't be a surprise either
because there's very little room between
the fan and the chassis it's not
terrible but don't expect complete
silence while playing games or other
intensive tasks temperatures are next
and I'm completely impressed with the
passive airflow method on both radiators
keeping things supercool at idle while
reaching 82 degrees C on the CPU when it
boosts to 4.5 gigahertz and there's a
lot of headroom for overclocking the
1080 by seeing those low temps in the
sepia chamber you can easily spot the
motherboard Ram power supply built-in
Wi-Fi module two two and a half inch
drive bays with one preoccupied and I
really want a credit Corsair for the
awesome cable management working inside
a case of this size can bring up its own
challenges plus this should also help
with air for movement in such a cramped
space switching over to the GPU chamber
there is an empty slot behind the
motherboard but accessing it means
removing the GPU which isn't so easy
unfortunately the one does not have m
dot 2 SSD options so from our course air
force le SSD don't expect crazy read and
write performance so the one looks
beautiful and Corsair her surprises with
the internal layout especially with
their approach on cooling but what kind
of performance does it bring to the
table battlefield one at 1440 pset2
ultra averaged over 75 frames per second
and it into the high 50s
overwatch at 1440 P set to epic averaged
over 95 frames per second and dished out
minimums in the low 60s Tom Clancy's
Ghost Recon violent which is a slightly
more demanding title taxed out on the
GTX 1080 averaging close to 70 frames
per second and dipped into the low 50s
lastly doom at 1440 pset2 ultra gave us
over 135 per second on average and
minimums hitting just south of 100 what
surprised me the most was the core
temperature on the card as you can see
the maximum it was able to hit was 58
see so the liquid cooler is doing its
job really well plus it has a lot of
headroom for overclocking which we'll
probably do another video on I was
curious to test out some render times in
Premiere and compared to my six core
4930 K PC and the one rendered out our
standard one-minute 4k project 10
seconds faster than my PC really one
really software wise the machine comes
free of clutter geared towards gamers
with pre-installed game launchers but
aside from the corsair link software
there are no overclocking suite and be
mindful that corsair isn't promoting
overclocking nor are they against it
it's kind of a gray zone with regard to
warranty so approach gigahertz sing with
caution guys I love the final product
Corsa one is the definition of a
portfolio showcase you know everything
from the ground up case design to the
integration of trusted hardware and this
collaboration with MSI will not go
unnoticed and while this is targeted
towards the gaming market the silence
and cool operation widens disco for
potential customers in the equator field
this machine is not for DIY builders but
targets users who pay the premium for
all the size benefits and this unique
build and it deserves our Harbor
connects damn innovative award oh hey
there NC XCOM is Canada's leading a
tailor for anything your mind desires
just keep within those categories which
are plenty and be attempted by the
weekly deals visit n CX dot compare all
them sweet deals so stay tuned for our
overclocking adventure to see how far we
can push the 7700 K and the GTX 1080
inside this passively cooled interior
and let us know what you guys think
about the pricing strategy on these
models on Newberg's hurricane axe thank
you so much for watching and we'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
