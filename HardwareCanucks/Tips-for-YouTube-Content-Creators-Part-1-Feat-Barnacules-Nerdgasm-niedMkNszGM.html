canucks welcome to another behind the
scenes I am actually super ecstatic
about this episode today don't get
interrupted by text messages in the
middle of the video I'm actually super
ecstatic about this episode we have
because we have a very special guest on
the show and we'll be talking about
concepts and ideas that benefit
everybody that within the community that
we've built on the all the video
platforms so we have very special guest
Jerry a ka-bar necklace nerdgasm on this
episode talking about tips and tricks
for content producers and content
creators hey what's up Dimitri thanks
for having me in your video and I invite
him on the show because he has one of
the most memorable characters on YouTube
hardware Canucks they're Canadian so you
don't have to we're going behind the
scenes of talking our heart out of how
we can help build your character we're
on how to build character about what
character really means within the
Buddhist and within this industry well
how to build an audience what it means
to have good quality and consistent
quality of content and what that means
to stay motivated and also what does it
mean for their to exist competition and
how you can benefit from the competition
and certain things that you shouldn't do
as well when it comes to the competition
so guys I'm really excited for this
episode this can be a two-parter just
because I don't want to create a 30
minute video and we have a lot of
insight to share so let's get started so
one comes to content production I truly
believe that character is very important
how do you stay yourself how do you
present yourself and from the camera
like for instance i'm sitting on a
toilet right now some people might find
that offensive but that's not the
audience i'm looking for now when it
comes to character for me as you guys
know for the first two years that i've
been making videos for hardware canucks
i basically remained off camera and
they're really focused on making my
craft of making those products stand out
in a pure white background that at the
time i think was the state of the art on
the YouTube community and then it came
time to be to evolve and trying to do
something different and that's when we
started doing a lot more things of more
home style of more creative things in
terms of adding more elements into your
frame and into your shot my two
characters is on camera sort of wrong
information something that I've started
to do with this series behind the scenes
and how to stuff but every time there is
a review of an item that is me there's
different Dmitry because that's the
Dmitry for reviews concise very
informative and to the point without
anything wasteful in every single word
it's basically like nearly reading a
script and yes things are scripted for
the reviews all right first off I want
to say there is a huge difference
between attracting an audience and
keeping an audience but let's go ahead
and focus on the question and that is
what do I do to attract an audience well
it's pretty obvious from my channel just
by a lot of cool stuff well actually
that's not entirely true there's a lot
more to it what's most important for
attracting an audience initially is how
much time you spend engaging that person
where they're going to see you the first
time and that's going to be in a search
result so you want to make sure you
spend a lot of time on your video titles
you want to spend a lot of time tagging
them properly that's the keywords that
ultimately go into the search engine to
make you go further up the list they
call it SEO search engine optimization
and then you also want to spend a lot of
time on the thumbnail you want the
thumbnail to be engaging people are very
very visual creatures and when you're
looking down the side list you always
notice how the thumbnail that's got the
boobs in it always has about a million
point five views and then you click on
it it's like ninety-nine percent
dislikes yeah we refer to that as
clickbait you do not want to do the
clickbait but what you do want to do is
create the most compelling accurate
image that portrays what your video is
about like for instance I 3d printed a
stormtrooper so what did i do I took
pictures of me and my stormtrooper suit
the superimposed them against the Death
Star now some people might dislike the
video because they're like wait a second
that guy wasn't floating in front of the
Death Star but but most people are going
to be like no okay we get it it's the
context but it draws the eye you want to
draw the eye first to the image the
thumbnail and then you want the people
to move to the video title and those two
things combined I'll make something
click on their head and then they're
going to click the video now you've got
the viewer there there there now they're
watching your video now
you have to focus on keeping that viewer
and that is staying true to the content
matching the same kind of tone is the
thumbnail set so some kind of comedy in
the video try to translate that into the
thumbnails in a very very serious video
try to translate that in the thumbnail
because if the thumbnail does not match
the content you're going to end up
getting a dislike at the very least and
people are going to eventually just shy
away from it SEO is going to go through
the crapper and nobody's going to watch
your video now as far as character I
would say the character is more for
keeping the audience once you brought
them in now you want to keep them and
that character for me it's just myself
you guys probably if you've ever met me
in person you'll know that I'm the same
guy in person as I am on camera and the
reason being is I got over all my fears
of shooting videos early on by treating
the camera like a friend I'm looking at
you like a friend I'm talking to you
like a friend and in my mind I am in a
state of thinking that you're just
somebody who doesn't talk a lot and and
you listen to everything I say and that
helps me tremendously because now I take
on this role of just being the guy that
just talk talk talk talk talk and
telling you about my experience and it's
very very genuine and people seem to
really really kind of relate to that and
a lot of the comments that I get on my
particular channels people feel like
they're right there with me when I'm
doing stuff and and I'm not saying that
that should be everybody's goal
everybody's different but you definitely
need to find your voice you need to find
what's comfortable a lot of people will
try to be somebody they're not they'll
try to do a character they'll try to do
something like that and you can be
successful at doing that but just be
careful because if you do take on a
character or a persona you have to keep
that going throughout your whole
audience because if you get bored of it
and decide to change at some point your
audience is just going to leave because
they expected one thing and now you're
giving them another that's why I prefer
to just be myself only do things that I
care about and that I'm passionate about
because by doing that it doesn't make it
such a chore to keep that up and just
everything that I do seems to keep my
audience around and keep it growing
steadily because it's a group of people
that are like me not a group of people
that I'm trying to be something else to
attract perfect examples as FPSRussia so
everybody knows him by his videos on
guns and he does entertaining things for
you know everyone
wants to see blows the blow stuff up
however he is just pulling off the
Russian accent and it's not real and
everybody kind of knows that but they
accept him for it because it's always
consistent and that's actually key
staying in character is very important
because otherwise people that have come
there in the first place to watch you
are all something to recognize that you
are not the same person that they came
to watch you initially when they first
started to you know company channel but
honestly my biggest tip to anybody is
try to be as close to yourself as
humanly possible because it'll make this
entire process so much easier in the
world is a magnificently huge place
there are so many people out there that
you will find an audience no matter what
your content is now those audiences vary
in size and everything like that you
might have to tweak things around take
on some new things to track the new
audience but I'm just saying at the end
of the day just be yourself don't try to
emulate somebody else because it always
ends bad unless you're PewDiePie then it
ends pretty well but but let's be honest
we're not PewDiePie so the second
question is what a successful content
and how do you achieve that successful
content and how do you keep yourself
motivated so for me successful content
means quality and consistency seriously
quality and consistency and those two
are not mutually exclusive they come as
a package so you have to have quality
content that is also consistent and you
also have a consistent quality content
that is also quality because you want to
create an established relationship with
your publishing schedule so that the
viewers can expect something out of you
and that does not mean creating or
publishing video every day they're just
means to have an expectation for the
viewer on when to expect a video and
make sure to you do your best work is
possible to deliver to that expectation
this is this is kind of a funny question
for me to answer because I would say
that I suck at quality and consistency
I'm not saying that I haven't gotten
better at it I've taken huge steps to
improve the overall quality of my
channel and that's paid huge dividends
but I've never really released on a
schedule and the quality of my videos
changed dramatically because I'm always
trying new things and sometimes I might
not have everything in the lighting and
everything's set up to do something
I still proceed with it because I want
to share that experience with you but I
think what makes it different for me is
that i condition my audience from the
beginning to accept that that's how I am
now if you tried to just create a video
every week and you had you know like you
know talk back tuesday and news
something friday and here i'm gonna eat
a sandwich in front of you saturday
you're going to have a problem if you
stop doing that because people come to
accept it now I've hit that ripple a
couple of times myself and I've created
series like jerry-rigged encode gasm
then I don't create a new one for a very
long time because my squirrel chasing
abilities have me running off and doing
other stuff people that came in during
that series have the expectation that
that's going to keep happening on a
regular cadence and it takes him a while
to get used to it and most of them do
and I experience positive growth as a
result but honestly if I stayed on a
schedule and I released these things on
time and everything and was more
predictable my growth would actually be
a lot better quality for me means
shooting something to best of my
abilities and being satisfied with the
work that I'm doing and being satisfied
with the final edit if I'm not happy
with the final edits if it doesn't make
me smile and let me watch it a couple
more times after the the thing is
published then I I would see myself to
have failed so I actually watched my
videos quite often even if they even
after they're published just to review
back and seeing how I've changed
throughout the time and I would suggest
that for all content producers whether
or not you're just in the beginning
stages or even in the advanced stages
try to define what quality means for you
but try to connect quality with your own
satisfaction and with the feedback that
you get from the viewers because quality
does not necess expensive equipment
quality means being satisfied with your
work and using everything in your
possession for the tools to create the
best thing you could possibly do so for
example right now this shot is led by an
ikea lamp and the on the side of me
there's another light that gives me a
bit of an edge light on this side and
that's just something that I really pull
together so this is what the shot would
look like without those two extra lights
simple ikea light and another simple $20
light from
amazon and so try to use the best tools
that you have and we've published a few
videos in the past check out the
previous episodes on how to do lighting
tips and filming tips and techniques
that you will definitely learn from
something and you definitely have the
joy of shooting in content in being
satisfied with the end result so the
second part of that question is how do
you keep yourself motivated and how do
you keep yourself going best thing for
me is when i get to the editing station
and I put all my source footage in and I
start to look at it and just review and
maybe delete a few things that I haven't
deleted yet in camera and I'm happy with
what I'm seeing that keeps me motivated
as a contact producer to know that I'm
enjoying the footage that I shoot
because as a happy editor your your
video is going to be stunning and you're
going to always try to come up with some
some ways that the final video is going
to be just look amazing and you'll be
very satisfying myself about that now
motivation for me in the past did not
come easily right now it's very exciting
because we have a lot of cool things
that were reviewing and taking a look
and making videos about but in the
earlier days it was difficult for me to
get excited about new case review
because we've reviewed so many I've
reviewed over 200 cases ma'am so what I
used to do then is try to come up and do
something different for each single
video and I've pointed that out in our
how to shoot tutorials on on filming
techniques because every time I try to
do something new it makes me happy try
to even if it's challenging the end
result is kind of what what what really
matters for me when I'm sitting and
editing and then from happy about that
then I am I keep motivate myself to go
further and look forward to that next
video now as far as motivation to do
things YouTube actually started as a
hobby for me I never intended on this
being my career that just kind of
happened as such all of my videos were
more for me and to leave a legacy and to
share up my friends and family than they
were to share with you guys and just
through a ton of events that I'm not
going to really recap here you can go to
my channel and watch videos about it
somehow I just took off and people
really enjoyed what I was doing it
allowed me to get a lot more proud
from companies to review it allowed me
to travel a lot more I probably traveled
more than last year than I have in my
entire life and it's allowed me to do
some really really cool things I love
sharing those experiences with you and
by you guys watching my videos I get the
ability to keep growing and keep doing
even more and more of those things and
that's what's motivational to me it's
being able to wake up every morning and
look at some statistics and look at my
social networks and see that people are
engaging me people enjoy what I'm doing
people are questioning what I'm doing
but but it's all engagement and seeing
that engagement and seeing things raised
its it's an adrenaline rush it's almost
like playing a video game and looking at
the high score so that's what keeps me
motivated but some days I'm not
motivated some days I wake up and I'm
just in a pissy mood I don't want to do
anything I let negativity on the
internet get to me that's another thing
you really have to watch out for guys
but I I on those days I don't touch the
camera because my number one rule is
it's more important for me to be happy
and enjoy what I'm doing when I'm making
a video then feel like I have to make a
video if I have a deadline that I have
to hit and the deadline is a movable
I'll cancel the project if I have to
because I'm not going to force it
because one thing I learned early on
when you force videos on a regular
cadence when you're not in the mood
people totally pick up on it people are
smart they pick up mannerisms they pick
up inflections and voices pretty soon
everybody down in the comments all
sellout sellout sellout this guy doesn't
even look like he enjoys what he's doing
blahblah and I don't like that I really
really don't like to be put in that
position so every video that you see me
make is it comes from a place of passion
if I'm turning on the camera it's
because I feel very strongly about
something or I'm very very excited about
getting something are very excited about
reviewing something or 3d printing
something actually I do i do a lot of
stuff on my channel so it's called
nerdgasm anything if it's nerdy I do it
and there's a lot of stuff that could be
made nerdy but anyways that's where I
get my motivation from but if you don't
feel motivated to make videos do not
force it just relax go play some metal
gear solid 5 or GTA just get out of that
funk and then come back and sit in front
of the camera trust me you'll thank me
