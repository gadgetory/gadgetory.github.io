so-called gaming peripherals will likely
be a bit daunting because let's be real
there are a ton of options out there
that feature RGB lighting dedicated
media playback buttons extra
programmable macros extensive software
suites and the list just goes on but
what about folks who don't want or need
any of these add-ons or you know they
would rather prefer more simple
inexpensive no-nonsense peripherals they
don't still feature a few gaming centric
add-ons
I think Coolermaster has something for
you the dark bass 900 maybe the most
innovative case of the year with a
built-in Qi charger interior lighting
tempered glass that can be installed on
either side and a fully modular interior
that can be inverted if you so desire be
quiet
stepping up their game check it out in
the description below what I have here
is a new combo pack from Coolermaster
they call the master keys light combo
RGB which contains both a keyboard and a
mouse it's priced at $60 which is
similar to the price point of the opt-in
gear that was featured last year on the
channel and can also be considered a
more advanced version of cooler masters
iconic Devastator combo one of the most
interesting additions to this combo are
the so-called
mem Kanaka switches that cool master
uses on the keyboard mechanical switches
are all the rage these days which is and
they come in different forms like Cherry
MX Gator on kale Oprah and the list goes
on men Kanaka on the other hand aims to
replicate the feel of true mechanical
switches without the associated price
premium with this in mind one of my
first goals here is to find out if the
mem chemical switches are any good
getting to the basics the keyboard
switches function with three stages the
tactile don't foundation at the bottom
provides tactile feedback with minimal
noise level on top of that sits the
steady support housing that holds the
key caps and finally the transparent
plunger that allows the LED lighting to
shine through sound simple right
taking a look at a true mechanical
switch in this case Cherry MX blue there
are a lot of more components working
together to get the satisfying actuation
and linear feedback these switches are
more durable and my personal favorites I
have to admit coolermaster has done a
pretty good job with their main chemical
switches
my first impressions were that I was
typing on a plastic switch because of
the sound it produces let's take a
listen key travel is present and minimal
force is required for actuations to take
place furthermore I noticed if I press
the key about 90% down it wouldn't
register until I give it an extra push
because the plunger has to hit the
tactile don't locate it at the base
whereas on a mechanical keyboard when
the key is pressed about 50% down it
registers right away now with normal
typing force I didn't experience any
skip Keys while writing the script or
gaming except on a few occasions if I
need to access certain weapons pressing
the appropriate key while focusing on
movement within a game could be tough so
remember to fully press the key the life
cycle on these switches are said to be
about 12 million which is almost a
quarter of the expected life cycle of a
traditional Cherry MX mechanical switch
it will make a huge difference at the
beginning but they will eventually start
to wear out over time but on the
positive side these switches are
water-resistant and that will avoid all
possibilities of water damage compared
to a mechanical keyboard this also
brings me to the next point programming
for example the Corsair strafe RGB has
dedicated driver software where you can
assign multiple profiles which can be
accessed right away whether that's in
game or while doing something more
productive the master key slide on the
other hand doesn't come with any driver
software so programmable keys are
completely out of the question but at
least in game assignment is an
alternative option it's 2016
so RGB is slowly starting to emerge into
budget gaming market this keyboard
happens to feature RGB with built-in
backlight control effects like speed
area and the direction all these can be
accessed via the function key this is
what actually differentiates it from the
regular master keys light the lighting
is consistent throughout the board only
when you look it from a top angle
otherwise as you can see light struggles
to shine through the key caps because
the LEDs aren't embedded within the
circuit board that's
the rubber dome given how transparent
these layers are light bounces back and
forth to produce the nice ambience
within the keys but compared to the
strafe RGB and it's another story the
multimedia controls are built into the
function keys and there is a Windows
lock button but that's about it if you
want dedicated macro buttons or other
features you should be looking elsewhere
the body is fairly well built and given
the thick plastic chassis there was
noticeable flex but it's nothing to be
worried about Coolermaster hasn't cut
too many corners to make a properly
functioning keyboard you get adjustable
razors to angle the keyboard at your
convenience the UV coated key caps are
compatible with cherry MX stems and I
like the texture on these there is a
dedicated numpad for those who work with
a lot of numbers and overall I think of
getting a solid package for the price
as for the included Mouse it's
lightweight and features the Avago 3050
optical sensor that can only go up to
2,000 dpi which for many would be enough
for basic gaming and casual use the size
is a bit too small for my hands and it's
not ambidextrous which is a bit odd
given this as a combo that targets the
beginners connoisseur should have made
it accessible to many people as possible
there are six buttons including the
primary left and right forward and
backward on the left side scroller a
button and a dpi shift button behind it
the 10m arm or switches provide
excellent tactile feedback and it
doesn't require a lot of pressure to
press I will surprise it how well define
the scroll steps where and to be honest
I enjoyed gaming on it as well
it had excellent tracking just like my a
B or 7000 there are two lining zones one
on the scroll wheel and the transparent
bring at the bottom but the luminosity
isn't consistent throughout you can tell
that there is a single LED light housed
within the shell rather than multiple
lighting zones and you can change the
lighting effects by pressing the DPI
shift button and the right-click button
and so my concluding thoughts on the
master keys light from cooler master is
that you're getting a fantastic
all-in-one package for $60 the keyboard
is far superior than a typical membrane
keyboard and while it does feel like
typing on plastic switches there is
proper key travel distance and close to
perfect tactile feedback it's certainly
not going to replace a standard
mechanical keyboard or my white fox
because I'm spoiled by mechanical
switches and you won't experience the
durability and
the perfectly tactile response that
comes out of these guys the included
Mouse surprise me in a lot of ways two
for one the sensor is accurate and I
love it
the online switches are excellent and
given the light body it should
complement well with the keyboard what I
recommend this combo to someone looking
to build their first gaming PC
absolutely though for weather and gamers
it may be a bit too basic my question
for you guys is that how has mechanical
keyboards affected your daily computing
and gaming experience can you live
without a mechanical keyboard even
though it sounds a little bit awkward
and what do you guys think about the
master key sleight from Coolermaster
looking forward to the comments I'm

much for watching and see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
