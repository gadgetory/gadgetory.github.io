you know what in this video I want to
challenge myself because I change cases
way too often so reconfigure my system
into another enclosure depending on what
is the latest and greatest that I enjoy
and it is kind of like part of my space
it's there it's and videos I enjoy
looking at it but I want to challenge
myself what happens if I don't use my
main workstation desktop PC for a week
and instead we're gonna use a laptop
computer the MSI p65 creator edition it
is a pretty decked out computer but I
wonder in terms of what I'll be missing
you know from a traditional desktop PC
and what will be the advantages so let's
begin the unboxing
so just look at that thing it is amazing
at how thin it is I've never actually
used the noble computer for my main
workstation PC I've always had desktop
PCs that are gigantic that the like
towering and powering but what happens
if you just kind of switch to something
like that well let's discuss right after
this oh come on what are you doing don't
sit on the keyboard sorry I didn't
realize
it's so low profile did you bring the
stuff I sure did
it's so compact it's a good tool trust
me this brushed aluminum plate floating
1/2 high keycaps MX cherry low profile
switches a type c connection and comes
in different sizes to the cooler master
sk series careful not to miss links
below alright people so my experience
with the msi p65 creator edition has
been surprisingly satisfactory from a
gaming perspective from a Productivity
perspective from portability so you know
perspective and I feel like this is a
nice complete package so first I travel
with this thing to Vegas for our CES
coverage so all the videos were made on
it absolutely no issues in terms of
rendering performance I didn't have an
issue with the the cooler so this is a
replacement and bringing it back to the
desktop it's a significant downgrade in
hardware versus what I had on my desktop
PC with a 2080 ti in the 9900 K but here
the 8750 H CPU plus the gtx 1070 max-q
hardware wise is perfectly capable to
you know deliver what I needed to
deliver for my daily workload but the
main advantage for me with this type of
setup is being able to just unplug
everything put this thing in my backpack
and work remotely and so for a lot of
people who do that office work homework
and something in-between that whole
travel section this is a really good
machine I shot a wedding in Toronto and
edited all my photos on battery life
while traveling to Montreal on a train
for six hours and I arrived with some
battery left over and this is with me
rendering all the photos and editing all
the photos as well so battery life
without this thing being plugged in is
actually a really good productivity
obviously you'd not want to be gaming on
it because the performer
completely tanks but from a Productivity
standpoint battery life on this thing is
actually quite good now I will say the
build quality here is just okay it's not
superb in any way especially compared to
like the razor blade or the MacBook for
example here we have multiple points of
flexibility on a chassis both on the
interior and on the exterior and so I
would be careful now I feel like this
whole creator edition of notebooks is
going to become a lot more popular and
mainstream in 2019 because the p65 is
just the GS 65 in the skies so a white
color scheme we have an added
fingerprint sensor and no longer the
SteelSeries keyboard that everybody
loves on the GS 65 so if you're not fan
on that gold and black color scheme then
the white limited edition is you know
your choice now to get this thing ready
for a true desktop replacement I first
needed to get a notebook stand for
appropriate elevation and nice angle for
the keyboard I'm not a fan of the
wobbling situation when I'm typing on
the keyboard but I do have an external
one connected so that kind of solves
that issue I also got the USB hub from
anger and I velcro that to the bottom of
the stand so I can remove that if I need
to bring it with me on the go
and just gives me additional USB ports
but in terms of the port selection on
the notebook itself I am surprised at
how well equipped it is to be in exist
exactly have plenty of USB ports we have
a full size Ethernet jack we have plenty
of display connectivity so a full size
HDMI we have a mini DisplayPort and a
Thunderbolt 3 this is how empowering
this secondary display with a Type C
cable although for notebook that is
targeted for creators the lack of an SD
card is kind of disappointing the screen
on here is fantastic 144 Hertz which is
awesome for general productivity but
especially great for gaming and although
this is not the true IPS display because
of that high refresh rate color accuracy
for my work has been satisfactory the
bezels are super thin and the screen can
fold all the way back not exactly sure
why you would use that but it has that
extra mobility also a positive is that
I've experienced no scaling issues in
Windows like I was expecting for some
reason so if I drag my window from a 4k
display to the footage
you display you know everything still
stays sharp there is no glory text and
since I moved away from the dual screen
configuration with my desktops I'm
actually quite liking what's happening
here with a smaller screen onto which I
can play like some YouTube videos and on
the main display I can have email open
that can be doing editing and just a
little bit more real estate and then
when I have to you know go to a coffee
shop to do some work unplug everything
take it with me
it's it's quite nice the keyboard on
this thing feels great nice tactile
actuations fast rebounds
however the illumination is quite
disappointing it is uneven between
characters there is likely behind the
keycaps
and also if you have anything white on
the screen it is completely invisible
you cannot actually see what the keys
are whenever they're illuminated so I
tend to just turn off the illumination
in the evenings because the light from
the screen spills onto the white keys
and the white illumination and you
cannot see the actual characters the
trackpad on here I feel like is the
weakest point for portable needs so the
surface is not as smooth as I was
expecting
it is not using Windows precision
drivers or it is but it's got synapse
drivers on top of that so it's not
exactly precise and also there is a
fingerprint scanner built into the top
left side which means that that whole
area cannot be used for tracking but you
have to really press your finger inside
for it to actually you know recognize
the fingerprint otherwise it won't
notice that there is a finger on top the
speakers are located at the bottom so in
my configuration I actually don't mind
that at all it bounces that Audion
Eisley from you know a table surface now
as for performance obviously my 2080 Ti
and the 9900 K system is going to be
much better but for games this thing is
killer with a gtx 1070 max-q
I'm getting respectable frame rates
something that you know I play around
with medium to ultra settings and I'm
pretty happy with frame rates depending
on the title but more importantly I've
been very happy with rendering
performance in Adobe Premiere with the
cooler acceleration without the GTX 970
max-q
and that I 78750 H has integrated
graphics the UHD 630 which is the same
you know graphics that we find on 9900 K
the 8700 K so that quick sync
acceleration with a dual premiere is
absolutely it just flies through things
but the major limitation here with the
internal storage I only have 256
gigabytes inside this machine which is
nothing for content creators this video
is gonna occupy a hundred gigabytes
alone so you have to rely on the
external storage either nass solutions
or just external USB sticks and stuff
and this is kind of what I'm how I'm
working from here so that I can you know
transfer all my gaming library all my
productivity work folders from one
computer to the other I also only have
16 gigabytes of memory it here which is
a single channel so that's also a
slowdown for Adobe Premiere and gaming
too
so you could upgrade this to 32
gigabytes but the second spot is I think
it's below the keyboard so it's not
super accessible also another annoying
issue that I've encountered on this
machine and then the first one our
driver issues so in the first machine my
Intel graphics drivers were crashing
constantly whereas here the Nvidia
drivers are constantly crashing until I
reinstall them they were not detected I
had to revert back to the original
drivers from MSI and which are outdated
and some games freaked out they're like
hey your drivers are outdated I finally
was able to update everything and so far
haven't experienced any crashes like I
have in the past but that's something
that I wasn't expecting to encounter and
certainly don't have this issue on my
you know desktop PC and my takeaway from
this entire experience is that no books
are getting so good and so powerful that
they have this beautiful balance of
being totally appropriate as a desktop
replacement while also having this
entire portability factor built in
because this thing is super light it's
thin I can just collapse it bring a
mouse with me and pair of headphones and
be totally satisfied with the
performance and everything that's that's
kind of revolves around the notebook the
power brick is also pretty small you
know for cable management for example
you could also argue that it gives you
slightly cleaner space if you were to
use something like this
as a desktop replacement overall I'm
quite happy with how this creator
edition of the P 65 has you know
delivered I think that is all I have to
say about my experience using this thing
as a desktop replacement and I think it
has and you know met my expectations on
an overall level I would say be careful
with the build quality I don't like the
trackpad the keyboard illumination could
be better because otherwise you can't
really see the keys when something
bright is on the screen and it just
spills onto white keys but in general
it's a fantastic laptop and it's a good
disguise to target not only gamers with
their GS 65 but you know everyone else
who doesn't want a black and red
notebook but has the exact same specs
and everything else to be the same as
well this is why the creator edition
exists so everything will be linked
description below check it out and if
you've been using a notebook as your
main PC for the desktop what's your
experience been like and would you
consider going the desktop route or you
kind of like settled within your ways
you know this has definitely spoiled me
now in terms of being able to have
everything on one machine that I can
take away when I work but everything is
on my USB hard drives anyways because
the capacity on this thing is not that
good but yeah thanks much for watching
I'm gonna meetry I'll talk to you next
