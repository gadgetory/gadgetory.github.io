is brought to you by and say x-com
technology connect alright we are here
with in wind you guys know in wind makes
very unique cases something known for
particularly for the gamers style I'll
be looking here but more of a for a
lifestyle user that guy in the or girl
who wants that unique a start of all the
black boxes and everything so right now
on to to my left we have the eminent of
for this is a sort of a unique case
because it's using a whole one-piece
aluminum chassis on the exterior and
tempered glass so this is not a critic
it's full-on class shipping with this
thing you know the box that comes with
is massive but they've also realized
that they could potentially go with even
the smallest chassis then we are moving
on to this in win nine and one and I'm
gonna bring out this aluminum frame here
this is the frame that the Inman uses
and the reason for this is expensive
price tag this is $190 is the fact that
this whole aluminum chassis this
exterior is one single piece except for
here this so you can just remove the
piece in order to for you to get access
the the
rear i/o but the fact that they can
manufacture the single piece aluminum
here like that it's also very expensive
so let's move on to the case itself and
check out what type of features they
include so it does carry over a lot of
the same features as before tempered
glass removable with these so also it's
a tinted tempered glass removable with
these a sore thumb screws it does carry
the exact same design with the sort of
brushed aluminum curved panel in when
here and a little bit of a space in the
bottom that's not it can be utilized for
storing things but it does have a fan a
fan mount installed at the bottom for
that intake because you can see the
front is totally closed off closed off
let's look at the back and see how you
want come around
at the back well this is removal also
with thumb screws for you to access that
IO panel and you can also install a
120mm at a fan here and in terms of
water cooling it's not the most
conventional way so as you can see
there's no actual fan holes but they do
fit in right in the in this spot power
supply has been extended to the back as
well as only 94 it was sort of kind of
sticking out here but they have moved it
to the back a little bit that means that
the you could lie utilize the space you
can install along the power supply is
more room for your cables and at the
bottom we have an optical slim drive I'm
not sure you can see that but it's
basically installed underneath the power
supply we are told that that your SATA
cable is already installed and it's
included then all you have to do is plug
that into your power supply and you're
good to go
ok so remove the panel is always kind of
worrisome for me because the stamford
glass is a little bit thinner than the
one that is included on the 94 but it is
totally beautiful it is tinted and it is
tempered glass very sturdy and obviously
have to be careful with this it's a very
he'll you can probably see all the
fingerprints but let's put this downside
on the carpet so that I don't get in
trouble and get inside so they have a
light we have two three in the quarter
inch drive base that sorry they say
three in quarter three and a half inch
drive cage that are hot swappable we
have an SSD bracket at the bottom like
what you see on the side as well we have
a fan mounts there the opening power
supply opening and you have USB or your
audio and your power button and that's
pretty much it I mean on the other side
there are some openings for your cables
to pass through there isn't much in
terms of cable management but like they
said this is a mini ITX system designed
for this this minimalist who want who
wants that very awesome sort of appeal I
do like the design of this in terms of
aesthetically it's not the best
functionality or its numbers came in
management like what we come to expect
certainly at this price point but for a
mini ITX system who if you want that
very awesome elegance chassis the Inman
901
is definitely the choice okay yeah so
this has been in wind here at CES 2014
they announced the 901 and I do like the
fact that there's you know they're
scaling down and their original line of
four and hopefully based on our feedback
based on all of your comments guys they
will redesign this type so that the
space of the bag is not so much so much
wasted because you know it's not elegant
chassis but there's a little bit too
many there's some drawbacks that perhaps
could make this case not attractive so
guys thanks for watching our CES 2014
coverage here in Las Vegas they will see
you the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
