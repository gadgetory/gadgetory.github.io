possible by our partner Nvidia it is
also made possible thanks to Corsair
fantex
and NCI X how can you make an awesome
graphics card even more exciting that
was probably the question gigabyte had
at the back of their mind when designing
the new Xtreme gaming series of GPUs
right now mainly for Nvidia but with AMD
cards added later so it still features
the windforce 3x cooler but with the new
added features like the ring RGB
lighting behind the fan blades which
looks awesome it can obviously be turned
off but the main attraction here is what
could be done with these ring lights to
make your experience with the card even
better in terms of the physical
aesthetics side of things first the
color can coordinate with the
temperature of the GPU which is awesome
and second of course to highlight the
triple fan design and full RGB support
with the spectrum lighting and all types
of different effects now this would
require a flipped motherboard design as
otherwise down facing fans will do
nothing on the visual front and so you
would have to coordinate with your case
to make sure that you take a full
advantage of the extreme gaming series
of the GPUs also for the 980ti edition
of the extreme gaming the middle fan
spins in the opposite direction that
apparently allows better heat
dissipation of the hot air I'm surprised
this hasn't been done before and also
features an extra six pin on the
backside of the PCB for added
overclocking power to the already dual
eight pin connections and so these GPU
chips are specifically picked by
gigabyte to allow for best possible
overclock and I think this might
actually compete with the kingpin
edition from EVGA in terms of the i/o
that has not changed so the only thing
you gain is the extra cooler potential
given the card is two-and-a-half slots
for the 980ti and the 970 in the 980 are
smaller just two slots plus all of them
will have the RGB lighting and on
overall outstanding looking GPU</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
