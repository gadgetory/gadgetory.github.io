ways I mean we've seen a tremendous
shift in notebook design build quality
and features as well if you go back in
time let's just say maybe five years are
still and compare the notebooks from
that damage to what we have right now
the difference is pretty significant and
I think consumers are starting to
appreciate what
oh yeah manufacturers are coming up with
their flagship design on their ultra
books now one thing I want to quickly
mention is performance because we really
haven't seen a tremendous increase in
that department for the past few years
until last year when Intel decided to
launch their cable a car chips basically
incorporates quad core eight threaded
processors into these thin and light
notebooks and they've really changed the
game big-time we're talking about 40%
increase in performance and luckily I
was able to get my hands on the XPS 13
with both a seven generation CPU and an
eighth generation CPU and I was able to
compare the performance differences so
if you're interested in the raw results
you can check it out right over here but
today I want to compare two different
types of laptops so on one hand we have
the Dell XPS 13 featuring the core i7
eight generation processor and this is
just a standard ultrabook so you can
just take it to work school or whatnot
and get work done and on the other hand
we have this beautiful HP Spectre x-360
it's a two-in-one convertible so you can
use it as either as a tablet or as a
laptop and it features an eighth
generation Core i5 processor so be
interesting to see what the performance
difference is like when you compare the
i-5 to the i7 but most importantly I
just want to go over the build quality
differences and features and just the
way how they compare to each other so
let's dive in right after this are you
ready okay watch this
so that is what the components must feel
like inside the H 500 P measured by
Coolermaster check it out in the
description below okay so quick
disclaimer the XPS 13 laptop that I have
over here isn't exactly the newest model
that was launched this year in January
this is last year's design with just two
CPU refresh so it comes with the agency
PU buttressed assigned it's exactly the
same now the newer model is $200 mark
Spencer than the older model so if
you're interested in the new design and
if you want a much smaller form factor I
think going for the new model is a much
better option but if you want to save a
few bucks and still get the eighth
generation CPU and you're pretty compact
notebook especially in the XPS lineup
you should definitely pick up the older
design with the processor because it's
$200 cheaper than the newer model and it
still looks gorgeous from from the
outside and yeah it looks it looks
amazing coming back to this comparison
let's start with the build quality and
design both notebooks are built really
well so the XPS 13 features an aluminum
unibody construction
it feels robust in the hand Dell hasn't
cut any corners when it comes to the
structural integrity of the chassis and
I'm really impressed with it so far the
carbon fiber finish on the palm rest
feels softer to the touch and it doesn't
get too warm while performing heavier
tasks although be mindful that it can
pick up grease and fingerprints easily
but it's fairly easier to clean with a
microfiber cloth there's also a
fingerprint sensor located at the palm
rest it's a quick and secure way to log
in to your Windows PC and I think we're
starting to appreciate biometric
authentication zone notebooks these days
because we're so used to them on
smartphones so it's just a much better
way to improve that on notebooks the HP
does come with a fingerprint sensor but
it's actually on the side and it's not
as quicker I mean it is pretty quick but
it's just I feel that the location on
the XPS 13 is a little bit more
intuitive and quicker to access now Dell
does offer this particular model in two
different color options so there's a
standard silver model and rose gold
which oddly enough is recommended by
Dell on their customization page for a
$50 premium interesting HP Spectre x-360
does not fall behind in build quality
the
Sassy's primarily constructed out of
aluminum and it feels a bit lighter than
the XPS but needless to say they're both
built really well the aluminum finish
continues to spread across the interior
including the palm rest and it's mostly
comfortable to type on HP does offer the
spectre x360 in three different color
options there's natural silver dark ash
silver and that's a model I have over
here and rose gold the last two options
have a $10 premium The Spectre x-360
looks gorgeous in this dark ash silver
model the copper chrome accents in the
hinge and the edges add some visual
characteristic to the notebook and it
certainly looks unique when compared to
the XPS 13 now given that this is a tune
one device you can easily flip this into
tablet mode and you can start using it
right away and if you're working on a
word document the on-screen keyboard
pops up automatically they can start
typing on it but my problem is that I'm
not comfortable using the device like
this because keyboards kind of get in
the way it just feels uncomfortable the
edges are a little bit too sharp it just
isn't that comfortable and the keyboard
by the way the physical keyboard gets
disabled so you don't have to worry
about registering any presses but yeah
it's just I don't see myself using it
this way although I mean you could use
it in tent mode and start consuming
content on maybe like watching Netflix
or something with friends but again this
is I could do the same thing on the XPS
13 with my hinge open that way I mean
it's sure I'm a little farther from the
screen but this is I'm not sure if this
is fancy I don't know but I love to hear
your thoughts on toulon convertible
notebooks are you interested in the
design I mean is it something that you
see yourself using over a traditional
ultra boat like the XPS 13 again let us
know in the comments down below next up
display so both notebooks feature IPS
panels so if you angles and contrast
ratio are right on par with what you'd
expect from a panel of this type the XPS
13 features slimmer bezels resulting in
a smaller footprint when compared to the
spectre x360 but the location of the
webcam on the XPS isn't ideal for
conference calls whereas with the
spectre it's right where it needs to be
and that's at the top both notebooks can
be configured up to a qhd+ resolution
and during my testing period I noticed
that the HP No
was a bit on the cooler side when
displaying colors but that can easily be
fixed with proper calibration needless
to say you wouldn't have a problem
consuming content on both devices
because they feature great displays I
should also mention that both notebooks
feature touch support it's a quick and
easy way to interact with the content
being displayed although be mindful that
both screens do exhibit a slight amount
of wobble it could be a discerning
factor for some of you out there but
that's just a nature of any touchscreen
laptop the screen gets wobbling it's
super glossy so expect a ton of
fingerprints over time the spectre x360
comes with a stylus so it can use it to
take notes doodle around with paint or
if you're an artist this could be a
great tool to enhance your creativity
the response time between the screen of
the pen input is very minimum it feels
almost natural when joining down quick
notes and this is an excellent addition
that could help students with their
productivity unfortunately it isn't
magnetic meaning you won't be able to
attach it to notebook like the surface
pro but HP does include a nice sleeve
out of the box so you can not only use
it to protect the notebook while
traveling but there's a little hook to
store the stylus as well so that's a
nice touch the keyboard on the spectre
x360 is pretty good I found that the
keys were evenly spaced out so that's
nice but I have one problem or one major
concern and that is the arrow keys the
top and bottom I found that to be a
little bit too narrow when compared to
the left and right keys so it's a little
bit confusing when you're trying to
navigate through Excel documents and you
know folders or just browsing the web if
you're using arrow keys and sometimes
you can accidentally hit up shift
instead of the up key so it could be an
annoyance for some of you out there but
you could potentially get used to it
over time the keyboard is also backlit
but it only comes with a single step
brightness adjustments so basically on
or off and it isn't bright enough when
compared to the XPS the keys on the
other hand feature great tactile
feedback nothing too much to complain
about travel distance is pretty short
but that's to be expected from a chiclet
style keyboard the trackpad is also
really good the surface is pretty smooth
for navigation and it uses synaptics
drivers instead of Windows position so
you lose quite a bit on gesture controls
however I found the integrated primary
left and right buttons
we're a little bit further apart due to
the long width of the track
now when you're using a single hand for
navigation you would need to physically
move your hand to actuate the left
button it's honestly not a deal-breaker
but something worth mentioning switching
gears to the XPS 13 + layout is well
thought out the keys are nicely spaced
out and they feature a great tactile
feedback it isn't the best keyboard that
I have come across on a notebook but
it'll you get used to it eventually
it is also backlit with three step
adjustments including the ability to
turn it off the arrow keys are uniform
and consistent so there's little
confusion when navigating through
documents unlike the specter del has
also done a phenomenal job the trackpad
on the XPS 13 the surface is super
smooth for navigation it's not too wide
when compared to the spectre x360 so you
can easily reach the integrated left and
right buttons plus it uses Windows
precision drivers so you can take
advantage of gesture controls built
inside Windows 10 and the tracking is
just perfect I have nothing to complain
about
great job Dale port selection on the
spectre x360 is a bit compromised so you
only get a single USB 3.1 type-a port
combo audio jack power button as well as
a micro SD card reader on the left side
and switching over to the left you get
two USB type-c terrible three ports and
you can use one of them to charge the
laptop as well as a fingerprint reader
and a volume rocker now they could have
easily added in an extra USB type a port
because if you're using external hard
drive and if you have a wireless mouse
that uses a wireless receiver well then
you'd be out of ports because you can
only use why the one of them or you
would have to get a type C to type the
adapter and you have to approach the dom
to life and that's something that I'm
not willing to take as of or at least of
at I'm making this video because I don't
I don't like dongles now another thing I
want to point out is the inclusion of a
micro SD card reader I'm not really sure
who would actually take advantage of
that because I'm pretty sure most
cameras not smartphones but most DSLR
digital cameras take SD card full sized
SD card readers so if you're trying to
edit a photo or if you're trying to
transfer media from a full size SD card
reader to the laptop well you'd be out
of luck because the micro SD card reader
is of no use so I would have preferred a
full size SD card reader on the spectre
x360 but it is what
and perhaps you could just include I
mean if you want to expand the storage
you could potentially pick up a 256 or
512 I think a 400 gigabyte microSD card
reader and just expand your storage that
way now the XPS 13 you get standard
power in a single USB type-c tenable 3
port full size USB 3.1 type a port combo
audio jack and a subtle LED indicator to
monitor the battery life while switching
over to the right side you get
Kensington lock another USB type a port
and a full-size SD card reader Thank You
Dell I do want to take this time to
appreciate HP for including a nice
sleeve to protect a laptop while
traveling but also a USB type-c to HDMI
2.0 adapter so if you want to connect
this thing to an external display you
can do it right away without having to
fetch your own on Amazon I'm looking for
one whereas with the XPS 13 you only get
the laptop and charger and that's pretty
much it so there's no sleeves or
adapters or whatnot but Dell does offer
accessories at a premium cost so that's
something that you know you can look
into now how do the integrated speakers
on both these notebooks sound let's
actually start with the HP spectre x360
so they've partnered with vengan Olson
to create a pretty immersive experience
so we've got two drivers at the front in
this front grille I like the projection
of it so it's not like hidden at the
bottom we're completely distorts or
mutes the sound it's nice and clear so
when you're listening to music tracks
it is pretty audible and I haven't
noticed distortion in higher volumes
which is great but what's interesting is
that when you're trying to use it in
tablet mode and if you're watching TV
shows or something like that
the audio doesn't get distorted because
now you've got these speakers from the
bottom that are firing up to give you a
pretty cool experience so you're not
really you're not really losing a lot
when you're converting between different
modes when it comes to audio which is
great and they sound excellent too now
with the XPS 13 it is great it's
definitely not as good as the spectre
x360 because you know got multiple
speakers here on this laptop but I would
definitely consider this as a great
speaker on an ultrabook
it's not the best but I have listened to
a lot on gaming notebooks and I would
definitely give this a pass okay so I
think it's about time to get the
performance statement comparing the i-5
to the i7 model and
check out what the performance
difference is but do note that you can
configure both these laptops up to an i7
processor or even an i-5 but I just
wanted to test out how good the i7
processor is when compared to the i-5 so
let's let me quickly run over the specs
with the XPS 13 you're getting an i7
8550 you quad-core hyper third processor
comes to the base clock of 1.8 gigahertz
and it turbo boosts up to 4 gigahertz
you've also got 16 gigabytes of memory
clocked at 2130 megahertz and a 512
gigabyte SSD that's nvme switching gears
to the spectre x360 it comes with an
eighth generation Core i5
8250 u quad-core hyperthyroid processor
comes in the base clock of 1.6 gigahertz
that can turbo boost up to 3.8 gigahertz
so it's a little bit slower than the i7
but that's to be expected from an i5 it
comes with 8 gigabytes of RAM clocked to
2133 megahertz and a 256 gigabyte nvme
SSD I do have to point out that both
notebooks have their RAM soldered on to
the PCB so it's not music placeable so
if you pick up the 16 gigabyte variant
then you should be good but if you pick
up the 8 gigabyte model on either of
these notebooks you'll be out of luck
when you're trying to upgrade the RAM
however the storage drives so the NDMA
PCI SSDs are user replaceable so if you
go with the base model 256 gigabyte
model then you can definitely upgrade
that to a 512 game buy variant or even
go as far as 1 terabytes if you pick up
some maybe like a samsung 960 pro SSD or
something like that
alright so here are some numbers our
first owner of basic synthetic test
shows that the I 78550 you isn't that
far ahead when compared to the i5 a 250
you we're talking maybe 1 to 2 percent
increase especially with programs like
cinnamon jar 15 in the multi core test
this makes total sense because they're
both featuring the exact same
architecture with the same number of
thread count now switching over to the
OpenGL test there is a bit of difference
between the two and that's due to the
slightly lower clock speed on the you HD
graphics found on the i5 CPU taking a
look at some real-world tests both agent
CPUs are pretty close to each other
you wouldn't notice a significant
increase in performance if you bump up
to the i7 model both are excellent for
multitasking especially with intensive
applications like handbrake lock
mark GIMP and Paul for a now I wouldn't
recommend editing videos on both these
machines since the lack of a dedicated
GPU severely affects render times but if
you were to give it a shot anyway the
core i7 takes a slight lead here in this
case I ran a one-minute 4k h.264 export
using Premiere Pro CC 2017 and the i-5
8250 you took a minute and a half longer
to render when compared to the I 78550
you I also pushed the integrated
graphics on both models and all I can
say is that both CPUs are pretty capable
of playing games at 1080p at lower
settings so take old watch for instance
at 1080p set to low it gave us around 68
frames per second on the i7 found on the
XPS 13 when compared to 57 frames per
second on the i5 found on the spectre
x360 as for temperatures this one was
pretty surprising to me remember both
these notebooks feature a quad core
processor with hyper threading and they
come with a TDP of 15 watts the I 78550
you found on the XPS 13 ran about 95 c
during my stress test when compared to a
DC on the i5 found on the specter that's
a pretty significant difference between
the i7 and the i5 CPU s but I can
conclude as to which noble can cool
these new a generation processors so if
you configure the XPS 13 with an i5
processor it would obviously run a lot
lower in temperatures but it also be a
lot quieter but I can't really say the
same thing with the spectre x360 say for
example if you want to get the i7 model
you could potentially run into
overheating issues down the line it
could to see if you could get toasty so
I would recommend picking the i5 model
if I were you if you're if you're
worried about temperatures I would stay
safe and think the i5 model you're
really not losing a lot in terms of
performance and you've seen that with
the results and plus you know it'd be a
lot cheaper to invest as well so that's
something to keep in mind and this
brings us to our last test battery life
now do note that both these notebooks
feature a 61 hour battery and our heavy
load test consists of running wheel
bench on a loop until the battery is
completely depleted interestingly the
XPS 13 lasted a bit longer than the
spectre x360 even with a core i7
processor but
our light load test where I looped a
refreshing web page I noticed that the
spectre x360 with the HN core i5
processor lasted an hour and 40 minutes
longer than the XPS 13 these are great
results by the way because it really
proves that Intel has done a terrific
job balancing performance and power
efficiency with these new mobile cable a
car CPUs alright so the last thing that
I want to cover is acoustic performance
and I have to give that to the spectre
x360 from HB this is by far the most
probably the most quietest notebook that
I've ever come across or tested here in
the studio it just runs dead silent
during idle situations especially when
browsing the web and just watching
videos in general whereas with the XPS
13 a fans do kick in when you're trying
to watch a video and perhaps browsing
the web here and there you can
definitely hear the fan ramped up but I
do have to point out that this is an i7
marryin and this is an i5 arian so if
you swap things up so for example if you
get the i7 model on the spectre x360 i'm
not really sure how that would affect
both temperatures and acoustics same
goes for the XPS 13 you could expect
lower temperatures and perhaps better
acoustics when you pick up the i5
variant so I really can't conclude on
that part but generally speaking with
the iPhone model on the spectre x360 the
acoustic performance is pretty amazing
so that pretty much wraps up this
comparison between the XPS 13 and the
spectre x360 from HP I definitely love
to hear your thoughts on both these
laptops and the performance difference
between the i-5 and the i7 model would
you consider bumping that up or if
you're configuring either of these
notebooks
would you consider I'm bumping these
specifications to an i7 or would you
just stick with the i5 model quick note
Dell does offer the XPS 13 and a
two-in-one factor see it's the same form
factor or convertible so you can convert
it to a tablet or laptop and HP does
offer the specter and just the noble
variant so if you're just looking for a
notebook you can definitely pick it up
but I just wanted to sort of start the
conversation as to would you rather pick
up a tune one device when compared to a
standard Ultrabook or do you see the
benefits of using a two and one in your
day-to-day lives let me know the
comments down below I'm Mira with
hurricane axe thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one
and that was a card that just dammit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
