one terabyte three-and-a-half inch hard
drive it runs off a SATA 6 gigabits per
second interface and you might find
these common among desktop systems and
they're still widely available people
still purchase one of these drives
because they're like super 250 dollars
you'll get a one terabyte hard drive no
problem now
you might recall these type of drives
sold in external enclosures about 10
years ago with a SATA to USB interface
there require separate power adapters
and you know people use these as
external storage solutions or external
storage drives but now it's 2017 so
what's popular well these guys right
here
portable SSDs look at the size
difference now obviously you know really
can't compare them because the price
wise you know this is four times more
expensive than this drive right here
but you know being able to toss this
around your backpack and just carry it
around fit in your pocket is kind of
amazing so let's take a look at this
right after my system our sponsor
explore your future with the cosmos to
case and celebrate 25 years of ambition
the drive cooler master forward enjoy
the familiar yet still forward-looking
character the frame with solid aluminum
handles it may be the most physical
you'll ever get with the computer case
but it's all worthwhile or gets creative
put any of the 13 storage options that
encourage outside the box thinking
meanwhile the curve temple glass panels
on both sides ensures a lasting
impression classically trained but still
ready for anything the cool elastic
cosmos - let's celebrate the past by
building for the future as always let's
start with the design because it's a
unique one compared to the Samsung t3
and the Pnyx SD there's a mix of plastic
and aluminum throughout the body and it
feels rock solid in the hand WD claims
that it can withstand drops up to six
and a half feet but I'm not going to try
that because I take good care of my
products now price-wise you're looking
at $100 for the 256 gig based model
bumping that up to 512 runs around $180
and finally the top-of-the-line one
terabyte model costs around 360 dollars
and that's what we'll be using to run
the benchmarks when you compare to
something like the t3 from Samsung that
costs $400 for the one terabyte variant
the WD drive offers a
more with $40 shaved off that price
point and here's why unlike the p3 that
uses a USB 3.1 type C gen 1 standard the
passport runs on a Type C 3.1 gen2
interface that means theoretically this
drive with one on 10 gigabit per second
speeds instead of five but it would be
limited to the internal SSDs performance
inside the chassis I guess we'll find
out about that in the benchmarks on top
of that you get a type cd' type-c cable
with a standard type a adapter so if
you're rocking a desktop or notebook
with a thunderbolt port or a 3.1 gen2
type-c port you will be achieving SSD
class speeds in an external solution
that fits in the palm of your hand do
not that it is reverse compatible with
USB 3.0 and 2.0 standards now Western
Digital has built a solid reputation for
themselves in the reliability department
and one of them obviously includes
taking proper security measures there's
a built-in 256 bit AES hardware
encryption module and when you set it up
with WD security software your data is
secure this can come in very handy when
you're traveling around with
confidential files but it's also cost
compatible with both Mac and PC so users
who are invested in both ecosystems are
not left out of the equation all right
so before I proceed to the performance
segment of this video I need to quickly
mention that I recently switched my
editing workstation PC to Rison and the
reason I say that is because I tested
the Samsung and the Pnyx sd's on an X 79
platform which is fairly old so now that
I've switched to this new guy right here
let's retest all three SSDs okay so
starting with synthetic benchmarks just
like our last comparison I fired up
crystal de smart and tested these drives
by setting the number of tests at five
and a file size of one gigabyte the
results do speak for themselves
the passport outperforms the PNY and the
p3 averaging read speeds at 490
megabytes per second and writes in the
low for 80s the 3.1 gen2 interface is a
huge bonus to unleash the internal SSDs
true performance so we're not bottleneck
by Gen 1 speeds so that's awesome moving
on to a todas benchmark a program that
tests the drive read and write speeds
using incremental file sizes the
passport takes the lead once again
dishing out well over 490 megabytes per
second in both read and buy perform
the t3 and PNY Drive are almost neck to
neck in this test but still very
respectable results from both of them on
to some real-world tests I transfer a 47
gigabyte folder packed with 4k videos
back and forth between the desktop and
the drives so starting with me passport
that whole folder took 2 minutes and 36
seconds to transfer to the SSD averaging
between 290 to 360 megabytes per second
right performing that backwards took a
minute and 53 seconds because the read
speeds were topping at around 417
megabytes per second that's one of the
highest stuff come across on a portable
SSD I perform the same task on the other
drives and here the results the Samsung
Drive completed the right task 5 seconds
faster than the WD drive but the Pnyx SD
took a whopping 7 minutes to transfer
that folder just like what I experienced
when reviewing it it definitely has to
be a miscommunication between the drive
cache and an end but on a positive note
the Wii performance on the PNY was
excellent compared to the t3 as you can
see there was a more than a minute worth
of gap between the two but when put
against a passport SSD both of them were
forced to bow before the new Wii
performance King my second test involved
another folder transfer consisting of
After Effects lock files thumbnail
projects Excel documents and a few
videos the overall size of that folder
was sitting around 5 gigs so that took
about 20 seconds to transfer to the
passport SSD averaging around 300
megabytes per second right performing
that backwards took half the time
because the read speeds were topping at
around 1.5 gigabytes per second at the
beginning but then it dipped to 30
megabytes per second during small file
transfers for just a second and then it
picked up right away till 500 megabytes
per second upon completion now my
desktops local Drive is an RD 400 from
host lazy so that sudden peak in 1.5
gigabytes per second must have something
to do with the way how the storage
controller handles queue depth this was
also fairly evident when testing the
other drives as you can see the time it
took to complete the transfer back and
forth were exactly the same among the
three my final tests involved rendering
a one-minute 4k video using Premiere Pro
CC 2017 and set the destination to the
respective drives per render the results
only a two-second difference between all
three with the WD passport SSD
taking the lead it's honestly not a huge
deal even when rendering larger projects
like this seven-minute 1080p video I've
scaled to 4k the difference isn't that
huge between the drivers be ready for X
299 with as Rock's flagship gaming eye 9
motherboard the world's first to feature
a quantity at 10 gigabits per second LAN
port for extreme bandwidth a 13th based
power designed for smooth power delivery
and reliable overclocking and of course
USB 3.1 type C that can also charge your
devices of up to 36 watts more info in
description below so I'm going to leave
you guys on this note the Western
Digital my passport SSD is a fast drive
in fact it normally costs less than a
Samsung t3 but it outperforms the t3 in
terms of repr formance so if your
day-to-day tasks to rely heavily on that
process pick the WD trot it's a much
faster solution the USB 3.1 gen2
interface is so refreshing to see on a
portable SSD not just because of
bragging rights but it eliminates the
bottleneck when the SSD is trying so
hard to dish out those read and write
numbers so what do you guys think of the
passport SSD from Western Digital are
you a fan of the design plus what do you
think of its performance compared to the
Samsung t3 and the Pnyx SD leave a
