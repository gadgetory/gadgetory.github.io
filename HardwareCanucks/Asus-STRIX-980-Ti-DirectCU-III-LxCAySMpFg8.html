thanks for the following sponsors
show them some love for helping us get
here to Taipei the strict series of
graphics cards from Asus promises no
compromises for performance here
Computex they have announced the gtx
980ti Strix Edition and the default
clock speeds are set to be clocked 10 to
15 percent higher than the reference
card so we should expect base clock on
his tricks to have around maybe $1200
megahertz still no final clock speeds
revealed but up to 15% or 20% is what
you would expect for a higher-end cooler
like this to keep the GPU cool asus is
introducing an all-new direct cu3
cooling system that features 3 10
centimeter fans on the front and
fortunately without any rim lighting as
what was teased but that would be really
cool this introduces a shift from their
dual a fan cooler solution so we are
really excited to do our own testing and
see exactly how the new design of this
cooler will play out for thermals
there's a single 8 millimeter dual 6
millimeter and dual 10 millimeter heat
pipes for a total of 5 to ensure better
heat dissipation and a lot more room for
overclocking we hope so the new blades
are designed to increase pressure and it
will automatically stop spinning when
the GPU is under light load this is not
confirmed yet but we think below 55 C
and the fans won't spin this is it the
case with the gigabyte cards so we hope
a sues is being competitive also in that
way not only is this pretty impressive
for a GPU of this class but total silent
operation is just incredible for a 980ti
as we've only seen the complete silent
operation from the gtx 960 and so we are
really excited to see how the 980ti
with this new cooler will play out the
brushed metal backplate looks pretty
standard with the Strix logo imprinted a
new addition to the GPU as a GPU
fortifier that prevents the PCB from
bending due to a fairly heavy heatsink
and all these heat pipes plus nobody
wants to see any GPU sag another awesome
thing we'll notice that the Asus booth
was their new claim or keyboards
utilizing RGB cherry switches this
awesome textured platform underneath
keys and a module a numpad that can
either be installed on the right side to
be used normally as a standard numpad or
moved on to the other side for crazy
macro operation there will be some cool
lighting features integrated into the
keyboard like CPU temperature indication
based on the color of the backlight and
we'll save that showcase for the full
review and along the peripherals was
their new flagship rog Mouse the spatha
made an appearance in its almost final
form it is equipped with 12 programmable
buttons and the shell is made out of
premium magnesium alloy that felt
extremely solid to hold the spatha is
geared towards MMO style gamers and you
can use it both wired and wireless Li
for your convenience with the stylish
dock included the omron switches inside
are replaceable just like we saw on the
Gladius it will use an Avago 9800 sensor
which is fine with the latest upgrades
to the sensor but it will really come
down to the ergonomic design and whether
you like this large form factor or not
and unfortunately none of the parts are
modular so if you prefer smaller mice
the spatha
may not be for you so let us know if
you'd like to see a review of this mouse
or the keyboard so we can make sure to
deliver as soon as these peripherals
launch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
