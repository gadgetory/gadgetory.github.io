thanks for the following sponsors show
them some love for helping us get here
to Taipei
alright so as soon as I heard antec will
be on the show floor at computex i
received the tiny glimpse of hope for
the company to come out with something
amazing and competitive and so this is
their signature chassis the s10 I'm not
gonna lie I wasn't expecting something
of this caliber as this case is launched
at five hundred dollars instead I was
hoping for something mid-range to blow
us away but the s10 no doubt integrates
some unique features first the build
quality I'm loving the materials with
the thick brushed aluminum side panels
and I suggested to have them sandblasted
as that is the direction we see aluminum
heading within the chassis industry the
side panels have magnetic strips that
hold them to the case which means easy
access as the panel's goal was to open
but not having the panels securely
attached to the frame is a bit worrying
one of the most interesting design
choices are for the frame is this gap
between the main chamber and the hard
drive chamber now the concept is great
to actually separate the heat transfer
from hardware and allow direct airflow
delivery in the main chamber without
sacrificing on the actual length of the
chassis
the hard drive compartment will support
six mechanical drives on these rubber
brackets and three dedicated SSD spots
by the side there but for the hike that
is available six drives seems kind of
limiting but they are mounted in this
vertical position as there is an exhaust
fan at the bottom to take away the heat
from all the tribes in the power supply
chamber there's another drive cage
that's built in but this one's only for
ssds and again given the size of the s10
I was hoping for a bit more storage
capacity and user flexibility when it
comes to drives the orange filter in the
gap is easily removable from the side it
covers triple 120mm fan spots on that
internal wall allowing direct air for
delivery for the main compartment that
might compromise GPU clearance if you
install a thick radiator with push-pull
at the front the top air flow is limited
to do 120 140 mil fans and coming around
to the back we can see that chamber
separation a bit more clearly when that
tans fan hub included that this SATA
powered and one of the most annoying
things would be routing the SATA cables
to the top hard drives because you need
to pass the cables through this small
gap at the bottom so antic is telling us
that SATA extensions will be provided
with the case and I sure hope so for the
price they're asking now if you guys
want to see a full review of the s10 let
us know in the comments below I really
want to give this case another chance or
your food chains and also a more premium
model will be released with tempered
glass panels that looks absolutely
fantastic so like or dislike to let us
know how you feel about the s10 thanks
for watching and we'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
