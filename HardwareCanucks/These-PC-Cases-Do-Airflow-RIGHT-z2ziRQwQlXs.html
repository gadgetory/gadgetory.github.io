Silverstone baby let's go but first huge
thanks to SteelSeries and Phanteks for
making our Computex trip possible so
let's begin with the LDO 3 this thing is
finally finished and i remember
originally seeing it at Computex and was
this thing with acrylic side panels it
was curved but I'm really happy at the
end result this thing looks elegant
I love the tempered glass especially how
they are slightly cut off gives a really
unique look it is an ITX enclosure so
it's a little bit on the larger side but
they make so many tiny as g-series ITX
cases that branching into something
slightly bigger I'm totally ok with that
the side panels as before are easily
removable you simply pop them out like
this to access the interior they have
made a few modifications on the interior
like having this big GPU cut out
underneath that is so that you can maybe
use that space too if you if you need
additional space for the GPU which
supports 12.1 inches or if you cannot
mount the GPU from the side or from the
front you can actually insert it from
that hole and just makes the
installation easier they've also removed
the top bracket above the fan
they had a tiny fan over there to have a
little bit better airflow but throughout
the testing they removed it because it
didn't really help for any other GPUs
other than blower cards and they've also
made the case slightly wider so there's
actually some ventilation behind the GPU
for a little extra airflow because in
the previous one the GPU was really
close to the side panel so the ldr 3 is
now shipping it's going to be for 109
dollars but for our us friends because
of all the tariffs and canadians as well
around 140 to 150 so that kind of sucks
but one more thing bits power is working
to create a custom reservoir slush pump
for this enclosure so you can do full
water cooling here I appreciate that
little ITX enclosure with water cooling
components this is how ITX should be
done
nicely done Silverstone now for many of
you silverstone lovers you'll be happy
to hear that they are actually
condensing their entire case line up
into three categories fara SATA and alte
and that is because they currently have
14 different puddles so good luck trying
to decipher that I mean still probably
better than cooler masters mmm
s/m lemon whatever thing but we have
fairer SATA and Alta affair is the the
lower tier budget entries SATA is
something that we have here kind of a
mid tier and out there really high-end
stuff the reason why I'm showing you
this this is the theta seder Seder a1
I'm already getting a little confused
but yeah SATA a1 and the reason why I'm
showing this is because there have this
nice aluminum front panel and they're
doing some trickery here because this is
a dual material construction we have an
aluminum piece over here but the actual
frame behind it is plastic it is all
silver so they look very similar and
then we have the metal frame itself and
they're hopefully trying to do the same
thing in terms of color coordination but
because of the LEDs it helps to kind of
camouflage
any color difference there might be and
the question I have for you like I love
this design but since you can't really
see the fans underneath it what do you
think about Silverstone including RGB
fans in here right now there are 200
millimeter fans underneath two of them
and they are RGB and you can kind of see
them from the inside but would you guys
prefer RGB fans on something that you
can't see them from the front or do you
care there's a tad I guess it adds a
little bit of spill but I would love to
hear your thoughts on something that
where you can't see through the front
panel there's RGB make any sense and now
good people let's talk about the outer
s1 so the outer is the really enthusiast
premium line of cases and this is
Silverstone answer to people's question
about when they're gonna release a
flagship case you really need the new
flagship and the this like the really
high-end stuff and this is what they've
come up with so it is massive it is very
spaceship looking it still has that
Silverstone ID with the aluminum panels
and tempered glass side panels which by
the way are curved so we do have triple
200 member fans inside and you can mount
radiators on top of the bracket so you
don't necessarily need to waste the fans
if you're going the whole water cooling
route and the airflow in this sort of 90
degree chimney style has been fantastic
they're still working on trying to make
sure the performance is best as it can
be because with non blower style GPUs
there's a lot of heat that accumulates
over here and even though we have that
nice common air from the bottom to the
top
the
the top section only still has that
single exhaust fan which means that the
CPU is cooled very well with either
water cooling or AOS or CPU towers but
the GPUs suffer a little bit and they
still want to continue with this whole
idea the front glass panel so you can
see the GPUs and gets your entire system
but I'm excited to see what they do in
terms of improving those GPU
temperatures but my friends let's go and
check out the Raven prototype so this is
the Raven prototype the expected price
is from 180 to 200 dollars and of course
much higher in the US market a few
changes include a type-c connection on
the side over here they've added a
larger cutout from the front panel so
that they're really sticking to being
able to see your components from the
front and simply because the motherboard
is rotated 90 degrees so the GPU is
going to be that highlight I like their
approach but I guess we'll see how it
plays out in terms of also being able to
see your your motherboard cables and
whatever else in there what if your GPU
doesn't have a pretty backplate or
actually pretty shroud what what are you
gonna do they're just gonna cover it up
they have closed the back panel so the
airflow is more directional so there's
no leakage happening from the rear
they've added a vertical GPU bracket
over here so that you could have a
vertical rotated GPU so the shroud will
be facing the side panel a really cool
approach to an otherwise already
vertical orientation of the graphics
card we have dual 180 millimeter air
penetrators fans so these are like super
premium fantastic airflow and the only
thing that oh the only reason why this
is not on the market yet is because
they're not happy with performance it's
performing just as well as all their
previous Raven Series cases and that is
because the non Flores tile GPUs spit
out a lot of heat and they don't know
how to handle that exhaust over here the
CPU temperatures are fine but like we
saw with the outter this is going to go
through a little bit of revisions so
that they can have better performance
and I'm really looking forward to see
what they do with the Raven prototype so
that the temperatures on the GPU are
much better man every time we come to
Silverstone they're like oh we have a
new new power supply that is higher
wattage so the power density is now
increasing every year so now they have
an SFX L power supply that there's a
thousand watts instead of the previous
one from two years ago that was 800
watts so that's pretty cool and
interesting thing they tell us is that
see these connections we have normally
we see like six normally we see red or
blue connectors that specify your CPU
power and PCIe power but now they're all
black which means that you can take any
six pin or eight pin and plug it in here
and use that corresponding to whatever
you need on the motherboard so you have
a little bit more options for the
modularity of the unit and we also have
now an S effects
750 watt unit they're now trying to
match the Corsairs latest 750 SFX power
supply versus previous this was 700
watts so again power density is
increasing in power supplies which is
awesome because the whole direction of s
FX and s FF builds you know it's it's
becoming more popular and silverstone is
staying on top of their game and one
more little thing they always have a
bunch of little goodies over here like
and now a PCIe expandable Gen 2 USB
enclosure you can bounce an nvme m2 SSD
inside of here and this is actually what
we're using for the show but the SATA
type which are awesome and we've we've
done the video on this little clicker
that you can plug this into your
computer and wirelessly control it with
the remote control but now they're doing
a whole Wi-Fi connection over here so
you plug this into your PCI and there's
an app you can restart and power on your
PC within the Adhan card pretty awesome
for difficult to access places and if
you want to really you know prank your
roommates or by turning off their
systems this is something that I'm
really hoping to do in the future but
yeah multiple accessories as usual
alright guys so that is it from
silverstone i'm really happy they're
simplifying a naming scheme farah sada
and alta so hopefully in the future it
will be an easier distinction to to know
which sort of series you'd want to go
for and I'm really excited to check out
the LDO 3 and see what they do with that
raven prototype in terms of airflow for
the GPU I'm Dimitri thanks so much for
watching check out this other relevant
content and I'll talk to you in the next
video
