I like to make a shadow play shadow play
is something we've been talking about
shadow play is basically a DVR for your
pc gaming for your g-force the thing
that's really special about shadow play
and the reason why it was such an
extraordinary piece of work is because
you want to record your game without
affecting your name it would be a real
problem if by recording your game you've
overloaded the CPU in the system to the
degree that your gameplay suffers if
that's heck if that happens nobody will
never turn it on because the gameplay is
simply too important your goal is to
play with you surely wouldn't one record
yourself losing and so shadow play its
unique feature is that by using Kepler
the encoder and by integrating the
entire software stack the concurrent
recording deep into the pipeline no
copies no system copies new frame copies
no overloading the CPU you know taxing
the CPU as a result the overhead of
shadow place incredibly low this is an
area that I would love for you guys to
measure measure shadow play which only
works on Kepler and do to save with
other recording stacks and measure the
amount of frames that are dropped as a
result of it so the first thing is
shadow play allows you to be always on
because the tax is so low you can record
a 1080p it records the last 20 minutes
if you recorded an automatic if you
would like to go into manual you can
record for as long as you like I think
for windows 7 it goes to four gig and I
think
Jose that goes to us large describe can
afford and this is wonderful way for you
to share with your friends and capture
your greatest moments this is also
available on them to 28 okay but what's
really really cool is when you combine
shadow play and game stream when you
take these two technologies and you put
it together and you integrate it with
the number one gaming broadcast platform
twitch all of a sudden you can share
like you've never done before today
we're announcing that GeForce experience
streams directly to twitch super easy
integration super easy user interface
very very low overhead from your
gameplay record capture at 1080p
streaming out to twitch no effect on
your gameplay and let everybody watch
you as you dominate the opponent's now
to help you experience this let's have
but let's have tap come up here myself
tapping the audience early hey tap tom
is going to demonstrate this to us tell
us about this thing that you're going to
demonstrate an active just absolutely
amazing I will do I have a mic on write
something okay so what we're going to do
today is just give you a live demo about
this new capability it's going to be out
before the end of the year and what
we're doing is making it super easy to
I'll check check that's much better so
not it's going to be it's gonna be super
easy that's a stream to twitch yeah your
big guy wow this is this is slightly a
few hot girl I feel I feel this way
right ok so ok this is really my boss's
boss hugging me I got my love all right
so sure make this is going to work as a
human and tap thinking there's no way
I'm paid enough for this I'm definitely
paid so anyway it's easy one-click
broadcasting instead of your account so
let me bring up a demo and we'll show
you how this works can we bring up eggs
excellent excellent hey all right so
let's not bring up Joe GeForce
experience now this is our next big
release of GeForce experience i
mentioned it's going to be out before
the end of the year and what you can do
is kind of you can set up an account to
log directly into your twitch account
super easy and then you can kind of
configure how your webcam is going to
work so you can get your little web on
your screen I call this sort of like a
full-featured broadcasting interface
that's really simple so you got webcam
interface small medium large put your
face with you all in the picture you can
have a little indicator so you know when
you're streaming and it's super easy to
know
casting motors on and then you can pick
your resolution either 480 1080p
whatever you need and we're going to
also what's really cool about this is
we're going to upload to twitch at 60
frames a second so you get a just
amazing experience as a receipt and it's
just great technology so I think the way
to do this is show you in action so I'm
good and pull up blacklist and this is
obviously a game that's a really popular
it is up running right now at six
hundred frames a second but once we get
into the bad I think we'll be landing
more like 120 okay so we've got fraps up
and you can see right now we are just
playing the game jos√© over here playing
on this pc and we're running somewhere
around 120 hundred frames a second he's
actually in a pretty good player so can
we just run around a little bit see
roughly the performance jumpin up great
game all enhanced graphics now what I'd
like you to do is turn on the casting
mode so let's go ahead and turn on
shadow play and what you'll see in the
bottom right hand corner is a little
green dot that's how he's got his you I
configured so right this second I'm
sorry I forgot to ask want to turn off
the internet so your wife I should go
down right now it is it down you guys
down awesome alright so now let's go
ahead and pull up the twitch internet
window and take a look at that so what
you're looking at here on the on the
twinge side this is actually all the wet
right now
we're kind of uploading and then we're
also downloading and you can see the
experience is pretty credible it's 60
frames a second it's 720p at the best
part about it I don't know if you've
noticed but now that we're streaming our
frames per second is still 120 frames
per second so below on the cpu load on
the GPU is negligible when we're
streaming to twitch this is going to
change everything I don't you guys
extreme which before but the existing
technology is not at all it doesn't look
anything like now if you watch when you
watch twitch today it's not it's barely
even standard definition it's right yeah
I want to be negative but yeah had some
issues but this rocks okay so what we
pull up the caster window and I'll show
you what it looks like on Joe's pc so
this is what you see on his pc this is
what all of his buddies are seeing in
the entire universe entire world right
now tune in to Joe's 620 p transmission
so so sorry basically basically about a
two second leg that's in there one
one-thousand two one-thousand and it's
just so high quality I think people are
just going to really enjoy and it comes
with GeForce experience it uses Kepler
and shadowplay technology and it's it's
just a no-brainer it's a great way to
cast that's amazing that's fantastic
what you guys think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
