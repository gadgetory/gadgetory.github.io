no lighting have you been here yet the
oligo st. is fun this is actually a lot
fun just hunting down for the camera
here it's a lot it's the expense it's a
little bit different compared to the
shopping online because you just look
online to do research but when you got
to get into the streets and do your
research and explore that's fun I see a
big cannon flying down the road I think

little bit
