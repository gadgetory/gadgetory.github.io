great technology selection and service
hey everyone
Aiden here with Harlequin ox and today
we're taking a look at Cougars new 450
series the 450k hybrid mechanical
keyboard and the 450 and gaming mouse
priced at $59.99 USD respectively we'll
start by looking at the 450k keyboard
and then later take a look at the 450 m
starting off with the physical overview
the 450 K has a solo plastic build
coming in at 1 kilogram or 2.2 pounds
it's not particularly heavy for its size
but it feels extremely well built
there's no flex anywhere in the build
and the entire keyboard feels quite
tough it features a smooth plastic on
the top and bottom of the keyboard with
a brushed plastic finish in the center I
personally love this design choice
brushed plastic allows for a more
premium finish without the fingerprint
attraction that plays brushed aluminium
also here are the hybrid mechanical
switches with three color backlighting
with an iso keyboard layout on the
bottom of the keyboard you have a red
finish with five rubber grips as well as
true flip-out feet finishing the
physical overview is the 1.8 meter cable
which is not braided despite Krueger's
released specs one of the features
cougar is pushing in terms of durability
of this keyboard is the splash resistant
design which they claim is due to the
hybrid mechanical switches that are
completely sealed
this means no liquids can reach the
internals which I would consider a
fantastic feature I poured a large
amount of water on the keyboard when it
was powered on to test this and it held
up perfectly which is a testament to the
focus on durability which has been
placed on this board overall the design
of the 450k seems very well-thought-out
with a premium build which is not
characteristic of this price range
the pricing seems very competitive as
most affordable Cherry MX boards like
the quick-fire TK start at the 70 to 80
dollar range this brings us to the
switches on the board it features
cougars hybrid mechanical switches
cougars concept of these switches is to
provide a mechanical feel without the
mechanical design Krueger does this by
having a fixed mechanism underneath each
key cap which actuates the membrane as
opposed to the conventional rubber dome
method of having the key cap actuate the
membrane to
actly and as such this allows for longer
travel distances these don't feel like
Cherry MX switches to me but
simultaneously they aren't like membrane
switches either while Krueger doesn't
state the actuation force I feel these
are in the middle of Cherry MX blacks
and MX Reds they feel heavy while still
being relatively easy to press down
while they don't keep the clicky feeling
of the blues which I so love I have
found myself really enjoying them they
are satisfying and consistent
unlike many membrane keyboards Logan
from Texas indicate compare these two
turbo switches and while I haven't tried
torpor switches personally the
comparison makes sense as a switch
design of this board reminds me of the
Nova touch these switches are also
fairly loud unlike membrane switches so
here's a sound sample one of the
disadvantages of this non-standard
switch is the lack of third-party key
cap customization the caps on this board
are quite good but the option for the
customization that's available MX boards
is sorely lacking from this the contains
switch does allow for that water
resistance though and it also allows for
the backlighting to be embedded in the
switch which supposedly allows for more
even backlighting this brings us into
the features and the board packs some
simple useful ones the backlighting has
three colors red green and blue with
three levels of brightness as well as a
breathing mode which transitions
smoothly however that's where the
backlight customization ends with no
custom modes or other effects present
the backlight brightness is also
lackluster with even the brightest level
being fairly dim in good light this
means that the backlighting can seem
uneven as it's quite dim leaving certain
areas not adequately lit jumping into
the software we have a fair bit of
customization for the keyboard you have
the ability to rebind every key on the
keyboard except for the function button
and you can also assign macros to keys
this is awesome and it's
see this level of customization on a
keyboard I wish that you could reassign
the function key however as I personally
like to have the windows key in that
location and would love if you could
swap the right windows key to function
however that just doesn't seem to be
possible the board also has support for
three onboard profiles which changed the
macros and also can have individual
lining profiles so that you can tell
which profile is activated these
profiles can be changed with the three
dedicated keys on the keyboard and
there's also media controls as well as a
polling rate control up to a thousand
Hertz accessible on the board so that
about wraps up the 450k it has a great
design enjoyable typing and good
customization at an attractive price
point
moving on to its sibling the 450m I
found it didn't impressed me quite as
much as the 450k did to recap the 450m
is priced at $49.99 which puts it in
line with mice like the Logitech G for a
tune and the razer deathadder so the
competition is fierce in this price
bracket the 450 M touts an ambidextrous
design with two buttons on each side of
the mouse and it weighs in at 105 grams
which is fairly light for large amounts
like this it also features RGB lighting
on LAN switches a 5000 dpi optical
sensor a thousand Hertz polling and a
32-bit ARM processor with onboard memory
in terms of raw specs the mouse delivers
with no obvious features missing I
personally prefer more buttons like on
my g6 are true however for a gaming
oriented Mouse this decision is
understandable sensor performance has
been very good so far it uses a pixel
art 331 0d each sensor with no
acceleration issues and no polling
issues I jumped into csgo and found no
abnormal behavior with the sensor it
seems to be very accurate and overall
the experience was pretty enjoyable my
issue with this mouse is not the sensor
but with the mouse design the killer for
me is the material they chose for this
mouse with the top material being a
black glossy plastic I honestly can't
see any reason for this choice as not
only does it look tacky in my opinion
but it also picks up fingerprints it's
more slippery and is generally just a
terrible surface for a mouse I'll give
them props for the execution of the
surface however as when I saw that it
was glossy plastic I did expect much
worse but it's been more resistant to
finger prints and more grippy than I
expected but no matter how well this was
executed I don't think this material
choice is a good one the sides have a
textured rubber finish which works well
even if it isn't my favorite feeling
texture the true side buttons are very
small and Irbid too thin for my
preference generally the mouse is fairly
good for their palm grip I use with
ambidextrous mice but it isn't one of
the most comfortable myself used the
mouse has a large dpi switcher which is
individually lit and while it's a tiny
bit far back for my preference it has a
very satisfying click and it's easy to
press
the scrollwheel has very defined steps
but I do find the resistance is a little
strong for my liking and pressing the
scroll wheel takes more force and
ensured customization is something the
Krueger 450m does well in the software
we can switch from our keyboard to the
mouse and we see not only three modes
like in our keyboard we also have
individual profiles you can adjust a
range of settings with individual access
dpi control which is awesome
there's also scroll speed lift height
polling rate acceleration and snapping
in here which is all great stuff you can
have profiles activated by game as well
if that's your thing moving to key
assignment you can bind macros or keys
to every button which is great to see
under lighting we have the full RGB
lighting suite which was lacking on the
keyboard the controls are great with the
RGB codes available for input as well as
the slider the colors on the mouse match
very closely does it software so that's
refreshing to see you also have the
option between breathing and fully lit I
would have liked to see brightness
levels but the breathing mode is very
good like on the 450k while the lighting
effects are simple they're very well
executed and work well however they're
let down by the ridiculous choice of
having green on the mouse the main point
of having RGB lighting is color matching
with other peripherals so having such a
vibrant green on a product with RGB
lighting makes little to no sense to me
as most lighting themes will clash with
it this really is a strange choice to me
and it renders most of the colors on the
mouse useless whereas they would have
looked great with the otherwise plain
black mouse so in the end the 450m isn't
terrible it just has a lot of
questionable design choices if it was
competing in the $30 price range it
would have had a chance but at this
price there are just too many poor
design choices for this mouse to compete
with the other mice in this price range
the lightweight design and average build
quality are starkly different to the
450k and they don't seem like they're
from the same product line at all
ranging from the accent color on the red
underbelly of the 450k to the green on
the 450 m and this seemingly just
different design philosophy of the
products in conclusion the 450k hybrid
mechanical keyboard offers great value
with an enjoyable typing experience
excellent build quality and design solid
features and a solid price point and as
such we're giving it a damn good value
award however the 450m contrasts as it
seems uncompetitive in the current
market while it brings some good
customization and hardware the design
lets it down resulting in an ultimately
lackluster final product thanks for
