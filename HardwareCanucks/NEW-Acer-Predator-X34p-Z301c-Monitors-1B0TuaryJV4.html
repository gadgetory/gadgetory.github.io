during coffee tax and they announced two
interesting monitors huge thanks to our
Computex sponsors for sending us out
here
shoutout to Nvidia fantex and CIX and
msi let's kick things off with the Acer
x34 P there are only a few changes to
this monitor over the original x34 first
it comes with a base refresh rate of 100
Hertz so you don't have to manually
overclock the panel and it's going to be
stable during gameplay now if you love
curved monitors you're definitely going
to like this Acer has managed to
increase the curvature to 1900 are
compared to 2300 are on the last gen the
smaller the number the larger the curve
the next change is subtle but I like it
ASA went with a different finish at the
back gone is the glossy plastic design
that's a fingerprint magnet this time
Acer opted for a more refined and
brushed aluminum finish but it's still
plastic if you remember the OSD buttons
on the previous x34 they were okay I did
require some pressure to press and it
wasn't UI friendly now this model has a
multi-directional joystick at the back
so this makes navigating through the OSD
one faster and it's a nice touch a sir
they also announced another monitor meet
the Z 301 C it's a 30-inch 1800 our
curved
VA panel with a 4 millisecond response
time the refresh rate can be overclocked
at 200 Hertz and just like most high-end
gaming monitors these days it comes with
Nvidia's g-sync module the resolution is
2560 by 1080 just like the Z 35 pricing
has not yet been unveiled for both the
predator x 34 P and the Z 301 C but let
us know what you guys think about a sirs
new additions to the predator lineup and
I'm definitely sure at some point this
year both these monitors have to go to
the proper high rep next treatment
I'm Hebert with hurricane X thank you so
