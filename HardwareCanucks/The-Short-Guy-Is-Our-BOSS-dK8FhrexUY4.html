for CES seven six days left
five four three days left to CES Wow we
got another beautiful sunny January day
two days left I'll see us I fly out
tomorrow so it has been a pretty busy
start of the year and when I come back I
have this little number to take a full
extensive look at something that I've
been trying to hide in the studio it's
the new h1 50 i from corsair their new
360 all-in-one cooler
nothing is I accidentally reviewed it in
my 5 t video and it made it to Reddit
and then we got an email from Corsair
being like hey guys what's up but I'm
super excited to put this into one of my
cases and actually compared with another
360 all-in-one from be quiet that's the
what is it the silent loop 360 I guess
but this thing has RGB it looks
beautiful
so before we go I think we should unbox
this
well a 360 all-in-one that's pretty nice
a really thin radiator but look at this
tiny pump Wow
so I'm pretty excited about this one but
it will have to wait for after CES so
right now let's go get ready now so I've
always encouraged myself to travel light
and look at that surface area wise it's
pretty efficient sorry Fred
you're gonna have to wait and now let's
see what Ebers bringing well I guess
it's that time of the year again where
we get to pack it's pretty
straightforward I'm still rocking the
c100 Agathe Sennheiser MKE 600
microphone I'm not gonna bring my Costco
membership card I don't know why this
even why this is I think this is expired
so this is actually broken some lights
work some don't so let's just we'll just
have to see how this works if you guys
recall I did a video comparing the air
15 X to the Asus Jeffers notebook and I
preferred this over that primarily
because of its design so it's got the
edge twitch display great keyboard good
software or good trackpad so I realized
say that I lost my lens cap for the
Sigma lens and I was thinking to myself
well how am I supposed to take this with
me to Vegas you know without scratching
the glass now check this out guys I mean
isn't this amazing like come on you've
gotta appreciate the time in the effort
that I did I put to get this up and
running it up and set up
and you know you're in Vegas when the
pilot says have fun at CES and that his
gels everything picked up
so this is funny this is the first time
that we have an actual image on our
passes and mine has a stretched portrait
photo from the 1 + 5 T this is how every
Vegas trip begins yeah so those fire
things are really lifesavers in the
morning when it gets really cold so
welcome to Vegas my fifth time here
never disappoints to smack you right in
the face with all that smokiness look at
that
okay let's find a check-in meet Michael
and then wake friebert so it is 2:30 and
my time eastern Pacific
it's 11:30 here in Las Vegas I slept
pretty well but I gotta get to the hotel
and meet up with Mike and Demetri I got
a message from Mike saying that he's
already in bed so is Mike so I guess I'm
just gonna have to silently enter the
room and
okay so this is our fifth time at CES
and we want to treat ourselves and we're
three people in the suite
which by the way is awesome let me show
you oh we got the mysterious Mike over
here yeah II began ready and this suite
is absolutely incredible for the three
of us and for the three gentlemen so we
all feel very comfortable each other
right people wear zebra there you are
and then we have yeah
the mysterious Mike but first let me
show you around well good morning it is
7 a.m. everyone's still sleeping I'm
rendering my first CS video on the
throttle MacBook that has to be upside
down for best airflow so I think we're
on to a good start
Thanks so loud ok so that's the place
it's pretty incredible I love that we
have so much breathing room and we have
our own little workstation set up there
we even set up a little recording studio
in the kitchen with pillows for
dampening make sure to check out this
video over here but the thing is we
booked this place far in advance so it's
actually cheaper than what we were
renting last year and this place is much
bigger and allows us to actually invite
companies over so that we don't have to
go to them instead uh-huh and as usual
we're gonna have so much awesome content
coming up for CES and I hope you enjoyed
this little entry vlog showing our space
and how we've set up our home base so
thank you so much for watching make sure
to subscribe and check out this other
relevant content that we'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
