hard-working acts and I'm back with some
exciting content regarding the new
Galaxy Note 9 now I've been using this
phone ever since launch and I know my
first impressions video I talked about
how the 6 point 4 inch display was a big
upgrade for me personally coming from
the pixel 2 but having used this over
the weekend I'm actually slowly getting
used to it and I'm actually enjoying my
time watching content on the note 9 now
there are so many features to explore
with the note 9 because it is a feature
pack device and you know hence the price
tag of $1,000 but I actually wanted to
test something pretty interesting that
Samson did claim during their note 9
presentation and that is the
implementation of an advanced water
carbon cooling system inside the note 9
and Natta says she prevents the phone
from overheating
especially when you intend to play you
know game if you intend to gain on the
note 9 so I'm actually gonna validate
that because if you think about it every
flagship smartphone out there that comes
with the highest end processor so in
this case we have the snapdragon 845
octa-core CPU 6 gigs of ram 120
gigabytes of storage so in order to
dissipate the amount of heat you know
engineers have to design a cooling
solution that's a lot more efficient but
also doesn't you know give you an
unpleasant experience with overheating
while you're you know playing a game or
something like that so I'm gonna
validate that with a few tools that I
have here in the studio in fact I do
have one important tool I'm really
excited to try out so yeah let's take a
look at it and validate those or
validate the water cooling system inside
the note 9 but first a quick message
from our sponsor
treat your ears with the incredibly
comfortable HD 5/8 X Jubilee headphones
from mass drop and some Heiser
delivering sound expected from $500
headphones but only for a hundred fifty
bucks making it one of the best price to
performance skins available check out
and join the drop down below alright so
the testing methodology for this is
actually pretty straightforward I'll be
playing a couple of first-person shooter
games on the Galaxy Note 9 the first one
doesn't really need any much of an
introduction because it has been a
heavily anticipated or I guess a heavily
requested title for the Android platform
and interesting enough it's exclusive to
the note 9 and a few select Samsung
devices folks
fortnight is officially hitting the Play
stores very soon and I'm
pretty excited to try it out myself for
the first time next up we have pub G for
Android that also flexes the Adreno 630
GPU and I chose this title specifically
to create a point of comparison to my
Google pixel - since fortnight is
currently not available at least at the
time of making this video on the pixel -
and a few Android devices in fact it was
a collaboration between Epic Games and
Samsung during the note night launch to
bring fortnight exclusively on the note
9 and the newly announced Galaxy Tab as
for tablet and now if you are interested
in playing for tonight on the Android
and if you want to test out the Android
beta program you can actually sign up on
their website and you'll be part of the
invite list where they'll you know
randomly pick a hand pick a bunch of you
know users and you will be able to play
fortnight on the Android platform so
I'll leave a link to that in the
description down below now there are a
couple of things I'm looking forward to
when testing fortnight on the note 9 and
pub G on both the note 9 and the pixel -
one of them is of course the
temperatures because if you're gaming on
an Android smartphone you want to be
able to game at a comfortable setting
you don't want your you know hands to
sort of sweat over time and of course
prevent overheating because that's
something that we're looking into so
temperatures is definitely gonna play a
huge factor when it comes to this
testing methodology the second one is of
course what the what's the experience
like because if you look at both the
note 9 and the pixel the primary
difference between these two devices is
of course their screen size so you know
is it gonna is the bigger screen gonna
give you a lot more advantage when it
comes to a gaming or are you much better
off on gaming on a smaller display so
that's something that I'm also going to
tackle so I'll be using the FLIR efore
thermal camera to actually test or
evaluate the temperatures on both the
front side of the display and the rear
side of the phone to see what the
temperatures are like especially you
know after playing these games for about
15 minutes so that gives us roughly a
good amount of time to you know get the
phone warm up and of course see where
the temperatures are peaking at so
starting off with fortnight on the
galaxy note 9 I've gotta admit it was
actually an amazing experience playing
in for the first time on the mobile
platform in fact this is my first time
playing 49 in the first place and so it
got me a few trials to sort of get used
the gameplay and of course after 15
minutes of runtime
I was
able to get a temperature reading of
around forty five point nine degree
Celsius on the front side of the display
and switching over to the rear side
I got a temperature reading of around
forty two point nine degree Celsius so
it's certainly warmer to the touch I
wouldn't say it's way too warm because I
can certainly comfortably game on it I
can certainly feel the heat coming out
of the SOC but that's obvious given that
it's pushing really hard on the six
point four inch qHD plus display so
definitely keep your expectations medium
I'd say if that makes any sense because
don't expect you know the phone to stay
completely cool while gaming on it
because it is an SOC that's not actively
cooled so keep your expectations
somewhere along those lines but I'd love
to hear your thoughts on the results in
the comments down below are you
impressed
switching to pop G we saw a temperature
readout of around forty three point
seven degrees Celsius on the front side
and on the rear we got a readout of
around forty two point four degrees
Celsius so it's definitely respectable
alright so switching to the pixel two
running pub G and I definitely noticed
an increase in temperature compared to
the galaxy note nine so as you can see
with the front display I got a reading
around forty five degrees Celsius and
switching to the rear side I got a
temperature readout of around forty five
point seven degrees Celsius so hitting
the forty six degrees Celsius mark which
is definitely a little bit hotter on
compared to the galaxy note nine and it
kind of raises a few questions because
one the SOC on the pixel two is actually
located somewhere around the fingerprint
reader so that could be a little bit of
a limitation because it's right beside
the camera and there might not be as
much of a you know the the cooling
solution on the pixel two might not be
as efficient compared to the galaxy note
9 but that being said I did feel like
you know this part of the phone was it
felt a little bit warmer so that's
something to consider but like I said
both these games can still play just
fine the one thing that I will mention
is that I did experience a few
framedrops on the pixel too because it's
running you know a slightly outdated
version a Snapdragon 835 which is a year
old CPU compared to the eight forty five
processor on the galaxy note 9 so we
could definitely expect a little bit of
a performance difference between the two
which is obvious but you can still game
on the pixel two this is still a pretty
good smartphone at that but out of these
two smartphones which one would I pick
for gaming
to be honest I might actually have to go
with the galaxy note none because the
six point four inch display is just
amazing to look at and of course you get
a lot more real estate when it comes to
you know running around the gameplay and
of course you get a lot more detail and
the whole experience just you know
shooting your targets is really is an
immersive experience and you don't feel
like you're crammed and you don't feel
like you're just focusing on a smaller
screen like the pixel 2 which is a
little bit crammed in my opinion when
you're gaming on it and I think that's
where something like the note none can
come in really beneficial if you're
looking for a smartphone for gaming
because man the 6.4 display on this guy
is just it's amazing well folks that
about wraps up this video and for those
of you are wondering how the water
carbon cooling solution on the note 9
would play out especially with games
like 49 and babji well now we know by
the results and you know I want to hear
your thoughts on this whole
implementation especially when it comes
to smartphone brands trying to push
their limits when it comes from display
tech and you know cramming in the best
in terms of specs thermals is definitely
something that some brands tend to
compromise on but it looks like the note
9 seems to handle that relatively well
and I can't wait to explore some more
features with this device so definitely
stay tuned for more content
