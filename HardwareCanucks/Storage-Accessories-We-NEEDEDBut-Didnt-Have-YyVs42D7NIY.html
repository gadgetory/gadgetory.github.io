looking for tools or you know little
things to improve our efficiency our
workflow and how we share media and it
happens to be that we found something
that will do just that
at PNY now we don't normally talk about
small storage devices but you know once
we see these things we can't realize
just how important they could be for our
workflow so these are the dual link OTG
devices from kny they vary from capacity
of 32 to 128 gigabytes so that's pretty
good range you can buy them on Amazon so
we'll link a few down below but for
example I'll give you an actual example
of how these could be useful we share
media across the team all the time so
either with his beautiful pixel phone
takes a photograph and it looks hyper
realistic and me and Mike here just are
crying over what these cameras can do
Eber get that phone out of my frame
please seriously
so Ybor take a picture plug in this type
see into his phone transfer his media so
that I can plug this back into my phone
and download those pictures and then
where we can share in social media
because Eber doesn't have access all
right boom then normally you would share
media over Wi-Fi but there's compression
sometimes you don't get into the
internet access and that also what if
the file is gigantic if he's shooting 4k
video on his pixel I want that
information right here this is the only
way to go if you want that raw data we
do have different connections so a type
C microUSB and the Lightning port for
your iPhone the iPhone one is nice and
fancy and also can charge your phone by
the way so here on the other end is a
USB type a so you can you know extract
information from your phone and plug
this thing to your computer so you can
have that raw data there as well it's
also very good for backup 128 gigabyte
capacity I can plug it in I can enable
the backup on the app by itself so it
can automatically do that things in the
background and I don't have to worry
about so you know something crashing or
and just have all that information it's
safe in a separate place but another
cool thing that I want to share with you
guys is this little number so what I
have in my hand is 512 gigabytes of
storage half a terabyte in my hand so I
can plug this into my
own Nintendo switch it might do my drone
into anything because it also has
obviously the full size as the adapter
this is the P&amp;amp;Y 512 gigabyte micro SD
card that isn't say my friends we could
have shot this entire context coverage
of all seven days on this single as
micro SD card with the adapter and still
not have run out of storage but
dangerous but also quite dangerous
obviously there are multiple users or
for micro SD card if you're plugging
this thing into your smartphone the only
thing is that the firmware on the
smartphone has to match or has to
support the such large capacities but
I'm sure as more of these become
available that will not be an issue
alright so now that we're back from PNY
let me show you how we've been working
for the past week to deliver this
content for Computex
there are a lot of stories on this table
so let's begin with a banana so coffee
thanks always claims some victims so
right now Ebert charger is literally
falling apart then should we gonna
replace it when you go to the camera
store my brand new launch the g3 or 5
mounts stopped working all of a sudden
while Ebers Mouse is also wireless it
still works but only under 24 hours so
you have to recharge it constantly it's
super an annoyance
Michaels headphones here right here have
fallen apart look at that cable I don't
do them on touch them I feel like they
can adjust the situation in my things
and the last thing that's kind of been
broken is the internet so if we have
three devices connected to the Wi-Fi
nothing is going through so we have to
costly disconnect one of the devices so
we can upload the videos so the notebook
spectrum here is quite surprising
Michael why don't you tell us about your
10 year old by oh 10 year old viola Zee
one of the best ones that have ever been
made we're the best notebooks I've ever
had is being replaced unfortunately
everything still works still 8 hours of
battery life and it's it actually has
USB ports it has more USB ports a my
macbook and as you can
more USB ports in the new Dell XPS
notebook oh and check this out a disk
drive all inside a compact it's
relatively thin but it has an expanded
battery on the bottom check that out
Wow so eight hours battery life and
ergonomics Eva what about you well I'm
using the gigabyte arrow key Phoenix as
you guys know this has been my editing
for such an PC ever since I got it
I've done a few upgrades have added a
new SSD or an additional SSD for mental
responses and I maxed out the rabbit of
32 gigabytes now with the recent update
with Adobe Premiere hardware
acceleration has been an amazing feature
videos just print faster like for
example a ten minute video renders in
like two minutes so overall a fantastic
notebook for mobile editing I'm very
jealous of that one Ebert because I'm on
a mid 2015 MacBook Pro that thing with
hardware acceleration is actually not
bad but yeah it's quite slow guys alone
and this Sony Vaio is running the
appropriate Windows software the windows
7 which only requires one gig of memory
to run and this notebook has how many to
my it has four gigs of ram that's insane
you're one person but that just shows
that the way that they're making
programs nowadays not right not right at
all alright so we love to discover new
little things to improve our workflow
and efficiency and I will try to of
course bring you more of this type of
stuff that there's a little bit
unconventional potentially not not many
people talk about it but of course it
could be something super useful in our
and potentially your daily life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
