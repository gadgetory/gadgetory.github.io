500 from San Heiser how did they look
they look ridiculous man you mean you
don't like how I can fit my entire hand
above the ear cup you know what you
could do is actually hold another pair
of headphones using using the little
cutout in your head so like have another
set of headphones sort of dangling on
the side you know like this oh my god it
actually works where has the gaming
headset design gone now we have this
what are you wearing right now what's
your favorite um I'm actually wearing
the AKG K 7 X's these are the mass
repetition super comfortable lightweight
I love it all right so this is
ridiculous so let's review the GSP 500
right after this
thanks Seaver yay the new master keys MK
750 keyboard comes with a comfortable
magnetic wrist rest beautiful RGB light
bar on the perimeter and perky lighting
control with a variety of Cherry MX
switches and the bottom type-c
connection Coolermaster doing it right
check it out the low all right so the
intro basically summarizes my almost
frustration with the entire gaming
headset market direction because why did
they have to be all so clunky so chunky
so like really in your face and
aggressive design and especially coming
from some hyzer the company that's
brought us the game series which I would
consider to be the best headset lineup
ever they look fantastic they're
comfortable they sound amazing and the
microphone is best in class but I
understand son Heiser needs to expand
and diversify their gaming lineup
because you know games your own game one
where you go from there whereas with the
GSP lineup you add 300 600 and now 500
easy diversification within their
product lineup so the GSP 500 is just an
open back version of the GSP 600 with a
few needed modifications so let's talk
about them now and so the one thing I
appreciate with the open back version is
the simplification of the body so for
example the ear cups no longer have this
very aggressive look to them on the
exterior for example the red accents are
just round and no longer have this
industrial feel to them as on the GSP
600 the GSP 500 is also about 40 grams
lighter than the GSP 600 which is
definitely a compliment in this whole
comfort element because both of them
have pretty strong clamping force but
just p600 more so because it's a closed
back pair so they need to create that
really tight seal so you cannot hear
anything but this being an open back
design the clamping force is just right
and having a lighter frame overall
means you can wear them for longer
without experiencing any fatigue or
clamping force anywhere on your head the
clamping force has also been reduced
with this one which I appreciate
so at the bottom of the ear cup no
longer is kind of like the dominant
pressing point and you have to adjust
around that now here they're a bit more
natural whereas with GSP 600 look at how
much it kind of it curves like a
triangle at the bottom whereas here we
can actually have a bit more space when
they're in this like default orientation
and the one thing that I don't
appreciate from son Heiser is their
imaging on the site where all the
headphones look like the ear cups are
flat which is not the case at all when
the headphone is just by default it's
very much just a triangle one that the
ear cups come down and even more so when
the GSP 600 that have pretty strong
clamping force in this bottom section so
perhaps they should change up their
imagery to actually demonstrate what
these headset looked like when they're
on your head
the ear cup design is also quite
different on a 500 versus the 600 it's a
first of all it's not as thick it does
not have the leather material instead we
have this soft fabric which is super
comfortable on your skin there is no
heat concentration it allows you to
breathe which is awesome but it does not
have any memory foam on the interior of
the ear cup like you would on the 600
that would hold the shape whenever you
would press into it so here there are
more firm but still the seal is quite
good and it allows to it kind of retains
a lot of the base inside the ear cup
which is awesome
despite having these kind of open
sections on the earcup where the sound
would leak now the two reasons why I
love open-back headphones is because one
sound stage is widened so the audio is
not concentrated in your ear cups
instead it's a bit more open it's much
more Airy and I prefer that sound
signature and for number two I just like
to be aware of my ambient surroundings
so if I'm listening to music really loud
volumes or playing a video game and
somebody is at the door I can hear them
knocking or ringing the bell I can hear
my phone ringing I can hear if there's
something on the stove that needs to be
turned off and whenever I test any
closed-back headsets like the chess
piece 600 which provides incredible
isolation you know you could be yelling
on my ear right behind me and I could
not hear anything so that kind of scares
me a little bit of not being aware of
what's happening in my space so
open-back nature headsets is just the
way to go for me personally now the ear
cups are removable if you want to clean
them and potentially clean anything
around the driver and maybe even swap
them out for leather ear cups if you
want more isolation and bass enclosure
the microphone is no longer as stiff as
on the GSP 600 so the headset stays in
position when you bring it down or when
you mute it in the upright position and
the volume dial on the right side has
nice stiffness to it so you don't
accidentally change your volume whenever
you you know handle the headset it
doesn't actually rotate the headset like
you would on the GSP 600 microphone test
time so what you're hearing now is the
GSP 500 I think it sounds awesome one of
the best microphones on the gaming
headset there is no nasally
characteristics it has some compression
going on so the voice has bass has
detail in the sounds identical to the
GSP 600 so what you're hearing now is
the GSP 600 the microphone is identical
it sounds exactly the same this is going
directly into my motherboard so there's
no compression this is straight unedited
the only thing here is that because it's
a closed headset everything I say right
now is muted and I really don't like
that feeling
and finally the Game one headset which
has been my go-to microphone for gaming
headsets I think it sounds phenomenal
this one doesn't have as much bass as
the others and this one has a little bit
more compression but out of the three
which one do you like the sound of the
most I really like the 2 meter
removable cable the braiding is awesome
and doesn't kink and it doesn't like
catch with anything but you can still
hear the cable noise when the cable is
brushing against your shirt or something
now in terms of overall comfort I
preferred that 500 over the GSP 600
because the clamping force is not as
strong so when you put them on it
doesn't feel like you have a lot more
pressure concentrated at the bottom of
the ear cup which is definitely present
on the GSP
600 you still have the headband pressure
adjustment with these sliders that have
low markings so you can make sure that
they're in this equal position however
on the size expansion while they would
accommodate really large heads you still
have no markings for size adjustment on
the the headband so you don't know
exactly if you're expanding them equally
on each side now the one thing I have to
point out is that in order to achieve a
uniform seal on the entire height of the
ear cup you have to play around not only
with size adjustment and the headband
slider is up top but also the angle at
which the headset and the headband sits
on your head
because otherwise you might experience
too much pressure at the bottom of the
ear cup and too loose at the top and so
I found that by pushing the the headset
forward a little bit more I'm able to
cover my ears more uniformly so the ear
cup is there and it's the pressure sort
of distribution is all equal and I
mention that because for headsets like
the game one it's super low profile it's
snug on your head it's absolutely
perfect there's not too much clamping
force but you can only expand the size
there is no adjustability in terms of
the pressure point like you would on the
GSP 500 and 600 and I'm not sure what
type of maybe focus groups they had that
indicated that this would be the best
designs for the current you know gaming
generation or something that would buy
this product but I feel like they're
over complicating the comfort department
whereas the bottom of the headset is
just way too inward it's way too much of
a triangle and that causes you know them
to create these adjustable headband
sliders to compensate for this frame
error whereas with the game one is you
can see the ear cups are completely flat
by default and they can rotate based on
the head shape so that I would find them
them having this like flat nature
is a lot more comfortable than having a
lot more pressure at the bottom first
and then rotating to fit when your head
size and so now you know how I feel
about the GSP 500 in terms of comfort
versus the 600 I like these more the
open nature style is awesome they're
lighter comfort wise is better
not as much clamping force now in terms
of sound performance they have the same
driver specifications as the 600 but
have totally different characteristics
so for the 600 they tune them to be a
little bit more open so they even tell
you listen to a closed bag design the
sound stage is more widened and it's
like not through simulated surround
sound but through the driver tuning and
stuff like that so you would experience
something on a larger scale even though
everything was enclosed within the ear
cup with the GSP 500 I don't think they
have to do that because the open nature
already does that automatically in terms
of expanding your your sound environment
so I feel like the drivers here are more
tuned like naturally you still get
really good bass not as like rumbling
deep all inside the ear cup base as you
would on the 600 but really powerful you
can feel it and not airy the base on the
GSP 500 is absolutely incredible for an
open back nature compared to the game
one which has absolutely almost no bass
whatsoever in terms of treble control
some Heiser has always been on the
smoother end so no issues here
absolutely no harshness even if you
listen to something treble heavy
hi I'm heavy no problems with control
and no fatigue whatsoever
the best thing about this headset for
games is the creation of this natural
stereo imaging that's in front of you
you can clearly separate between stereo
left and right channels no problem you
don't need to simulate surround sound to
get this large or you environment
because the open back nature already
does that for you so playing which are
three for example you're in the forest
you can feel exactly how large the
forest is you know at listening to
something super closed off in your ear
cups and I love this expansion that
happens naturally without any surround
sound simulation if you really want to
gain an advantage in like pub G if you
want to know exactly where people are
coming from you get that sense of
somebody's upstairs and you know exactly
it
part of the floor they are on and not
just hearing something at the top of the
ear cup so this expansion of the sounds
sound imaging and sound environment is
really helpful for competitive if you
really want to know exactly where those
little minut audio details are coming
from I replayed half-life 2 with this
pair and man what an experience is like
feeling the audio environment you know
it's a really old game so the sound
engine is not up to par what we get with
like battlefield one right now but still
it's just feeling the audio
immersiveness and seeing g-man for the
first time that was absolutely
incredible
but is it $230 incredible it is $20
cheaper versus the GSP 600 so if you
don't need that incredible isolation you
get with these and potentially can try
them on before you buy them to see if
the fit is right for you the GSP 500
would definitely be my pick they are
improving the GSP lineup though so in
comparison to the older game series the
build quality on these is much better
and the the game one is my second pair
in two years something happened inside
the ear Cup and the audio was not
working the bass extension here is much
improved versus the game series and you
still get that airy soundstage really
nice detailed treble without the
harshness it's all smooth really
excellent mid-range but the bass is a
lot more pronounced versus the older
stuff I still like the fit and the look
of the game series but I'm guessing
they're moving into this direction for a
little bit more recognition when they're
finally like you know part of like
eSports competitions where something
like this on players heads would
definitely gain son Heiser that brand
gaming recognition join the wireless
club with Corsairs new dark core Mouse
play the way you want with nine
programmable buttons aligned in the
comfortable shape and fantastic sensor
you can trust and crazy good Wireless
performance plus qi wireless charging
built-in focus on the game the dark core
will do the rest
alright guys so that is it for my review
of the GSP 500 I'm pretty happy with the
improvements they've done over the GSP
600 but yeah you let me know what you
think of this direction from Sennheiser
