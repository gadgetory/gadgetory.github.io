the morning on Thursday and I'm about to
catch a flight because AMD invited us to
New York City for briefing on Rison -
and of course the platform and I'm
actually pretty excited because I think
a lot of you guys are excited about
Rison - and what kind of performance
improvements it's I'm gonna bring when
compared to the first generation rise in
CPUs so yeah I'm actually pretty excited
so let's go catch this flight are you
ready okay watch this
so that is what the components must feel
like inside the H 500 P managed by
Coolermaster check it out in the
description below
so I'm finally here in New York City
after that heavy turbulence when I was
about to land I was actually pretty
scary and then the heavy traffic on my
way from the airport to the hotel so I
spent about 22 23 minutes just just
getting from there okay so I'm not
exactly sure if I'll be talking about
the rise into stuff and platform in this
video but ideally I'd like to showcase
what it's like to be here in a named
event and what it's like to cover an
event like this let me just adjust my
exposure here perfect so yeah just to
showcase what it's like to be an event
like this and of course get some insight
and feedback on if some fellow members
that I know of and what they think about
the products so it'll be interesting to
see what they think about rise into and
of course showcase like the behind the
scenes stuff with you guys because I'm
sure a lot of you guys are curious about
how this whole thing works out
so right now AMD is that they're
basically accommodating us for the day
and I'll actually be flying out tomorrow
we have three presentations that we have
to attend we'll get some hands-on stuff
hopefully with the rise into products
and just see what it is and I have like
two hours left what should I do
well I'm actually in the middle of
scripting ds9 review so I'm probably
gonna finish finish my script on this
guy because I have a lot to talk about
it so yeah let's do that okay so I did
get some work done on the s10 review but
I was also setting up for the rising to
a presentation so basically you know I'm
setting up the stuff on my laptop so let
me show what exactly what exactly is
going on so I brought my laptop
obviously this is the Aero 15 X my
editing beast but I've also opened up a
Google Docs folder so I can put all my
information in the notes and stuff so I
can actually use them as key points
while I'm actually doing my explain
video later on so labeled it
appropriately a pulse is gonna put the
NDA and of course the time I'll make
sure that it's correct so I can actually
when the embargo lists I'll be able to
share the information with you guys so
yeah pretty excited about it
so let's head out to the event right now
well
that's where we're meeting all right so
we somehow managed to get in but check
this out this is like the most so we're
entering through the kitchen Wow
and here we are pretty nice fancy place
guys all right registration time
Hey look who are you turn em into oh
hello hardware connects viewers fancy
seeing you here welcome to New York yeah
we're at the where are we I please
Houston Paul he's Nichols called yeah
this is usually a bar no we're here to
learn about rising - mm-hmm what are
your expectations I think it should be
faster 12 nanometer instead of 14
nanometer and we are hearing early
rumors that the Fox beads are a decent
amount so nice 4.3 4.5 gigahertz is what
I'm hearing tossed around whoa supposed
to like the four ball games
okay so it's lunch time right here in
Houston Hall pretty cool thing actually
I really like it
so we're gonna have lunch and then
presentation gonna take place right over
here so it's kind of like the one
setting thing it's completely different
from what we did last time with the
bagel lunch
and so that's pretty much a wrap for the
presentation we're on a 15-minute break
right now but I'm gonna I'm asked Paul
what do you things about my rising too
because he had a few expectations so
let's just see what he has to say here's
what it comes down to
and II they put this dessert in front of
us right here this plate cookies
brownies like what am I supposed to do
is but I'm sitting here I'm supposed to
listen to this presentation about
technology new rising processors
I got XFR to and precision boost too and
all this stuff but I love time I'm just
trying to keep myself from eating too
many of these cookies I actually managed
to only have one of these single brownie
bites the entire time I was sitting here
taking so more important than any of
this rise into stuff I just wanted to
say I'm very proud of all right guys so
we're in the hands-on section right now
so we're basically comparing two systems
we have one from team red and another
one from Team Blue
basically identical specs so I think
this is the one with the risin 525 or
2600 X Vega 64 and it's running Deus Ex
mankind mankind divided
yeah we're getting roughly 60 frames per
second on this guy again this is just
hands-on time we really haven't done any
I mean you guys have to wait until the
full review because you know we always
like to test our own stuff but yeah 60
frames per second 56 on this guy these
the specs just in case you're wondering
same Vega 64 GPU these are stock sayings
by the way they haven't overclocked it
you know what else I find interesting
with the AMD systems they've decided to
go with RGB everywhere so as you can see
every system over here features G skills
try to see RGB memory of course are to
be motherboards and you know what's
really interesting is that the new rate
prism cooler comes with an RGB ring in
RGB fan so yeah I think AMD has embraced
rjp it is official so Amos actually
invited us to join their overclocking
Olympics it's a more friendly
competition so myself and a bunch of
other press members are supposed to
compete and kind of come up with the
best results with the new rise into CPS
so I'm gonna see how far I can overclock
one of these processors they'll be
interesting I think puzzles are gonna
join are you gonna take it down Oh
that's a fancy if you're gonna do ln2
overclocking you gotta make sure you
have a high quality heat source and of
course Hello Kitty only the highest
quality everything basically you should
all buy Hello Kitty stuff well see they
pay me to self pop all recommended so
we're trying for point two I think yeah
and you give it a little bit of multiple
voltage yep
alright alright
Bob's gonna take one more shot and then
we're gonna see if we can break the
19-hundred on Cinebench all right we're
gonna see if this works
Oh 19:06 my friends yes 19:06 that
that's check this out guys 19:06 honest
on in 2,700 eggs what is it what are the
other things 4.2 to 5 gigahertz so just
a little bit over 4.2 our voltage is at
1.5 which is a little high of course but
this is for benchmarking overclocking
testing and the real trick trick I think
to getting the maximum overclock was
rising to its 2,700 X is to have someone
who has formally done professionally
over professional overclocking like
Steve from tweak 10 who came over just
moments ago right go into the BIOS and
all these sub BIOS settings were you
like what the heck does that does he's
like I'm just going to change this and
change this and I'll make things faster
and then it does that that's how you do
it it's all about trial and error and
hey we broke the score the record 1900
so I think we're pretty happy with this
with this session here so yeah this is
my second time here in New York City and
one of the things I've always wanted to
do is visit Time Square and this is my
first time taking the subway with
Paul we have so this would be fun
this is really happening this is this is
actually really happening
are you excited Paul kind of excited you
don't look safe yeah I don't know I'm
not sure how excited I should be exactly
so I'm matching what you excited I just
I just see a lot of lights that's that's
basically it that's that's the whole
deal with me I'm backpacks for life.org
I've never been more excited about that
you like that you know one of the things
I noticed is that I don't think you
would need external lighting to let
yourself in the night because like it's
it's nice and well-lit you've got all
these screens all over the place so if
you want to shoot video you can just
bring your camera you don't need a high
performance sensor or whatever so pretty
cool
so it is 8 a.m. on Friday here in New
York City I'm about to go have breakfast
and then head back to the airport
but guys overall I really enjoyed my
time here short time here in the city of
course last day or yesterday most of
time was spent for the Andy stuff but it
was really exciting too and I definitely
fulfilled one of my wishes which was to
visit New York's Times Square and it was
quite the experience I definitely had a
lot of fun I learned an interesting fact
that the event so Verizon or AMD
launched 20 Rison processors in 8 months
I repeat 20 processors in 8 months
that's ridiculous if you think about it
I don't think Intel has ever done that
but but it looks like you know their new
lineup of CPUs is they look promising
the performance difference might not
seem as a significant increase it might
be a significant increase I don't know I
still have to test it out I think by the
time you're watching this video a lot of
the were used must be out I'm never
gonna compare the 27 X to the 1700 X
system that I have on my main hitting PC
and see if it's worth actually upgrading
so I hope you took away something from
this vlog and what it's like to cover an
NDA event in this case AMD but it's
normally this it's similar when it comes
to other brands like Nvidia or Intel or
anything else you just just have to make
sure that none of the information goes
out of your publication before the NDA
that's something that you always have to
keep in mind because it is pretty
serious
I consider India's to be important but
yeah I'm gonna go head back to Toronto
so I'll catch you guys the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
