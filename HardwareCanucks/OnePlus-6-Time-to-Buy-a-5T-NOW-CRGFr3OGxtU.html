my flights at 6:00 in the morning so I
have a little bit of time to sleep going
to London for the new one plus six
launch should be fun your device you
should be able to deliver whatever you
need whenever you need it so I'm packing
super light but the force cannot avoid
the tripod the thing is it all started
with this interesting invitation I'm
sure the phone is shaped this way and
also we have this two side glass so I
guess you can expect what comes next
alright time to sleep I'll see you guys
in London
alright good people welcome to London
the event is about to start I'm about to
head out but first a quick city tour
that's right
all right we're here where's the sign
there you go all right so the main
takeaway with this one plus six launch
is that it's both fast and smooth
something that oneplus has always
delivered to us so with their latest
generation smartphone I feel like and
that's exactly what carplay wanted to
emphasize so I've been using the 5 T
ever since launch and so the main
differences between that and the 1 plus
6 is that the alert slider has now been
moved above the power button so that
might conflict with your thumb placement
the screen has also received a slight
bump in size because of that additional
top left in the right areas but Android
is not fully ready for that notch
implementation yet so it doesn't fully
is not utilized properly in full screen
apps so I feel like we're just not there
yet and I've been told by many who own
the iPhone 10 that the iOS
implementation of the notch is much
better for applications where it
actually utilizes that area for other
things within the app unlike on the
Android version but it's still a
beautiful display
it's OLED so blacks or inky and the DI
cp3 color mode looks awesome the
fingerprint sensor has been changed from
a circle to the surrounded rectangle and
dual vertical cameras are now in the
center for symmetry I do like their
upgrades for the camera so the sensor is
now 19% larger the pixels are larger so
we get better low-light performance
there's additional bokeh effects for the
portrait mode which is kind of silly but
really cool to see how they can take it
with software and I'm really excited to
see their slow motion mode at 480 fps at
720p resolution so the resolution is a
bit on the low side but you can record
up to admit it and then cut out only the
portion that you need so you're not
necessarily struggling to capture the
perfect moment you have a little bit of
leeway to capture that in slow motion as
expected this is a dual glass phone but
surprisingly it's actually more grippy
than my aluminum 5 T once you get some
human oils on it and it actually looks
stunning when clean with this curved
reflection look I think for video
coverage it's an awesome attraction but
only on the glossy version as the main
block looks kind of bland while the
limited edition white and gold is
stunning with this unique smooth texture
on the glass now this departure from an
aluminum body is convex
affected as they go along with the flow
of other smartphones but there is no
wireless charging they're still a
headphone jack so no problems there and
a type C port - charging a favorite
feature of mine on the 5 T and it's kind
of funny how Carl only wanted to spend
one minute on specs because they're kind
of irrelevant it's a fast phone with
lots of RAM and storage
it loads games faster and game mode and
reduces unnecessary loading of graphics
for apps to save on battery and so the
oneplus 6 almost feels like this perfect
Android smartphone with clean oxygen OS
but I'm not sure I'm ready to ditch my 5
t just yet because the notch design
really bugs me at how the sides are
slightly angled coming down and this
proportions for the notch don't seem
natural I think I would have liked it to
have been wider and not as tall but
regardless I think it's just a matter of
me getting used to it and now let's hear
what others think of what oneplus could
have done differently for the 1 plus 6
what's up guys sap from super SAP CBI
if there was one thing that I changed
into one of bus 6 it would be for it to
have wireless charging it's got a glass
back so you know technically you would
have been possible and I'm somebody who
does use a wireless charging not all the
time but occasionally so it would be
nice to have that but otherwise I'm
pretty lucky phone everybody this is
dawn
one thing that I would change is how the
knotch works like okay they're not just
here is the 2018 thing I'm okay with it
I can deal with it but just seems like a
lot of Android software isn't ready for
the knotch like there's nothing special
happening here in most apps it just
hides a notch anyway so that kind of
leads me to wonder what's the point
unless we have software that's dedicated
to take advantage of hey what's up
everybody this is Danny I think the
biggest thing with the glass design is I
wish there was wireless charging that's
probably one of the biggest things about
it but I'm actually worried about the IP
rating on this thing because with
glasses eyes you see IP six to seven IP
68 but they said it was resistant at
everyday slashes which makes me think is
IP 53 so I would like to see an official
IP 67 or 68 rating on this thing so I
that's one thing that I wish they would
have changed on the oneplus
what's up guys it's Carl here one thing
that I would change if you guys saw this
silk white I would have actually had
preferred if it was the white and say
like a gunmetal not too sure about the
rose gold just a minor thing on the
design end but overall looking for it
easy hey what's up everybody it's
Jonathan and if there was one thing I
could change about the 1 plus 6 it would
be to have dual speakers like a dual
speaker system I think they kind of
missed out on that a lot of smartphone
manufacturers are adding that I think
they could have really had a little bit
more to introduce with the 1 plus 6 to
do it about them alright guys so the one
thing that's really kind of bothers me
about the 1 plus 6 is the curvature of
the bottom of this play to me it doesn't
match up the frame per so the actual
screen curvature is not identical to the
frame curvature because the screen is
slightly higher and it gives you this
illusion that something is off now the
price point has remained and the similar
price bracket as the 5 T that's a good
thing and we have a 256 gigabyte version
available coming out under $700 that's
pretty good and so with this launch I
feel like oneplus has won a larger
android market share with the 1 plus 6 I
feel like it's a balanced package in
terms of specs to price to performance
and we kind of already know what to
expect from oneplus so there's no like
totally complete surprises and I would
say that's a good thing and I just hope
they're smooth and fast mentality
doesn't translate into a shorter six
month cycle for the eventual 60 because
that's kind of what happened the one
plus five and the six month later 5t
join the wireless club with Corsairs new
dark core Mouse play the way you want
with nine programmable buttons aligned
in the comfortable shape and fantastic
sensor you can trust and crazy good
Wireless performance plus Qi wireless
charging built-in focus on the game the
dark core will do the rest
all right so let me know what you think
of the one plus six are you picking one
up and if not why not let me know in the
comments below
