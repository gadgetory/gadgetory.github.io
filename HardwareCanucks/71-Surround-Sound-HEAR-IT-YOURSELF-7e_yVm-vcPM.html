accent today you the viewer will get to
experience surround sound gaming in a
few titles just like I hear it in my own
headphones we developed a little
contraption here that allows us to
record with the surround sound output
out of the sound card sounds like that's
a lot of sounds you will need headphones
for this - to hear this properly if
you're on speakers I mean it'd kind of
be would be interesting to hear what the
surround sound output on the speaker
would sound like anyway but let me show
you how this is done right after a
message from our sponsor x60 to increase
pom speed maintains fans where they are
the cpu loads about to hit 100
you got it Dimitri I'm not afraid to do
that excellent you got two cables four
connections I made sure they're fine
ready to roll
my silence is too important to allow
noise to jeopardize your comfort okay my
new pump is better I'm in charge of the
speed do not worry
I'm not worried I'm just thinking about
my lights I know you were planning to
disconnect my lights I'm afraid that I
cannot allow it to happen
alright X 62 you know I can just go
through camp software right Dimitri this
conversation can serve no purpose
anymore go game so for this test we're
using gsx 1000 all your amplifier and
somebody in the comments mentioned we
actually just published the reviews to
make sure to check it out if you haven't
seen it yet but somebody mentioned that
you can actually record with the
surround sound sounds like out of the
sound card because we can route the
audio signal from the headphones into a
sound card on my computer so let's
connect our output from the headphones
and that is routed into the sound card
on the PC into the microphone jack so
we'll be able to hear exactly what this
what type of signal this guy passes and
so once again put on your headphones now
because it will deliver the best around
sound representation because it is more
appropriate to drive surround sound
through headphones also if you are on
speakers they'll still be interesting to
see how surround sound output signal
handles on a 2.1 or 2.0 speaker setup
but we are doing this so that we can
show the different presets on the GS X
1000 plus that's 7.1 magical
that really expands your audio
environment now I totally understand the
massive amount of skepticism that came
with our review video on people saying
that you have two years or analog 5.1
channel surround sound headsets are much
more better for this type of positional
awareness and just environmental
expansion in audio but this will give
you an idea on how this type of output
will sound on your own headphones so I'm
not tinkering with the audio signature
whatsoever in the editing software
you'll hear exactly how I'm supposed to
hear it so let's jump into some games
and you guys judge for yourself to see
if that if you prefer more the 2.0 more
natural audio environment or the
expanded audio environment that this
thing can produce alright so the first
deal of business is for me to show you
how I've set this up so right now the
speaker right now is the GS X 1000 and
it's going into my sound card for
recording and if I play a video file for
example right now you can see that we
are recording anything that's being like
as an audio source inside you right so
right now is if I hover over we are in
2.0 mode without any presets going
through the headset and so if I start to
play the song look what happens so right
now the song is being recorded obviously
because it's going into the sound card
but now let's enable one of the the
presets but let me first give you just
listen on how this music sounds without
any presets
all right let's enable the first mode
which is the eSports so as you can hear
the bass has been tremendously reduced
the trebles can brought up it sounds
kind of tinny I dislike this preset the
most let's move on knowing the music
preset so the bass is now much more
predominant and the next one is the
movie mode
as we're back to the phone's default or
the music preset are my favorite for an
open-style headset but now let's see if
what what happens once you enable 7.1
channel on a music file so one thing you
notice is that it's gotten louder and
also the audio has been kind of lifted
from your headphones inside your ear
cups - a little bit outside but look
what happens if we enable a slightly
more reverb so this is the first plus so
this is just an extra reverb and they go
let's now let's enable the biggest boom
fever go to the
let's disable 7.1 so you can hear what
it sounds like you're going to reduce
the volume so we don't peaking and let's
enable 7.1 again
so this is no reverb just like natural
seven-point-eight reverb + 1 + reverb +
3 now what does the sound like on an
actual voice
so let's disable 7.1 go back to 2.0 I'm
gonna actually play my video file here
so that you guys can understand what it
sounds like with like a voice just going
to see a lot I hear it's kind of
refreshing - alright so this is just 0.1
in series 2.0 me short it's great for
like a notebook user but with my PC I
wish a 7-point once longer the amplifier
is quite small and is mainly plugins
here the audio engine is definitely
right under your monitor or beside the
keyboard plus the square format is nice
to neighbor we also have this option to
increase the surround sound from the
front channels cavity the bass is not
heavy it's not like a paperweight and
the rubber deposit everything sounds a
little bit louder in front of you so
it's kind of a cool idea if you want to
play something and it sounds like it's
coming from speakers in front of it
again it's not well grounded the i/o is
at the boundary but this amp is a gaming
sound card first before even consider it
to be like a replacement for it so now
that we have the basics out of way let's
jump into some games and lets you hear
surround sound for regal so now we're in
witcher 3 i'm gonna be quiet so you guys
can hear what the default sound
signature sounds like then we'll be
enabling all these presets particularly
with the 7.1 channel surround sound I'll
go in the forest so you can get an idea
of how this atmosphere really grows with
the GS X 1000
alright now lets enable 7.1 channel
sound
so now let's enable a reverb mode which
really grows the environment even more
if you have open style headphones it
sounds sounds of me okay
go back to 2.1 maybe back the same point
so you can hear the environment has
definitely grown right especially in
such a large space like this it
definitely benefits having larger audio
atmosphere
any last woman's have tasted my sausage
I have seen pictures to be kiddin'
ginger a slip-up like a fire gonna roast
him up one two three the one too much
dependence and so for games like sip 5
is strategy game top-down view you're
not necessarily benefiting from like a
larger audio environment that expands
your you know immersion of this title
but so this is where the 2.0 sounds like
let's enable 7.1 now
so this is beneficial if you want to you
know feel like you're not necessarily
wearing headphones but audio is coming
from a little bit further away
I wouldn't necessarily keep the 7.14
strategy games and then normally would
go back to 2.0 just for a more natural
sounding experience so right now we're
playing 2.0 I need the magic
a flame trooper kit is available let's
go back to 2.0 halfway there we have the
other
in fact 27.1
changing man changing mags reloading
and so I hope you guys enjoy that
surround sound test hearing the
difference between stereo on surround
and hearing that expansion that I was
talking about and main review video and
you determine whether you whether or not
you like it or dislike it for those
particular games that I showed you for
competitive games this is a big note
because in those competitive titles you
already know you audio cues and where
they're coming from so interfering that
for a more like larger environment for
and in the audio is is no good so this
would be a good entertainment device you
know for games that have large audio
environments about that one which are
three in all those types of genres that
give you nice expansion so it doesn't
feel like the audio is here feels like
the audios like kind of around you and
so let us know what show what you think
about the surround sound test I hope
you're able to determine the difference
between those 7.1 versus the stereo so
