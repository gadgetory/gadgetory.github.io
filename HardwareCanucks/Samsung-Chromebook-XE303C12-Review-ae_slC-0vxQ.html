great technology selections and service
hey guys this is Dmitry and welcome back
to another haru-kun x review so the
Chromebook where does it fit in within
the list of portable devices it's not an
ultrabook nor a tablet and it's not
meant to compete with either but they
all have something in common and that's
portability and the user specific
purpose the Chromebook is in a similar
market waters as tablets because of the
price which are $249
let's face it is very competitive the
series 3 Chromebook looks and feels like
an ultrabook it's quite light at 2.4
pounds and with dimensions that could
easily be carrying around in a small bag
also for an all-plastic design which
looks a luminary is very deceiving it's
actually quite sturdy although we did
notice signs of wear at the bottom after
just a few hours of use then for call
activity and the bag features a power
plug full-sized HDMI port USB 2 and USB
3 ports and a SIM card slot for 3G
models and on the side we have a
combined headphone / microphone jack and
an SD card slot now given we only have
16 gigabytes of internal storage that SD
card slot will come in handy for
transferring documents or just you know
media playback the screen is sized at
11.6 inches with the resolution of 1366
by 768 and in this price we can't
complain but you can sure make out those
pixels when working with text now
viewing angles are nothing to brag about
contrast drop significantly when viewed
either from above or below but the
screen manages to hold pretty strong
with side-to-side viewing the webcam is
only 0.3 megapixels which will come in
handy for Google Hangouts and those
Skype calls and we also have plenty of
funny effects to be used for that
FaceTime and the audio you listening to
now is recorded by the built-in
microphone on the Samsung Chromebook as
you can hear it's pretty decent it would
suffice for regular Skype calls and
Google
else as well the keyboard on the
Chromebook has its flaws but that's
actually quite nice
first there's almost no flex and for
something that's this thin it makes us
happy
second the travel time and the bounds
for the keys is well executed for any
text work which will most likely be
doing if you do get the Chromebook third
we have a set of Chrome OS specific
buttons to maneuver your browser adjust
the screen brightness and control your
volume now it also has a useful built-in
shortcut function which shows all quick
navigation tips to be used with the
Chromebook using the shift ctrl alt and
search buttons as fortunately the keys
are not backlit which makes working in
dark environments a lot more difficult
now the trackpad is smooth it supports
two finger scrolling with left click
integrate it into the lower portion of
the trackpad and the right click only
through two finger tap the speakers are
positioned at the bottom which are okay
for basic audio playback but we'll
definitely be muffled when it's on your
lap so the physical form of the
Chromebook resembles an ultrabook or a
small laptop but it's the stuff on the
inside both the hardware and the
software the differentiy the Chromebook
from the rest of the device is now
what's powering the entire system is an
ARM based system on the chip with a
dual-core processor the Exynos 5 which
is found on mobile devices like phones
tablets and PDAs with the speed of 1.7
gigahertz we also have 2 gigabytes of
ddr3 memory which is shared with the GPU
built into the system now this approach
with the ARM based SOC allows excellent
power efficiency with the to sell 30
watt hour battery which equates to about
6 hours of battery life with constant
use at full brightness so not bad for a
$250 device of course the system is
powerful enough for working with several
browser windows as long as you don't
bring video into the equation as 1080p
playback on YouTube is choppy
and quite frankly unwatchable even
bumping it down to 720p brings some
hiccups now killing some time with Angry
Birds we're not impressed with the
performance so don't be expecting
miracles with this machine so then this
brings the question of what is possible
with the Chromebook and that can be
summarized in three words
supported apps the Google Chrome OS does
not support executables so installing
anything outside of the Google store is
off the limits even some apps in the
store are not supported by the OS so
leave light gaming for either your
smartphone or your tablet now the OS
itself is quite simple on the bottom
left are all your icons and on the right
as your clock battery life and the rest
of the settings now you cannot actually
populate the desktop with icons but
windows snapping works very well and
also windows cycling button comes in
really handy for multitasking wakeup
times and shutdown times are really fast
which spoils the mood once you're back
to say Windows 8 for example now given
this is mainly a cloud oriented device
you will constantly need internet
connection to access your cloud files of
course offline work is possible and it
will synchronize all your files wants
your backup online now the model we have
here is a Wi-Fi only by 3G options are
also available so this leaves very
specific purpose for the Chromebook and
that's portable text / browser work
while you're on the go
checking your email and browsing the web
on your phone might not cut it
so the Chromebook fills the gap between
portable convenience and the need for
proper browser experience of course at
$350 that might sound crazy but the
Chromebook offers compact and light 4
factor decent keyboard and great
trackpad variety of connectivity
including SD card slot and the USB 3
port for expandable storage and an
excellent battery life
however the ARM based SOC isn't really
all that powerful and clogs up during
1080p video playback and even during
Angry Birds and given the Chromebook is
a cloud-based device Internet
connectivity is a must so unless you
have a 3g version of the Chromebook
you'll be limited to offline work on
your Google Docs so the Chromebook
provides a very specific experience that
is concentrated around doing text heavy
work while you're on the go just
remember it's not meant to replace an
ultrabook or a tablet but instead
compliment you Wallet for on-the-go
cloud work so thanks guys for watching

Chromebook the series 3 leave your
