just doing a little day recap i'm here
with Sam we were recently at the aim DS
experience zone where dr. Lisa soo and
these number two was was announcing
basically aim DS progression with the AP
use and basically where they're heading
so Sam what is in these direction and
what can tell us about aim these
appearance here at computex well it was
only last year that Rory breather CEO
said the AMD could not beat intel on the
speed game so Intel's chips for x86 were
there and these were there so and yet
the diversifying and from that came the
APU this apu is a great ship I mean it
combines a GPU and also a cpu and its
really creative it's very unique nvidia
in cell they can't quite match it and so
this device this chip rather can be
scaled to both you know a low-power
low-end device like a smartphone or a
tablet and also a high-power device like
a top-tier damien pc or next-gen game
console and so from this apu movements
am these chips are now in the to
next-gen game consoles the xbox one and
ps4 so even though at one time AMD
looked like it was you know it was close
to bankruptcy it was almost finished
great things happens they diversified
their real comeback kids and i was very
impressed by what they annales time what
they're offering today at computex and
sam spoke with the math scanners today
the vp of AMD and graphics and this is
what he had to say so something that you
guys highlighted in your keynote was the
fact that AMD is now powering these
next-gen consoles the xbox one and ps4
how will this change AMD's role in the
next four or five years and what
advantages does the company have
being the graphics being the power
behind these next-gen consoles so first
of all work we're obviously really
excited working with is only
microstructure yeah that's cool you know
the the console success we're using a
really leverage point for success in on
the market yeah so how do we you know
how do we look at it we look at games
will be developed on as new pops come up
games be developed on a console first
this games reported sure and so if you
go back whenever games are developed on
your hardware yeah when you know when
those poor over there going one great on
our heart and so we hope that they it's
a better experience on the pc on any
harder because of this development and
that's key he saw this when when we were
first to market with directx 11 yeah all
the first directx 11 games were
developed on our hardware and weary had
a huge advantage especially at the
beginning sure in directx 11 games and
so that that hardware link is really
important definitely yeah given the fact
that both these consoles are actually
six powers do you feel that a pc games
will be more developed right better
looking because most games are developed
for consoles first and go to pc
afterwards yeah i think it's a good
thing for development in general i think
it's a for developers i think it makes
it more efficient yep because the base
architecture is similar and so that's
that's
that's very good for them on development
costs speed of hoarding and that sort of
thing is important okay and so I think
that that that's an advantage and then
therefore they can spend you know more
time and making a PC and that's her
thing for sure now going towards that
the pc sector right some one your
primary focus is for your upcoming
graphics architectures well our focus is
game right and so we you know I talked
to the keynote about why is the gaming
market important it's important because
gaming drives our drives are hardly more
than anything else right so both from a
performance point of view it's the games
that really push our hardware and from
the type of features we bring to market
so our architecture is going forward are
are going to focus on really you know
improving that improving that gaming
experience okay so that's its key for us
and
no how do you believe that the gaming
involve initiative gives you a leg up
over the competition well I think
there's a couple things one is is a
focus and you know over the past a year
and a half two years we've really really
focused on this as being important to us
as we develop this you know fighting
strategy yeah we have invested in
developer relations engineers and so we
we have what I believe is in the best
set of Engineers that can work with
developers sure that's important the
other thing is that we want to bring
value add to the developers and a great
example of that is tressfx is to the
developers of Tomb Raider you know we
brought a technology and we work with
them and they said hey this is cool
let's work together and let's get this
in the green and let's make the game
look better where it does yeah pops hair
looks awesome absolutely and so working
working closely with them you know
really as it as a team and and bringing
value add I think that's the secret of
her successor looking at trust FX who
else has committed to using tressfx and
their titles well one of the things I
talked today about was was the Ruby down
yes and Ruby demo is part of that is
that it's being
crying two three and so as you know with
game engines they are leveraged into
more games and so getting it into a gang
and just really important exactly
leather to the future titles sure yeah
so we're going back to desktop gaming um
last year you announced the end of your
monthly driver refreshes what were the
thoughts behind that how is this I
helped you cope with more frequent game
releases well I mean our drivers are you
know catalyst drivers been very
successful for us we you know we're
finding that you know we should more
release drivers sort of as needed as
opposed to oka on a monthly basis and so
you know we continue to do updates with
performance improvements with features
improvements that that's sort of paying
like on a more on an as-needed basis
than in the past but you still we have
very frequent to look II nuts did you
just market then how this AMD plan to
distinguish themselves from the
competition from Nvidia sure and so how
are we going to see yourself what is the
focus on getting a weave sure I mean
that's the main thing right we think
that that our unified gaming strategy is
something that the competition can't
match and we leave by working closely
with game developers bringing a radeon
gaming solution leveraging our console
wins so that we lead in the console
decline and the cloud that we're going
to distinguish ourselves i think we're
doing so why can't nvidia match this
plan you guys have out because they
don't have
the opportunities in the console what we
have right um ever an article a while
ago that claims now operative word
claims that some nvidia does not want
consoles because the margins are too low
for their liking so I see I mean I can't
okay fairly leave we love for business
yeah i think you know basis they don't
want the console to dispatch the gaming
business we we care about gamers we want
jaymers we want that business yeah so we
just I guess have a different focus okay
on the tie things up um broadly what is
AMD's biggest defining challenge right
now you know I think the challenge
always is you know executing on your
planet sure right and I talk today about
from a graphics point of view and you
know that's why I'm really focused on is
we had our unified gave me strategy and
I talked about how are executing now we
got to continue to do that yeah it's not
going to get any easier we have we have
a tough competitor just so you know
we're gonna got to continue to to
continue to fight and continue to
execute going for okay I mean it wasn't
too long ago that people were saying
that AMD was done they were close to
bankruptcy I mean what do you say to
those those haters from the equity side
of things I well I I never believed that
I think should we have and you know we
have a great IP in this company okay I'm
from a GPU from an EPA point of view I
think we have a great leadership team
and I think we have a great day
continue to lose those haters room okay
great well thanks so much okay nice time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
