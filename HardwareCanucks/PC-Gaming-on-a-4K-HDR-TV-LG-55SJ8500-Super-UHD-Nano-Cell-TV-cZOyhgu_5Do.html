over the past few months I've been
thinking about building a really
powerful gaming PC for my living room I
can pretty much handle everything from
streaming Netflix to high resolution
gaming unfortunately my current TV setup
wasn't up to the task it's slow response
times and poor contrast when viewed on
and even the slightest of angles was
acceptable for console gamers but I
needed something that was a bit closer
to what a pc monitor could achieve
that's why when LG approached us to look
at their new nano cell 4k HDR TV I had
to jump at the chance this TV will
actually lead us into a new compact htpc
build in the next few weeks and a few
other living room upgrades - now before
I get too far into this video I want to
mention a bit of a promotion and contest
that LG is doing around this TV it's
called the LG nano cell super match and
it involves a soccer match between two
pretty famous soccer players named a
Steven Gerrard and Adam Lallana I'll
leave a link to that match video below
or you can search for LG Nano so super
match on Google one thing I liked about
this new nano cell TV right away is how
it looked there is an edge-to-edge
glass panel with very small bezels a
slimline footprint and while this isn't
as thin as something like an OLED TV
it's still amazing to see what LG has
managed to fit into such a small space
port selection is pretty good too we
have 4 HDMI 2.0 ports that are hdcp 2.2
compliant 3 USB ports RF in composite in
Ethernet optical and an rs-232 C mini
jack I just wish all of these ports were
rotated 90 degrees so I could have used
a flush mount vasive wall bracket okay
so now back to this TV and why I was
pretty excited to get it set up and
gaming basically it offers great
performance and exactly the areas where
I found my old TV lacking the panel LG
used is fast compared to many other TVs
that I've used in the last year or so
while it can compete with V response
times on the best gaming monitors it's
still much better than many competitors
also unlike some other TVs that add
color sheets in between the LED panels
and the backlit like quantum dot for
instance nano cell technology filters
distant colors with much greater
precision resulting in a
wider color gamut then msl technology
also helps improve viewing angles LG
ended up sending me their 55 inch SJ
8500 which typically retails for around
two thousand dollars USD but it can be
typically found on sale for much less
considering this TV also has a 4k
resolution and the capability to process
HDR content I think that's a pretty good
price all things considered as you might
expect I need a pretty massive amount of
horsepower to push gaming content to a
4k TV that high resolution makes images
look extremely sharp but it also
requires a very powerful graphics card
too and I also needed one that would
support HDR output in the future as well
while that's something I'll take into
account when eventually building the new
htpc for now I decided to use the AMD
thread Ripper system I finished building
about two weeks ago you can find a link
to that build video right about in
person this TV just looks stunning
regardless of the content I threw at it
I certainly felt a difference the moment
I switched from my old LCD TV the colors
very vibrant and very true to life
it took my content consuming experience
to another level a good way to test this
was to watch a few of my own 4k YouTube
videos and see how the panel handled am
i greeting and it did a really good job
displaying the image with excellent
white balance and perfect contrast
remember this is an LED TV and not OLED
so don't expect the deepest blacks and
vibrancy I was barely able to spot the
backlighting on this display but it's
certainly not pitch black and there are
very subtle shifts in panel uniformity
in some areas of the screen like I
mentioned earlier one of the main
selling features of this new nano salt
TVs is the ability to view content at an
angle without experiencing distortion or
contrast shift conventional LED TVs have
suffered from this drawback thankfully
LG steps and once again offering
consumers accurate colors in contrast no
matter what angle you're viewing yet so
if you have siblings or kids who are
fighting to get that optimal smart to
watch a soccer game a movie or play
games well nan-oh sell TVs are here to
rescue and speaking of gaming let's get
to that since it's one of the primary
reasons I was so excited about according
to this TV obviously when you move from
a gaming monitor to a UHD TV you will be
maximizing size but sacrificing
response times plus while the 55 SJ 8500
does advertise a hundred twenty Hertz
refresh rate it actually has a sixty
Hertz panel but uses interpolation to
achieve the illusion of smoother moving
images basically its hdmi 2.0 eight
input can handle that bandwidth
necessary for 4k HDR and 120 Hertz you
need to wait for an HTML 2.1 supporting
TV for that gamers will want to turn
this interpolation off since it adds
processing overhead on the TV side and
therefore increases input lag
luckily LG has added a few options to
their nano self 4k TV that works towards
improving the gaming experience first
and foremost there is a game mode which
essentially turns off much of the TVs a
background image processing and that
lowers input lag by quite a bit any
other fine-grained image adjustments can
still be made on your window system
though so you can still achieve a
spectacular picture but do all these
features make the LG an NSL TV good for
gaming titles like Ghost Recon with its
sweeping environments and massive
open-ended gameplay looked spectacular I
spent a good amount of time gaming on
this TV and there were definitely a few
standout features that will benefit
gamers for example of those wide viewing
angles that I kept talking about meant I
could actually lie down on my couch
without any fear of missing parts of a
gaming action my TV is actually in a
pretty bright room which made gaming on
my previous setup almost impossible
during the day there was just too much
glare off the screen even with a panel
at maximum brightness but LG has applied
a light anti-glare coating to the screen
that works well in cutting down
reflections without cutting down on
clarity of color reproduction I know
that comparing it to an older TV may
sound odd but I'm in the same situation
as many of you could be in I was looking
to upgrade an older LCD set and the LG
nano cell TV seemed to fit in quite well
but the question everyone is really
wondering is how a TV feels after
playing games on a monitor for most of
my adult life for first-person shooters
I could immediately tell that the Nano
so TV had a higher amount of input lag
than most PC monitors have used in the
last few years it didn't destroy my
performance completely but it took a
while to get accustomed to
all right now that gaming is done let's
seriously discuss some other things that
I wanted to talk about this new LG nano
cell TV other than a PC my set up
primarily involves around using the
Nvidia shield Android TV as it has the
best pad collection in my opinion and
that partly due to how well its
ecosystem has matured over the past few
years the unit can natively output 4k at
60 Hertz and it recently got an update
with support for HDR which ended up
being a perfect companion for LG's
active HDR with Dolby vision support
it's compatible with generic HDR 10 and
hybrid log gamma formats
I used Amazon Prime to watch one of my
favorite TV shows that Grand Tour which
was available to stream in 4k HDR and
the best part is that the TV
automatically picked up the metadata
that came with the app or the TV showed
to be more precise and it switched the
picture profile mode to HDR instantly
watching the Grand Tour with that
remarkable b-roll was amazing couple
that with the edge to edge display and
the immersion is just unreal there is a
lot of 4k HDR content on YouTube that
you could take advantage of but the
collection is limited
although Netflix has adapted the HDR
standard so that's a positive throughout
my experience it was hard to pick out
any glaring false
particularly since HDR signals are
processed directly by the TV and don't
require user input for picture
modifications LG has a built-in 4k
upscaling engine that essentially up
skills non UHD content to 4k in order to
give users a sharper image I did test
out a few 1080p blu-ray movies from my
collection and it looked great without
any artifacts honestly I'm not really
sure if there's a better way to test out
this feature unless if I have two
identical 4k TVs with one playing bag
1080p content upscale to 4k and the
other playing the same content in native
4k resolution it's important to
understand that if you're in the market
for a 4k TV make sure you have access to
4k content broadcasting standards at
least here in Canada haven't quite
caught up to that resolution so
alternatives like Netflix Amazon and a
few other streaming services are your
best bet but that ax cost the Nano Cell
TV comes with webelo s 3.5 which
simplifies the entertainment experience
it comes pre-loaded with all the major
streaming apps like Netflix Amazon TV
and even YouTube you can certainly
expand that
election via the LG app store but
unfortunately it is very limited when
compared to Android TV right now
there's even a built-in web browser if
you want to browse things and the
included magic amount is both
economically and functionally perfect
for the TV you can simply point at the
TV and a cursor pops up which helps ease
the browsing experience the built-in
scroll wheel within the remote is a
great addition as it helps with browsing
the web YouTube Netflix and a few more
streaming apps do note that this is only
vertical and not horizontal well that
concludes his overview video on this new
LG 4k HDR TV featuring their new nano
cell technology this video is definitely
the start for a series of other videos
that I have a plan for this living room
space so stay tuned for that but I'd
like to hear your thoughts about this TV
and more specifically would you like me
to check something else out or probably
suggest a few upgrades that could
complement my 4k living room experience
let me know the comments down below I'd
like to take this time to thank LG for
sending me out here a new TV perfect
time but yeah I mean we're with
hurricane X thank you so much watching
