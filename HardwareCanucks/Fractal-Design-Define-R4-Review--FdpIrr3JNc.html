of choices when it comes to simple and
elegant cases at an affordable price the
latest addition to the defined series is
the r4 it brings plenty of useful
upgrades from the very popular r3 case
and then just over $100 you get plenty
of options so let's take a look the
front panel with its reflective aluminum
a looking surface should automatically
ring frightful design they have been
very consistent throughout the entire
lineup and rightfully so it is elegant
clean and also functional it opens just
plus 90 degrees which could be a
problematic but unfortunately it cannot
be switched to be open from the other
side which is a bummer the doors card a
noise dampening foam and so are the side
panels to really silent your rig and
next up we have two optical Bay covers
that are easily removable and below that
another panel that covers the front
intake fans now notice the panel just
pulls down which makes accessing the fan
bracket a lot easier the bracket itself
removes with ease just by pulling down
on this one clip and this is a very
smart way of integrating front intake
which can easily be reassembled for
cleaning and replacement of the fans
then the bracket does have a built in
dust filter and supports both 120 and
140 member fans
the bigger fan is held in with clips but
you will have to mount the smaller one
with the screws the sides of the front
panel have plenty of venting however
there is plenty of resistance so you
should not be expecting optimal air flow
from the front and also an extra
addition would be this three speed fan
controller would support for three fans
so let's check out the connections at
the top we get our power and reset
buttons audio jacks and four USB ports
and continue with the top we have two
fan mounts for both 120 and 140 millner
fans and they come with noise dampening
panels pre-installed now for any users a
single exhaust fan at the back is long
in the cutted so utilizing the top
exhaust slots will drastically improve
your cooling potential however we still
don't have this hybrid system between
silence and airflow so you will have to
choose between either of the options and
the case comes with pre-installed rubber
feet which is always nice you will avoid
scratching the floor and prevent any
unnecessary operational noise and
looking at the back we get our usual
scene with the exhaust fan io area 7 PCI
slots and one additional vertical one
for mounting accessories and a dual dust
filter for the bottom so what does the
inside look like and what let's find out
and first one list are the two optical
drives and we do miss the two low system
next is the module hard drive cage that
can be either removed or rotated simply
with the two thumb screws it is a very
simple solution and that is functional
and hassle-free the drive brackets are
also not Tula's but nevertheless work
very well incorporating rubber grommets
and 2.5 inch drive support as well and a
single 140 millimeter exhaust fan is
included so if you are planning on
keeping your system cool adding those
top pants would not hurt and another fan
mount is available at the bottom
supporting both 120 and 140 millimeter
mounts clearance of which would depend
on the length of your power supply so
anything up to 170 millimeters will
still have clearance for both mounts
and coming around to the back we have a
decently large CPU car oh that could be
larger and also plenty of cable tie
notches to clean up all your cables
during assembly also available are these
mounting cutouts for two SSDs now it's
quite common to mount yours as these
right behind the motherboard tray but
perhaps using velcro would be a little
bit easier simply because removing one
drive would require you to remove the
entire motherboard and that could
introduce a lot of hassle into your
build now there's a lot of room to work
with when it comes to your graphics
cards even with the cage installed our
11 1/2 inch card fit in just fine and
sort of that is the maximum clearance
you can get without removing the hard
drive cage
and so everything in place that defined
our four handles very well as a silent
slash enthusiast enclosure it is user
friendly during assembly and cleans up
very well both on the inside and at the
back the module cage system is pretty
clever and is absolutely hassle-free
with the two thumb screws support for
long GPUs is sort of a must for a case
of this caliber and most of you should
not have any clearance issues even with
the hard drive cage installed now the
silent component does add value for
those who are looking for a silent build
however as was the case with Excel and
XLR 2 there is no hybrid between airflow
or silence it would be awesome to see
some sort of system for the top exhaust
that could integrate a silent solution
without compromising air flow but the
new r4 is one top notch case and we're
giving in the hardware connects damn
good award so thanks guys for watching
hope you enjoyed the review and we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
