back to another Haruka Knox review the
Rose will are more evil gaming case is
actually quite interesting as it's
specifically designed for e ATX
motherboards the form factor is rather
unusual with longer body to accommodate
for why their motherboards but it is
tall just like a mid tower so priced at
$120 this might be an alternative pick
if you don't want to opt out for a full
Tower the front mesh panel is something
I really like it allows for good airflow
reveals the red LED fans that are
included plus it blends in with the rest
of this industrial design we do have
three optical base with dust proof
covers and taking off the front panel
there are two included fans that are
attached to the frame with a built-in
dust filter and below the panel is very
discreet and awkwardly placed fan LED
button as the rest of the connections
are the front with four USB ports your
audio jacks and your PR buttons the
sides and top panels both have a
protruding mesh with rubber grommets for
all the fans and I do like how Roseville
incorporates excellent air flow out of
the box with a 200 millimeter side fan
and dual 120mm fans for the top so a
total of six fans is included with the
our more evil case take a look at the
back we have seven PCI expansion slots
and a removable power supply dust filter
so the internals are interesting because
of this added length for e-atx support
there is 13 and a half inches of
clearance until the fan bracket leaving
a compatibility for long graphics cards
without any compromises the drive cage
includes seven slots with metal drive
caddies these are not tools but they are
a lot sturdier than a lot of the plastic
ones we see today now the fan bracket
may come in very useful not just for
additional airflow but once removed you
can easily mount a 240 million radiator
and portion pool and still have a little
over 11 inches of clearance so I could
see this being an interesting case for
multi radio system and while it is tight
the rad fits in just fine
with our GTX 590 now I am also happy to
see Armour Evo is well equipped for
cable management with multiple wrap
grommets for both standard ATX and ATX
motherboards lots of room at the rear
and scattered cable tie mounts all
around and you will see later on how
well the build cleans up now one of the
most common things we've seen cases is
the lack of proper spacing between the
top fans and the motherboard and we only
get one inch of space between the fans
and the memory modules on our
motherboard so giving us more space
would be nice to avoid compatibility
issues with CPU towers and of course a
top mounted radiators and continue when
the assembly check out how clean the
system looks this is due to proper
grommet location and flipping the case
around you can see no loose cables and
super simple job for wiring all your
components and so to wrap it up the
armor Evo is a well-built mid tower with
the purposely longer frame to allow
compatibility with ATX motherboards
without merging it into a full Tower it
certainly comes equipped with excellent
airflow out of the box with six fans and
promising water cooling support with
excellent cable management however with
such large site intake potential the
mesh is not filtered which will cause
massive amounts of dust and a slightly
taller body it would be nice to
accommodate four top mounted radiators
and CPU towers and because the side
panels are much longer than your
standard it was a bit more difficult
making sure all the hinges were in place
and also at the $120 they are sure
making it difficult for the armored evil
to be competitive considering the latest
10th of 530 from in 6d is similarly
priced but off far superior
functionality will define excel r2 from
fractal design both of which have EA TX
support now also while our model arrived
just fine without any dents or broken
fans Rosewill quality control for this
particular model has received numerous
complaints so we hope they're listening
and improving as well so thanks guys for
watching and we'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
