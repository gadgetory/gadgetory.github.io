hardware connection we're still here at
CES 2019 might just pass by me if you
didn't notice probably you might not
notice but anyways we're still here the
show get trying to bring you the best
content or more content from the show
floor but I want to talk about Corsairs
new slipstream wireless technology and
what and why it's super important for
the future of gaming peripherals like
keyboards mice and headsets so let's get
started but first huge shout out to our
sponsors Corsair fantex Razer MSI and
Thermaltake because without them this
trip really would not have been possible
now a few days ago we posted a video
about Corsairs new mice for 2019 and if
you're interested in checking that out
link is right over here
but essentially we did talk a little bit
about slipstream technology but we
didn't really get too much into it
and the reason is because we didn't have
any information about the new tech but
after having a one-on-one session with
Corsair we have a lot actually there's a
lot to be excited about this new
technology and the fact that it's
actually shipping on a $50 Mouse like
the harpoon Wireless is pretty amazing
now the intent for slipstream is to
provide improvements for how wireless
communications are handled with it
response time should decrease ranges
will get boosted and there should be
less issues in areas with high wireless
traffic basically what slipstream does
is use the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum but
with a proprietary protocol that's been
developed by Corsair that port O'Call
allows supporting peripherals to handle
twice the number of wireless packets
within a millisecond
there's also intelligent frequency shift
which actively scans the wireless
spectrum to find the best transmit
frequency so that's a lot of technical
stuff to digest but what does that
really mean for gamers well on a mouse
like the harpoon wireless you're gonna
get some more millisecond response times
but supposedly are also expected to get
about up to 60 hours of battery life
with just a single charge and you could
also use this male 60 feet away from the
actual receiver and I'm kind of starting
to wonder why would you even use that
feature
I mean for HD PC setups sure but 60 feet
away is just like I just I mean it's
cool tech but I want to know your
thoughts on that particular you know
feature in the comments down below
basically the harpoon Wireless is the
first in the lineup
coming peripherals that will have
slipstream technology but Corsair said
that the biggest potential for it will
be within wireless headsets the problem
with current wireless headsets is that
they do typically lack range and in some
cases they do encounter interferences
and the microphone quality is just not
that great and we've encountered a more
experienced them with previous wireless
headset reviews now slipstream basically
eliminates all of these issues by
basically providing a high bandwidth
connection that allows for downstream a
high definition a game audio as well as
lossless upstream voice communication at
the same time that's just not possible
with today's current wireless standards
another interesting thing that Corsair
mentioned is range on these headsets
could be around a hundred feet which is
pretty amazing and the last thing that I
want to mention about slipstream is that
up to four devices can run off a single
USB controller which is actually pretty
awesome because concerning laptops are
slowly starting to get rid of you know
full-size type-a ports and just getting
you know a few ports this is a great way
to you know be able to connect your
wireless headset your peripheral so you
are the peripherals and just control
them via a single USB receiver the other
thing that I wanted to discuss quickly
is Corsairs capital X LEDs because they
could be a game-changer in many ways
traditional LEDs are mounted to a large
surface and then there are separate
controllers that require space corsair
is now mounting their LEDs directly to
the PCB which increases density
brightness and overall efficiency this
is a quick example showing the space
necessary to mount 132 capital X RGB
LEDs versus a traditional RGB strip it's
just really amazing to see this kind of
technology miniaturizing in terms of
what it means for products well there's
a couple ways to look at capella X
because of its lower power consumption
peripherals with the technology will
provide much better battery life heat
output will also be lower so
incorporating them into things like
memory and motherboards will come with
less trade-offs as well
coarser was also showing off their first
cap Alex product with the Dominator
platinum RGB it uses 12 individually
addressable LEDs per module for some
crazy-looking lighting effects and
remember this is just where corsair
starting so it'll be interesting to see
where they go from here so there you
guys have it it's really awesome to see
a company like Corsair taking things
differently with you know something like
slipstream technology and of course you
know a technology like complex
with their RGB LED setup but I'm looking
forward to what they can come upon in
the next or their upcoming products for
2019 and of course the years to come but
yeah let me know what you guys think
about the two new things that we
discussed in this video in the comments
down below
I'm Evo retiree canucks thank you so
much for watching stay tuned for more
CES 2019 coverage Dmitri is right over
there chilling with his air pods and his
iPhone 10s Michael is he's just chilling
with his Lenovo notebook and we'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
