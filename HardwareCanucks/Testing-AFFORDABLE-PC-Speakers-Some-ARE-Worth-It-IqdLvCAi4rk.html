hard-working axe and as you can see I
have speakers in front of me and believe
it or not
speakers are a very crucial element when
it comes to a desktop setup because
sometimes if you want to enjoy the
moment when you're listening to music or
something like that it's always good to
you know switch things up a little bit
and switch away from using our
headphones to something like a speaker
setup because it fills a sound it fills
the room and it really does create a
pretty amazing impact when it comes to
listening to music or even gaming in
some cases now I do want to acknowledge
that we've done a lot of speaker reviews
in the past and typically most of them
are on the expensive side so we wanted
to do with something a little bit
different this time and check out some
speakers that are you know within a
different price range so you know
ranging from twenty thirty and forty
dollar price points and we hand-picked
so many best sellers on Amazon and of
course these things aren't stocks so
that's pretty amazing and we wanted to
check out and see how they sound
respective to their price point now I'm
also aware that it's back-to-school
season and for students who are planning
out their dorm room setup and if you're
looking for something a little bit on
the compact side but also you don't want
to break the bank well stick around
because you are gonna be surprised with
some with what some of these speakers
are gonna be offering for their price so
let's get at the details right after
message from our sponsor hello I'm
looking for some fans well are you
married yeah I have a ring what is your
favorite number I would say 3 do I have
the perfect fan for you this is the new
thermal tech ring trio 12 fans with good
static pressure for radiators it is a
beautiful frame with double side and
center ring illumination with soft and
super brights bill with razor chrome and
compatibility control it through your
smart phone the RGB plus software on the
PC or Amazon Alexa well I'm gonna take
these home perhaps you should to check
them out in the description below
alright so let's start with the cheapest
pair the Logitech Z 200 priced at $20
it's a very basic 2.0 stereo speaker
system the design is fairly simple
nothing too much on the aggressive side
and it should complement both an office
or a home desktop setup the build
quality is fair for the price it's
entirely constructed out of plastic
materials so I would handle it with
caution
each speaker up is 5 watts of RMS be
power resulting in a total of a 10 watt
delivery there are two active and to
passive drivers to enrich the stereo
experience but I'll get into the sound
quality a bit later on
and as for controls there is an easily
accessible power / volume adjust dial a
headphone output and an auxilary input
all on the right channel speaker and to
run things off the z2 hundred features
an adjustable base knob on the right
side speaker to add or eliminate the low
range now what I really appreciate about
the Zi 200 is the slightly angled
drivers for better projection because
there are some speakers out there that
are just straight-up flat so you the
sound actually face your chest rather
than your ears so having them slightly
angled is of course a better way to
experience sound because of the adeney
of the day you can have the best
possible speaker system but if you don't
have them oriented that well then the
whole experience just wouldn't add up so
that's something that I want to point
out and lastly if our connectivity
logitech has included a power adapter to
power these speakers and it also comes
with a 3.5 million red connector so you
can connect it to your cell phone or
your laptop nonetheless as long as you
have a device with a 3.5 member
headphone jack which I'm sure most
modern smartphones don't do you'll be
fine next up we have the creative a 250
s priced at $30 this is a 2.1 desktop
speaker system meaning it comes with a
dedicated subwoofer to enhance the bass
response I was really surprised by the
compact form factor of both these
satellite speakers and the subwoofer by
itself which by the way is downwards
firing so if you're living in an
apartment I'd go easy on that volume I
think this would be an excellent option
for compacts debt service because the
two satellite speakers are super tiny
and cute and here's a shot of it next to
my pixel - and you can clearly see what
I'm talking about the build quality is
about the same as the Logitech Z 200
mostly plastic body with a glossy finish
at the front which I'm not a fan of but
that's okay and as for controls there is
a power / volume dial on the right
channel speaker but unfortunately you
don't have a headphone pass report or an
axillary input with the creative a 250 s
which I thought was a little bit
disappointing because the Logitech
system comes with that but this doesn't
so that's something to keep note of but
nonetheless it's a pretty compact setup
for 30
lastly we have these cyber acoustics CA
306 it's priced at $40 and this is yet
another 2.1 speaker system the setup is
slightly bigger when compared to the a
250 s but it should still be sufficient
for compact spaces the build quality is
no different when compared to the other
two speakers the front side of the
satellite speakers feature a glossy
finish which can again scratch easily
and attract finger prints the included
sub is front firing and for connectivity
there is a single 3.5 mile-an-hour jack
which connects both left and right
speakers you also get this control hub
that conveniently lets you adjust the
volume and other things looking at it
you can certainly tell it's not built
really well so I'd go easy on it but it
gets the job done ask for controls the
top dial functions as your volume adjust
then you have a headphone pass report on
with an aux input and a base adjust dial
which is something that the a250 slag
and I think this control hub is a pretty
cool feature because if you want adjust
the volume if you want to play around
controls you don't have to fill around
with the satellite speakers because with
some of these guys you'd have to adjust
the volume by reaching towards the
speaker which might be a little bit on
the inconvience side so this is
certainly a nice touch and of course
that's something that you would expect
for $40 so having looked at all three
speakers how do they actually sound
respected to their price point let's
start with the z2 hundreds they sound
very basic for a 2.0 speaker system you
can definitely pick up the vocals but
when you're listening to say EDM s or
music that emphasized a lot on the lower
ends you can certainly tell that there
is a lack of a dedicated subwoofer
because it's not that powerful and
pronounced expects some sort of
distortion at certain frequencies so
keep your expectations pretty low with
this a speaker system because again it
is very basic so for $20 it gets the job
done
switching over to the creative a 250 s
and Wow
I was literally blown away by the sound
coming out of a $30 two point one system
that dedicated subwoofer just completes
the listening experience the lower ends
are powerful but that being said the
higher ends are clear and balanced I was
really surprised by the way how the tiny
tweeters handled the vocals regardless
of the type of genre that you're
listening to these speakers won't
disappoint
is that extra $10 difference between the
Z 200 and the a 250 s is just so massive
it's like a day and night difference you
know upgrading to something like this
because you know the tweeters are
amazing they're super compact and I was
very surprised at how they sounded for
the cost and this subwoofer man like wow
it's it's really amazing when we onto
the cyber acoustic system there is great
detail in the higher ends vocals are
clear and pronounced the bass response
is powerful but surprisingly it wasn't
as good as the creative a2 50s or they
weren't as clear if that makes any sense
now when you play around with the bass
style that's included in the convenient
hub it actually just increases the bass
volume rather than actually giving you a
much more of a tighter response in the
lower ends so again it does doesn't feel
as pronounced or as tight compared to
the a2 50s there was also little
emphasis on the Mint's meaning I wasn't
able to pick up certain elements from a
soundtrack that I typically listen to
which I was completely able to with the
creative speaker system so overall you
know it sounds great
but I think it lacks the whole cohesive
aspect when it comes to putting together
the higher ends the Mint's and the low
range because at the end of the day you
want a speaker system that sort of
completes that experience having
switched from the 1850s the cyber
acoustics I just didn't feel like it was
blown away for the next for $10 now just
for fun sakes I revisited my closet and
I pulled out the razor Norma chroma
desktop speaker systems because those
are priced at $150 the chroma version to
be exact and I just you know switched
back listening to the creatives and the
razor system and one thing that I can
tell you right now is the razor speaker
systems you know they're a little bit on
me flatter response because you can
definitely pick up the lower ends and
the highs in the mid sarve area clear
and pronounced but you know you can
definitely tell that there is a lack of
a dedicated subwoofer if there was this
dedicated subwoofer with that setup it
would obviously be a lot better compared
to the creative speakers right over here
but I think you know for $30 this system
just gives you an all-around package
because I think personally it sounds
this extra subwoofer just adds that
extra
oh when it comes to gaming because when
you're firing gunshots or when you're
moving on through the gameplay when
you're you know chatting with your
friends or something like that it really
does make a big makes a world of a
difference with a decade a subwoofer now
one of the downsides when it comes to
adding a subwoofer to your setup is
cable management because believe it or
not these two systems have the most
amount of cables compared to the Z 200
speakers because again this is a basic
2.0 setup so cable management shouldn't
be a huge concern when you're working
around with these speakers are compared
to you know the creatives and the cyber
acoustics so that's something to keep
note of now I'm not gonna be doing a
sound test comparing these two speakers
because for one they this is again it's
not a comparison video because these
speakers are priced differently but
secondly you know you may be listening
to a pair of headphones that are not
optimized and of course I have this
microphone won't that won't be able to
give you guys a real representation as
to how the speaker systems sounds so if
you do get a chance if you find them in
a local retail store say you know at
Best Buy or something like that
highly get a chance I would recommend
just you know listening to them checking
out for yourselves and if you're
satisfying then you can go ahead and
pull the trigger
now we do want to conclude this video by
saying then this is not the end-all
be-all of desktop speaker systems
because there are a lot of them in the
market in fact I haven't even this is
just me scratching the surface because I
haven't explored a lot of the other
cheaper options so if you do have
certain alternatives that fits this
criteria definitely leave a comment down
below and will perhaps revisit you know
those systems in the future but for now
I have to admit this $30 creative 1850's
have surprised me by a huge margin
because if I were looking for a set of
budget speaker systems I would
wholeheartedly spend $30 and pick this
up rather than spending $20 or even $40
for the cyber acoustics because these
are compact they sound phenomenal
actually a lot better than cyber
acoustics and so yeah this is just this
is just an instant buy so I hope you
take away something from this video let
me know what you guys think about this
speaker roundup I'd say I mean what do
you guys think about it
are you actually interested in picking
up the creative of a 250s and if you are
an existing user or if you own
these guys how was your experience been
like and of course don't forget to leave
comments on alternatives as well i'm me
