down we decided to drop by team group to
see what they're showing off and
interesting enough we were actually
really surprised and they always tend to
surprise everyone with their interesting
products I mean if you remember back
vandeyn announced the Asus tough memory
that looked absolutely gorgeous in fact
we included that in one of our tough
series bills if you're interested in
checking that out link will be right
over here but before we get into their
you know new products and stuff I want
to give a huge shout out to Phanteks and
SteelSeries for making Computex 2019
possible all right so let's start with
probably what's going to be the craziest
SSD at Computex and that's the t force
delta max RGB it basically follows the
footsteps of the original delta rgb SSD
we looked at last year but this time
it's being taken to a whole new level so
they've added addressable RGB surround
the perimeter and then used a diffusion
panel to allow the light to spill evenly
across the whole thing and honestly guys
this thing looks amazing
sure if you aren't into the whole RGB
craze this won't be your thing but team
has actually worked with multiple
vendors to implement brightness
adjustments through software like MSI
mystic light and asus or a sync pushing
those LEDs to the sites also means
temperatures are much lower than the
delta remember some people had issues
with that SSD overheating since it's RGB
LEDs increase the in tone temperature in
higher load situations a team group has
also added a thin internal heatsink to
make sure that this never happens again
other than the RGB lighting effects the
Delta Max gets its power through either
USB or a 5 volt connector along with
these standard SATA and power connectors
while teen group couldn't tell us the
price it's available in capacities from
250 gigabytes all the way up to 2
terabytes when it's launched sometime
between July and September continuing
the RGB trend there's the T force
extreme ddr4 16 gigabyte kit with an
addressable RGB heat spreader
this isn't like anything I've seen
before with teams unique dissipation
panel it's seriously cool like the whole
module is glowing in a subtle color
right now the modules aren't all that
bright sands they're working with metal
manufacturers to validate the modules
and their light output but like the SSD
expect the modules to get a lot brighter
but also have the ability to
get down to more subtle output as well
continuing with the RGB trend this is
actually something we've been hoping for
an addressable controller with both 5
volt and 12 volt inputs and upwards
alongside one another while there isn't
a white channel team is providing for 5
volt outputs on the captain RGB
controller box along with 5 different
presets that can be changed with the
press of a button power input is done
via a single SATA connector and expected
to be compatible with every motherboard
out there that supports 12 volt and 5
volt RGB connectors alright enough of
RGB stuff let's talk about water cooling
since teen group has something
interesting in that area as well this is
the cardea M 2 PCI SSD and it
incorporates a liquid chamber inside of
a traditional heatsink but you notice
that I didn't say that this was a water
block well it isn't
since these SSDs are far too small to be
plumbed into a water cooling loop
instead the idea here is to fill the
chamber with the same liquid as your own
loop for color coordination and to do
this you can drop back the protective
cover remove the metal plug and fill it
in with the fluid according to team the
team for scardiest water chamber can
lower temperatures by over 10 degrees
over the naked SSD alone also for those
of you keeping track at home the cardia
will feature read and write speeds of up
to thirty four hundred and three
thousand megabytes per second
respectively now something that I should
mention is that considering that this m
dot two PCI SSD has a liquid chamber
built on top of it I'm not sure how that
heat is going to be dissipated as
efficiently compared to something like
an aluminum heatsink so I guess we'll
just have to test and see how the
temperature variances could be in the
long term so hopefully I'll be able to
get my hands on one of these and give
you as my thoughts on it one other thing
that I need to mention is that team and
the T force group are running a little
contest so in it you can actually get
the chance to win the new car do is D or
1 up to t1 and TDR for memory case I'll
actually leave links to the contest in
the description down below if you're
interested so that about wraps up our
coverage at team group let me know what
you guys think about the cardia SSD as
well as the delta max RGB SSD as well
I'm really excited to you know
test out the temperatures on these new
you know products especially since RGB
is a element or I guess a heat element
for that component so yeah let me know
what you guys think about these products
in the comments down below
I mean bar with hurricane axe thank you
so much for watching make sure to check
out certain relevant content over here
subscribe to our boutique on channel for
the latest tech news and updates and
I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
