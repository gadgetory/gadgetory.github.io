we all do we all did it we did all right
let's go see a suits well while a for a
box at they suits
highly appreciate if you're doing any
photography let's go see what else p.m.
and huge thanks to our sponsors for
making see as possible thermaltake
fantex corsair msi and razor thank you
very much
alright so with everyone covering the
mothership from ROG what really caught
our attention and the issue sweet was
this little notebook the tough gaming FX
505 dy that's a mouthful but it is
another gaming notebook but the best
part is then it's not gonna cost you an
arm and a leg unlike some of the other
flagship models so what are we talking
in terms of specs well for starters it
now features AMD second-generation Rison
533 58 apu with vega 8 graphics a Radeon
rx 560 x discrete GPU support for up to
32 gigabytes of RAM and a 15.6 inch IPS
level display with a refresh rate up to
120 Hertz with Radeon freesync best of
all it just starts at $7.99 that's just
incredible so for comparison the intel
version of this notebook is $200 higher
from a design standpoint this laptop
just looks like any typical rog gaming
notebook with some aggressive design
elements at the top and this fake
brushed aluminum look on the plastic
chassis that I'm sure will turn into a
fingerprint magnet something I noticed
recently is that every flagship no bug
that's been announced lately features a
stealth finish that looks minimalistic
but when it comes to the more budget
oriented notebooks they just tend to add
so much on top of the chassis that just
makes it look unattractive maybe it's
just me but I'd love to know your take
on this the display on this is
well-thought-out and features minimal
bezels and the webcam is placed
appropriately at the top Thank You Asus
you're also getting a full size keyboard
and all the necessary tile I did hope to
see a full size SD card reader but
unfortunately this noble does not come
with one a laptop is also not too heavy
and I think part of that is due to the
plastic chassis being used here so
portability shouldn't be a concern ask
for battery it only features a 48 watt
hour module so I'm not sure how that's
gonna impact matter your life but it
will be interesting to see how powerful
these new rise in AP use on mobile would
be I'm also really curious to test out
how well this notebook would perform
compared to the Intel and NVIDIA
expected competitors and hopefully I'll
be able to get my hands on one later
this year and if you guys are interested
in that let us know in the comments down
below okay guys so with that cool gaming
notebook out of the way it's now time to
switch things up and check out some of
the most unique monitors we saw at the
show let's start off with the Strix XG
438 q which is pretty close to my dream
display personally I don't understand
the use of 4k on smaller 27 inch screens
but this beast uses a 43 inch 4k VA
panel that's HDR 600 compliant
it also has free sync to HDR 120 Hertz
refresh rate a 4 millisecond response
rate and features low framerate
compensation issues is also factory
calibrated each one before they leave
the factory you have to see it to
believe it because what Asus has created
is absolutely stunning and while 43
inches might be a bit large for a
desktop display I think it's perfect
provided you're able to place it a bit
further back on your desk if you're into
productivity the Strix XG 43 8q also
allows you to view up to 2 content
sources at the same time with its unique
picture by picture mode it can even sub
in as a display for your console since
Asus includes 3 HDMI 2.0 inputs and 210
watt speakers as of right now pricing
hasn't been sent but it will be
launching the spring so we'll have more
coverage a bit later this year you might
remember that we covered the Allegiant Y
44 W in some CES content which you can
find out right over here but Asus has
seriously gone a step further this is
the Strix XG 49 VQ which is a super
ultra wide 49 inch 32 by 9 gaming
monitor with a native resolution of 3840
by 1080 with all these new monitors
you'll notice something similar g-sync
is missing in action this ultra wide
white screen once again has free sync
though this time it's at 144 Hertz HDR
is present too but this time only HDR
400 rather than the higher-end specs and
unlike the 43 inch monitor I talked
about before this one can only take up
to three input sources at the same time
alright so now that you've seen that
Rison in Sleeper notebook let's check
out the case which is called the asus
strix Helius so we actually saw semi
prototype a comput
and now we see a more finished product
so they have got rid of a lot of
branding on front window glass which I
highly appreciate because it was just
way over the top now it is RGB it's
tasteful it's like slightly glowy it's
not like right in your face which is
awesome the tempered glass side panel is
no longer branded that are just
completely slightly tinted black as for
the interior the coolest thing about the
front panel is the addition of the ROG
note panel which displays your
temperature I'm not sure if you can
cycle between maybe GPU temperature
actually you can CPU temperature right
now is cool you know it's kind of like
discrete it's almost looks like it's
OLED just shines right through for text
only you cannot see the display that's
for the top panel so it is quiet tall
and the built-in handles are quite
awesome because their fabric and that
we're told super strong so you can carry
the system no problem you can of course
remove them if that's not your thing the
i/o is totally loaded there's a type C
port in there very standard stuff and
that's for the interior so it's a very
roomy type of layout we have a little
cutout in the front for radiator support
the power supply shroud has a nice
tempered glass window to reveal whatever
power supply you're using so definitely
works towards the Thor branding for
their own power supplies the motherboard
tray is nicely condensed there and
beside it we have a cable cover that you
can remove so it's pretty standard but
one additional thing we have this metal
rod that runs beside the motherboard
onto which you can attach little
brackets for anti GPU sag so it will
support the GPU and you can move that
back in three positions in case you're
using a really long graphics card so
that's pretty nice they're thinking
about the enthusiast market and yes
while the case is quite large I know
it's there trying to kind of condense
all the things so they can trickle down
the features into lower tier SKUs but of
course for their first case you got a
start big alright good people so that is
the ROG goodness I'm standing beside the
end to fantex elite with all types of
craziness inside and so let us know what
is the most you know exciting thing for
you that you saw in this video the rise
in laptop the case the monitor stuff and
yeah we'll try to deliver
in terms of reviews later on thanks so
much for watching we'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
