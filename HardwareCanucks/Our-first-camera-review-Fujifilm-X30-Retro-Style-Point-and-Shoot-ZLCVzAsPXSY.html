great technology selection and service
hello everyone this is Dmitry with
hurricane axe and welcome to our first
ever camera review on the channels give
us a like if you want to see more camera
reviews in the future but this is the
fat - this is a Soviet made SLR in the
1950s it still works it's my
grandfather's and the reason why I'm
mentioning this is because this type of
retro design is now coming back in
today's world with of course optical
mechanical and digital differences so on
the review table today we have this this
is a few G film X 30 keeping true to
that form factor that's beautiful
aesthetical retro / vintage design but
is it trying to compensate for something
with its pretty body let's find out
so the x30 runs for $600 and it's
definitely and step out from your
standard point-and-shoot and I feel the
build quality or the manual controls and
all the features are all worth the price
and to quickly get the specs out of the
way the sensor here is 2/3 of an inch
Extron CMOS - it's likely smaller than
what is found on competing cameras it
captures 12 megapixels jpg and broad
1080p movie recording at 60 frames
optical zoom or 4x ISO range of up to
12,000 800 there's a 256 zoom metering
for exposure control built-in image
stabilization maximum shutter speed or
one for thousands of a second there's
full manual control for bracketing white
balance focus and even more an
electronic viewfinder a 3-inch display
at the back wireless communications and
it survives for about 500 shots per
charge coming back to the form the
camera is gorgeous you can see the metal
frame combined with this rubberized mid
section brings an awesome sense for
handling and this is no doubt will be
one of the main selling points of the X
30 even the table dials are made of
metal like the exposure compensation on
the right the mode dial right decided
and the shutter button itself strongly
resembles the release design on my own
60 year old camera now let's talk about
handling the camera is fairly compact
not exactly pocket-sized as you can see
the lens protrusion there but if you
want to do some street photography you
will still be able to remain that
low-profile and low-key of taking
pictures and not really standing out the
gigantic lens and a DSLR the large
rubber dimple at the front helped to
secure the grip plus a small one at the
back for your thumb keeps the camera in
place just in case you switch the camera
on by turning the lens and if you are
looking for that DSLR feel this is
definitely in line with the manual zoom
lenses and that seems to be the trend
with the X 30 offering all the manual
controls for this sort of high profile
point-and-shoot camera although I would
prefer a standard on button as the lens
protrudes when you
on the camera the landscape can be
displaced easily and say just want to
view your pictures you have to sort of
go through this cumbersome process the
lens is a 28 to 112 millimeters on a
full-frame equivalent focal length it
provides a good range of optics from
wide enough angle to close enough zoom
which is on line two competing cameras
like the Sony rx100 Mark 2 the zoom
could be smoother though that's really
the only downside of being manual it
hiccups on our sample at 35 and 50
millimeters almost like a hard stop
but you avoid the common lag you get
with automatic zoom lenses the aperture
is not constant throughout the zoom you
get F 2.0 at the widest angle and F 2.8
with a telephoto still letting plenty of
light in for low-light shooting the ring
behind the lens is an awesome feature
that can be programmed to change any of
your exposure parameters can be used to
pull focus even cycle through different
picture modes and profiles and the best
part is how smooth and responsive it
feels there's also another dial at the
back for your thumb that's a little bit
too light and almost always I nudged it
without noticing and change my settings
all of a sudden it's mainly used to
adjust your f-stop and the shutter speed
and using this discreet button at the
front of the body that can be easily
pressed with your middle finger you
switch between these two parameters in
manual mode the 3-inch 920 K dot display
the back has some articulation but it is
quite limited for only low and high
angle shooting it's unfortunate you
can't fully rotate it it's not a
touchscreen but the viewing angles are
good and response time is fast it's
bright enough outside but there's also
an excellent electronic viewfinder with
two point three six million dots and
it's also a LED it's large and detailed
with 100% coverage meaning what you see
through the viewfinder is what you'll
get the sensor beside it can be modified
to switch the display or EVF only or
turn off the display when you approach
the EVF which is that perfect hybrid the
built-in pop-up flash is easily
accessible for direct flash only you
cannot angle it for bounce and it's
automatically disabled when in silent or
macro mode so keep that in mind the 12
megapixel 2/3 inch CMOS 2 sensor is
quite capable you can still achieve
shallow depth-of-field
with a bit of zoom and awesome macro
abilities with one centimeter minimum
focus distance with the lens at 28
millimeters the image stabilization
works well for handheld macros all the
pictures he now are all shot with
handheld and given the sort of large
form factor it's not exactly compact
future film could have outfitted this
with a larger one-inch sensor similar
what is found on the Sony rx100 line but
as you can see clearly funding was
distributed somewhere else and that's
your compromise the battery life is
pretty decent you'll get a few days of
shooting no problem and everything is
recorded to an SD card video mode on the
X 30 is present there is a dedicated
record button beside the shutter release
this is a terrible spot that sort of
blocked by the exposure comp time but
good thing that you can remap the movie
mode to any button on the back and there
was the first thing I did the camera
records at 1080p at 60 frames a second
so you can do some slo-mo effects pretty
cool internal processing isn't terrible
plus it has a fairly high bitrate and my
only points of critique here would be
the incredibly inaccurate and slow
autofocus especially if you're doing any
type of zooms it has very difficult time
catching these subjects in focus the
stereo microphones pick up reference
audio just fine but there's a side mini
mic jack unfortunately that's not
three-and-a-half millimeters but there's
also an odd micro HDMI for video output
don't know why that's there and there's
also a microUSB for charging the battery
and transferring things from the camera
if you are feeling artistic you can set
focus to manual with the dial on the
front and your options are single
continuous or manual and this way you
can actually achieve some interesting
video format and the smoothness of the
control ring really benefits manual
focus so the x34 pictures I find
satisfactory it can shoot raw and JPEG
at the same time just make sure you have
fast as a card for this dual format
capture the externa can do 12 frames
burst in JPEG and I found out a focus
reliable and very impressed with the
dynamic range that you can fine-tune
from 100 to 400% in the settings and
it gives the extra detail in highlights
here's a side-by-side JPEG versus edited
raw and this extreme to dark to light
picture shows that even the JPEG while
still blowing out the highlights shows
an impressive amount of dynamic range
aiyah so performance is OK up to 3200
but this is not a low-light shooter
anything about 3200 and you get smudgy
pixels loss of detail but I do have to
praise them for a noise reduction the
default setting can seriously clean up
your images without super negative
after-effects it does leave your shadows
and all those spots a little bit soft
but if you really want to touch up your
images just shoot wrong the x30 has
Wi-Fi capabilities for remote shooting
and transferring photos and I love that
I can connect my phone to the camera
either iOS or Android and transfer the
photos to Instagram and maybe back up a
few my favorite captures of the day you
do have to go through this process every
time so a name of the Wi-Fi and connect
to the camera through the Fujifilm app
but it's still faster in my opinion for
sharing than having to offload the SD
card and from my time with the camera
you really get a sense of handling
something like this a combination of
retro and modern with the X 30 really
the best camera feature all the manual
adjustments if you want to a full
accessible control of everything that's
there on the body and you can remap
things you can adjust what the Rings do
and that's really good to see the
electronic viewfinder is awesome fast
focus for pictures and even Wi-Fi link
is great 1080p video capture at 60
frames a second is alright and really
amazing macro results round this up for
an all-inclusive package but don't
forget raw capture pictures come out to
a really sharp with great lighting but
you come in door and the conversation
changes as the smaller sensor has
difficulty with retaining detail and
high ISO performance is just not
possible
I really wish to dedicated the exposure
compensation dial at the top was
something else because the only time
I've actually used the exposure
compensation was when I was outside I
didn't want to blow out the skies set it
to negative one and went on my way but
that's easily done in a software
regardless and if this was
customizable dial you can put it meeting
through ISO or shutter speed then you'll
actually come to use it more often
I also not a big fan of the turning on
mechanism especially because if you want
to just view your pictures you have to
take off the entire cap and it's a
little bit good conversin process plus
the video record button beside it is on
a very difficult spot to access if you
have bigger fingers luckily that's
remappable so the bottom line the x30
you know it's high in appearance it's
having features the best feature is all
the manual controls that are right there
but the main compromise is its sensor
size so if you can you know face
limitations if you can work around the
sensor size and it's a high poor ISO
performance and poor low-light then you
might actually love the X 30 so guys
thank you so much for watching this
