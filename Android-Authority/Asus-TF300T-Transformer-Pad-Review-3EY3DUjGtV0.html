Elmer coming at you from the one and
only Android authority calm today we're
coming at you with another awesome
review we've got the Asus Transformer
Pad TF 300 T as well as the Asus
Transformer Pad mobile dock now the TF
300 T tablet is coming in around $399
and the mobile dock is coming in at 150
so paired together you've got a really
good experience that's almost turns the
tablet into a netbook like device and it
can actually outperform most netbooks
due to its hardware anyways let's just
get into some of the hardware we've got
the royal blue Asus Transformer Pad here
you can see it's a really nice design
they all went with the swirl design on
the back they usually do that the Asus
Transformer Prime had that with a metal
back now this is going with the plastic
back for a cheaper tablet but it does
not lack any functionality you can see
here it's a nice clamshell design with
the mobile dock and it is really nice
it's nice and thin we'll go ahead and
take the tablet out of the mobile dock
just for a moment to show you the look
and feel of the tablet now it easily is
removed just by sliding this over and
you can pop it out get a nice sturdy
hinge on the mobile dock there but
anyways checking out the Asus
Transformer Pad here we do have a nice
thin profile it's nine point nine
millimeters thick now that's a pretty
much industry standard this is a basic
tablet thinness compared here to the
original Galaxy Tab you can see not too
much of a difference the Galaxy Tab is
actually a bit thinner
not too much heavier anyways they are
about the same size tablet the bezels
are a bit smaller but the screen on each
is a 10.1 inches anyways this is packing
a 8 megapixel rear facing camera we've
got a 1.2 megapixel front facing camera
now the lens on the rear camera is
really great as a 5 element lens has a
really nice aperture as well anyways the
10.1 inch display has I P s technology
in-plane switching
means it's an LCD display and
coming in with a resolution of 1280 by
800 this also has 10 finger multi-touch
support which is a pretty amazing
anyways this device is packing the Tegra
3 quad core processor which is actually
a 5 core processor in essence the fifth
core is just a small little core that's
clocked at 500 megahertz used for when
you're not doing intensive applications
or anything like that so it's a really
power saving design anyways it's clocked
at 1.2 gigahertz have our connector pin
here we've got our two ports to attach
to our mobile dock we've got our HDMI
port or mini HDMI this is our mini SD
port got a volume rocker here we've got
our power button the top you have a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack have our
speaker right here now that's only a one
speaker on this device which is somewhat
of a downfall in my eyes but it does
have the Asus sonic master technology
now the sonic master technology is a
nice little technology they've
implemented some software sounds pretty
nice but your hand can somewhat cover
the speaker back here when you're
holding it in landscape mode that's not
necessarily awesome in my book anyways
this is running the Android Ice Cream
Sandwich operating system if we go into
the settings go into the about tablet we
can see we're running the 4.0.3 I do
have a system update available so I'll
install that after the video and we
might see some newer operating system
coming on to this now I have root of
this device but this is running the
stock firmware I flashed it back to
stock it's not rooted anymore everything
is 100% stock so anyways it's got a nice
user interface we have our isus custom
user interface we have our recent window
you can kill all of our recent apps that
were running right here I've got our
home button and then we've got our back
just three on screen soft keys we've got
a status bar here with our Asus um
settings here we've got a performance
mode our battery saver mode and then our
balanced mode and the performance is
what you're going to want to be running
if you're playing any games watching
some HD video everything will just look
nice cut our auto rotate toggle Wi-Fi
settings here bluetooth
well we can scroll through have our
sound settings turn on sync and then I
turn on our GPS anyways going into the
full settings we have our white eye
excuse me Wi-Fi Bluetooth and data usage
as we usually do and under the more
settings we have Virtual Private
Networks airplane mode tethering and
Wi-Fi direct we've got our sound
settings that display this display is
not as enhanced as the transformer prime
but it's still really great it still has
really great viewing conditions
especially when it's turned all the way
up you're not really going to need that
indoors but I always find IPS displays
to be pretty reflective so going down
through our settings menu we've got our
aces customized settings we can choose
which button is actually programmed to
take a screen shot we can choose the
screenshot file format
our performance mode like was accessible
from the status bar we have our quick
settings in our notification panel we
have our system bar lock we have our
Mouse and touchpad settings for when
we're connected to our mobile dock we
also have our battery saving features
and we've just got a regular Ice Cream
Sandwich features here I'm a regular
developer options with 2d hardware
acceleration and all that a lot of great
stuff so knees will go back we've got a
few intuitive apps on the Asus tablet
here we've got the my zine widget it's
also just it's basically an aggregator
of weather emails calendar events your
books you've got your browser here and
then you have music I have no music on
this device okay so let's just pop this
device in the mobile dock quickly and
get a nice feel for how it interacts
with the mobile dock now this is a
really quality mobile dock it's a lot
better than the other manufacturers that
make mobile docks so you can see here
we'll compare it to the Samsung Galaxy
Tab 10.1 mobile dock the Galaxy Tab you
cannot actually fold it up it's not
going to be a nice clamshell design like
a netbook and it does not have support
for the newer Galaxy Tab models but it
does have raised keys much like the
mobile dock for the asus we have our
keys coming out of the body here that's
always quality we have all of our
different shortcuts we've got home here
we've got our search as well we can go
back with the top left button control
our Wi-Fi and Bluetooth from here as
well as disabled our mouse pad
add and our little clickable dock there
we have our brightness settings we can
go to our camera browser regular
settings just everything is accessible
right from this keyboard so anyways once
we are plugged in and using our little
touchpad here we do have the on-screen
Mouse the on-screen mouse has some
intuitive gesture support much like most
laptops if you use two fingers you can
long press and hold an item can also
move it around and stuff like that now
also if you use two finger gestures you
can go right and left fairly easily now
that's also um in applications that
works so if we're in the Play Store
we'll just let that load up we can
scroll up and down by simply using two
finger gestures and then once in a
subcategory we can go left and right
with our two finger gestures as well so
it's a really intuitive application you
can simply click and then you can also
double click or hold you know the same
as touching and holding by using two
fingers stop does add the extra battery
life as I said an extra 15 hours um if
you have it fully charged as you see our
Asus pad is at 92 percent and then we
would have our keyboard percentage right
there now that's one of the intuitive
apps widgets actually from Asus we have
all sorts of different widgets here
we've got our task manager we'll bring
that out and actually set that on our
other screen here and like I recently
said the my zine application we've got
our battery manager here our Asus
weather just looks really nice so do our
emails and then we have all our usual
google widgets there as well now anyways
this is the Tegra 3 so let's go to our
task manager kill all these apps and
then let's do a quadrant test as well as
some gaming tests just to show you how
good the Tegra 3 does perform so let's
make sure all of our apps are clear so
we have no no memory being used up we'll
turn it on a performance mode and then
we'll do a quadrant test see what we get
for scores we'll run a full benchmark
it's going to let that go we'll return
right after this ok so we'll send for
our results the Tegra 3 was pushing 60
frames a second which is pretty nice we
did get fourth
the 49 that's right below the
transformer prime it's basically the
same thing that Jagger 3 does run really
fast now the HTC One X is also running
the Tegra 3 it looks like we're pretty
even across the board in all areas the
CPUs it's a little different now this
can be overclocked when rooted and
robbed also running a custom kernel
which I have done but anyways I will
just stick with the stock we'll try and
play some games here now the global
application was actually pre-loaded on
the device and it was made specifically
for the Tegra 3 just to demonstrate some
would be cool graphics you can also hear
our sound our sonic master technology
and basically you can see that the
curtains are waving and stuff when the
ball goes through now that's specific to
the Tegra 3 devices my orientations have
been off you can see the nice colors and
everything kind of reflecting off of the
globe all the main feature of this
basically the waving curtains courtesy
of the Tegra 3 so yeah we are see we
have our Nvidia logo up there nice
reflections toppling of the barrels and
then our big old clown
so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
