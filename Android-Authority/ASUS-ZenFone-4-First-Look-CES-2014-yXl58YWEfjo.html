by Toyota
hey it's trucks regard from Angela
authority what's going on everybody and
we're here at the Trump Towers with a
soos and we're taking a look at all of
their newer leases that were just
announced yesterday and we're starting
off with the smallest of the zenfone
bunch - these n phone four alright here
we are we have the zenfone 4 Maya soos
as the moniker says it says mobility in
style what we have is a very affordable
phone here that is you know it's a it's
a plastic build here that comes in at 99
dollars but packs a little bit of power
inside that allows for all users to get
a really great experience underneath it
comes packed with the Intel Atom
processor that runs at 1.2 gigahertz and
has the brand-new Zen UI underneath not
what we were told is this and UI here is
actually a bit of an early build but you
can write to see some great aesthetics
here especially if you look at the app
drawer it's nice and speedy and it's
very very clean and of course with the
notification drop-down right over here
nice concentric circles just showing the
entire interface looking very nice so
what we have underneath also is a 4
gigabyte onboard storage capacity that
does give it a bit of a small onboard
storage number but it should be enough
for many of the general users out there
who are just looking for a pretty simple
experience on a phone that is very very
affordable now this version of the Zen
UI right here is based on Android 4.3
and when the launch happens sometime in
April is what we're being told it will
update to Android 4.4 KitKat so that's
something to look forward to there as
far as other specifications go we do
have a pretty standard 5 megapixel
camera on the back this is a 4 inch TFT
screen coming in at 800 by 4 for 800 by
480 excuse me in resolution so what you
have here is a very very affordable
price point on the phone that can bring
you a nice experience because of some
power that is definitely underneath so
this is the zenfone 4 we're going to
move on to the zenfone 5 and 6 here at
the Trump Towers we're kicking it with
is Zeus stay tuned for more coverage
here at CES 2014
and once again thank you to Toyota for
sponsoring our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
