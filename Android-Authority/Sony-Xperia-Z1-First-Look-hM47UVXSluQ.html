Josh of Agartha mandroid authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the Sony Xperia z1 in your first look
here at the Sony press event just before
Aoife we got a look at what is probably
Sony's biggest and best smartphone
endeavor after starting with the Xperia
Z and then evolving their design since
then the so called Omni balance design
methodology is in full force here as the
phone is basically made up of one
unibody piece of aluminum and then
covered in glass what you get here is a
phone that looks a lot like the Xperia Z
almost identical really but has a
sturdier feel and according to Sony is
as mechanically sound as it can get the
phone has a nice rigid feel to it due to
sharpened corners and the flat sides and
of course there is Sonia's signature
Xperia stoever power button on the side
alongside the added in dedicated camera
button for a 5-inch screen device the
ham Gymnastics are kept to a minimum
just like with the Xperia Z and the
placement of the power button and volume
rockers is right where your thumb would
land around the sides the port's all
have covers on them the classic sign of
water resistance it's no secret that I'm
a fan of the black site design and few
do a better than Sony the Xperia z1 is
very much a simplistically elegant phone
Sony has really been working on their
display game since the original Xperia Z
and have come up with a number of
enhancements that have made it onto the
Xperia z1 the triluminos display is a
1080p resolution screen that is also
backed by Sony's x-reality engine
sonja's UI does typically take on darker
tones but it's not hard to see some real
contrast between the colors on the
screen viewing media is usually quite
good on Xperia screens and we're certain
that this will remain true for the
Xperia z1 as well but within that
aluminum frame are what we'd expect from
a high-end smartphone just like this the
Xperia z1 supports the snapdragon 800
that comes in out 2.2 gigahertz and is
backed by the Adreno 330 and 2 gigabytes
of ram from our initial testing we saw a
little stutter and lag and the more
simplistic Xperia U I continued on with
no problems
16 gigabytes of on-board storage is
available but also expandable due to a
micro SD card slot and a 3000 milliamp
hour non removable battery should give
longevity especially with the rather
robust Xperia P saving features
Sonne really tried to drive home at this
event that they are bolstering their
imaging department that also includes
their mobile devices in an effort to
make smartphone photography as good as
using a compact digital camera the
Xperia z1 comes with what is called the
G lens a twenty point seven megapixel
shooter that takes everything we may see
in Sony's camera lines to the smartphone
the Exmor RS CMOS sensor is Sonja's
jumping into the very high-end
smartphone camera game and is supposed
to bring a stellar photography
experience the interface has changed
somewhat but retains the superior auto
and various modes that Experian's have
had in the past enhancement apps are now
also available for download and can add
more flair to your pictures and video
more of these apps are set to become
part of the experiment in Lluis lease o
expect more ways of getting creative and
of course for further enhancement sony
created the QX series lenses but that's
for another video we'll have much more
in-depth looks at the camera and its
picture quality when we get our own
Xperia z1 software is a department that
Sony typically keeps pretty simple the
Xperia UI is pretty stock like in nature
echoing some design elements of Ice
Cream Sandwich while having the
jellybean enhancements not too much has
changed this time around as the same
additions like the small apps and the
Sony's apps like the Walkman returned
Sony's focus continues to be social for
example a camera app is included that
allows you to livestream from the
phone's camera to Facebook and will give
you live updates of comments that people
make on that stream Sony's own unlimited
services were given many mentions and
it's clear that Sony wants you to come
to their ecosystem for all of your
general media needs but unless you jump
in the Xperia experience is pretty much
what you might remember it to be and so
there you have it a look at the Sony
Xperia z1 known prior to this event as
the onami phone even with new powerful
specs its biggest asset is basically
that monster of a camera and could be
what sets it apart the most this is very
much the perfecting of the Xperia Z
smartphone and if you are an experienced
might be the dream phone that you've
been waiting for for more coverage of
the Xperia z1 stay tuned to android
