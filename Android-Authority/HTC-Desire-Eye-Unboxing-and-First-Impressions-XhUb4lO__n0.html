might be the phone for you hey it's Josh
of regard from Android Authority what's
going on everybody and it's time to
unbox and give my first impressions on
it the 13 megapixel rear and front
facing cameras of the HTC Desire i HTC
Desire eye right here on the bottom
let's go ahead and get that opened up
and there we are nice and crisp with the
plastic still on there and you can
already see on the front that camera
already has the larger size to it
because it is the 13 megapixel
front-facing camera that is there now
get this out of the way and of course it
has those 18 t colors right there
basically the orange with the white I
have to say it does look pretty good
still the desire line now has this
two-tone coloration to its frame and to
its body that does make it look very
attractive so when you get in the right
colors this isn't too bad actually
getting into the contents of the box we
of course have a couple of QuickStart
guides available get underneath here and
we have the adapter for the micro USB
charging cable the actual cable itself
and that right there or the contents of
the box for the HTC Desire eye for AT&amp;amp;T
so let's go ahead and get the plastic
off of here it looks like it's pretty
easy just sliding the phone out of the
plastic and that's pretty simple now we
can talk about the actual device itself
we do have this white on the bottom and
on the top with the HTC bar and logo
here on the bottom still but the screen
looks like it has a pretty respectable
bezel around its frame the size is
actually pretty nice in order for you to
have some nice handling in one hand on
the side here are a couple of slots for
you to put in a couple of cards the
button layout is over here on the right
side with the power button underneath
the volume rockers and then the welcome
addition of a dedicated camera button
which is always great when it comes to
the camera experience on a phone that's
supposed to be good with its camera and
the large hole up front at the top means
that they 13 megapixel optics upfront or
hard
miss we do have the boomsound speakers
but they are relegated to these very
small slits on the bottom and on the top
which I'll give you a closer look at in
these shots right here but here we go
we're just going to go ahead and power
on the phone right now going through HTC
Sense it looks like it has the nice
simplistic look that HTC has put on
there with all the functionality that
you need let's open up a couple of apps
and just take a look at the grid right
here and it looks like everything is
running pretty smoothly I mean HTC Sense
has always been pretty smooth and with
its enhancements and previous iterations
the most recent iterations things I've
started to look really nice it is one of
the better Android iterations that we've
seen in the market today
HTC does a good job with their OS
alright and let's get right into the
camera now we have the rear-facing
camera 13 megapixels that are available
and like I said I'm going to show you
some examples of the camera quality here
in this initial unboxing and first
impressions of course and just looking
at the application we have some pretty
simple interface elements here with just
the buttons on the right side and of
course these settings here on the bottom
we can change the exposure compensation
the ISO we can change the mode so that
we can have a few extra ones right here
there are a bunch we have the manual
mode obviously and when we go over to
macro mode but also the sweeping
panorama the fast Full HD video capture
some stabilization some anti shake which
is more of a software type of
implementation slow motion video as well
which we're going to take a look at in
the full review again and I'll probably
do a camera shootout on this as well so
just go back to auto and let's take a
look at some of the modes so here are
the modes that are available on the
desire camera of course selfie split
capture which will allow you to use both
of the cameras in tandem photobooth
which is going to be a nice thing to use
and after that Pan 360 but let's just
jump into the selfie and take our first
self-portrait with this particular
camera there you go 13 megapixels will
allow for quite a bit of detail to be
found inside of these photos but let's
also take a few outside and you'll see
them as we close out this
videos so keep it tuned to Android
authority for all of the best coverage
including my future review of the HTC
Desire eye yes
the selfie game will be upgraded because
of this particular phone and it's 13
megapixel front facing shooter and once
you have the front facing shooter on
lock you'll be able to take some
high-quality photos with you you're
friends with a wide-angle lens and we're
going to see exactly how that looks in
the real world when I take a look at it
in a camera shootout and our full review
keep it tuned here and drop us some
