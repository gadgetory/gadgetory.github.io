Galaxy s7 versus the Samsung Galaxy s6
now there really aren't a whole lot of
design overhauls on these two devices
from one to the other and the galaxy s7
pretty much just continues the premium
design language that was started in the
galaxy s6 with the metal body and the
dual glass panel design but they're
having some refinements to the elements
of the phone including the reduction in
the camera hump on the back which means
that if you're sliding the phone around
you're not really going to scratch up
the glass in front of the lens a whole
lot anymore if that was ever a problem
but the main two additions to the design
of the galaxy s7 from the galaxy s6 are
the curves on the back that allow it to
sit even nicer in the hand and the
handling is even better this time around
with those two curves on the back it
just sits so nicely and kind of just
formed fits to the palm and the fingers
and getting from side to side or top to
bottom on this 5.1 inch display is
pretty incredible it's almost as if they
took a shrink ray to the samsung galaxy
note5 and this is exactly what you get
but the other feature that returns which
is awesome is the water and dust
resistance which means that the galaxy
s7 will be able to brave the elements a
little bit better than its earlier
brethren the displays are really similar
on here as 5.1 inches really is the size
for both of these devices and they are
Super AMOLED displays with quad HD
resolution supporting really high pixel
densities you're going to get a very
vibrant to display on both of them with
punched-out colors and good viewing
angles and brightness so Samsung display
prowess is still well-known and you're
looking at the two of them here in the
s6 and the s7 but as far as the
additions are concerned the galaxy s7
does now have the always-on display so
every time you turn off the device the
little area where you can see the time a
calendar the weather will be there at
all time so you can get a quick glance
at that piece of information no matter
what the phone is doing and it's a very
low-power
feature so that the always-on display
doesn't take up that much battery in
terms of performance it's really just a
jump forward as the Samsung Galaxy s6
did sort of go by the wayside of the
snapdragons of the world in order to
bring their own in-house processing
packages and it for the most part did
prove itself the XE no 7420 did a great
job backed by three gigabytes of RAM but
this year we have the Snapdragon 820
making a return with the
you know five thirty and four gigabytes
of RAM however depending on the market
there will be versions of the galaxy s7
with the exceed knows eighty eight
ninety as well with the same amount of
RAM but in hardware there are some big
news items here we already talked about
to the return of the water and dust
resistance but we also have the return
of the micro SD card slot that's right
the galaxy s7 now has the feature that a
lot of people were wishing every samsung
phone from last year provided the
battery has also remained non removable
though between these two but the battery
life will hopefully get a much bigger
boost and the galaxy s7 is hoping that
three thousand milliamp hours in the
battery of the original s7 will be able
to bolster what was already a decent
battery life longevity in the twenty
five fifty million power unit of the s6
16 megapixels is definitely the larger
number but the 12 megapixel s7 camera
comes with much larger pixels at 1.4
microns and it also has AF 1.7 aperture
lamps but as far as the interface goes
you still get all of the different
features you get a couple of extra modes
this time around and the pro mode where
you can actually granularly change all
of the different settings do provide the
same amount of control no matter which
one of these two that you pick but the
low-light performance as well as the
fact that phase detection autofocus is
inside of every single pixel the larger
pixels of the galaxy s7 makes auto
focusing a snap and finally in software
we still have TouchWiz and it for the
most part will feel very familiar the
galaxy s7 does come back to these sort
of rounded almost cartoony type of icons
are throughout the interface but there
is one very important distinction to
make note of here all of the different
features that were available in the
galaxy s6 come back in the s7 including
the pop-up view and also the multi
window multitasking capabilities but in
the galaxy s7 there are a few extras
that are found under a very specific
area of the settings and it is called
galaxy labs now we do see a trend
happening this year that AB drawers
might be going by the wayside and though
you do have an app drawer already in
these galaxy s7 you can actually turn it
off inside of the galaxy labs area now
whether or not this is going to become a
permanent feature is a little bit
worrisome to us but ultimately we hope
that we will be
able to keep our app drawers and if we
don't then that will take some getting
used to for a lot of users of the galaxy
s7 and future versions of TouchWiz so
there you have it for taking a look at
the galaxy s7 versus the galaxy s6 there
aren't really a whole lot of changes
between these two except refinements to
an already well received design that
even if it did not provide a couple of
features from last year they did bring
them this year including the expandable
storage the battery might not be
removable still but at least it is
larger this time around and with fast
charging it should be able to handle the
distance so keep it tuned to Android
authority for more about the galaxy s7
and remember we're going to get our
review units pretty soon so we will be
able to put this phone through its paces
and compare it to all of the best
including more from Samsung galaxys line
so keep it tuned to Android Authority
and stay tuned for even more from MWC
2016 because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
