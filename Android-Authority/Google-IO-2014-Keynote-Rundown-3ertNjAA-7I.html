to a close and as all of the people over
here file out of this huge room you know
what time it is it's josh regard from
android authority what's going on
anybody and this is the google i/o 2014
keynote rundown
so obviously one of the first things
that we do kind of have to talk to talk
about because you're going to see a lot
of new stories about it all over the
Internet at least right now or at least
when it just happened was that there
were a couple protesters here at the
show now I'm not too sure how they even
got in that's what I'm most curious
about whether they were press or maybe
they were people that actually paid to
be here but essentially a couple people
came out and they were just saying that
Google either needs to get a conscience
or they build killer robots I kill
people well obviously you're dealing
with a crowd that will not believe in
such a thing so they were easily
escorted out of the out of the room and
who knows what happened to them probably
arrested or something like that really
the first huge announcement that we got
was a preview of the new l series now
whether that's going to be called
something like lemon drop or lollipop or
licorice is something that we don't know
just yet but it's just L so that's the L
preview that we're going to have and it
will be available for all the developer
edition phones that are available out
right now but also you will be able to
get the image from the Nexus 5 for
example and that's something we're going
to be working on right away to bring you
a look at what the what the hell preview
kind of brings to the table but a couple
of things that I wanted to talk about
there are just the new design elements
and now if you updated your Google+
application in recent weeks then you
probably have had a little bit of a
taste of what this particular material
designs what they're calling it is all
about basically it's about providing
death and whether that's through provide
having drops shadows behind particular
elements or bring a certain elements
forward while dimming the background a
little bit it's just a way of showing
you exactly what you're looking at in a
way that puts it front and center and
also from there it also provides a nice
a nice sort of apparatus for creating
animations that sort of make everything
flow in and out of the general space
whether or not that's because you press
on a particular type of element on there
and it comes out maybe like a line or
notification that comes up in the drop
down is a kind of what they're kind of
going for here in this new version of
Android they say it's going to be the
biggest release of android yet and we
will have a bigger review or rather
preview of it for you a little bit later
on once we get the image on one of our
devices one of our guys
is going to be able to do that as I
don't have my Nexus 5 on me at the
moment so from there the L preview is
really the basis so it's really the
platform by which the integration with
all of the different eco all the
different devices across the ecosystem
is going to be and we got a lot of
previews from that there are things like
Android wear and Android auto which I'm
going to go ahead and get into we got a
lot of great announcements here and yes
they are typically developer centric so
it's something that a lot of us
consumers may not always be able to get
into but that's the point of google i/o
it's for the developers about being able
to develop great apps being able to
develop great experiences across all
particular devices no matter if they're
smart phones or smart watches or
anything like that so we got a lot of
information especially in the middle
about Google Cloud Google Play services
and new ways that developers will be
able to get their work done in an easy
fashion and aside from that however we
also got a lot of greats announcements
when it came to the integration of our
devices and the collaboration that our
devices can have in order to make our
experiences even better the first one of
course has to do with wearable tech
wearable tech is a big deal this year
and we got to see previews of particular
devices like the LG G watch Samsung is
falling in line and creating their own
version of a smart watch as well based
on Android wear and that's Steve samsung
gear live and then after that of course
the motorola 360 while the first two are
going to be available later today for
order on Google Play we will not be
seeing the Moto 360 and so later this
summer one thing that was very
interesting to me was the inclusion of
automobiles when it comes to android
integration and Android auto is the name
of that particular wing of Android and
essentially what it will do is it will
work into the interface of the screen
that is inside of your car and it's an
apparatus by which you can easily access
all of your Android capabilities and
whatnot and be able to easily text or do
music or play music or do navigation
without having to take your eyes off of
the wheel now the one of the quick
things that I thought of when I first
saw that was the fact that well you
still have to touch the screen so
anybody who is prone to distractions
will probably have a problem with that
they'll still be looking at the screen a
little bit more
more than they are looking at the road
but for the most part it is a nice way
of integrating the Android ecosystem
weather is the smartphone or the
SmartWatch into the automobile and yes
texting while driving is something that
I think we all do on some level are
these looking at our phones to either
change the song or to check the
navigation steps but all in all being
able to make the automobiles safer for
all of us is something that I think is a
great idea let's move on from there and
finally into the android TV announcement
now Android TV is not necessarily new
but it is a new way of looking at what
was once just a smart application on top
of Google TV which is what it was
originally called Android TV is yet
again another API that is going to be
put into various televisions that will
be released over the next year so you
are going to need to get a television
that actually has excuse me that
actually has that functionality inside
but it integrates perfectly with your
smartphone and you are actually able to
use your smartphone as the remote
control for the TV as an apple be made
available that pretty much works at your
remote control Google games is a great
addition to Android TV that I think a
lot of people are going to love in that
you will be able to play a bunch of
games on Android TV and be able to play
multiplayer games as well on that big
screen even if that other person is
playing from somewhere else on their
tablet or their smartphone so that is a
great integration there but Android TV
is a big development and unfortunately
but unfortunately not all of us will be
able to get an android TV as easily
whether it's because of cost or because
of the fact that we already have a great
TV and we're not really looking to
replace it anytime soon but from there
we do have a chromecast which has been
given a little bit of an update as well
now chromecast has been given a few new
features that I think we've all kind of
been waiting for primarily being able to
change the background on the actual
splash screen that comes up and be able
to put our own photos on there and that
is exactly what they did being able to
put you on photos on there is kind of a
big deal and I think it's a great
addition that is available from there
you are actually able to cast what is on
your smartphone straight to your TV and
I'm talking about the entire screen this
is full screen cast capability that is
available and that will allow you to get
a lot done on your TV as a post on your
smart
phone and just be able to really blow up
that image and do anything from there
after that another good feature about
chromecast is the fact that if anybody
comes to your house for example and goes
to your living room you will be able to
let them cast from their smartphone to
your chromecast using the cloud at first
I thought it was kind of problematic
because someone might be able to create
an application or some sort of a hack
that would be able to take a look at the
information stored in the chromecast and
get the password of your Wi-Fi network I
still think that might be a little bit
of a problem but we have been told that
it's going to be an opt-in system you
will only be able to allow certain
people that you trust to be able to
connect to the chromecast using this
feature so the chromecast is getting a
lot of play as well so if you don't
happen to have the resources or what not
to be able to get an android TV at least
the chromecast is still a great viable
solution to be able to get all those
services maybe not the entire
functionality but a good amount of it
onto your chromecast and be able to do
it in an affordable fashion and I kind
of want to know what the future is when
it comes to the Chromebooks now
Chromebooks have been given their own
section inside of the presentation and
while the aren't necessarily that many
huge analysis when it came to the
Chromebooks it still shows that the
Chromebooks are a viable very viable
alternative to all of the PCs and the
max that are out there especially for
people who are working and there was a
big there was a lot of focus on what it
looked like using Chromebooks when
you're working and being able to sync
with all of your co-workers and be able
to share everything that you are putting
together Chromebooks are kind of still a
little bit of a French product at least
for me you want to be able to get much
of video editing done but as far as just
pure text editing and maybe some simple
on the cloud functionality Chromebooks
are a very good and viable solution and
they happen to be one of the most
popular apparatuses for people out there
who need exactly that so there as you
can see they're taking all of the chairs
out and everyone's kind of filing out
there's a huge crowd over there that's
why I'm taking my time over here because
being up being able to get to that crowd
is going to be absolutely nuts all in
all this was a great show that all of
the lights there was a very interesting
a countdown apparatus over there that
eventually turned into this this large
contraption that pretty much just
announced that it was time for the show
to start but there's still a lot to look
forward to here at Google i/o I will be
attending a few sessions like I told you
earlier and I
share a few of the things that they do
talk about at these i will go to some
wearable sessions and some android
sessions so i will have some information
for you there but stay tuned because i
will be picking up my LG G watch pretty
soon I have my pick of that order here
live and i think the g watches us is the
newer or rather the more fresh the
pressure of the two devices since we
already have gears so i'm going to go
for that stay tuned for an unboxing of
the of the g watch and also my first
impressions of it and after this
conference is over i'll give you second
impression just to show you really what
the functionality is and how I feel
about using it throughout something like
this conference so keep it tuned to
android authority for all of the best
