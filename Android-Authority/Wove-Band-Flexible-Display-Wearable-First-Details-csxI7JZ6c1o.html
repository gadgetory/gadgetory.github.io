especially when you consider
smartwatches has really stepped its game
up especially in terms of making their
smartwatches look like real watches but
like I've said on multiple occasions in
the past I always thought that wearables
should own their own form factors and
today I got a look at a new product that
just might be doing that in a great way
it's Josh freghar from Andhra thority
what's going on everybody and today I'm
here to bring you information about the
announcement of the wolf band by poly
era now I do want to make one thing
actually clear real quick you are going
to see this particular video in which I
will explain poly era in their new wolf
band which is a brand new take on
wearable technology and I have some
pieces of tech in front of me some
examples that lead up to what hopefully
will be the product now the product that
you are going to see in only pictures
today and in a follow-up video later
this week is so pre-production that
they're not even calling an alpha phase
this is such an early production unit
that this is only going to be considered
0.1 stage and there will be more
information on that in a little bit but
without any further ado here are the
couple of pictures I'm allowed to show
at least for now on today's embargo of
the wove band now as you can see here
the wolf band is of a flexible display a
picture there showed it at its full
retracted state and then clamped
together into the way that you're
supposed to be wearing it the other
thing you won't be seeing is this watch
actually worn by somebody because that
is a moment that poly era the company
wants to save for each individual person
so they can keep that experience as
personal as possible but the wolf band
is born from poly eras near decade
experience of creating flexible
technology and I have a piece of it
right here actually this which looks
like just a simple piece of plastic is
actually a sheet of real circuits and
these circuits are not only able to be
used in actual electronics but they are
as flexible as a piece of plastic can
possibly be now that is really the crux
of what Paulie era is trying to do
only with wearables but what they've
been trying to do for a long long time
and now they have they are bringing this
technology to display so now here is a
mock-up of displays these actually
become part of the full-on displays that
then are made into these particular
sheets now it's it's very interesting to
note that these sheets don't necessarily
have to be of this size the actual
displays that are being created on these
sheets that are then constructed into
the real displays can be of different
sizes so when you do end up seeing the
picture and the video later this week of
the wove band keep in mind as they told
me that there are going to be versions
of it that will be able to cater to
different wrist sizes even different
genders because it's something that they
can actually cater on-the-fly and based
upon their own manufacturing process but
what ends up happening is you have this
this is a actual display now the only
reason why it looks like a printed piece
of paper inside of a piece of sheet of
plastic is because this is the last
image that their version of a paper had
when it was firing on an actual display
on an actual device and as you can see
here the actual display is fully
flexible and this is exactly the kind of
display that they want to bring in the
wolf band as you're going to see in a
few assets that I have here you're going
to be seeing on their website which
should be opening today the website
shows the examples in renders of what
the wolf band is going to bring to the
table not only is this a flexible
display it is a very large display and
behind it is an Android iteration that
has been customized into the wove OS now
they're going to be applications or what
they call compositions because this
entire thing can be a huge canvas for a
artist or a developer in which they can
create experiences on here which will
house a number of elements it could be a
large picture like this or you can head
on over to a different composition that
shows information for example you have
directions on the top for if you're
using the Maps application you also have
music controls the time and even a news
feed on the bar
and what's great about the wolf band
concept is that it actually creates
areas by which you can prioritize your
information now the wolf band itself as
you're going to see in the video later
this week when we are allowed to release
footage of it latches on to itself and
just sort of goes around the wrist there
are extenders if you need them and you
can just easily deploy the detachment
whenever you need to take it off but it
can also be used as a display that just
sort of sits on your desk because it is
a ePaper display it has the guise of
just being part of your workspace so you
can have a lot of information in
landscape mode and it can double as a
clock that will go for days on end
because the battery life should be very
good on a wearable that does not use
typical displays now today's
announcements are not just about the
device itself but also about getting the
process started the zero point one phase
of the wolf band is asking for
developers artists pretty much anybody
that wants to create on the wolf band
their own applications and they can
apply to get to have their own device in
order to start developing for it and
with the journey that the wolf band can
have over the next however so many
months until the actual final production
release units become available they will
be able to create all of the experiences
that will one day make it onto your
wrist we're incredibly excited about
this honestly innovative take on smart
watches and wearables and we hope that
the wolf band will continue to grow
especially a little bit faster because
we can't wait to get these watches on
our wrists but you can also see all of
the other pictures that I took of not
only the tech that I showed you in this
video but of the band itself because
pictures were ok but video was not made
available until much later keep it tuned
to Android authority for that and even
more once the video of the wolf band
that I have filmed is able to be
released you can click me right now to
go straight to that video once it is
available and after all that to make
sure you drop us on life's on our video
subscribe to our channel if you haven't
already to get even more about this
great smart watch that we're just
getting our first look of and then head
on over to android authority comm for
even more because we are your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
