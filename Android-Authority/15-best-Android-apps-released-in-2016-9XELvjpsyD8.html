handy Deandra at Authority app guy and
we have made it around the Sun at least
one more time together that means it's
time to round up the best new Android
apps that were released over the course
of the last year if you want to check
out any of these apps for yourself you
can find those links in the video
description below Adobe released a
handful of Android apps this year and
instead of putting them individually on
the list we're going to group them all
together the biggest releases included
Adobe Photoshop fix Photoshop sketch and
Adobe comp CC the first one is a photo
editing tool that gives you some pretty
decent tools and controls to fix your
photos Photoshop sketch is a drawing
application with a few pro level
features finally comp CC allows you to
create designs that can then be ported
over to other Adobe apps they all work
pretty well although you may need a
Creative Cloud subscription to utilize
their full potential
brave browser has an interesting history
okay so get this late last year the
popular link bubble browser was
rebranded as brave browser then in late
2016 the application was re rebranded as
link bubble and brave browser saw a
fresh release this browser is based off
of chromium so the interface should be
familiar for most people it also comes
with built-in adblock along with
additional security and privacy features
it's a solid browser overall and
probably the best one that comes with
built-in adblock one of the biggest
announcements at Google i/o was chrome
custom tabs is essentially an instance
of google chrome that opens as an in-app
browser chrome ER is an application that
essentially gives every single
application a chrome custom tab it works
by intercepting links and then opening
it up in its own chrome custom tab
instance it's a relatively simple
application to use once you fire it up
you forget about it and it'll just open
web pages for you as you go it also has
a web heads feature that allows you to
load websites in the background and then
open them later you can download it for
free or pick up the pro version for four
dollars and 54 cents AV launcher flew
under the radar for much of 2016
for those who don't know it's a minimal
launcher that uses a no app drawer
premise you are instead given a slide
out alphabetical list of your
applications or you can search for them
manually it also comes with
customization features to help make you
feel right at home it's not as feature
heavy as something like Nova Launcher
but it does have more options available
than something like Google now launcher
it's pretty good and it's
so completely free we don't usually do
social media applications for best of
the year candidates however flamingo for
Twitter is just that good it features
comprehensive multi account support that
includes per account theming options and
settings on top of that the interface
and layouts are pretty customizable
there are also a good set of Twitter
specific features and the application
just works really well it's a pay once
app like most Twitter apps but it's
definitely worth the charge even in beta
it was one of the best Twitter apps out
there after a long time of simply being
integrated into a ton of other products
if you went ahead and released their
official Android app with it you'll have
one of the most solid and reliable
source of gifs on the entire Internet
the application is designed simply and
takes a lot of its design cues from the
actual website thus using both
interchangeably provides a level of
familiarity you'll be able to search for
keywords or browse gifs based on premade
categories by the site if you use or
enjoy gifs whatsoever you'll want to
give this one a shot Google a low-end
duo caused quite a stir when they were
first released after all we had been
waiting for them for months and what we
got wasn't quite what we expected even
so over the course of the last few
months both have become pretty decent
chat platforms duo's primary strength is
its ease of use and cross-platform
support alo boasts the only non pixel
way to access Google assistant we expect
them both to get a lot better as time
goes on so even if you're not interested
right now do make sure to keep them on
your radar isotope is an educational app
its purpose is to show you the facts and
data about the periodic table of
elements and it does so quite well
it features information on 118 elements
along with theming high quality images
no advertising a search feature and a
temperature unit chooser the free
version comes with some basic info while
the pro version offers an additional
theme and more detailed info about every
element it's a bit niche but the design
of this application is impeccable and
it's definitely the best at what it does
quick is a simple video editing
application that was released by GoPro
and it takes a simpler approach to video
editing you'll take a bunch of clips and
then the application will try to thread
them together into a fun little
highlight reel this can of course be
shared on social media when you're
finished it comes with some video
editing options and you can do some of
the cutting yourself it's not a full
featured video editing tool but it's
definitely good enough for mobile use
most of the time
parcel track is a fun little application
that helps you track your packages it
works by taking tracking numbers and
then keeping a detailed list for you to
check back on when you want to it
supports most carriers around the world
and it's a good place to put all of your
shipments into a single spot you get a
decent amount of features in the free
version while the premium users will
also get push notifications a barcode
scanner syncing between Android devices
and more it's a must-have if you ship or
receive shipments regularly Prisma was
one of this year's most viral
applications it hit the scene and was so
popular that the apps servers actually
crashed for those who don't know Prisma
is a photofiltre app that uses neural
networks and artificial intelligence to
rebuild your photos from the ground up
with these new filters admittedly the
results aren't as awesome as the tech
behind it sounds but you do get a
selection of some pretty unique filters
that people really do seem to enjoy sk r
WT bills itself as an advanced photo
editing and camera app it's big draw is
its in-app extensions that allow for
even more advanced editing tools they
are called m rrw and four points which
allow for things like perspective
correction mirror effects image
manipulation and more it's not as loaded
with tools as some photo editing apps
but it does have some fairly unique
tools that nobody else really has you
can get the application for free and the
various plugins will require in-app
purchases in order to get swipe for
Facebook is probably the best Facebook
alternative out there its claim to fame
is its customization on top of having
theming support you can actually change
the layout of the app to make it work
how you want you can even make it look
like Google Plus for instance as a whole
it works pretty well or at least as well
as can be expected as a third party app
to a site that hates third-party apps
you can pick it up for free and check it
out and there is a separate app for
those who want widgets trusted contacts
is a pretty awesome little app from
Google the basic premise is that you use
it to assign yourself a trusted contact
those contacts can then ping the
application as to your whereabouts if
they think that you're in trouble you
can block the request simply by
responding to the app in a reasonable
amount of time it likely isn't great for
everybody but there are some situations
where it can be great for instance
having an older relative who is ill or
having a kid who is out
trick-or-treating on Halloween in any
case it's completely free if you want to
check it out crewmen keyboard is the
biggest keyboard release in 2016
it's original claim to fame as its
adaptive theming that changes the
keyboard theme based on what app you're
using updates over the course of the
year have added additional features to
round out an already pleasant experience
the keyboard also does the basics like
gesture controls autocorrect and a lot
more and there's even a night mode along
with a neural network powered prediction
engine if you want those its original
release wasn't all that impressive but a
steady stream of big updates over the
course of the year kept making it better
and better overall we're choosing it as
the best Android app released in all of
2016 and that about does it for this one

have plenty of other best app list
videos out there and we have them linked
