Razer logo on the back of what basically
looks like the next bit Robin or at
least the next evolution of it well you
could say is that the next bit Robin
from the ashes of what used to be that
phone comes what you could call
basically the Razer Phoenix this is the
razor phone razor really wants to
position this phone as a phone for
gamers and that's an important
distinction to make because this is not
necessarily a gaming phone this is a
phone that is made for the type of
person that wants the best possible
specifications in a device that can
pretty much do anything and so far this
phone seems like an absolute beast and
that's no exaggeration what seems like a
behemoth of a phone houses a quad HD 5.7
2 inch LCD panel made by sharp on a body
that looks a lot like a beefed-up
version of the original midnight edition
of the Robin flatten angular all around
the phone is easy enough to grip if not
for its larger size and much like the
next bit Robin there is a fingerprint
reader embedded into the flat power
button the screen has a lot more going
for it than its size and resolution
taking some inspiration from razors line
of laptops the screen actually has a 120
Hertz refresh rate so that means that
everything simply glides across this
screen in a way that they call ultra
motion this is something that you'll be
able to experience not only in games of
course but also in scrolling through
websites like our own and of course
going through certain applications like
Reddit on top of that the sync rate is
always synced to the GPU making it
adaptable for whatever situation the
phone is rendering the result is a
variability that allows for the battery
to be used only when it absolutely has
to be so you're not going to get lower
battery life just because it's always
firing on all cylinders now as far as
games go not all games will run at this
super high refresh rates but razer has
already gotten a number of partners
onboard with more to come in the future
a couple of names that were dropped
included $0.10 which you might know from
League of Legends and also Final Fantasy
15 mobile Edition by Square Enix and
it's good that games look great on here
because the performance is as top-notch
as possible and we mean that the
Snapdragon 835 powers the razor phone
but as a bit of a surprise there's a
massive amount of RAM on here at 8
gigabytes and razer has made sure that
all eight gigabytes is used by the phone
of course we can't really talk about the
long-term performance of this phone as
we bowling on
a little bit of time with the phone thus
far but we're pretty confident that
eight gigabytes will go a long way
especially in terms of multitasking and
productivity and on top of that you can
actually cater the speed of the
processor in the game booster cap the
frame rate at 60 or 90 frames per second
if you wish change the display
resolution that the game pumps out or
even change the clock speed so you can
get a little bit more game time out of
the four thousand milliamp hour battery
now you can't necessarily overclock the
processor but razer did tell us that the
max performance setting in the game
booster already puts it at its max level
above what it is already set at at
default but for the sake of battery life
it's nice that you can change the
settings up so you can get a little bit
more game time so let's get to the rest
of the hardware 64 gigabytes of on-board
storage is available by an SD card slot
is also there in case you use of all 64
gigabytes available for all the games
that you might install or maybe you
aren't all about games if you want a
media powerhouse that screen will
certainly enhance the experience but
audio has not been left out of the
equation either in a partnership with
Dolby Dolby Atmos for mobile helps power
the dual front-facing speakers that
sound incredible
once again Razer derives from their
laptop line in order to create speakers
that are super high quality on a mobile
device and these speaker grilles are a
lot like the ones you would find on a
laptop we cranked it up to max and not
only did the lows and mids actually
sound quite full but the highs were not
piercing to the ear and it got really
loud
but of course if you don't want to
bother anyone else with the speakers
headphones are always an option
unfortunately there is no headphone jack
on this device now let that bummer sink
in for a second and then realize that
the adapter that Razer adds into the box
has a 24-bit deck installed this is a
move I've been spouting phone
manufacturers should do for a long long
time it's great to see it finally
happened and Razer is one of the first
to do it
unfortunately we didn't have any high
impedance headphones to really test this
out but we look forward to doing so once
we get our hands on our review units
we're pretty confident that the audio
experience on here is going to be
top-notch the next bit Robin was
notorious for having a slow camera
experience and that doesn't seem to be
the case here but the camera software
lacks a lot of options there are dual
cameras on the back with a telephoto
lens and both are 12 megapixel cameras
unfortunately when you go into the
application there aren't really a whole
lot of options for you to mess around
with not even a button for you to be
able to change between the 2 lenses
easily we still remain hopeful that this
camera combo and the 8 megapixel front
facing shooter will prove to be good
cameras despite their lacking software
but we wouldn't be surprised if this was
the one part of the device that we
weren't super excited about which brings
us to the software and Razer again put
some forward thinking into what they're
trying to provide in this device by
partnering up with a very popular
third-party launcher
that's right Nova Launcher premium is
going to be pre-installed on here so you
have all of the customization options
that Nova has already given people who
love it there are the typical green and
black color motifs throughout the
operating system but anyone that has
used nova before will know what to
expect
Android tinkerers are given carte
blanche to make it look the way that
they desire
so to RAZR this phone personifies the
philosophy that they've always had with
their gaming community uncompromising
specifications high quality offerings
and the ability to use their highly
stylized products to achieve a myriad of
tasks with that in mind they wanted to
make a phone that was made for gamers
even if it's not necessarily a gaming
phone but of course it could blow away
pretty much any game you throw at it if
you're looking for the highest
performance device ever then this might
be the phone you've been waiting for
with a large screen great specifications
and performance that can help you get
gaming productivity and media done
today's announcement of the razor phone
will also have another surprise
the price this phone could have easily
hit the $1,000 price point we thought
but instead the phone is priced at six
hundred and ninety nine dollars it is
available for pre-order on November
third on razors website and through
select ecommerce channels with the
phones making it to users hands around
the 17th keep it tuned to Android
authority for even more about the razor
phone and we can't wait to get our hands
on the review unit if you are a gaming
person this might be the phone you've
been waiting for but for everybody else
this phone was going to provide as much
as it can so you can enjoy it as well
keep you tuned to andrew authority and
we'll see what that result is and
