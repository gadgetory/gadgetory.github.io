by Toyota
while this comparison might be somewhat
skewed in terms of the size differences
we can definitely still see how Samsung
is trying to eclipse the top performers
in the mid-range tablet game
hey this is Joshua regard from Andhra
Authority what's going on everybody and
this is the Samsung Galaxy Tab pro 8.4
versus the Nexus 7 let's get the obvious
part out of the way in regards to the
sizes yes the Tab pro is the larger
device and thus does benefit from a
little more real estate for work in play
while we did get an update to the Nexus
7 from a soos that gave it more
resolution at 1920 by 1200 the proline
by Samsung brings a whopping 2560 by
1600 resolution to every iteration even
this the smallest of the Tab pro line
and in terms of material the textured
plastic that has given Samsung devices
new life in the eyes of those who got
tired of glossy plastic adorns the tab
pro while soft touch minimalistic
plastic makes the Nexus 7 quite the
stylish device in its own right
underneath the surface the differences
continue as the Nexus 7 sports the
Snapdragon s4 pro that might be a little
dated but still holds up very well tab
users who may have wished for more
high-end specifications in their tablets
can now move to the pro line for the
Snapdragon 800 or the ik c nose 5 octa
processing package for some great power
3 gigabytes of ram in the tab pro
Trump's the Nexus 7 as well but it all
goes to good use as this updated version
of TouchWiz keeps itself very busy in
software we obviously have a big
difference in user interfaces while the
Nexus 7 boasts the stock Android
experience that plenty of Android
purists Pine over it is definitely
pretty minimalistic and doesn't provide
for much more functionality outside of
the bare essentials however those bare
essentials are valuable in and of
themselves to be fair
TouchWiz finally got an update and a
refresh as the magazine UI as it is
called now we will see in the proline
allows users to create highly
customizable pages with widgets spaced
out on a grid making for a magazine like
interface that actually looks pretty
clean and is definitely functional on
top of all of this you can't expect many
of samsung's additions to be built in as
well such as the multi window for the
spec hungry it is clear that samsung's
new pro offerings will really fit the
bill because of their power great
display quality
and the many features that are built
into the software however there is the
matter of price now while we don't
really have any real final word
regarding the price point of the Tab pro
8.4 it is likely going to be quite a
premium over the affordable two hundred
and twenty nine dollar Nexus 7 now in
that case you might look at this as a
you get what you pay for a situation and
in the future we are going to take a
much harder look into these two devices
in a more full comparison but in the end
it does come down to what you really
need and what is clear here is that
Samsung in the new tab proline certainly
wants to try giving you everything they
think you want
once again this is Josh regard from
Android Authority telling you to keep it
tuned here for all of the best coverage
here at CES 2014 and once again thank
you to Toyota for sponsoring our CES
