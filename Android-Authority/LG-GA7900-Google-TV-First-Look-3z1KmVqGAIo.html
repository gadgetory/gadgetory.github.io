authority com we're here at CES 2013 in
Las Vegas at the LG booth and we're
going to talk about the new LG google TV
that LG is debuting here today if you
tell us a little bit about the new
features of the Google TV with a that
you're announcing here today absolutely
here you have one of the brand new
series of LG google TV this is DG ace
7900 this particular model features our
brand new cinema screen with a brand new
remote and this year just to elaborate a
little bit tell you what the options are
with Google TV we have two different two
different series the entry-level series
features 120 Hertz and edge lit LED that
when you upgrade to this series to get
the cinema screen plus 240 hertz and led
plus which offers local looming which
will increase your contrast ratio on
black levels now Ozzie is the UI on this
the same as the previous LG Google TVs
it's similar but we did add some new
features if you notice here we added a
new YouTube card which is great we know
everyone was to keep up with what's new
on hot on youtube so very similar to
what you used to on the YouTube website
you have access to recently featured
videos to most viewed and the training
videos if you notice here this user
interface is very well laid out very
easy to understand and navigate through
and that's one of the best benefits that
people really like about our Smart TVs
and of course our LG urltv I do see that
it comes with some premium apps such as
Netflix Amazon Instant Video which right
now is exclusive to LG I see it comes
with onlive for gaming and in plex for
those of you that aren't aware Plex
normally costs fear 3 4 5 dal or
something like that on the Google Play
Store so that's great those apps are
included now the remote has a microphone
and a correct for the new version 3
search features yes it does this remote
is LG's Magic Remote with porting
keyboards who you have a full keyboard
to browse the net and you have dedicated
buttons for specific functions like the
voice function and if you'd like I can
show you a few things with the voice
search yeah that'd be great yeah go
ahead no we'll try it out alright so
let's start off by looking for a website
let's say I wanted to look for espn.com
espn.com
it might be hard with all the background
noise because I said calm the television
knows that I'm looking for a website and
it goes directly to where I want to go
now let's say I wanted to watch movie
nightmare before christmas
now it's great is that this is now
searching the whole interface and it
links me to prime time which is you to
basically bring all that content
together and give me all of my options
bride on this screen so I would just
select watch and hear have all of my
options so it's coming on soon on hub I
can purchase hit or rented from Amazon
Google Play I can even watch it on
Netflix if I have our netflix membership
that's great and one of these going to
be available in store first quarter all
right great thank you very much this is
derrick rose with android authority calm
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
