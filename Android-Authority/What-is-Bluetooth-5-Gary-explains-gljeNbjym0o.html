authority now we've had Bluetooth since
the mid 1990s and recently the Bluetooth
special interest group released some
details about Bluetooth 5 now what is
Bluetooth 5 why is it a good thing and
when will we get it well let me explain
Bluetooth 4 comes in two categories
Bluetooth classic which is the Bluetooth
we use to power our keyboards and mice
and wireless speakers and Bluetooth Low
Energy
which is used for healthcare fitness and
for beacons so while a wireless keyboard
will be using Bluetooth classic a device
like the Fitbit will be using Bluetooth
Low Energy and that's because it hasn't
got such a high demand on the battery
now with Bluetooth 5 Bluetooth classic
remains exactly the same and it's
completely backward ly compatible so all
your existing keyboards and speakers and
mice will work with Blu to five devices
and that won't be a problem however the
big changes come with Bluetooth Low
Energy in Bluetooth 5 they've been some
big changes first of all it has a
greater range it has a greater speed and
it uses less power
now with Bluetooth Low Energy version 4
you're expecting an outdoor range of
around 50 meters and indoor range would
be around 10 meters of course that
depends on how many walls there are and
the construction of the walls and how
thick they are and so on
now with Bluetooth 5 that's been boosted
to 200 meters 200 meters line-of-sight
directly no obstacles in the way and
inside that means now around 40 meters
now I don't know how big your house is
but I'm sure that in my house everything
was in 40 meters of everything else so
this has a real boost for areas like
Internet of Things and for home
automation and even for home security
because now these devices can talk
wirelessly with a low energy consumption
amongst themselves in a 40 meter radius
and that's a
good improvement but it's not only range
that's been improved it's also the speed
now previously in version 4 of the Low
Energy Bluetooth specification the
physical Bluetooth speed was around 1
megabits per second now that's been
boosted to 2 megabits per second now
when I say the physical speed that's
because one by time you add on protocols
and arrow checking and so on
the actual data rate is reduced a little
bit but tests are showing that the
theoretical throughput for a Bluetooth 5
low-energy device in 1.6 megabits per
second but that's full duplex which
means in both directions so in a single
direction that's around 783 kilobits per
second however what that means
practically is again devices like the
Fitbit or other similar devices will
sync at least twice as fast but also it
means that there's maybe new areas that
can be explored now because data can be
sent quicker maybe video audio without
there being consider consumption of the
battery power and as I said there's less
power use now you'd imagine it with all
the extra range and the extra speed and
actually the power usage would go up but
because of some clever technology that's
including Bluetooth 5 including a better
use of the frequency different ways of
doing the modulation the actual energy
can be up to two and a half times less
depending on the usage situation so
greater range greater speed and less
power however there's also one important
extra thing that's been added to
Bluetooth 5 now in Bluetooth 4 there was
the idea of connectionless broadcasting
if you remember at the moment when you
use bluetooth you mainly use it by
pairing it you pair your phone with you
with your Fitbit you pair the phone with
the speakers you pay a computer with a
wireless keyboard and so on but there is
a mode in Bluetooth 4 that allows you to
have a connection less advertising and
this is aimed at the idea of things
called beacons basically little device
that can transmit Bluetooth information
in an area let's think about a shopping
mall for example maybe you go into a
particular shop and there may be a
Bluetooth beacon that will transmit
information that offers about having it
access to their online site or some lots
the possibilities that can be used you
can even go up to a parking meter and it
has a Bluetooth beacon that can tell
your phone how you can pay online for
example and there was a small problem
with the Bluetooth 4 version you are
only allowed to put 31 bytes inside
those broadcasting packets now in fact
there's no standard for how that 31
bytes is formatted and there are
different schemes available the moment
one is ibeacon from Apple and another is
Eddystone from Google which try to
define how those 31 bytes look on what
information they can contain now the
problem is when you add protocols inside
of that data package actually the amount
of space you can get in actual data in
there is even reduced even further
because you have to have bits of proto
say this is an ibeacon think this is an
Eddystone thing this is a URL business
text this is whatever and that takes up
space inside that 31 bytes and really it
takes around sort of 1011 bytes so you
drop it down to kind of even 20 bytes
even 17 bytes of available data now HTTP
colon slash slash and/or Authority comm
won't fit into 17 bytes so we couldn't
have a Bluetooth beacon that transmits
the annual thora T's website now the way
this was envisioned in Bluetooth 4 is
through the use of a thing called
universally unique identifier you you
IDs and these are basically 128-bit
numbers that were basically unique and
your phone could match itself up to a
unique beacon say alright I recognise
this beacon I know what it's about I
know where I'm coming from and maybe
inside a shopping mall the beacons would
be different between every shop inside
each department they would all be
different and their uniqueness means
they can be uniquely identified but then
it would require the phone to talk to
something on the internet to actually
say hey what does this unique number
mean what can I do with it
can I look it up can I use your app
maybe I'll install an app for a
particular shopping mall can I use the
app to find out what that means and
really just having that unique number is
powerful but really not powerful enough
and so the Eddystone standard from
Google not only allows you to produce
these IDs it also allows you to send out
URLs it also allows you to send
some encryption data if you wanted to do
some authentication stuff now 31 bytes
down to 17 bytes by technically is not
enough space however with Bluetooth 5
that has jumped from 31 to 255 bytes
even when you include the protocol
overhead that's a significant chunk of
data which means you can send out some
very sophisticated URLs so imagine you
got to a parking meter the parking meter
sends out a Bluetooth broadcast that
says you can go here and the URL is
formatted with maybe what floor you're
on what the parking meter number is what
time it is and all that data will be
sent through your to your phone you can
then go onto the web and you can pay for
a parking ticket
now imagine that for just about any
service or idea that you can think of
with all that data uniquely specifying a
single physical point now actually this
idea is being spearheaded by a project
called the physical web which Google
also involved in in the idea is that as
you go up to physical items you can have
a web connection an internet connection
that allows you to interact with them so
Bluetooth 5 will see a boost in the use
of beacons because it allows you to add
in that extra information now what I'm
gonna do now is show you a Bluetooth
beacon running on a Raspberry Pi and
it's only of course version 4 so you're
limited to that 31 bytes however it will
give you an idea of what's possible
today and where this is heading once we
get Bluetooth 5 coming now what I have
here is a Raspberry Pi 3 and it's been
pre-configured to send out Bluetooth
Eddystone broadcasting packets as you
can see there's nothing else connected
except for just the power so if you're
building a beacon all you need is a
power supply so what I have here now is
an app which i've downloaded from the
Google Play Store called beacon scanner
and when you start the scanning that
will pick up the broadcasts that are
coming from the Raspberry Pi over
Bluetooth and it's here as you can see
I've used a short URL because as I said
earlier those 17 bytes aren't enough for
the full Android EECOM URL if you tap on
the signal you'll get some information
about the data that's being broadcast
and then here at the bottom you can
actually
on the URL and it will open up the
website now if you go to an Enron
website you'll find an article that
accompanies this video and there i've
got full instructions on how you can
turn your Raspberry Pi 3 into an
Eddystone Bluetooth beacon so when we be
able to buy a Bluetooth 5 smartphone
well basically the specification itself
will be completed by the end of 2016 and
because of the changes that are
occurring there needs to be new hardware
this isn't a software only upgrade so
the chipset makers need to make some new
chipsets and they will be available
sometime during early 2017 and then once
those chipsets trickle through to the
OEMs will probably see products that
support Bluetooth 5 towards the end of
2017 so if you're looking for a new
smartphone at 2017 holiday season then
get one with Bluetooth 5 well my name is
Gary Sims from Andhra thority and I
really hope you like this video if you
did please do give it a thumbs up also
don't forget to use the comments below
to tell me what you think about
Bluetooth 5 - are you looking forward to
it coming do you think it's going to
revolutionize because you think it's
going to be revolutionized home
automation and the Internet of Things if
you want a more in-depth discussion I've
also got a thread going over at the end
or Authority forums why not come over
there and connect with me and we can
talk about the possibilities that
Bluetooth 5 present for us also don't
forget to download the Android or 'ti
app because that will give you access to
all of androids information directly on
your mobile phone don't forget to
subscribe to our and royalty YouTube
channel and last but not least go to
Andrew authority comm because we are
your source for all things Android
