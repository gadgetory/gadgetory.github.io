domain.com Oh I know you want to hear
about how Apple got slapped around in
court 862 million times Apple could be
on the hook for a substantial damage
payout to the tune of 862 million as a
US jury has found the company guilty of
making use of patented technology owned
by University of wisconsin-madison 'z
Wharf licensing arm without permission
the patent infringement in this case is
related to Apple's processors used in
the iPhone 6 Wharf also took up a
similar lawsuit against Apple last month
to target the company's latest a nine
and a nine X processors that are found
in the iPhone 6s and iPad pro Apple
failed to convince the jury that the
university's patent was invalid and have
previously tried to convince the US
Patent Office to review the patent but
this bid was rejected back in April and
