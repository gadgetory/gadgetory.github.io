many big announcements except for one
the update to LG's out-of-the-box
thinking smartphone that now in the
second iteration is addressing a lot of
the issues we had with the first one
which made us really excited to get our
hands on it and we finally did so it's
Josh magar from Android Authority what's
going on everybody and it's time to
unbox and give my first impressions on
the LG G flex 2 but before I even open
the box just take a look at it you got
this nice design around the actual logo
on the front it's got this red
coloration to it which makes me think I
might have gotten the red version and
it's really it's just a nice looking
package obviously they're putting a lot
into the G flex 2 and as well you can
already tell because the packaging
already makes you feel pretty excited to
open it but let's just go ahead and pop
it open right now thinking it's gonna be
the red and sure enough it is here is
the red edition of the phone
this is more like a well I mean I won't
really say a Ferrari red but let's just
say this is a different looking phone
that I usually get for review units I'm
used to getting black or white editions
but it is a nice change of pace to get
the red one alright some of the usual LG
documentation with some of their nice
Korean cartoonish icons in here and
obviously I won't be able to read this
entire thing much at all because it is
in Korean and a wonderful addition
always to a package like this some
really nice headphones the quad beats
are very good headphones by LG and
they're really nice to use and come
standard with the LG g2 at least in this
particular package so well just giving
you a quick unboxing right here we have
the red edition of of the LG G flex 2
and those are the contents we have in
the box this is a curved display
obviously one of the first that was
available in the G flex one and it goes
from top to bottom as you can see here
which allegedly and as we've seen an
hour in our time with the G flex one it
does help with the handling somewhat but
in the G flex 2 we have a smaller screen
the original iteration at 5.5 inches
this time which obviously was a
complaint that we had with the first one
and they did listen to the fans and to
the users of the G flex Wan and made it
more accessible in the G flex to the
update version of the GUI brings with it
some of the enhancements that lollipop
brought to Android in general including
this notification drop-down that has all
of these cards right here now I'm gonna
have a lot of notifications for the next
let's say half hour or so because my
internet connection and my Google
services are already installing all of
the different applications that I want
on here based upon my other daily driver
we also have the usual GUI aspects like
the page right here that will show you
some cards in order for you to learn
more about the phone we have the app
drawer right here that still has the GUI
aesthetic going through some of the
areas here for like the phone and then
of course we have some of the tutorials
that will pop up from time to time at
least in the first however so long I'm
using this phone and there you go
looking at the recent apps screen it has
the card motif there we can access the
dual window easily here and that is a
quick look at the software which does
look like it has a very nice feel to it
already it's gonna be a little bit slow
a little bit stuttery for now because
I'm going to be constantly installing
the applications in the background as
you can see that icon on the top left
there that is already working on getting
my applications on this G flex 2 I do
have to say that the handling is already
taking a very positive turn with this
curve on the 5.5 inch screen I'm having
an absolute blast already just getting
through all the elements it feels very
very much at home in one hand I can
easily get to the top here and bring
down the notification drop-down where
you have those settings already
available I already messed with the
brightness to make a little bit easier
for you to see on the video and really
this is an enjoyable phone right off of
the bat it feels different from other
other devices especially of the same
size the backing as you can see already
there already has a few fingerprints on
it it is a bit of
fingerprint magnet a bit smudgy from
time to time but we are dealing with
these self-healing back that has a
material on it that is supposed to heal
with pretty pretty minor scratches at
the very least anything deeper and it
will probably still stay there
despite its claims of self healing
within maybe a couple minutes so going
through all of the elements this is
going to be what I'm using over the next
few days before we get out our full
review but I will also put the camera
through its paces with a camera shoot
outs that may come before the review or
just right after but I will be testing
the camera out over the next couple days
and bringing you my thoughts on the
enhanced optical image stabilization
powered camera here with the laser
autofocus
which you can see right on the left side
of the optics but all in all I have a
very good first impression of this
particular device and I'm very excited
to put it through its paces
if curved displays are still not quite
convincing you well the G flex 2 is
hoping to be the one to make you think
twice about it we originally had a large
phone with the benefit of a top to
bottom curve but now we have a more
accessible phone at 5.5 inches with a
lot of power underneath in the
snapdragon 810 and a powerful camera on
the back this is a phone that's really
trying to do it all in a package that is
thinking outside the box and there's a
little bit different for those of you
who might be tired of some of the
tried-and-true designs let's say of
other flagship smartphones that being
said I'm very excited to bring you my
full review my first impressions like at
the first look at CES 2015 are already
quite good and ergonomically I'm very
excited to use this on the daily because
it just feels like a nice somewhat
lights but still very comfortable phone
to use and it does have to do a lot with
that curve so keep it tuned to for my
full review of the G flex 2 &amp;amp; 4 camera
shoot out some verses as well as this
week is pretty much going to be all
about this phone so I'll be excited
about all of that and if you are please
