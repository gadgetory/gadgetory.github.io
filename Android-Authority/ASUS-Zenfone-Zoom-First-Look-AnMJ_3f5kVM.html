Authority and is it a camera or is it a
phone well it's a little bit of both
this is your first look and hands-on if
the Asus zenfone zoom it's pretty clear
that the zenfone zooms main focus is on
the camera and from the rear the camera
optics makes the phone look like a
typical point-and-shoot camera but
switch over to the front and it looks
like your standard everyday smartphone
the phone is made from a combination of
metal and plastic with metal for the
frame to give it some rigidity and
plastic for the back which is actually
removable to give access to the micro SD
card slot and the SIM slot going around
the device the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack is up top microUSB port is on the
bottom and the right side houses not
only the power button and volume rocker
but also a dedicated two-stage camera
shutter button and a video recording
button
many of the zenfone zooms other specs
are very similar to the zenfone 2 that
came out earlier this year so on the
front you're looking at a 5.5 inch 1080p
LCD display protected by Corning Gorilla
Glass 4 and if it's anything like the
zenfone 2 S display it will most likely
be a struggle to see outdoors but should
get the job done just fine otherwise
inside the zoom is being powered by a
quad-core 64-bit Intel Atom chip with
four gigs of RAM that should provide for
some excellent performance and comes in
either 64 or a hundred and twenty eight
gigabytes of internal storage with
microSD card expansion for up to an
additional 64 gigabytes there's also an
embedded 3000 milliamp hour battery that
should allow the zenfone zoom to get
through a single day's worth of use and
possibly even more depending on usage
barring it doesn't suffer from the same
battery drain issues of the zenfone 2 of
course the big story here with the
zenfone zoom is the 13 megapixel camera
and as soos is quite proud of how thin
they were able to keep this smartphone
that they're CH outing it as the world's
thinnest smartphone with a three times
optical zoom lens with the three times
optical zoom you'll be able to zoom in
and snap a photo without losing any
detail and all the zooming is done
internally which means you're not going
to see any physical movement from the
lens on the outside the camera also
comes with OS and laser autofocus
which should help out in low-light
situations and makes for faster
autofocus as Zeus claims that the
zenfone zoom is going to offer a DSLR
like experience with a new super
resolution mode that can create shots up
to 52 megapixels and a manual mode that
allows for instant adjustment of the
shutter speed exposure white balance ISO
and many other pro level grade settings
but whether this phone can be good
enough to replicate the quality of it
digital our remains to be seen for the
software design film zoom is running on
Android 5.0 and a Seuss's Zen UI so you
can expect many of the typical Zen UI
features that we saw on the zenfone 2 to
be on the zoom including a pretty solid
amount of pre installed applications
that most people are going to consider
bloatware pricing is still yet to be
confirmed but the zoom will be coming to
Europe before the end of the year and
you'll have the color choices of either
pure black or ceramic white but that is
going to do it for this quick hands-on
look of the zenfone zoom and it could
very well be the perfect solution for
anyone looking for a smartphone that
puts the camera at the forefront as
always thank you guys so much for
