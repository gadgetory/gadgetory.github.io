Samsung Galaxy s8 it was announced here
in New York City and what a phone it is
there's a lot talk about like the
infinity display you have the Bigsby AI
but in this video I'm going to be
talking more about the Samsung decks
experience
there's a dip show off its brand-new
desktop experience with Samsung decks
which is basically a platform but you
actually have this dock that connect the
phone into and then you could have other
peripherals connected to it like a
display a monitor you have a mouse
keyboard so essentially your phone
becomes a computer since undid demo it
off and it's pretty convincing because
essentially you have a desktop
experience on your mobile smartphone so
what Samsung Dex is a platform you
connect your phone to this brand new
dock that they have and the dock not
only charges the phone
it also has ports like USB ports an HDMI
port you can connect a monitor mouse
keyboard so it gives you that desktop
life experience and when you run it it
looks like a Windows 10 experience now
if I don't one who owns a Windows 10
smartphone this is kind of similar
they'll probably scratch their head and
think this has been done before because
if you've used microsoft's continuum
experience on say the HP elite x3 you
know what it is it basically allows you
to tether your smartphone to a monitor
and also peripherals to have that
desktop like experience i did see in
action and so far I think it's pretty
convincing because everything pretty
much ran smoothly so you could write up
documents reply to emails you could get
the notifications and for the most part
it seems like the apps do scale up
something Microsoft applications have
been optimized so they make good use of
the real estate but there's a big but in
all this that Facebook kind of relates
to what we're seeing with Android on a
tablet side where many of these
applications haven't been optimized at
all so when you run them they look kind
of weird and funky so it's going to be
interesting to see how quickly the
developers can take advantage of Samsung
decks and optimize the layouts to take
advantage of the larger screen you're
going to be using then it announced
pricing or availability on the dock
itself but they'll probably announce
that very soon now all this is fine and
dandy and it's pretty convincing what
Samsung Dex is going to be able to do
because now you have your smart phone
you're at work you might have the dock
there so you're able to quickly
transition from the mobile experience to
the desktop one what Samsung is doing
here with Sam
that's kind of reminds me of the
Motorola Atrix from way back when
because that phone itself tried to do
exactly what Samson is doing here but it
didn't really catch on now advantage
with Samsung is that they have an
established base and we can definitely
see this platform enhance optimize as it
continues to grow so we're going to look
forward to see what happens so how do
you guys feel about Samsung Dax is it
going to be useful as it redundant let
us know so if you guys won't learn more
about any of the stuff I talked about in
this video you can check out our website
