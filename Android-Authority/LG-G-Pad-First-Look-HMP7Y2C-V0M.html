the tablet game but guess what today
they have had a hell of an announcement
hey it's Josh MacArthur manager
Authority what's going on everybody and
this is the LG G pad alright and here is
the G pad it's an eight point three inch
tablet created by LG you can already see
there that it has a bit of a unique
backing to it this is an aluminum
backing and here are the two speakers on
the back design-wise this is definitely
a labor of love for LG as we were told
they tried to figure out exactly how
wide a tablet had to be in order to be
comfortable but also allow for the
biggest possible type of screen at eight
point three inches that is the diagonal
measurement what we have here is 127
millimeters from left to right in terms
of that's what they found in terms of
the most comfortable type of screen to
have in one hand and still remain pretty
comfortable and you know what I have to
agree it is actually quite comfortable
it rivals the nexus 7 in my opinion in
terms of the comfort because it is
actually quite thin and allows for a
very very easily easy handling and when
I have it in 110 it really does just
rest there very well for an eight point
three inch tablet at 1080p this is
definitely one of the best ways for tip
for LG to get back into the tablet game
if a full HD screen here and it's just
really really vibrant very nice I don't
believe we are at full brightness and
it's just a wonderful display capable of
probably giving you a great media
experience the thickness is just it's
just about eight millimeters thick if
they come around the back you can see
that there is a camera up here and the
two speakers on the side along with a
slot for micro SD card
now what we're working with here in via
and the LG G pad is a Snapdragon 600
processor clocked in at 1.7 gigahertz
that allows for a lot of speed and a
question that was asked was why not be
800 well what we were told was that the
Snapdragon 600 allowed for just enough
power without draining too much battery
now what we also see inside of the
Optimus UI that is here in the LG G pad
or quite a few enhancements especially a
few of them which i have already here
the slide aside I have a couple apps
that are already open that if you have
the LG g2 you already know what the
slide aside looks like we'll open up a
memo three-finger swipe it goes over to
the side ready to be used later we'll go
to Chrome and slide that aside and one
more will do the calendar slide that
aside and then when you have all of
those apps over on the side allows for
quick multitasking because when you
slide back you have all of these apps
already ready on the side i'm going to
show you one last thing on the G pad
here and we're going to look at the Q
pair so what LG has been looking for is
a way to connect to the tablet to the
smartphone experience essentially what
the tablet will do is connect to the
phone smartphone say the LG g2 and it
will connect a lot of different services
from it to the tablet and back and forth
so for example if you get a SMS message
on your phone it will show up here as
well as a notification if you get a call
you get a notification as well and you
can also move Q memos back and forth
from them so if I had this and then I
saved it it would automatically move
over to the phone and save it onto there
so that if I was to go out let's say I
had a grocery list here or something I
would be able to see that on my phone as
i leave my tablet at home so that would
be the g pad by LG LG has returned to
the tablet game as you can see i'm
moving it around pretty easily in my
hands all right
so we're going to have a couple videos
or regarding the g pad against a couple
of the top tablets in the market
especially in its and around its size so
stay tuned to android authority for all
the action we're here at Aoife in berlin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
