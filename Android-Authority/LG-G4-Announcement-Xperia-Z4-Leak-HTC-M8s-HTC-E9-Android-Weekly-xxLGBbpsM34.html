brought to you by domain.com so if
you've ever had that dilemma where
you're wondering should i buy the new
phone is out right now or wait a few
months for a better upgrade well if
that's you right now you'll be happy to
know that today shows all about new
phones both mid-tier and flagships
alright so let's start off with sony's
flagship the sony xperia z4 a number of
alleged sony experience that four images
have been leaked recently showing off
the devices chassis although we've
gotten a pretty good look at what we
think the device is so far up until now
we have yet to hear much about the
devices internals but according to a
listing on gfxbench a new sony device
has made an appearance toting flagship
level specifications the device
codenamed sony e 6553 could potentially
turn out to be the company's new
experience at four flagship according to
the listing the device has a 5.1 inch
1080p display 1.9 gigahertz qualcomm
snapdragon 810 processor an Adreno 430
GPU 3 gigabytes of ram there's also a 20
megapixel rear facing camera and a
5-megapixel front-facing camera and the
device is running five point 0 point to
volley pop so keep in mind that this is
still really early in the game and many
things could change but if these are
accurate it looks like the Zed for might
just receive a spec bump anything else
Sony so LG is telling us in a cryptic
press release that we should be prepared
to see the great and feel great and we
expect the great LG g4 will be announced
officially on April twenty-eighth the
invite shows off what appears to be a
notebook or a device and bears the
tagline see the great feel the great
with Ag in the same font as the LG G
Series logo so what's the tagline
hinting out here it seems likely they
are planning some kind of visual change
one might think that the notebook may be
hinting at some kind of full leather
though it's just as possible it could
symbolize the company opening a quote
new chapter whether that's a metallic
design or the rumor of a premium g4 note
device honestly it could be just a
anything turning to the rumor mill while
some rumors suggest LG will go with a
premium metallic build at least one
rumor suggests LG will stick with
plastic saving metal for its rumored LG
g4 note it's still unclear if the more
upscale flagship will debut next month
alongside the g4 though LG has hinted
that such a device is really in the
works another possibility is that LG's
tagline could be referencing a switch to
a curved design as rumored by Korea
Times which would certainly make it feel
and look differently than g4s
predecessor now turning to HTC's new
offerings will start with the HTC m8 s
launched last week in Europe the new HTC
One m8 s looks identical to the one m8
on the outside sporting the same
metallic construction boomsound speakers
and duo camera set up the device is
available in silver gold and gunmetal
and is the same size as the m8 the
differences are all on the inside
instead of the quad-core Snapdragon 801
processor from the m8 the m8s comes with
an octa core snapdragon 615 chip which
we've typically seen so far a mid-range
offerings including HTC's own desire 826
another difference is the jump in
battery capacity to two thousand eight
hundred and forty million power
batteries compared to the 2600 million
of our batteries on the m8 that brings
the m8s in line with the flagship m9 the
camera on the mas is a 13 megapixel unit
featuring a depth sensor that allows you
to apply a few post-processing effects
like selective bluer the frontal camera
is 5 megapixels there is no ultra pixel
sensor here and that makes the m8s
similar to the china only 13 megapixel
One m8 i launched last year other
specifications include a 5-inch full-hd
display and are identical to the m8 the
MAS runs five point 0 lollipop with sent
six rather than new sent seven found on
the m9 thus far the MAS is only
available in Europe and is quoted at 379
pounds now if you were on the hunt for a
new phablet you may want to consider
HTC's 9 plus over the weekend HTC
quietly published an official
page for the HTC one v 9 plus like the
e8 last year the e 9 plus looks like a
cross between the m-series and the
desire series featuring a two-tone
plastic body the distinctive boom sound
speaker setup on the front and a large
camera positioned on the top on the back
continuing the hybrid theme the frame of
the device is actually metallic with
sham 'fred edges the three color options
are meteor gray classic rose gold and
gold sepia according to the HGC product
page the 19 plus will feature a 5.5 inch
quad HD LCD display that's 2560 x 1440
pixels and has a pixel density of 534
PPI now we've been having a lot of fun
