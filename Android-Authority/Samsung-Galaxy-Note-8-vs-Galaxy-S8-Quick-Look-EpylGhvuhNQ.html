everybody
and we're taking a look at the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 versus the galaxy s 8 now
Samsung smartphone range has grown
larger in more ways than one with the
launch of the Galaxy Note 8 today and at
first it kind of looks a lot like the
galaxy s 8 plus we wouldn't really blame
too many people for making this
distinction only that the Galaxy Note 8
comes with the s-pen however there are a
few different changes in the design
overall the note a just takes the galaxy
s 8 plus body and makes it just that
little bit wider taller and also that
little bit thicker the result is a phone
that seems quite more square than before
but it still retains the Infinity
display that put a 6.3 inch display onto
that body and makes it so that the
bezels are as minimal as possible so you
get pretty much all screen all the time
the note line also now takes on the
button layout that the Galaxy s8 line
has where there's no longer a tactile
home button or capacitive keys and now
you have a key underneath the screen and
soft keys but you can also press very
hard on the bottom in order to trigger
what is basically the home button now
the Galaxy Note 8 does retain the
fingerprint reader location that the s8
provided and it was a bit polarizing
it's a little bit hard to reach up there
and actually get to the fingerprint
reader but at the very least there are
other ways of unlocking the phone but
next to the sensor is one of the largest
differences we have now a dual camera
setup here on the galaxy s 8 the lens
and everything surrounding it is quite
square and sits between the heart rate
monitor and the LED flash with a
fingerprint reader on the right however
all this has been sort of consolidated
along with the second lens and it's all
housed in one large black area this area
is a little bit high contrast compared
to the non black editions of the device
blue gold and grey but overall the
design of the note a pretty much follows
the Galaxy S a its meaning you still
have the USB type-c port the return of
the headphone jack thankfully and of
course with the note 8 now we have the
Bigsby button which comes over from the
Galaxy S a line we mentioned the
infinity display and now you have a few
different sizes of the display to choose
from among everything in this comparison
the galaxy s 8 and the si+ had 5.8 and
6.2 inch displays respectively while the
Galaxy Note 8 is slightly larger with
6.3 inches in its screen all our Super
AMOLED quad HD panels and
or the 18 point five by nine aspect
ratios for taller but more narrow
displays than previous years and as we
also mentioned before having that
slightly larger screen also means that
the Galaxy Note 8 is a bit beefier all
around it is certainly heavier than the
galaxy s 8 plus by about 20 grams 193
grams to be exact compared to the galaxy
s 8 plus at 173 underneath that display
all of the main similarities the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor along
with the six gigabytes of RAM in the
Galaxy Note 8 put it as the premium
above the 4 gigabytes of RAM found in
the s8 line and of course when it comes
to the battery Samsung is taking a lot
of precautions to make sure the Galaxy
Note 8 does not continue the poor legacy
of last year's device as such the note 8
sports a 3300 milliamp hour battery
which is actually in the middle between
the Galaxy S state and the SI Plus which
had 3,000 and 3,500 milliamp hours
respectively now of course the main
thing that differentiates the note line
from the Galaxy S line is the S Pen and
it returns here with a number of
enhancements and one main new feature
you still have the ability to open up
the pen command menu and show pretty
much everything you can do with the
s-pen no creation smarts the legs and
even a coloring book if you want to pass
the time the main addition here is the
inclusion of a live message which makes
an animated gif out of the paths that
you make with your written word and then
with screen off memo which is a very
popular feature for the Galaxy Note line
you are able to make up to 100 editable
pages using the turned off screen
putting the s-pen back into its slot
however we can take a look at what
enhancements are made into general
software experience the Galaxy Note 8
now includes a feature that will help
multitaskers and it's called app pairing
multitasking or rather the multi window
has been used by a lot of people and in
order to make that easier you are now
able to create shortcuts that will
enable two different applications in
multi window automatically there are a
lot of different combinations for this
kind of feature you can have the
calendar and an email application or
YouTube and pretty much anything else
and of course the main additions in
software are going to probably come
through Samsung Bigsby which we have
been told will be updated further in the
Galaxy Note 8 so we will do our further
testing to see what Bixby can offer
after its evolutions
so we can go to the main story here and
that is the camera now the camera
experience of the galaxy si was lauded
as one of the better ones out there for
the 12 megapixel dual pixel camera at F
1.7 aperture however with the Galaxy
Note 8 you get the same type of lens
however it comes with a buddy now you
now have a 2 X optical zoom 12 megapixel
F 2.4 lens that provides that zoom
capability that gives this phone more
shooting possibilities one of the best
additions that Samsung has managed to
put into their dual camera however is
optical image stabilization found in
both lenses this dual camera setup on
the Galaxy Note 8 brings some new
features to the forefront you have the
live focus feature which now returns and
it's kind of front and center because it
adds depth of field effects to portraits
of either people or things there's also
a dual capture mode that allows you to
get the picture from both lenses at the
same time this might be most useful
during the live focus feature where you
can have the zoomed in image for a good
portrait with depth of field effects and
then the regular portrait using the
wider lens so you have choices between
the two overall the note line still
retains its position as the more premium
device in the galaxy line not only does
it provide the S Pen and it's really the
only phone that does so it also provides
some higher specifications over the
Galaxy S 8 and the s 8 plus that people
have probably been enjoying up until
this point if you have a galaxy s 8 or
an S 8 + chances are that the
differences might not be enough to make
you switch however if you're looking for
that dual camera or the S Pen those are
two big features that actually
differentiate these two lines of course
with the Galaxy Note 8 you really only
have a large display to choose from but
with the S Pen and the dual camera that
large display is going to give you all
of the real estate and the great display
experience that you need to enjoy those
features otherwise the Galaxy S a is
still a very easy to handle device that
is great for daily usage so let us know
