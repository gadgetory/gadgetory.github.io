calm we're here live at CES 2013 we're
at the intel booth and we're going to
talk about the architecture behind
Intel's processors if you remember a
year ago in Intel started heavily
entering the mobile market in television
alee said that Android wasn't ready yet
for dual-core processors or even
quad-core processors there's a new phone
rumored to be coming out lenovo k900 so
we're to ask what is entailed on or what
has happened with Android over the past
year to make quad cores viable on intel
processors yes so you know what we've
done here at intel atom is make sure
we've optimized with the OS and the
harbor for it we found a senior android
still running on a single thread
operations for both absolutely OS so
with our Intel and Metro power we
launched this past year I always devices
we have around us we're still utilizing
you know how do we optimize that
experience with unions just using single
threaded prongs of processing so two
things are going on for Nick generation
as well we're using two things hyper
threading and births technology so with
hyper-threading were able to do more
processing tasks at the same time on
each thread and losses get things faster
when the first technology we can do
another thing is ramped up a performance
get a test done and then ramped down
that allows us to do is it get
performance on quicker and the last
enough longer battery life well and
everybody knows they want to save
battery life and have a faster phone and
so forth yeah exactly exactly are we
going to see a lot more devices possibly
this year launching with Intel
processors mobile devices on Android
well we officially announced yesterday
are emerging market platform called
Lexington which also features the same
technology hyper threading and births
terminology on intel atom so last 2000
is a great great year and we're looking
2014 if you build the momentum what we
did with oriental Adam
great i look forward to seeing multiple
cores with intel hopefully coming soon
you know keep your eye out you know we
will we will be watching all right great
thank you I'm Derek cross with android
