promised for their new flagship the
much-anticipated LG g 6 that will have a
large screen with a small body they even
went so far as to say that it will have
true one-handed operation getting people
like me excited I know there's others of
you out there those of you who don't
love sasquatch size smartphones but then
you find out that LG is going to make
this a 5.7 inch display clearly
one-handed for Chewbacca ok so here's
the thing LG has officially confirmed
via the Korea Herald that its next
flagship the g6 will be unveiled at the
Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
februari 27th the company also confirmed
that the device will have a 5.7 inch
display with an aspect ratio of 18.9 as
well as a wide angle camera similar to
the g5 and the v series LG has recently
uploaded a video to its youtube channel
called wish list for the ideal
smartphone that hints at some of the
features we can expect from the upcoming
g6 in the video random people named
quite a few things that they like about
the ideal handset based on the video
people want a phone with a big screen
that's still compact enough to easily
fit into your pocket the device should
also be easy to use with one hand
especially when texting and come with a
waterproof body other features mentioned
in the video include reliability and a
quote capture it all at once which we
assume has something to do with the
camera there are other rumors
surrounding the specs of the phone they
claim that the g6 will come with a
Snapdragon 835 chipset 6 gigabytes of
ram a curved glass back and wireless
charging what do I think great sounding
specs sick sounding phone I'm looking
forward to it but am I the only one in
the world who is not always like this or
like this or like this I mean I hold a
dog leash I hold tea or coffee in my
hand I have a driving wheel in my hand
don't judge you while freaky do it
I mean I am always doing one thing with
one hand and phone in the other hand
come on who out there is going to give
us true one-handed operation unless you
want to go for the iPhone you're looking
at the Sony Xperia compact and it's a
fantastic phone I've bought three of
them but getting kind of boring same
style forever I mean there is the pixel
which is a little bit bigger which is
better for one-handed operation but
there are very few options it's a theme
that I've talked about many many times
in the show what do you guys think of
this g6 are you excited about it which
why the right foot would you bother
would you why diwata rabbit would you
rather wait for the s8 that's coming
down is there something else you're
looking forward to let me know in the
