by bitdefender mobile security LG has
also taken the shrink ray to its
flagship device but the story is not
quite as simple as you might think hey
it's Josh regard from Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is
your first look at the LG g2 mini as you
might be able to glean from the video
here but also from the first look at the
G pro 2 we have a little bit of a
different design element going on here
as the glossy plastic that somewhat
defined the g2 has been done away with
for a more matted design on both the
bigger and smaller versions of their
flagship device what we have here is a
very small phone at 4.7 inches in the
screen and also with a very light weight
of 121 grams this is definitely a phone
that is very easy to use in one hand and
is quite refreshing the display as I
said is 4.7 inches and is a qHD IPS
display that comes in at 960 by 540
resolution now you might think that that
resolution is a little bit lower than
you would want however what LG has was
very keen to tell us was that the g2
mini is not geared towards the people
who want the flagship specs inside of
just a smaller body they're looking to
create the g2 mini for a demographic
that isn't looking for the high
specifications and is an entry point for
all of those who want to get into LG's
camp underneath the surface we do have
two different versions of the LG g2 mini
that will support either the 1.2
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 but
also there is a version that is
available with the Tegra 4 I by Nvidia
clocked in at 1.7 gigahertz which is a
version we're very excited to check out
as far as the other bits go you do have
8 gigabytes of on-board storage on there
with one gigabyte of RAM and an SD card
slot to bolster that onboard storage and
as far as the battery goes it is a
removable 24 40 million power unit that
for a device of this size should be able
to give you some good longevity as far
as the camera goes as we do see two
different versions of the chipsets that
could be available in the g2 mini we
also see two different cameras from what
we can tell the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400
version will have an eight megapixel
shooter but the NVIDIA Tegra 4i version
can support a 13 mm
pixel camera as far as its functionality
goes it is pretty standard fare
especially if you've used any optimist
UI powered cameras in the past from LG's
camp and finally when it comes to the
software we still have the same version
of the Optimus UI that you will find on
the G pro 2 and updated in the original
g2 along with all of the enhancements
that LG is planning on putting into it
including the updated knock-on feature
called the NOC code which we had a lot
of fun using in order to easily unlock
the device in a very unique fashion
however the Optimus UI is in need of a
bit of a refresh especially considering
its in-your-face features that pretty
much take up a lot of the real estate on
the screen especially on a screen as
small as this you might find that the
Optimus View eye is a little bit much
for some we do see the value in LG
creating a device in the g2 mini that is
not necessarily the most powerful device
just packed into a smaller form factor
but is a device that many people can use
as an entry point into the LG line and
the g2 mini is a good representation of
what LG can do when it comes to their
great smartphones so keep it tuned to
Android a thority for all the best
coverage including our coverage of the
g2 mini and for the rest of the Mobile
World Congress here at Barcelona Spain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
