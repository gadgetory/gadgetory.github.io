that Android has to offer and on the
other one of the best that Windows Phone
has to offer hey strasburg are from
android re what's going on everybody and
this is the samsung galaxy s4 vs the
Nokia Lumia 928 obviously this is mostly
a battle of android vs windows phone but
until we get to the software this battle
is basically samsung and nokia the
samsung galaxy s4 sports the same tried
and true design as many of their
previous offerings most notably the
galaxy s3 despite being covered in the
plastic that many are growing tired of
the form factor of the s4 undoubtedly
makes it the best handling 5 inch screen
device today it's button layout is
standard with the tactile home button
and the usual Samsung power and volume
lay out the back is removable giving
access to the removable battery and SD
card slot in the hand it's balanced
lightness makes it as nimble as a device
of its kind can get over to the Nokia
Lumia 928 rather than take on the pretty
typical rounded look the 928 brings it
back to the more rectangular look we
don't see enough of rigid corners and
flat sides make it easy to grip with a
four and a half inch screen the entire
body benefits and is thus easy to handle
with one hand capacitive keys line the
bottom of the front and all the tactile
buttons are on the right side volume
power and two-stage camera button around
the back this white edition is accented
by the camera optics atop a black line
down the middle it is a phone that is as
easy in the hands as it is on the eyes
the Lumia is definitely a looker it is
simplistic in its black and white
profile but it's rectangular form makes
those colors pop but don't forget about
that great 5-inch screen on the s4 it is
still the best handling one out there
speaking of the galaxy s4 screen the
5-inch display is this year's Forte that
we might find that the ones found on
these two devices have more in common
than you may think the s4 display is
capable of 1080p resolution at 441 PPI
being a super amoled screen it brings
very saturated colors that are
thankfully customizable for those who
want to tone it down sharpness is great
and it handles all media beautifully
enter the Nokia Lumia 928 whose display
is a 4.5 inch 1280
ii x 768 display it also sports lowered
pixel density at 332 PPI these lowered
specs are somewhat expected due to the
smaller screen but pretty much everyone
will find the experience still very
enjoyable text might not be as sharp is
found on the s4 but the general users I
will likely not notice the difference
this display is also a Super AMOLED unit
bringing it the same color saturation
that this time greatly complements the
motif of Windows Phone 8 viewing angles
do suffer a bit in the 928 though as
angles bring a bluish hue throughout the
screen nonetheless it is a good display
that brings a color experience similar
to the s4 so it comes down to how hungry
you are for the specs if you need a
larger screen with a higher resolution
and pixel density the s4 fulfils at all
but if you aren't quite as picky the
Lumia should still please the
performance aspect might seem pretty
skewed Samsung outfitted the Western
galaxy s4 with the processor package
that powers the best out there the
Snapdragon 600 clocked in at 1.9
gigahertz and backed by the adrenal 320
and 2 gigabytes of RAM there's no
denying how fast this phone is and how
much multitasking you can easily get
done even if a number of users report
very sporadic lag it doesn't hinder an
otherwise good experience nonetheless
you may want to be on the fastest of the
cutting edge and thus the s4 is the one
for you on the other end the Nokia Lumia
928 sports the Snapdragon s4 plus a
dual-core variant of the same quad core
processor that powered some of the best
last year had to offer it comes in at
1.5 gigahertz and is backed by the also
lower Adreno 225 and just one gigabyte
of RAM now in the Android space all of
this would be considered mid-range but
what the 928 reminds us is not all user
experiences are created equal that's not
to say Windows Phone 8 is any better or
worse in use than Android it just
demands less the Lumia is still very
quick and smooth through its elements
and I have yet to over multitask on it
we'll get to the software soon but rest
assured that the Lumia sets out to do
what it needs to do and does it well
hardware is a story of what else can you
do we start with the Samsung Galaxy s4
and all of the different features we're
sure you know about already other than
having the all-important expandable
memory and replaceable battery the s4 is
able to measure or track pretty much
anything you throw at it
and ir blaster controls your TV while
sensors for temperature air gestures
hovering fingers or even tracking your
eyes made it into this phone it's
capable of a great deal of things and if
you need the ability to do all of them
then it stands alone in functionality
with the Lumia 928 what you see is what
you get but what you get happens to work
really well if the galaxy s4 is already
good at what we are used to and then
excels at trying to do more the 928 is
definitely a phone that excels at the
basics 32 gigabytes of RAM are available
here and almost all of it is open to you
with all the typical inclusions of Wi-Fi
GPS NFC and Bluetooth everything you are
already familiar with in a smartphone
comes with the Lumia call quality is
good on the Lumia as its speaker is
louder than the pretty standard
performing one on the s4 if you go too
loud though details in the call sound
will be blown out its rear speaker is
also louder than that on the s4 but it
suffers from the same problem go too
loud and there will be more noise than
sound the s4 is a functionality Beast
but if you want to just get back to
basics the Lumia is a fine choice the
batteries on both devices do their jobs
quite well the 2600 milliamp hour unit
in the galaxy s4 goes up against the
2,000 milliamp hour unremovable unit in
the Lumia 928 the capacity of the s4
battery is not only more than that of
the Lumia it can also take advantage of
spares in sheer usage however I found
that both batteries manage to get
through just about the same full day of
work power users may wish to take
advantage of spare units with the s4 but
either one will perfectly suit the
general user now we get to the cameras
both of which sit atop the game in
quality the 13 megapixel optics of the
samsung galaxy s4 are backed by an app
that holds a lot of functionality
underneath the usual point-and-shoot you
get a ton of modes to make your
smartphone photography even more
versatile like best modes drama and
eraser modes it's packed with quite a
lot pictures are generally very good
with nice detail and vibrancy despite
sometimes seems with too much color
looking a little bit washed out the
Lumia 928 on the other hand sports an
8.7 megapixel shooter but is backed by a
slew of enhancements carl zeiss optics
PureView stabilization and a xenon flash
Nokia look to make its camera arrival
the
best out there and spared no expense in
outfitting it with everything it needed
while the pictures aren't as large as
the s4 s they hold just as good quality
and lower light shots benefit from pier
view though having a xenon flash helps
too for more fun modes downloaded
add-ons called lenses can help with that
both cameras manage to pack good quality
into highly functional apps while the s4
has all of its capabilities baked in the
Lumia 928 can be further expanded
provided new lenses are consistently
created either way both cameras one way
capturing the moment pretty fun and
finally we get to the software and you
can pretty much tell how this will play
out Samsung packed a load of software
into the s4 with additions like s health
group play and watch on apps while they
all bring some new uses to the typical
smartphone experience the crux of the
additions lies within the navigation by
taking advantage of every sensor you
find new ways of getting around the
phone wave your hand or hover your
finger over something and you get more
out of what you are already used to
doing the s4 also benefits from one of
the largest mobile ecosystems the Play
Store has grown a lot over the years and
now houses some of the best and greatest
that are available to any user now if we
look to the Lumia 928 and it's Windows
Phone ecosystem it might remind us of
Android back in its early years not only
is there a real lack of variety in the
Microsoft Store it will still be a long
time before any real growth can be felt
by its users but as I said before what
the Lumia 928 succeeds in is what is
already built in baked in applications
are included because they are reliable
and work wonderfully the live tiles do a
great job of showing you extra
information elegantly even social media
presence is felt in the Windows Phone
integration sign into facebook using the
People app and you can look at the
newsfeed without needing the official
application the motif of Windows Phone 8
is supposed to remain stylish while
being very intuitive and one can argue
that a phone like the Lumia is perfect
for anyone who would otherwise get
bogged down by the sheer enormity of an
ecosystem like Android or iOS what you
see is what you get and you can get back
to the basics you'll get whatever you
need done in either phone it's more a
matter of how you want to go about it
and if you want extra ways of doing so
we end on price the galaxy s4 being
Samsung's flagship comes in at up to
seven hundred dollars for the base model
unlocked nokia lumia 928 with
lesser specs can boast a price tag of
499 the same goes for two-year contracts
as the 199 dollar s4 holds a premium
over the $99 lumia on contract and so
there you have it if you're looking for
the best that Android has to offer the
samsung galaxy s4 sits at the top among
the best it certainly gives people
wanting more out of their smartphones
exactly what they're looking for but if
you just want to get back to basics the
Nokia Lumia 928 with its Windows Phone 8
operating system definitely has your
back if the windows phone ecosystem can
get a pretty big boost it could
eventually become a credible threat to
the bigger dogs in the game but until
then us android users probably don't
have a whole lot to worry about and that
will just about do it for this edition
