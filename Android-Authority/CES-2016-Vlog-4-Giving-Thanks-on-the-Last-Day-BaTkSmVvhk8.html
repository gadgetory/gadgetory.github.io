I can't reveal too many details yeah but
Bush content update
so was your favorite part of CES me not
cool people yeah any products products
the wireless charging stuff from human
box that was dope and the 553 the vibe
and a lot of stuff from harm who could
it one of the gun eat em stick is left
yes the stickers is what what hey sorry
I was just curious if you got him
stickers left from on everything skies
okay I'm on that that's alright cool
thanks stinking still giving away free
sound like an awesome right we're just
all it up lined off I see what people
are like they just rated yet
we just have been really really busy
today I know it doesn't quite look like
we have but it is the very end of the
day and now we're just kind of unwinding
while we finish up everything that we
have to do and it was literally just
here's what became all right so as you
saw in that last clip we had to
transition because when the lights went
out so did the damn sound board that was
recording our podcast but it also
provided us with a unique opportunity
because now we're actually on our way
out from the house that was our home for
this past week or so and well it's kind
of a bittersweet exit and we thought
that we would redo our last question
that we were doing on that podcast
because it seems pretty apps for the end
of CES 2016 so here we are with our
banner from the booth that is now
completely dissembled disassembled
rather
android admiral in there
that's why I say it
I'm stupid vice decided to stay so you
can do more work ain't that right flies
I'd originally booked my tickets so I
could avoid this Here I am how much does
it cost you to rebook I can't tell you
the exact details that's pretty much it
lasts less than five dollars just less
than time doing this straight
guerrilla-style on Josh's GoPro he has
no idea CES so who josh is right back
there
all I can see em is that
but it's over
lovin LCC the booth is gone
CS 2016 in the books folks
Luke these fools working all hard but
I'm just fine on them with a GoPro the
Josh working all hard I'm just spying on
them with a GoPro
but the thing that I want to do is give
a quick shout out to all of you out
there who came to the booth there were a
lot of you whether your patrons of CES
or you are in the industry or your
fellow reporters and tech journalists
and youtubers you guys all made us feel
very welcome you know and it kind of
speaks so just how much you guys really
feel comfortable around us and we really
appreciate all of that so if you got a
shirt rocket if you got stickers plaster
that thing everywhere and if you came by
the booth hopefully you were able to
catch a picture with me or the team or
anything like that and you'll be seeing
that in the final vlog which I'll be
working on later today that might
actually come out at the same time as
this podcast you never know
one really special shout-out I want
Darcy to give the shout out to your
cousin who was here my cousin that yeah
so we didn't really know what the booth
until December eighteenth I don't know
how we got it to be honest but we did
and so had to learn about trust staging
everything inside panic it's Christmas
time it's our busiest month of the year
we're trying to wrap up our coverage and
so I called my cousin oh he works
broadcast radio down the victoria bc at
the q and he's just an amazing guy and
you know without his help and without
you know his amazing energy we wouldn't
been able to put the booth together we
would have been able to get you guys all
that great coverage and all the
auxiliary support he provided so a big
shout out to Christopher Loran love ya
alright great well you know what um I'm
sure we all feel the same way but I will
say on behalf of you know the people who
aren't here this has been one hell of a
week well on that sentimental note i
will go ahead and say keep it tuned to
our android authority youtube channel
and our website for all of the best
coverage from here and beyond especially
in 2016 where we think it's the year of
the hustle so keep it tuned here because
we are your source for all things and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
