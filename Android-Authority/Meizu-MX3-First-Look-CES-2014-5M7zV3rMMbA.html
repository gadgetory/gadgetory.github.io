what's going on buddy and we're here at
CES unveiled it is an event that happens
before the actual show of CES happens a
little bit later this week but here we
are and you see the hustle-bustle behind
me with a lot of vendors here a lot of
people looking at the great products
before the show even starts and as you
can see behind me we are here with me
zoo and they are showcasing the mx3 so
let's take a look at that all right what
we're working with here is a very
beautiful phone as you can see here we
have the glossy plastic all around the
actual device and in terms of the actual
design and the different elements that
are here on the mx3 the best way for me
to describe it is this is kind of what
an iphone 3 would look like add a 5-inch
screen and what that basically
translates to is a very attractive
device what we have in the screen is a
5.1 inch display with wonderful vessels
on the side that are very minimalistic
and it makes for a very very
attractive-looking front 5.1 inches
allows for a little bit more resolution
so we have an 1800 x 1080 resolution
screen and after that we also have an
interesting addition of the home button
at the bottom in which depending on
where you are in the operating system
there are some soft keys that appear and
the operating system itself is actually
very very nice it almost has that hollow
look and is a very very nice flat look
to it that makes this a very attractive
operating system to have it's called the
fly me operating system underneath the
surface there's actually a great
processing packaging here as an optic or
eight cores is in here in a phone that
actually isn't priced too high after
that there is two gigabytes of RAM in
the standard 16 32 or 64 gigabytes of
storage and after that there is actually
a chip inside that allows for even
better audio processing audio is a big
big deal when it comes to the MX three
for me so and is part of all of the
marketing that is
unfortunately we can't show you what the
audio was like on his phone but we are
pretty certain that's going to provide a
very nice experience so at 3,000 hong
kong dollars this phone actually comes
in at under four hundred dollars in the
US market now we're not too sure what
kind of impact it will have in the
Western market if it'll come at all but
it is selling like crazy out in Asia so
if you are able to get your hand on the
phone like this it actually provides
great performance at a pretty nice price
point so if Josh pegard android
authority we're here at CES unveiled
looking at the MX three by Museum so
stay tuned because we have a lot more
coming for you from here at unveiled it
for the rest of the week here at CES</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
