domain.com so it turns out that inbox by
Gmail will not only be reading and
understanding your emails but will begin
to reply on your behalf as well I know
you're thinking you may not know it yet
but Google's artificial intelligence
algorithms may be changing our lives
very soon ai is soon going to be able to
read and understand your emails and even
come up with quick replies you may
choose to send think of it as a very
basic personal assistant that can deal
with those pesky task of replying to
your petty missives it's called smart
reply and here's how it works to a eyes
work in tandem one quote reads the
emails and turns it into an algorithm
friendly vector that represents the
essence of the message the other then
reads the vector and comes up with three
distinct and grammatically correct
replies and the replies won't differ
just inform the AI makes sure that the
meaning of the reply is distinct as well
that may sound trivial but according to
google making sure the AI wouldn't just
rephrase the same idea was a real
challenge early on another challenge was
teaching the AI not to reply to
everything with quote I love you as a
phrase that it really favored in their
early days now that sounds really cool
and all but I got to predict that
there's going to be a problem a
two-tiered email response over time
people are going to know when Google
replied to their email and when you
actually wrote the email and you can
imagine how people are going to feel
when they know that you just allowed
gmail to do the work for you they may
not be that impressed now let's talk
about the rumors surrounding the heavily
powered Xiaomi me five according to a
recent tipster the Xiaomi me five will
be powered by Qualcomm's latest
Snapdragon 820 processor the chip isn't
expected to appear in devices until 2016
but that's not stopping companies from
announcing phones before then the rumor
also suggests that Qualcomm may
officially launched its latest mobile
chip on November 20th this month
Qualcomm has gradually been dripping out
little pieces of information about his
chip over the past couple of months
other rumored specifications for the
xiaomi me 5 include a 5.3 inch q
d that's 2560 x 1440 display 4 gigabytes
of ram a 16 megapixel rear camera and a
3030 milliamp hour battery either 16 or
64 gigabytes of internal storage but
without SD card support a different
report also suggests that Xiaomi may opt
for MediaTek Helio x 20 chip as the
Snapdragon 820 may not be available for
a while yet and let's talk about the
Huawei mate 8 and it's coming up real
soon Huawei is uploaded and new teaser
and there's little doubt about what the
company has planned but Huawei mate 8
looks set for an official unveiling on
November 26 and an event which will
presumably take place in China rumors
about the mate 8.2 a large flagship that
also aims to offer value for money we
are expected to see a 6-inch Full HD
panel at at least 3 gigabytes of RAM
with storage in the typical 32 or 64
gigabyte options we would assume that
the mate s force touch display
technology will also make an appearance
in Huawei's upcoming smartphone newly
leaked images which were apparently
snapped from a fox kong factory also
point to a metal frame for the handset
and a dual sim and microSD card tray
which is going to make many gigs happy
hallway may date is expected to be
powered by the company's own hisilicon
cure a 950 system-on-a-chip this chip is
rumored to feature an octa-core big dot
little cortex a 72 and a 53 CPU design
paired up with the mal ET 880 GPU and
other high-end features such as
high-resolution camera support and cat
10 LTE now if you don't speak geek that
just means the phone is expected to be
powered by some pretty bad aspects now
last up I wanted to talk about some of
the conflicting rumors surrounding the
Galaxy s7 s camera the first report
suggests that Samsung will try to make
use of sony's latest high-end image
sensor this features a twenty five
megapixel resolution and a very fast 192
point hybrid autofocus system this is
the same sensor that powers sony's
latest flagship the experience at five
range which currently tops dxo marks
camera benchmark but then another rumor
suggests that no samsung will go with
their own image sensor and i bring this
up because
memory capability is becoming a bigger
and bigger factor for you guys in
choosing which phone to buy not just
geeks like us but even normal people so
what do you guys think let me know in
the comments below the experience that
fives camera is sick let me tell you it
is fantastic so for those of you who've
had the galaxy s6 and compare that
camera to the reviews on the z5 what do
you guys think which one would you
prefer let me know in the comments below
all right you've got five more days to
come up with an Android related domain
name that is not currently owned makes
me smile and uses a dot-com now why is
that because no domain name extension
tells your story with the same degree of
trust as a calm or dotnet domain name
