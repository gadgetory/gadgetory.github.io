better known as the Motor City although
I'm not a gearhead I do have an
appreciation for cars it's in my blood
it's important as a car owner to be on
top of the maintenance and properly
understand what your car is telling you
by its performance or error codes today
we're taking a look at an O bd2 tool
that communicates directly with your
Android or Apple device I'm Kevin the
tech ninja this is the blue driver and
this is my review onboard diagnostics
better known as o BD has been around
since the early 1980s
it's a dongle that you plug into your
car and normally the port is located
under the steering wheel back in the 80s
it would just flash a light if something
was wrong and then you'd have to figure
it out this tool was mainly for
mechanics it was bulky and it had cords
coming out of it
starting with cars that were built in
1996 obd2 was the standard this provided
you with detailed feedback on what is
wrong and this is the standard for cars
today over this time period this tool
has evolved to become smarter and that
brings us here obd2 to bluetooth to a
mobile device is nothing new just
recently it's become completely wireless
Blu driver provides you with the dongle
and free application from the Play Store
installation is a breeze you find your
old DD port and plug it in there
once it is plugged in it starts to flash
blue when it's initialized then you
connect to the blue driver on your
mobile device via bluetooth settings
once you are connected open the
application the application then
searches in fines of the blue driver
once you are connected you are taken to
your main screen from here you have an
array of options from reading codes
clear and cold smog check and detailed
vehicle information okay so let's say we
want to see our vehicle info you click
on vehicle information and it takes you
to a new screen that has all the
detailed information from here we can
share this report beyond that each
section we go into provides us with
information relevant
to our car the next tab over is live
view this shows you detailed information
as it's happening
you can add dozens of different options
to that screen they show up in a list
view and they update in real time
although the live screen is nice and
detailed for some people for me who may
not know exactly what everything is it
becomes a bit much look I'll be honest I
don't know much about airflow but it'll
be great to have a more detailed
breakdown on what each section means and
what are the average readings so I put a
parrot against something otherwise I
don't know if my car is behaving
correctly or incorrectly it's sort of I
have to figure out what the reading is
and then look it up if I think there's
an issue the last tab is the more tab
now there are things in here like user
manual update firmware and more settings
the user manual is video based the
videos appear to be a bit static and
boring but they provide you with enough
information that you need it was a
tremendous help to me during my time
with the blue driver I just wish the
videos had a bit more life to them
although my car has no error codes I did
test it on a car with a check engine
light we found that the problem was an
evap issue we googled the error message
I found out that was caused by a faulty
gas cap we then replaced the gas cap
deleted the error code and turn the car
back on so that alone right there saved
us a trip to the auto store or even a
mechanic I found a $100 blue driver to
be simple and clever the application on
the surface appears to be bare-bones but
once you dig into the menus and
customize the live view you can have all
the information you need at a glance if
you're a mechanic or truly understand
the ins and outs of a car this is a
no-brainer this should be something you
find in your tool kit on the flipside if
you're like me and really don't know
much about cars this will let you know
that you may be having an issue with
your vehicle this also allows you to
research it however the live view may
not be that useful to you but having the
ability to download a detail report for
your car and emailing it to someone
could be pretty big
I've used cheaper dongles out there and
they work pretty much the same for
Ronald four for the price just sometimes
finding that adapter support could be
pretty difficult
I had a search for applications that
were compatible with my adapter and that
alone made it a chore
and I actually had a returned one and
buy one that was compatible with the
application so having an application and
hardware pairing upfront does make
things a whole lot easier
overall it accomplishes the goal that it
sets out to do provide detailed
diagnosis of your car directly to your
mobile device as always guys my name is
Kevin a tech ninja make sure you like
this video subscribe to this channel and
also give me a shout on my youtube
channel it's the tech ninja and also
talk to me on twitter at tech ninja
speaks as always guys i'm kevin the tech
ninja have yourself a great day
this is android authority your source
for all things Android take care guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
