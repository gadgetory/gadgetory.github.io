its latest smartphone into this year's
group of flagships it's Joshua regard
from Android authority what's going on
everybody and I'm reporting to you live
from New York City with your first look
at the LG g4 given the different leaks
that we've seen recently the new leather
backings were already expected but more
on that later the device we got ample
time with was a titanium finished
plastic build if you don't want one of
the menu leather color options there
will also be a gold version and a white
ceramic finish plastic available give an
LG success when it comes to curved
displays it shouldn't come as any
surprise that the g4 sports one but it's
really subtle subtle enough in fact that
the g4 will benefit from the durability
afforded the Flex line without having a
pronounced curve with a 5.5 inch display
the g4 takes some of the best aspects of
the previous two releases including
their signature rear facing button
layout that is easily hit by the index
finger
they'll distinct in the middle struck us
as just a little bit showy the leather
actually gives the g4 an enhanced feel
it is sourced from actual cows and is
vegetable tanned to give a warm look and
an authentic feel plenty of colors
including black blue and yellow will be
available for the leather backing with
even more coming in the summer the
leather is also supposed to keep the
back pretty cool to the touch closer to
skin temperature no matter what
temperature environment you are in and
the best part all of the backings are
removable which means a 3000 milliamp
hour replaceable unit and a micro SD
card slot that you might need for camera
specific features are inside LG is
tackling the Super AMOLED displays of
the world with an enhanced version of
their already well-regarded IPS panels
what we have here is a quantum display
aptly named because the RBG coloration
is achieved by passing colors through a
specific phosphor layer quantum physics
they said their focus however was on
making the quad HD display rival the DCI
standard that is found in general
television and cinema whereas the Super
AMOLED display might over saturate
colors a bit past the DCI standard the
LG g4 quantum display hits 90% of that
mark now we didn't see any problems in
our short time with the g4 display
experience though the immersion achieved
in the G flex 2 is no longer observed
obviously because the curve is more
subtle now which brings us to
performance where the LG g4 is the
result
a very close relationship with Qualcomm
the Snapdragon 808 with three gigabytes
of RAM powers this phone and has been
optimized as much as possible 4G for
operation much like Samsung did with
their in-house XE knows the Snapdragon
808 is cater specifically to the needs
of the g4 and I am happy to report that
the phone moved very smoothly in my
usage though we might not have had the
best time with the G flex 2 in terms of
performance such is not the case thus
far with the g4 and that's a good
development already mentioned before is
the removable back that means the LG g4
sports a couple of features many current
flagships actually lack replaceable
battery and expandable storage LG claims
that the battery life can get close to
20 hours of talktime and close to 95
hours for music playback but we'll look
forward to our full review for those
actual tests what we're really excited
for as usual is the camera which LG put
a lot of work into AF 1.8 aperture
package 1ups the competition and also
includes a larger sensor than plenty of
the others found in flagships today OAS
has also been enhanced with a wider
stabilization range and color has been
given a big focus with LG adding in what
is called a color spectrum sensor found
right next to the optics that will
analyze the scene to help achieve the
right white balance automatically and
accurately so far colors on the photos
look good but we will obviously test
this out with our own unit in the future
now what's really great is the manual
mode which is another big story as LG
has put in all of the big features
photographers usually get in full
cameras a full white balance gamut a lot
of ISO stops manual focus even a
histogram and even the ability to shoot
raw and JPEG simultaneously which would
definitely require the expanded storage
option the g4 camera looks really robust
and might be one of its greatest sells
and finally in software we have a very
familiar user interface that has been
optimized in our short time with the
phone lag and start over very minimal
even if the look of the GUI hasn't
changed much additions in the OS include
an enhanced calendar that can save
captures from most parts of the phone as
reminders on dates and a more powerful
gallery application that among other
uses groups photos into memories
categories for an easy way to look back
on your photos of worthy mention is LG's
continued relationship with Google as
the g4 will sport an
almost Nexus like experience as they
said chrome is the default browser
Google Drive is integrated across LG
Apps and plenty of LG's applications
already work well with Android wear
not to mention a free 100 gigabyte
Google Drive storage option for two
years and so there you have it the LG g4
likely to be priced similarly to the LG
g3 adds own launch and do out by June
we've seen companies rethink that our
smart phone philosophies and then others
simply refined the established formula
LG seems to be doing a bit of both
making a phone that can be a fashion
statement a powerful camera companion or
even a mini theatrical experience due to
the quantum display well might excite us
the most though is that the LG g4 quite
possibly can be all of these things at
once
stay tuned for even more from our
coverage here in New York City here at
the LG g4 launch at Andrew thority</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
