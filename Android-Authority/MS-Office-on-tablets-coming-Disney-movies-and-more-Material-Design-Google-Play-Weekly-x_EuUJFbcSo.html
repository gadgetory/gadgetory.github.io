Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly this
week we're going to talk about amazon
instant video on the chromecast
microsoft office even more material
design and a little bit of call of duty
let's get to it first up this week
Microsoft has released preview builds
for their Microsoft Office app for
tablets it's been a long time coming as
one of the primary complaints about
Microsoft Office has been that it
doesn't support tablets the preview
builds are available on Microsoft's
website and that means an official
release likely isn't far behind they've
also integrated the application with
Dropbox and that's kind of a big deal
since so many people use Dropbox good
for you Microsoft to keep up the good
work there have been rumors on the wind
that say that Google is about to release
a new service called google co presence
sometime soon google co presence is a
service that allows people to transfer
large files between one another very
quickly there have been some hints about
it in the Google Play services
application and other places like the
patent office we have no idea when this
will be released and we don't know what
kind of tech it's going to use it could
be web or Bluetooth but I don't think
it's going to be NFC because Android
Beam already exists but I could be wrong
stay tuned because we'll have more when
this is a thing that exists google has
announced that micro SD card support
will return an Android lollipop this is
a huge deal because micro SD cards were
severely limited when KitKat came out
and it made a lot of people angry
apparently google has listened and has
added full micro SD card support back
into Android lollipop as long as you
give that app permission to have it
thousands of applications that were
broken will now be fixed and we can
begin to forget that horrible miss have
ever happened thank you google Disney
and Google have teamed up to bring us a
new application called Disney movies
anywhere which will officially be the
spot for getting your Disney movies with
this application you'll have access to
over 450 Disney Pixar and Marvel movies
there is no subscription or anything
like that's because it acts more like a
Disney movie storefront than anything
else you do get a free movie when you
sign up which is nice and the rest you
can buy and stream from pretty much any
device there is also some exclusive
stuff that you can't find anywhere else
it's free to download in the Google Play
Store and so far it's had fairly
positive reviews
in our last bit of news this week Google
Calendar gmail and google maps have all
gotten their material design updates
Google Calendar got a complete material
makeover which is just fantastic and you
can now see maps for appointments with
locations as well as the ability to grab
reminders from gmail if you give it that
permission gmail also got a material
design overhaul the added ability to add
more than just gmail accounts and more
although it hasn't started rolling out
to the google play store yet we do
expect it to soon google maps also got
updated and it now has material design
uber integration and open table
integration so who wants to see some
trending applications as usual if you
want to check any of these applications
out you can find the links in the
written companion which is in the video
description below pushbullet received a
pretty significant update this last week
it comes with more material design and
overhaul of the UI layout and a more
stable notification pushing service the
last time we talked about pushbullet it
had just given users the ability to send
texts over their computers using the
browser extension if you haven't yet
give pushbullet a try the call of duty
advanced warfare was recently released
and with it came a companion app for
android with this you can engage in clan
wars to compete for in-game loot manager
clan great clan emblems and more clans
stuff it's totally free with no in-app
purchases which is frankly a refreshing
change in the companion app paradigm the
app does seem to have some issues and we
hope the developers get that sorted out
eventually Rolf animator is an animation
application that allows you to draw
things and then those things can come to
life it's a really basic animation app
so you won't find the most advanced
features out there but you will find
enough to have some fun it's highly
recommended to use this app with a
tablet and a stylist because using it on
a phone with your finger is a little bit
rough with angry birds transformers has
finally rolled out to the google play
store for everyone to download we know
that another angry birds release isn't
the most exciting thing anymore but this
game does have some pretty fun game
mechanics and it has a 4.5 rating after
a hundred and eighty thousand reviews
which is pretty impressive it's free to
play with in-app purchases if you are
interested the prime cast is a new
application it allows you to cast amazon
instant video to your chromecast it is a
very early release so there are some
bugs here and there like I had to sign
out and sign back in before
showed me my watch list otherwise it
works pretty well and we're looking
forward to seeing how much better this
can get especially because it shows up
such a huge weakness in amazon instant
