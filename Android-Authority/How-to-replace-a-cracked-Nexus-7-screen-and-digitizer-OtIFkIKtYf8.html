here with Android authority calm your
number one source for all things Android
and today I'm going to be showing you
how to save your Google Nexus 7 from a
most certain debt by repairing a cracked
screen and bad digitizer sit tight and
we'll walk you through the tutorial step
by step show you exactly how to do it
you'll have a functioning tablet in no
time
so to start off we must remember that a
cracked screen and a bad digitizer is a
pretty serious issue and if you don't
feel up to repairing your tablet
yourself please seek the help of a
professional we mean this video only for
reference and we can't be held
responsible for any damage you may incur
that being said let's get into how to
repair this bad boy we're going to need
a few tools the first one being a small
prying tool I'm going to need some
screwdrivers as well and a guitar pick
or similar prying to let that we're
going to be using those tools to remove
various pieces of the Nexus 7 starting
with the backplate we'll start with our
small prying tool we're going to work
along the top the left the back and then
finally the right side I'm going to go
ahead and try and pry open the top right
corner and I'll in fact use the small
guitar pick because it's fairly easy to
do in fact you can do this with your
fingers if you don't have the tools and
once we have a small cracking these case
we can just go ahead and continue prying
it open as I said we'll work our way
down the left of the device near the
power and volume buttons and we can in
fact slide the tool down to separate the
shell completely now the backplate is
solely that we can set that aside for
now and work on the motherboard and
display alright next we're going to
remove the battery or the power source
from the Nexus 7 and we're going to rock
the cable left to right to remove it
from the motherboard I'll start at the
right then left
we simply rock back and forth until the
cable removes from its connector once it
removes we can set it aside for the rest
of the install because we won't want the
device to have any power whatsoever next
we'll work on the black tape that's
holding down the LCD connector and we
can simply pry that up with our spudger
or a flathead screwdriver you just want
to be careful of the motherboard of the
device and not puncture the board itself
or ruin any of the circuitry
now once the black tape has a little bit
of an edge you can simply
with your fingers as well and pull it
back and if you happen to lift up the
small metal cover that covers the
components that side not aware you can
leave that aside next we will work on
removing the LCD display cable and we're
just going to work our little sputter
under the cable and pry upwards it
should give fairly easily and then we
can move it out of the way for the rest
of the install simply bend it back then
work on the two other ribbon connectors
here and they have pressure clips that
we can lift up from behind
we simply pry that upwards on both
ribbons and we can slide them backwards
now those who remain out of the way for
the rest of install as well as we get
started on removing the screws that
surround the body of the Nexus 7 then we
simply go out those with a Phillips head
screwdriver and when we reach our final
screw we can simply remove the
motherboard from the LCD panel now the
bezel will be attached to the LCD panel
as well but we'll simply grab the
motherboard and guide it outwards and we
can set that aside for now because what
remains is the LCD and digitizer now the
LCD and digitizer is connected to a
bezel and if you didn't buy a full new
bezel and only the LCD and repair you'll
want to be careful of the Pogo connector
because you'll have to get that off
intact as you can see here but what
we'll do is use a heat gun or you can
set it in the Sun to remove the adhesive
tape that connects the panel I chose to
set my device in the Sun as I didn't
have a heat gun but it worked perfectly
and after 30 minutes there is some give
to the adhesive so we're just going to
want to gently work our way we can use a
little tool as well but once there's a
little bit of give we can work away
around the perimeter of the tablet and
remove the adhesive and the goal here is
to remove the panel without breaking it
since there are cracks most likely and
also to save the adhesive tape so we can
connect the new one and as I work around
here I'm just working to make sure the
adhesive does not remove its
from the actual bezel is a fairly easy
task but you want to take your time
and as you can see I'm just being very
wary right around the cracks of the
screen where they reach the perimeter
you'll want to make sure the glue is hot
like I said I can't stress that enough
if the glue is not hot you'll get a lot
of glass on your bezel that you'll have
to pick off later but if you have a
successful removal you should not have
any glass in the bezel whatsoever and if
you do you'll need to clear it out we'll
check for that in a minute so you can
see all the sticky tape is still on the
bezel and the Pogo connectors are intact
and as you can see our display is still
very much intact it was a fairly clean
uninstalled I have minimal glass on the
bezel still as you can see there is one
small chunk and you'll want to actually
go through and make sure there are no
chunks of glass on there because that
will incorrectly seat or it can damage
the brand new display and we can simply
pry those out with a small screwdriver
and make sure it's clear after that
we're just going to simply line up the
new display and insert it into the bezel
okay next we're going to reseed our LCD
connector ribbon we're just going to put
that back in this connector here and we
can use a small tool to help us shimmy
it in there from the left and the right
you can also use some of our original
copper heat shield from the display that
we removed
I'm going to receive mine with that will
then take the rest of our Nexus 7 body
including the motherboard and reseed it
to the new display I'm just going to
want to line up the LCD connector cable
and make sure that comes out on top
there and work our way down then we'll
just make sure we have a tight fit make
sure it's seated properly and then we
can put screws back in the perimeter of
the device
and after reassembling everything
exactly how is dissembled we will have
the moment of truth the power on test or
you see if the display is actually
functional and we'll see if the
touchscreen is responsive see it boots
up to the Google screen there and we'll
just let it run through the cycle of
boot up so looks like the touchscreen is
in fact responsive that means the
digitizer was correctly replaced then we
can login and Wi-Fi and proceed to use
our Nexus 7 like new now I'll provide a
link for a brand new replacement screen
and digitizer but make sure you're
getting exactly what you need and if you
have any more questions please feel free
to leave them in the comments section on
reply as soon as possible
anyways guys thank you so much for
