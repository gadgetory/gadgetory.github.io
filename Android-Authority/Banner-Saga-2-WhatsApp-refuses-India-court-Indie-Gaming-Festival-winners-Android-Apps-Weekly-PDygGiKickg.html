Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 160 so let's roll that
intro and get right into those headlines
in a little over a week Google aloe has
been downloaded over 5 million times the
controversial texting application has
been on everyone's tongue and despite
some warnings from the privacy community
people are still eager to try it out on
their own of course we don't know the
active user count right now but we're
betting it's not over 5 million just yet
last weekend it peaked as the number one
most downloaded app in the Google Play
Store whatsapp found itself in some hot
water this week after a judge in India
told the company to delete all the user
data from people who opted out of the
apps privacy policy before September
25th the company has refused so far
stating that this ruling does nothing to
hinder their plans moving forward this
comes in the wake of whatsapp announcing
that it would start sharing user data
including phone numbers with Facebook
which has understandably pissed a lot of
people off the developers of here we go
are starting a new platform to help add
live traffic data to the app what
they're trying to do is make it so that
here records things like car location
and speed along with other sensor data
to show traffic patterns think like ways
but without the users having to input
anything by themselves cars with this
feature can also transmit data like when
the wiper blades are on indicating rainy
conditions it's actually kind of cool
Ubisoft purchased the moderately
successful developer studio catch app
this last week ketchup is known for its
hit game 2048 which was essentially a
ripoff of the game threes the developers
have been highly successful even if
they're not known as the most original
developers out there pretty much
everyone with a brain has probably
guessed that Ubisoft and ketchup will be
working to make even more mobile games
in the near future google announced the
winners of their first annual indie
gaming festival this last week among the
winners were orbit a game about gravity
numboat jumbo which was a puzzler and
bit blocks which was another puzzler
there were also a handful of games that
were selected as runner-ups they should
all either be in the Play Store or
released here in the near future and we
even talked about orbit and our best new
android game segment which aired last
week lego harry potter are two new
android games that tell the complete
harry potter story the first game
focuses on the first four years of harry
potter story while the second game
focuses
on years 5 through 7 they both play more
or less the same way and they can both
be classified as platform puzzle games
the first title seems to have a few more
issues than the second title so if you
buy these make sure to test them out
inside of the refund time they're both
four dollars and ninety-nine cents with
no in-app purchases Firefox Aurora is
essentially the developer channel for
Firefox browser this application allows
you to check out the newest upcoming
features and the latest experimental
builds it works as a browser and you'll
be able to do most of the stuff that you
can usually do on a browser however it
is experimental which means there will
be crashes and hiccups here and there
it's been around for a while but it's
now officially available on the google
play store in case anybody wants to
check it out anybody who does should
keep in mind that these are not stable
builds ludi dungeon is the latest
free-to-play puzzler out of yoda won
games makers of the famed across erode
this is a simple and adorable little
dungeon crawler where you'll go from
room to room to kill bad guys find loot
and avoid obstacles it uses the same
graphics engine as prior Yoda won games
so there's nothing new there however you
will find eight bosses to defeat 50
heroes to collect and an infinite number
of rooms to run through it's a freemium
game but so are all the other ones by
this developer news Pro is the latest
application out of Microsoft's garage
project this application allows you to
create a giant personalized newsfeed
based on your interests the way it works
is that you log in using one of your
social media accounts the application
then gives you a starting point and you
can customize further from there you'll
be able to add and remove topics as you
see fit until you get the news that you
want it's suffering from some early
release bugs and it's not overly
intuitive but it's worth a shot if you
want to try something different banner
saga 2 is the latest in the banner saga
franchise it's a strategy RPG with
beautifully done hand-drawn graphics and
a storyline that revolves around Vikings
like its predecessor this game will
definitely rank among the best strategy
RPGs out there your in-game decisions
will affect the storyline and character
deaths are actually generally permanent
it's one of the better produced mobile
game franchises out there and it should
be well worth the 499 price tag finally
we released a huge update to the android
