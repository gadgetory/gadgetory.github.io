answer its android authority qa4
September for 2013 our first question
this week comes from our who asks when
will the LG g2 come to sprint it looks
like the g2 should be coming to verizon
and AT&amp;amp;T around the middle of this month
there's no official word on when it will
come to sprint but I'm thinking it'll be
sooner rather than later on a sarah asks
if I benchmark my phone with an 22 and
get a result can this result get higher
or lower over time does it change yes
and to two scorers change like crazy
which is why when I review a device I
actually run it ten times in different
situations and then come up with the
average it can also change from a
firmware update or software upgrade for
example with the nexus 4 we noticed that
antutu scores were higher on the nexus
for running 4.3 then they were on 4.2
though Lev says hey Chris I'm getting a
nexus 7 HD and Nexus 4 after your
recommendation a few days ago for an
android phone for two hundred and fifty
dollars would you use the stock google
rom or would you recommend replacing it
with cyanogenmod or paranoid android
since you're already running stock
android i personally wouldn't recommend
switching to a different rom for one you
can always customize your phone using
different launchers and since they're
both Nexus devices you'll be getting
updates as soon as they're ready the
only time I would really recommend
changing to a different rom is if it has
a feature that you just can't get
otherwise Thomason omkar had similar
questions asking will the Moto X be
coming to the UK and when will the Moto
X be released internationally so far
there's no official word on the Moto X
outside of the Americas specifically in
the UK if you go to motorola's UK
website there's a message that says
we're working on something new so it
doesn't seem too likely that it would be
the Moto X I'm shul asks what according
to you is the ideal screen size of a
smartphone obviously this is just
opinion and not that long ago I probably
would have said something smaller but
with
bezels shrinking I would say around four
and a half to five inches is the sweet
spot it's big enough that you can watch
movies comfortably but at the same time
you can actually fit the phone and give
your pocket Alex asks hey Chris what are
your thoughts on AMD and intel mobile
processors do you think they'll be
working with Samsung HTC and other
companies I think Intel especially is
going to start doing this more and more
they're already working with a few
companies and as their chipsets prove
themselves I think we'll start to see
them in more and more funds AMD on the
other hand has basically said yeah we
might do this if somebody asks us as
they seem to be focusing more on Windows
8 which might not be the best tactic
given their current market performance
shadaab asks hey Chris what are your
thoughts about the upcoming sony xperia
z1 honami with its massive rumored specs
isn't going to beat phones like the note
3 and the LG g2 well you're right it
certainly does look like a beast of a
phone well a beat the g2 maybe we'll it
beat the note 3 at least in terms of
sales probably not Sony just doesn't
have the buzz around that Samsung does
right now now if we're talking
performance and usability well we're
just going to have to wait until we
review it and that about wraps it up for
