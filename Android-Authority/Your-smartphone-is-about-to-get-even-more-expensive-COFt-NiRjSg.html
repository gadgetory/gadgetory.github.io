I don't think anyone can deny that back
when Apple introduced the iPhone 10
everyone was screaming when they
announced that it was going to be $1,000
but since then the price of $1000 has
pretty much become the norm for a
flagship smartphone and unfortunately if
you live in the u.s. that price might be
going up even further now basically the
gist of the situation is this last year
the US in China engaged in a trade war
though this means that both of them tax
imports coming in from either country in
the US this started with aluminum and
steel but it expanded a lot into three
separate lists eventually the u.s.
started putting tariffs on individual
electronics components like PCBs and
touchscreens but here's the thing these
lists didn't include fully assembled
electronics like your smartphone or a
laptop now most of these tariffs only
really affected the businesses that were
bringing in individual components to
United States from China most big
companies assemble smartphones laptops
and other electronics in China and then
import it into the United States so it
didn't affect them quite as much but
there is a fourth list of products being
introduced which pretty much blankets
the entire electronics industry and it
could go in motion as soon as July 2nd
if this list goes into effect pretty
much any smart phone laptop tablet or
other electronics product that is
assembled in China and then shipped into
the United States is going to be hit
with the tariffs up to 25% and while
that might seem like just more money for
the US it's usually be the end consumer
that ends up paying the foot of the bill
here's a real-world example I was just
in Taipei Taiwan for Computex which is
this huge computer trade show and the PC
case manufacturer NZXT unveiled their
new line of products but I looked at the
pricing and the US pricing for these
products is ten to thirty dollars more
than the global pricing that's because
there's already this tariff on steel and
aluminum imports and what our PC chassis
is made of steel and aluminum NZXT
manufacturers these cases in China and
if your phone or tablet or a laptop is
manufactured in China you're probably
going to see a very similar price
increase now the new tariffs probably
going to hit actual Chinese company
like Xiaomi and oneplus the hardest but
don't be surprised if you see Google and
Apple increasing their prices as well
both those companies use a company
called Foxconn to actually manufacture
their products in Shenzhen and unless
Foxconn moves all of its manufacturing
out of China to somewhere like Taiwan or
elsewhere you're probably going to see
that price increase in your product this
recent report from JP Morgan is
suggesting that Apple would need to
increase the price of the iPhone excess
about fourteen percent from nine hundred
and ninety nine dollars to eleven
hundred and forty two dollars in order
to make up for this tariff difference
now Apple makes almost a 200% margin on
their products so it's very possible
that they could keep their prices the
same and just eat that cost but for a
company like Xiaomi which has a five
percent cap on all their hardware
products there could be a lot of trouble
now Xiaomi Heusen actually entered the
u.s. phone market yet even though they
were planning to buy at the end of 2019
but things like the meat electric
scooter and the knee box s are very
popular products in the United States
now interestingly this tariff could also
give the upper hand to a few select
companies Samsung only has two factories
still operating in China because it's
preferred to move most of its
manufacturing out of the country they
were already the number one smartphone
manufacturer in the world and they were
set to be d seated by Huawei within the
next two years but we always kind of
fall out of this whole trade war
situation anyway so it looks like
Samsung is going to have a couple of
pretty good years now there is a public
forum set to take place from June 17th
to June 25th and then there's a 7-day
rebuttal period where companies like
Best Buy are expected to show up to try
to get the government to not put these
tariffs in place because they're gonna
have to raise their prices if you want
to follow along with the story make sure
you stay tuned to Android authority calm
because I'm going to be following it
very closely there's only a few days
until this actually all goes into effect
so I will catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
