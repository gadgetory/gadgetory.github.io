technologies that I really want to see
succeed but really smart phone users
haven't become fully enamored with it
yet and meanwhile the reason is that
there are different competing standards
so what are those competing standards on
what is the future of wireless charging
well let me explain first of all I
really must recommend you go to watch
one of my videos about wireless charging
there I give a demonstration using a
nail and some wires and a battery and
voltmeter about the basic principles of
how wireless charging work that will be
linked here in the description below but
please do go and watch that because that
will give you a background to what I'm
going to tell you now
now wireless charging is one of those
features you find in some of the top-end
flagship smartphones but the
manufacturers the OEMs don't really make
a huge fuss about it it is in the top
end Galaxy smartphone some version of
the LG G 6 has wireless charging it but
really there's not a big fuss made about
it now one of the reasons for that is
that there are three different competing
organizations that are trying to push
forward their what a wireless charging
technology now in the background one of
the biggest thing that's probably
happened is this year at will join the
wireless power consortium with their key
charges now the Chi charge is what you
find in the galaxy phones from Samsung
for example now the fact that Apple join
this this organization means there's now
lots of rumors that the iPhone 8 will
support it and lots of Apple fans say
well what's the iPhone supports it
everybody will support it now that might
not actually be the case the future will
show but they tell you about the
different types of charging technology
because they end all about distance how
far you have to be away from the
charging station now the one that we the
most popular today is Chi and Chi has
two different types of system one is the
one where you touch the phone directly
on the back of a paddy has to be within
a quarter of an inch within seven
millimetres otherwise the charging
doesn't work on that called induction
charging and that's what we see today on
two phones like the galaxy s7 now the
chief kind of also includes something
called resonant charging which allows
this distance to be slightly large
45 millimeters is about 1.7 inches and
that's good when you want to have the
child is built into a desk for the
office or maybe some furniture so you
put your phone down the rep arm of your
chair and it starts charging even though
it's not exposed at the surface now the
third type of wireless charging is what
I'm calling uncoupled and that's a
system where the device that's being
charged and the charging station don't
need to be next to each other in fact
there's a new type of technology which
the devices can be up to 15 feet away
now the leader in this or at the moment
is a technology called what up not
what's app but what up and the idea is
that when you walk into a room that had
one of these charging base stations your
devices can start to be charged remotely
and it does that by sending out radio
signals in this five gigahertz band but
then our cords are charging to happen in
the devices and in fact these base
stations can be programmed so that when
it sees maybe your smartphone it gives
that priority in charging than it does
maybe over your Fitbit and the reason
for that is there isn't that much power
that can be transmitted through this new
system we're talking maybe only 700
milliamp hours so that's not very high
now Apple also rumored to be working
with the what up technology and that
again has given a whole bunch of rumors
about wireless charging in future
versions of the iPhone now just to
quickly mention the three different
camps that are available moment one is
the wireless power consortium with the
Qi charging and that's Palka minute and
Samsung LG HTC media take em now of
course Apple the other is the fuel cell
alliance and that was made by a merger
between the Alliance for wireless power
and the power matters Alliance PMA now
PMA charging is what you actually find
inside also of some of the leading
flagship Samsung phones a Samsung kind
of went with both ways and called
Samsung are one of the partners of the
air/fuel alliance as our LG Sony HD
Qualcomm Intel mediatek and now also
while way so as you can see some
companies are hating their bet and put
on being part of both different
specifications and the third one is this
one called what up which I just talked
about at the moment they don't have any
product a/c out they say they'll have a
product out at the end of two
17 and Apple are rumored to be working
with them now while technology is great
while innovation is brilliant one thing
we all hate is competing standards which
means that you invest in one ecosystem
you invest in one way of doing things
and then find out that the other one did
became the boss and we really hate that
so for consumers things I really just do
shout out to all of these different to
power charging organizations get your
act together and work together because I
don't want to buy a phone and then find
out that actually I chose the wrong one
and there are so many examples of this
in consumer history VHS and Betamax HD
DVD and blu-ray and there's just so many
other examples really we want one option
that works well and we're prepared to
pay for it if it does the job properly
now there's one area that I haven't
mentioned that could really be a
deciding factor when it comes to
wireless charging and that is when
there's discharging or happening the
phone and the base station could also
communicate now at the moment there is
some basic communication happens at the
two kilobits per second range is very
very small when a phone is placed on a
charging pad because I just gas between
the charge on the phone what level of
power wants to be used what the battery
level ISM so they can talk to each other
but wouldn't it be great if you could
put your phone down on to a charging pad
on a desk and let's say you put it down
on a table inside a coffee shop and
actually up comes the menu and you can
order from there and that ultimately
gets them over to the bar where they're
making the coffee's for you all about if
in the future you have an electric car
it drives into your garage it starts to
use wireless charging to charge it up at
the same time it starts to talk to the
wireless charger may be receiving
software updates maybe it's kind of
downloading its fuel statistics and it's
kind of Diagnostics all these things
would be great at the moment that
doesn't exist in a kind of a generalized
form there is that idea to have that
discussion about power levels but
wouldn't it be good if technologies
would change so that actually you can
have communications while you were
charging now really the best solutions
the moment I kind of using NFC together
with Qi charging or maybe to have kind
of some Bluetooth enables but if you've
got all of that kin with that stuff
going on between the two devices will it
be great if you just built in so you had
wireless charging and near-field
communications of a sort at the same
time maybe that will be the things that
will make wireless charging take off and
be the kind of technology that we all
want in our smart phones well - go Sims
from Andrew authority I hope you enjoyed
this video if you did please do give it
a thumbs up please use the comments
below tell me do use wireless charging I
know some of you really love it some of
you just don't care some of you - will
mash when you buy a phone some of you if
it's got it I don't mind tell me what
you think about wireless charging tell
me what you think would be the best
thing about wireless charging that would
make you change your mind so that you
would start to use it all so let's get
to subscribe to and royal authority is
YouTube channel hit that little bell
icon so that you get notifications when
we release a new video and last but not
least go with Android calm because we
are your thoughts for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
