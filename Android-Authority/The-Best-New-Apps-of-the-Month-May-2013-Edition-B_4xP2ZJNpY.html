Hindy the android authority app guy do
you like new apps I know I do and after
the intro will show you some of the best
new apps from may 2013 we'll start with
a tower defense game that's not only
pretty popular but pretty highly rated
as well it's called Kingdom rush and
it's about as standard of a tower
defense game as you can get you set up
towers they killed bad guys trying to
reach your face and you get items and
money for a most tower defense
aficionados already know the drill and
it's easy to learn for those just
starting out it's simple it's fun and
it's a tower defense game it's also free
which is groovy when you add it all
together it equals a game that's worth
checking out next browser claims to be
the next generation of browsing we can't
confirm or deny that either way but it
is a pretty nice browser it comes with
all the standard features you'd expect
out of a browser including bookmarks
decent web browsing and a customizable
opening page in terms of web browsing
it's about as good as you can get it
load pages quickly but of course that
all depends on your web connection we
didn't run into any issues while
browsing and it's simple easy-to-use
interface keeps things clean and
efficient our next step can be described
in three words to your friends laser
breathing dinosaurs of course we're
talking about punch quest it's a free
runner game where you essentially just
pound on enemies until you die there are
two controls you can punch the ground or
you can punch in the air you can get the
a / mentioned laser breathing dinosaurs
as you progress along with other powers
it's a fast paced game that you can play
for a while before you realize that
you've been playing it for a while it's
a highly rated and really popular game
already so it's worth checking out
what's the saying is probably the
highest rated new app of the month it's
the latest in a long line of word games
some of which we review before it has
really simple gameplay and it comes with
some social networking attached so you
can get your friends involved here's how
it works you are given a picture that
contains clues to the phrase then you
guess the phrase if you can't you can
use coins to solve it for you or you can
post your Twitter or Facebook and ask
your friends if they get it alright
friends it's time for a dribble pissed
mess fun for those who have never played
you don't know jack before if that
stands for gibberish question you don't
know jack is an adult-oriented quiz show
game that first started in the early
1990s it's kind of a mix between Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire and jeopardy
it's fun it's occasionally vulgar and
hilaria
and with various question types like dis
or debt and gibberish questions longtime
fans can relive the experience once
again if you like quiz show style games
this is definitely worth your time if
you take a look at our leaderboard you
can see how all these apps stack up
against one another as usual this is
based on google play store ratings and
not our personal bias if you want to try
them simply head to the video
description where you can find the app
links lots of apps are released every
month so it's perfectly conceivable that
we may have missed one or two if we did
and you want to tell us about it let us
know in the comments also we were going
to mention Sonic the Hedgehog but it
wasn't compatible with the Nexus 4 and
we couldn't review it it is an honorable
mention if it works on your phone once
again I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy feel free to subscribe
to our YouTube channel and check out our
social media links in the video
