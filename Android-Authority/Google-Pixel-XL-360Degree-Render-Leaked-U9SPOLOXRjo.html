like the look of the Google pixel phones
at least those of the leaked images but
in 24 hours stuff has changed because we
have new leaked images and even a video
a bevy of leaks and rumors surrounding
the upcoming Google pixel smartphones
keeps cropping up as October 4th draws
near the latest shot has been fired by
the usual suspect on lease who revealed
Google pixels Excel dimensions and 3d
images in a 360-degree rendering now the
3d render shows what seems to be the
proposed measurements of the device all
sides and corners that's not to say this
shouldn't be taken with a grain of salt
now the leaks are shared on Twitter what
the Google pixel XL measurements were
you can see those right there the Google
pixel XL appears larger than the pixel
thanks to the former's 5.5 inch display
against the latter's 5 inch screen
further examination of the render
reveals a glass plate that seems to
cover the rear camera and fingerprint
scanner on the devices back panel
there's also a metal frame with sloping
edges a stereo speaker on the bottom and
a USB type-c port in addition to the
power button and volume keys that's on
the hardware side other than the details
of the key specs of the pixel XL and
pixel that we previously mentioned
earlier this week there's word that the
pixel XL could set you back around 650
bucks now the price tag is significant
you're gonna ask yourself what is
Google's strategy here the success of
the original Nexus 5 was largely due to
the fact that you got flagship power for
a budget price 350 bucks for a flagship
phone that was fantastic
it came out with a Snapdragon 800 holy
crap that was amazing and you got
vanilla Android there was a very
compelling reason to buy into the Nexus
brand and they've slowly wean themselves
off that strategy so what is the
strategy now what reason is there for us
to buy and Nexus phone at 650 bucks when
we don't get quite that much for it at
least it seems unless there's something
hugely groundbreaking now let's talk
about groundbreaking I'm referring to
the tweet that Hiroshi
Kaymer put out last week the senior vice
president of Android where he said we
announced the first version of Android
eight years ago today I have a feeling
eight years from now we'll be talking
about October 4th 2016 now allow me to
decipher something for you I deal with
leaks and rumors every day and one of
the reasons leaks and rumors happen is
that companies provide those leaks for
two reasons one they want to build
anticipation give people like me
the information we need to put out
content it builds anticipation for their
product and two it's a testing ground
they test their hard core audience a
year six months in advance before the
final product comes out to see what
people will think
now if Hiroshi law Kaymer really did
have a trump card up his sleeve and is
really going to deliver something that's
totally fundamentally different on
october 4th we would have seen a leak
about that we would have seen something
unless of course it's an entirely
different strategy I don't know I could
be wrong this is an educated guess let
me know what you think in the comments
below I will be reading them you think
