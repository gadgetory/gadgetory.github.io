Android Q&amp;amp;A my name is Jason this is
where we try and answer your most
pressing Android questions like if you
were stranded on a remote island full of
zombies which system-on-a-chip would you
take with you the Tegra k1 or the
Snapdragon 805 well I've uncovered some
goodies that will help you stay quit to
kill some zip here we go first question
comes from Vegard where he says which
system-on-a-chip do you like most so of
course after CES there was a lot of
hoopla but the Tegra k1 192 count'em a
whopping 192 cores very impressive
indeed and after Tom's Hardware put out
an initial bench testing indicating that
yes the system-on-a-chip outperformed
anything currently on the market but of
course Qualcomm did not take those
claims laying down Qualcomm said no no
no Nvidia your so-called benchmarks are
a little bit disingenuous as those tests
do not have any real-world mobile use
case scenarios yet but Qualcomm did put
on a pressive demo themselves I thought
this was really cool now the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 805 combines fork rate 450
CPU cores and a brand new Adreno 420 GPU
and with a GPU heavy focus Qualcomm was
more than eager to show off a bunch of
games running Snapdragon 805 tablets at
the show these tablets were running 2560
by 1600 and had no issues delivering
smooth playable frame rates regardless
of the content now it should be said
here with a big caveat that neither of
these system of chips have been tested
at scale in a real-world environment it
is fair to say that there are big step
up from their own previous generations
it's also fair to say that there's a big
emphasis on graphics for all you mobile
gamers moving on on how to find out if
your mobile device is USB on-the-go
compatible Jagadish says Jace can you
tell me if my phone is compatible with
USB on-the-go please tell me I really
need to know
yes Jagadish you can go to this link
right here and you can see all the lists
of mobile devices that are supported by
USB on-the-go check
let me know how it goes moving on to
another question about batteries you
guys sure love your battery talk marques
Washington asks what's the difference
between lithium-ion and lithium polymer
battery of the same capacity a little
history break here but did you know that
lithium-ion batteries go way back to
1912 but did not become popular until
Sony adopted it in 1991 lithium-ion
batteries have high densities and cost
less than lithium polymer batteries in
addition they don't require priming when
first use and have a low self discharged
lithium batteries do suffer from aging
even when not in use and of course in
the rare case lithium ion batteries have
been known to go poof on the other hand
lithium polymer batteries can result in
credit-card thin designs while still
holding relatively good battery life
in addition lithium polymer batteries
are very lightweight and have improved
safety however these batteries will cost
more to manufacture and have a worst
energy density than lithium ion
batteries Kelvin asks how do I change an
app drawer view list instead of a grid
list now for those of you don't know
what Kelvin and I are talking about
Calvin wants to be able to take this
view on his phone and change it to this
view now Calvin I found an app in the
Google Play Store called app drawer of
all things and it allowed you to do that
and many other customizations Calvin
please try that out and tell me in the
comments below how it works I haven't
tried it myself thanks for watching
android peeps i just wanted to point out
that i know that many of you have
questions both on twitter and in the
comments that i have not answered either
in the comments or in the show and i
apologize for that I can't possibly get
to all of them but we have decided we're
going to double the Q&amp;amp;A shows per week
next month because there's so much
demand for it and we shall see how that
goes
connect with me on Twitter or Google+
I'd love to chat with you don't forget
about my brother's an Android Josh Jo
and the tech ninja Kevin I shall see you
next week on a dry Q&amp;amp;A</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
