authority coming to you live from CES
2016 and we're taking a look at the lay
one pro this is a flagship smartphone
from late evie a company you may have
not heard of before but they're very
well known in China and they're actually
looking to bring the lay 1 Pro to the
u.s. very very soon it's got an all
metal unibody design with some very nice
curves along the back and sides which
gives it a very comfortable and sleek
feel in the hand it's got a 5.5 inch IPS
LCD display so it's still within the
realm of one-handed use the screen is
packin a resolution of 2560 by 1440 aka
quad HD and it looks absolutely gorgeous
the colors are fantastic it's got great
viewing angles and if you're not a fan
of the default color settings you can
tweak them in the settings as you see
fit inside is a Snapdragon 810 processor
and 4 gigabytes of RAM and so far during
our short time with it performance was
as good as you would expect for a phone
with such a powerful processor and four
gigs of RAM so things like heavy gaming
and multitasking between applications
shouldn't be a problem for this phone at
all it's got all the usual stuff that
you might expect from a modern-day
smartphone like Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS and
LTE but the most notable piece of
hardware on the Leie one pro is the mute
switch on the side you don't really see
this much on Android devices but it's
extremely useful anytime you want to
quickly silence your device at the
simple flip of a switch
it also has support for the latest USB
type-c standard and the nice thing about
this device is that it comes with a USBC
adapter in the box and just in case
you're wondering this adapter is 100%
compliant with USBC standards the
battery inside is a 3000 milliamp hour
battery which should be enough for a
full day and of course you have the
added benefit of fast charging there's a
13 megapixel camera on the rear with
optical image stabilization and a 4
ultra pixel camera on the front which
should give you some really great
low-light shots for both the front and
rear cameras the camera interface is
pretty straightforward as well and the
shutter speed was nice and quick making
it pretty easy to use the software Islay
TVs own custom software on top of
Android 5.0 lollipop
it's a pretty similar experience to
other Chinese OEM skins like the lack of
an app drawer but it does have some
changes that make it unique the recent
apps menu still allows you to multitask
like normal but shortcut toggles like
Wi-Fi camera and flashlight are all
integrated into the recent apps screen
which makes a lot of sense and feels
very intuitive
there's also built in live streaming
capabilities that allow you to tap into
any live stream like a current football
or soccer game at the touch of a button
which is a pretty awesome feature for
consuming your favorite content on the
go pricing and availability in the US is
still to be announced but will
definitely keep you posted on the site
at Android authority com
this has been a quick hands-on look of
the lei one Pro from late Eevee so keep
it tuned here to Android Authority for
the rest of our CES 2016 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
