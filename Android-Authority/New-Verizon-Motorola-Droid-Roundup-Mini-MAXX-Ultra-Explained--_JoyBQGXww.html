got the chance to take a look at the
three phones that make up verizon's new
droid lineup now that I've had some time
to reflect we're going to take a look at
all three and see how they stack up
against each other the main thing to
understand here is that aside from
battery and display size these phones
all share the same specs the chipset is
Motorola's x8 mobile computing system
which seems to be based on a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 pro design with a 1.7
gigahertz dual-core CPU and quad-core
Adreno 320 GPU then we have two cores
left one dedicated to natural language
processing and another for contextual
computing which is likely behind some of
the features like the new active display
which only lights up a portion of the
screen for notifications each phone has
two gigs of ram and 16 gigs of internal
storage with no microSD slot the cameras
are the same as well with a 2 megapixel
shooter up front and a 10 megapixel
camera in the rear clear pixel
technology here uses an RGB see sensor
instead of the normal RGB to allow
unfiltered light through when taking a
photo this doesn't add any additional
color information but it does add more
light information so low light
photography should be improved and
pictures should be less likely to blur
that said we haven't yet had the chance
to test this in depth so with all of
these similarities what makes these
phones different let's start with the
droid ultra at the event Verizon made a
point of stressing that this is
currently the world's thinnest 4G LTE
smartphone at only seven point two
millimeters thick it has a 5-inch
display and a fairly thin bezel keeping
with the generally thin feel of the
device next up is the droid maxx it
shares its display size with the ultra
at five inches but is a little thicker
at eight point five millimeters this
extra space is used to house a 3500
milliamp hour battery while the ultra
only has a 2130 milliamp hour battery
Motorola claims that the max can get you
up to 48 hours of battery life finally
we have the droid mini unlike the mini
phones current
we arriving from other manufacturers the
droid mini keeps all the specs the same
just in a smaller size with a 4.3 inch
screen and 2,000 milliamp hour battery
looking at these phones personally I
could see myself going with the most
expensive phone the droid Maxx because i
tend to tear through battery life that
said those who don't need that kind of
battery life or a 5-inch screen would be
well served by the droid mini especially
since it's the cheapest of the three
phones it's funny that the phone that
people were paying the most attention to
before the event was the droid ultra
since it doesn't really have anything
all that special about it asides from
its super thinness for more coverage of
the new droid lineup check out our other
videos or head over to android authority

news reviews QA giveaways and more I'm
Chris woken as always thanks for
