mid-range Sony Xperia L hey everybody
I'm Chris look now the Sony Xperia L is
a stylish mid-range phone in a sea of
less stylish mid-range phones but is
that enough to help it stand out let's
dive into the review starting with the
specs the Xperia L features a 4.3 inch
FW VGA display and runs a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 chipset with a one
gigahertz dual-core CPU and Adreno 305
GPU for memory we have one gig of ram
and 8 gigs of internal storage
expandable by micro sd we have an 8
megapixel rear facing camera capable of
720p video capture and a 640 by 480
front-facing camera powering everything
we have a 1750 milliamp hour battery
unlike a lot of other mid-range phones
from other manufacturers Sony doesn't
make any sacrifices in the design
department with the Xperia L one of the
most distinctive features is the concave
shape of the back of the phone as it
almost gives the entire phone a curved
look all of the hardware buttons like
the volume rocker the power button and
the camera shutter button are placed on
the right side of the phone on the
opposite side we have the USB port while
the headphone jack is on top as is to be
expected in phones of this class the
display is okay but nothing great we
have a 4.3 inch display with a
resolution of 480 by 854 pixels
resulting in a pixel density of around
228 pixels per inch while that isn't too
sharp text and icons look surprisingly
good for the most part colors are
represented well and despite the low
resolution photos and YouTube videos
look pretty good to test the performance
first we started with antutu benchmark
we ran the benchmark ten times and took
the average ending up with a final score
of 10000 54 next up
epic citadel which now has three quality
modes we started with ultra high quality
and got an average frame rate of around
41 frames per second moving to high
quality the frame rate jumped up to an
average of 50 1.7 frames per second
while high performance gave a minor
increase to around 50 2.4 frames per
second real-world performance was solid
and scrolling between home screens and
in the app drawer gave us no performance
hitches apps launched quickly and light
gaming was no problem the Sony Xperia L
runs Android 4.1.2 jelly bean and is
skinned with Sony's custom UI which
seemed to feel a little snappier than
TouchWiz or HTC Sense changing the theme
changes the color of the illumination
bar which is a nice touch
in addition to the stock google apps
sony has included a few of its own like
Walkman album and movies a few other
apps are included like neo reader the
very cool file commander and AAA stocks
which should appeal to the more fiscally
minded buyers of the Xperia L while the
idea of an 8 megapixel camera might
sound cool especially with the good
reputation that Sony's image sensors
have there isn't anything especially
interesting about the Xperia L camera
colors are well represented enough but
images tend to be on the fuzzy side
low-light performance isn't great and
the included LED flash isn't much help
there the same problems carry over to
the 720p video capture the auto
brightness changes very quickly and very
noticeably but motion is fairly smooth
though there doesn't appear to be any
image stabilization present sony claims
around eight and a half hours of top
time for the Xperia L which we found
usually matches up with moderately heavy
use this seemed to be the case here
around five hours of fairly heavy
testing brought the battery down to
around 33% while shooting and lighter
testing on a different day brought it to
just 61% real-world you should
bitte running along the battery is
removable so if you want to carry a
spare or search for an extended battery
that is possible in the end while its
general performance is right in line
with a whole bunch of other mid-range
phones we've looked at what might give
the Sony Xperia L a chance is its unique
sense of style now everybody has
different tastes so it might not appeal
to you but it is definitely worth a look
