is Jason I'm back from vacation I caught
fish I caught a can and a beard and I
feel more manly but that didn't stop the
Android use from carrying on while I was
gone and we got great new leaks from the
note for the Moto 360 and the Xperia z3
and also sharps new aquas crystal a
truly bezel asst phone although I like
to call it the Jay Leno of phones
because what it loses embezzles it gains
in a chin oh yeah what's heads bobbling
more so let's start off with the Xperia
z3 and we got many leaks in the past few
weeks but arguably now we have the most
credible leak with not only images but
hardware specifications from tena nao
tenha is china's version of the American
FCC and they gave us some goodies now
there are two versions of the phone the
l5 5t and the l55 you the only apparent
difference between the two is that the
l55 t is designed to work exclusively in
china while the l55 you is compatible
with international carriers now other
than a slight spec bump with this cpu
and GPU not much looks to have changed
since the Xperia z2 there is still the
same size 5.2 inch 1080p display 3
gigabytes of ram 16 gigabytes of
internal memory and the familiar 20.7
megapixel rear and 2.2 megapixel front
facing cameras now we are expecting Sony
to officially unveil the Xperia z3 early
next month now the good people like Sam
mobile have found some credible leaks
regarding the camera features of the
note for Sam mobile found software
evidence of the presence of a side touch
sensor on the note 4 but it's not yet
conclusive as similar tracks were found
in the code of the galaxy s5 as well
side touch is a sensor placed on the
lower right hand side of the device that
emulates a camera shutter button
basically instead of tapping the screen
to take a shot you tap the side of the
phone which should enable a more stable
shot with less
effort again it's not clear if the note
4 will actually feature this sensor the
note 4 will reportedly pack new camera
modes including three cell c modes wide
selfie presumably taking advantage of
the wide angle lens and a selfie which
lets you take a shot with a smile or a
wink and a selfie alarm the rear camera
automatically focuses on your face when
you try to take a self-portrait there's
also a jif making mode that will convert
shots taken in burst mode into an
animated gif all features from the
galaxy s5 will make a return on the note
4 as well let's just hope that one of
those borrowed features from the s5
isn't just a larger looking band-aid now
for those of us who lusted after the
Moto 360 when we saw this teaser vid
you'll be happy to know that Best Buy
mistakingly put up a listing of the Moto
360 that included both price and
specifications and then quickly took it
down but we cut a snapshot the
highlights of the best buy's moto 360
listing includes a 250 dollar price tag
a 1.5 inch 320 by 290 resolution display
a heart rate monitor waterproofing up to
one meter Gorilla Glass 3 on a stainless
steel case with leather band and this is
all powered by a Texas Instrument
processor considering all the additional
features and they somewhat premium build
including the round watch face the 250
dollar price tag for the Moto 360 seems
very much in line with the 200 and 229
dollar price tags of the Samsung gear
live and the LG G watch respectively now
as expected last week sprint officially
unveiled its sharps aquas crystal at an
event they called taken the edge off
made by sharp the new aquas crystal is
pushing the physical envelope of
smartphone design with a phone that is
almost all scream there is still a large
chin at the bottom of the phone for
things like the front-facing camera and
microphone but the other three sides
feature amazingly thin bezels and with
future component miniaturization we can
expect that chin to go away in the
future thanks for watching android army
my name is Jace
love to connect with you here on Google+
or Twitter I read all those out replies
and comments while we respond to the
wall but I do read everything you're
right you don't want to forget about
these guys Josh Joe and the technology
Kevin lon and Chris all working really
hard to deliver the best and read
content on the web and if you've been
following my android q and A's where I
answer questions that are posted in the
android authority forums you'll know
that I have two clues that have been out
to win the contest for the fifty-dollar
google play gift card and they've been
hard because not many people have even
gotten close to those clues a couple
people have they've read comments and
they've sort of got the words that I'm
looking for but I am looking for an idea
not just a spec bump so in the next
Android QA i am going to give a huge
clue like painfully obvious clue i'm
going to tell you that this is the clue
so watch that that's coming out the next
couple days I shall see you next week on
Android weekly
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
