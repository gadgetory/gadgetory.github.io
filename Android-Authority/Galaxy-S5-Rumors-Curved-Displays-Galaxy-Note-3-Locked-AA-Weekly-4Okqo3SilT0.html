Squarespace hello again ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy from android
authority calm and I'll be subbing in
for Josh Vergara on this week's episode
of android authority weekly we have a
lot of great news for you this week the
note 3 was just launched we have some
rumors about curved displays and some
more rumors about the galaxy s5 we have
that and a whole lot more so let's get
started our first bit of news this week
is the announcement of the Oppo n1 it is
a beastly 5.9 inch display and the
successor to the up 055 it has a lot of
great specs some really useful features
and even though it comes packed with the
Snapdragon 600 instead of the Snapdragon
800 it's still a pretty impressive
device aside from the CPU it comes with
an Adreno 320 GPU two gigabytes of ram
16 and 32 gigabyte options a whopping
3610 milliamp hour battery and a 13
megapixel camera that can swivel to be
both the front and the back camera an
interesting add-on is the 0 click device
which you can stash in your wallet or on
your keys and the n1 will tell you where
they are this could be invaluable it's
not even 2014 yet and already we're
hearing some juicy rumors about
Samsung's upcoming projects word out of
South Korea is the company is looking
for some metal bodies for smartphones
with large shipments set to be made in
quarter 2 of 2014 that coincides with
the Samsung Galaxy S series released
year-to-year of course the rumors don't
end there shortly after the metal bodies
rumor came out rumblings of a device
dubbed project F came out of South Korea
the premise a device that isn't a galaxy
device for the metal frame and a
flexible display keep in mind these are
unconfirmed rumors so this could all be
total hogwash we sincerely hope that it
isn't the speaking of unique displays
and Samsung's some more rumors were
circulating over the last week about a
samsung galaxy note 3 that would be
released with a plastic curved display
as it turns out those rumors happen to
be accurate DJ Lee Samsung's mobile head
of strategic marketing confirmed the
rumor a few days ago he stated that
plastic lcds have the advantage of being
strong enough to not shatter which
allows for some more unique designs
sources say the device could be released
as early as next month the behind the
scenes blog we made on Squarespace is
now complete and you can check it out at

android authority the kindle fire HDX
tablets were announced us last week and
from a hardware perspective they're
phenomenal both the 7 &amp;amp; 8.9 inch
variants will come with a snapdragon 800
processor and Adreno 330 GPU two
gigabytes of ram and LTE support the
7-inch variant will go for about two
hundred twenty nine dollars with the 8.9
inch variant being over 300 the kindle
fires come with a number of new features
including the latest amazon OS which is
based on android 4.2 an interesting
feature that everyone is talking about
is the Mayday feature when you hit the
Mayday button you'll have near-instant
tech support 24 hours a day 7 days a
week on September 25th the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 was released in 58
countries around the world with more
releases planned in the next couple of
weeks and the US planned in the first
few days of October the behemoth device
is reportedly going for seven hundred
seventy dollars off contract but it's
not without its controversy so
apparently Samsung is locking the note 3
based on region if you register the
phone in its home region first and on a
carrier then you can travel with it to
other regions with no restrictions if
you buy it from another region you have
to take it to a Samsung service center
to have it unlocked for free it is
needlessly complicated but aside from
losing a lot of precious time and
shouldn't cause too many problems in
case you missed our last episode of
Google Play weekly google made headlines
over the last week because they updated
a whole bunch of their applications
there were five big updates in total
including the Android device manager
hangouts gmail google play movies and TV
and Google Play Books the biggest
updates went to the first three an
Android device manager you can now in
put a password to lock your devices and
hangouts they've added indicators to
show whether or not people are online
and in gmail conversations are now shown
in card form like you see on google now
