android authority one of the best
android sites in the world we're
reporting live from las vegas we're here
at CES 2013 now we just had the
privilege of attending in videos press
event here and they release some amazing
technology they debuted their Tegra 4
SOC now what we're looking at here is an
arm cortex a15 quad core chipset the GPU
incorporates 72 unique GPUs it's going
to be remarkably powerful and in their
demonstration they showed us that it
just completely demolishes the a-15
dual-core exynos 5250 featured in the
Nexus 10 they were able to load 25 web
pages in like 27 seconds something that
most powerful laptops today can't even
match so let's check out the Tegra 4 is
android authority here with Darcy llueve
reporting live from CES 2013
you
places of our properties attributed to
probably great surprise to all of you
like engineers the temperature we just
need a lot more performance and here
today I'm here to prove it to you I'm
here to prove to you that we do a lot
more perform step 4 has 72 GPU cores
listening is flooded which engine course
I just wish we could flood even more
cheating whores in here second thing is
it is the world's first part 48 15 2015
which is arms new cpu architecture and
quite a bit faster than our last
generation we still have our power
standing water that's global power cord
that comes along sips local it's a power
when you're mostly doing local community
regarding water while you're reading a
book or just browsing the web site or so
you enough and then of course every
mobile processor in the future we'll
have to be connected and fortunate
obviously the next step and include a
fortune emmaus first 4g LTE other so
poppy shows now please
and so this is on the left is the nexus
10 and we'll going through websites your
Amazon's website cna on New York Times
and on the right is jigar floor we're
cranking along and these are these are
web pages that you see you know
everybody misses on a daily basis and it
hit a sign if it's not clear already got
a ticket for it is a is doing quite well
and so you took about twenty seven
seconds to load 25 unique web pages a
real world example of an application
that we do all the time now of course
all this basically means is this if
you're unloading a website which I go
for it comes to the second basically
like them if you're learning to web page
with the fastest android tablet of all
today nicely and rajendra nexus 10 it
would take two seconds now frankly i
think i think one second is welcome
twice as fast it's two seconds today's a
camera works like this as a sensor goes
into an image signal processor which
takes the what is called the bear cabins
in terms of it
in the process it advances the image
quality extracts the luminous address
Roma and reconstruct what looks like to
give a JPEG image what nvidia tegra 4
architecture does is something radically
different something radically different
we introduced a brand new way of
designing our chip so that we could put
our processors closer to the imaging
tightly the first thing that you see
we'll just go back this is all this is
Duke the first thing that you notice is
that we take two shots at once which a
two shots at least one shot with high
exposure launch of the light exposure
then the first thing we do is we dumped
it into this computational photography
pension sitting in system memory and
once we do that this engine for the left
could now take advantage of all the
processors on chip that's why we have 72
court that's why we have 48 15 that's
why we got this powerful iced tea and
with this computational photography
we could do the necessary mathematics so
quickly that effectively at the end of
shy you have his yard weather for does
it as we go pam pam reject your shots do
simultaneous shots and then all
processors are deployed and running to
do the alignment of war be the
registration the tone mapping all of the
necessary image processing and who goes
out one single foot it basically is a
one-shot deal what comes out of the chip
right off the bat is HDR what that means
is every software application today just
works no modification necessary no
authority necessary you can either
decide I would like to have HDR on all
the time and then as a result in that
particular case it was just a google
camera became
nearing the door and it is totally HDR
nice to illustrate the benefits of
software to migrate here or this
software modem technology compared it to
the state-of-the-art del tema it is so
much smaller than the reason for that
the reason for that is this architecture
was this programmable architecture was
designed for motive technology and
because it's able to reuse reuse each
one of the processors for every stage of
the pipeline it doesn't have to
replicate any special she wants frankly
if Nvidia today in our industry in
graphics was still using fixed function
processes in order for us to deliver the
type of visual only that we're seeing
today then chefs would be many times
partial as well we were so enamored with
this technology we took a chance and I
drop and try to find the second that we
are now sampling a 4g modem based on the
strange acknowledged let's get this guy
