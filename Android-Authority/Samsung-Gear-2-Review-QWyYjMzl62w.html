Android authority and Samsung is back at
it again this year with a trio of new
wearables the gear to being the biggest
of the three and the successor to the
original Galaxy gear did Samsung get it
right this time
let's take a look and find out this is
the Samsung gear 2 all right so here it
is the Samsung gear 2 the successor to
the original Galaxy gear but this time
around without the galaxy branding there
were a lot of flaws with the original
Galaxy gear but Samsung is looking to
rectify all of that with the gear 2
starting with the hardware it's still
comprised of metal on both the face and
the clasp which gives it a very premium
look and feel with textured black bands
which are now removable whereas on the
original they were not just from the
hardware alone the gear 2 feels much
more refined in comparison to the
original it still has an industrial look
without trying so hard to look
industrial with visible screws it's
smaller more compact and lightweight and
they've done a much better job at
concealing the watch's actual Hardware
make the gear 2 look a little more like
a normal watch like the camera module
for example which no longer protrudes
from the watch itself or the speaker
which is now hidden on the underside of
the watch face versus being on the metal
clasp and the power button which also
doubles as a home button has been moved
to the front even the charging accessory
is a lot smaller now it's not that big
bulky awkward to use charger that we saw
with the Galaxy gear and if you're
wondering just exactly how small here it
is next to a quarter and a microSD card
it's got some new hardware as well like
the inclusion of the IR blaster to
control your TV and a heartrate monitor
just like the Galaxy s5 and also like
the s5 the gear 2 has been bumped up to
ip67 certification meaning it is dust
and water resistant up to 30 meters the
display hasn't changed much if at all so
there's not much to really say about it
it's still a 1.6 3 inch display with 320
by 320 resolution and it's very bright
and vivid making it very easy to see
outdoors it's a nicely sized display
making it very comfortable to glance at
small bits of information without making
the watch larger than it really needs to
be if you're wondering exactly how big
the gear 2 is in comparison to a normal
watch it's really not that big at all
here it is in comparison to a few G
shocks that I own and if anything the
gear 2 is smaller and practically every
dimension it's also very light coming in
at 68 grams making it very comfortable
to wear for long periods of time I can't
imagine anyone out there right now
wanting to buy a wearable based on its
internal specs but if you really want to
know it is a slight bump from the
original with a 1 gigahertz dual-core
processor 512 megabytes of RAM and 4
gigs of internal storage the performance
is smooth and responsive whether you're
swiping or opening up apps and very
seldom did I ever find myself having to
repeat a tap or gesture because it
didn't register the camera on the other
hand is still pretty much more of the
same coming in at a whopping 2
megapixels like I mentioned earlier it's
much better integrated into the body of
the watch but don't expect much from it
after all we're talking about a 2
megapixel camera on a watch here if
taking pictures or recording short clips
from your watch is important to you then
the gear 2 is definitely the one to get
you can also have the files
automatically transferred to your phone
for easy viewing as far as the battery
it is rocking a 300 milli amp hour
battery which doesn't sound all that big
but it is a watch after all and so far
the battery life has been great I
typically get about three days out of it
before I have to reach our
so it seems pretty solid as far as I'm
concerned there's not a whole lot you
can do in terms of battery management
except for keeping the screen brightness
low but even at relatively high
brightness you should still be able to
get a reasonable amount of time out of
this watch before having to recharge it
one of the biggest shifts from the
Galaxy gear to the gear 2 is the
software the gear 2 is running on
Samsung's own Tizen platform whereas the
Galaxy gear ran Android but the overall
functionality is still pretty much the
same you still have all the same basic
apps like the dialer contacts email the
ability to check your notifications and
for better or worse Samsung's own s
voice is still present here as well
Samsung has also been really big on
pushing fitness for the last year or so
and on top of the heartrate monitor that
I mentioned earlier there's also an
entire exercise app for measuring
running walking cycling and hiking and
how many calories you've burned you've
also got a pedometer to measure your
steps and I'm not sure if it's a
connectivity issue or just a bug but
intended to freeze a lot and all of a
sudden your steps would just skyrocket
so it's hard to really gauge how
accurate the pedometer actually is and
if you want you can also monitor your
sleep which I actually did just wants to
see exactly what it was measuring turns
out not only does it measure how long
you sleep but how long you lay
motionless while you sleep some apps
that I found useful and I think most
people will too is define my device and
MIDI controller would find my device not
only can you use it to locate your phone
but to watch as well through Samsung's
own gear manager app provided the two
are still connected and in range with
MIDI controller you can control your
music on your phone directly from your
watch so you can pause play and skip
tracks and it doesn't have to be from
Samsung's music player either I used it
for google play music and it worked
great and it was actually rather
convenient the gear 2 is available now
for $300 through various outlets and
whether it's worth that money is going
to be purely up to you as it is only
compatible with Strictly Samsung devices
but it does offer a lot of functionality
that other smartwatches don't so there
you have it for the Samsung gear 2 and
personally I think Samsung got it right
this time the gear 2 definitely feels
much more
and polished in comparison to original
in pretty much every way and it's
everything the original Galaxy gear
should have been with much better
hardware and a lot of extra
functionality but that's pretty much it
