youngberg coming at you from your number
one source for everything android
android authority calm today we've got a
review of the otterbox commuter case for
the samsung galaxy s3 now this is a
pretty new it's going to be your top of
the line protection for your Galaxy s3
OtterBox is known for making really
strong cases really durable and then on
cases that just look good so is this is
our stylish protection commuter series
can read on the back it is a stylish a
protective case for a highly connected
lifestyle we've got protection against
bump and shop dustin d'bries and
scratches it does include screen
protection and two layer protection
against falls so anyways let's just open
her up just take it out from the top so
here's our commuter case got some
pamphlet right here now the pamphlet
says basic installation struck
instructions you've bought more than a
great case you've bought a form-fitting
fully functional cover made by the most
trusted mobile case manufacturer pretty
cool stuff then we just have our other
languages in there so anyways let's take
out the inside of the OtterBox Commuter
here we can remove the first layer of
the shell just like that it's a nice
rubber feel so now we remove our dummy
out of there no this actually comes with
a screen protector does not come with a
built-in screen protector like on the
defender series cases so I won't apply
the screen protector because I already
do have a zagg invisible shield on here
but it does come with a electronics
cleaning cloth and then OtterBox
installation card and you cut out some
of this look pretty nice looks like it's
a pretty nice screen protector so this
is our first layer of protection here
this is the rubber layer this is going
to serve as most of the shock absorber
in the case all of the shock is going to
just disperse across this rubber piece
starting from the corners if it were to
fall in the corners you can see that
these will be kept raised above the hard
plastic edge we also have our raised
buttons for the
our and the volume rocker we've got our
cutouts and they have our dust flaps for
the headphone jack of the micro USB jack
anyways you can just put this in from
bottom or top or even from the sides and
you just want to make sure this is
seated nicely over the galaxy s3 evenly
looks pretty good there make sure we
have our buttons accessible we can hit
the buttons while this is on my phone is
dead or else you'd be able to see it
coming on but you can hear the clicks we
do have access to the buttons anyways I
like to put this in from the top up so I
can line up the dust flap for the
headphone jack so I put that in just
like that and then we'll make sure to
line up either the volume rocker with
the hole or the power button but I'll
just do the volume rocker because it's
bigger and then we'll push the bottom in
here we're going to have to work our
dust flaps see we got those worked in
though and once we do that we can
actually lose our little raised edge but
we can just bring that back up like that
then we're gonna have to work our power
button in and if you can't get it with
your fingers just go ahead and use like
a little tool to push that down in but
it's nice and seated it's not too
difficult of an installation and it's
going to provide a lot of protection
anyways we can check out what this looks
like it's really nice we've got a raised
edge here the raised edge is provided by
the rubber piece so if it falls down
that's not only going to be impact
resistant but it also has a little bit
of space in between the ground and the
screen so as long as your phone does not
fall on anything the screen will remain
fine let's mention with the otterbox
screen protector that comes in the box
anyway as you can see here we've got our
nice little dust flaps for our headphone
jack I've got the cut out for the mic
the dust flaps just fit in very nicely
there and just press it and it'll stay
there we've got our volume rocker in our
power button they both work nicely our
cutouts look great too our LED camera
and speaker we've got our OtterBox
branding right here we've also got our
little cutout for the micro USB the dust
protector that just situates back in
there you kind of have to work it
anyways the two-part protection on the
OtterBox Commuter is really great if you
want to stylish a application but you
don't want to spend the extra money or
have you
added bulk of the defender case I would
suggest getting the commuter we'll have
a review for the defender very shortly
though that one's going to provide a
little more protection but this is
probably the best case you can get for a
streamlined look and the maximum
protection available falls under corners
it's just going to disperse the impact
got a nice rubber there then if it falls
on the bottom directly it's still just
fine back sides even the front got a
scratch resistant material right here
and then on top of that it all looks
great so anyways guys if you got a
galaxy s3 go ahead and check out the
OtterBox Commuter but also check out the
otterbox defender you can get these on
amazon.com and your local store otterbox
calm they're pretty common anyways stay
tuned fans are in authority calm so we
got plenty more reviews for all devices
and all accessories coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
