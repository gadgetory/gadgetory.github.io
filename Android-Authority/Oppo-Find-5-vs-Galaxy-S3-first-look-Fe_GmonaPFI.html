from Beijing taking a closer look at the
Samsung Galaxy s3 versus the Oppo find
five now what we have here is Samsung's
flagship device from 2012 their
best-selling device and the best-selling
Android phone of all quad-core
processing at 1.4 gigahertz a four point
eight inch 1280 by 720 display vs. Oppo
finds 5-inch 1080p display now 1080p at
five inches as you can see it's actually
quite a bit bigger but still very usable
for one-handed operation LCD versus
AMOLED here guys but I can assure you
the colors are very rich on both in
terms of operation both are very fluid
very responsive devices so what we're
looking at here for the Oppo find five
is actually an engineering build so
we're gonna have us three soft buttons
on the very bottom LED backlit that are
going to have a home button a context
menu and a back button so really they're
quite similar actually in terms of the
physical footprint and both are very
fluid due to the powerful hardware
inside but despite the fact that it has
to push so many more pixels the Oppo
find five still does manage to best the
s3 in terms of benchmarks with the dual
LED and a very nice matte back the
samsung galaxy s3 we have an 8 megapixel
and with a single LED flash and a
fingerprint magnet plastic back despite
the fact that the aqua fine has a
slightly larger battery it also is
slightly thicker despite not being
removable or having microSD
but as you can see from the benchmarks
the s4 pro really shines and beats the
s3 now similar to Sony's design it has a
curved back very experienced buyer there
are no physical hole buttons on the Oppo
find 5 running Android 4.1 of the box as
I mentioned it does feature 441 pixels
per inch which is stunning really this
video will not do justice of how great
this looks and if you ever have the
chance to be the Droid DNA in person
you'll know that 1080p at this pixel
density is incredible in terms of the
form factor both are relatively similar
we have an angular design rather rigid
versus the s3s curved designs so Emily
I ll CD right we have a 13 megapixel
camera here with hardware-accelerated
HDR and the ability to capture video at
120 frames per second which is very
impressive they haven't fully optimized
this off your head so obviously it's not
up to Nexus 4 level but I'm sure that
they'll be able to get it there
considering the hardware that they have
inside additionally we have 2 gigabytes
of RAM for the Apple flying 5 whereas
for the international version of the s3
we only have one gig of all but as you
can see the footprint in slightly larger
for the Oppo find 5 again the s3 is
thinner and has a removable battery
though I must say the bezel is very nice
and thin on the alkaline 5 now you'll
see here that color production is
excellent all you and will let die heads
out there need not worry one of the best
displays I've ever seen on the phone and
a $440 price point it's very impressive
now there are some things that you
should know about the Alpen fine 5 first
of all it's going to be released in
China first middle of January at 440 US
dollars second of all there are no LTE
variants confirmed for United States or
Western markets thirdly
Oppo is relatively new to the space
despite having sold over 10 million
smartphones last year so guys what's it
gonna be the value-added 1080p packin
Apple fine fine 5 or the galaxy s3 with
this higher price point AMOLED and last
generation hardware let us know what you
think of these devices and subscribe to
our Channel thanks a lot guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
