Authority and late last year when
Samsung announced the Galaxy Note 5 and
the s6 edge+ they also announced their
own proprietary mobile payment platform
called Samsung pay similar to Android
pay from Google and Apple pay from Apple
but how does Samsung pay work what are
the requirements what are the benefits
and what is it like to use Samsung pay
so samsung pay works a lot like other
mobile payment platforms out there like
Android pay or Apple pay by using NFC
but you may have heard that samsung pay
is the most widely accepted form of
mobile payment available but why is that
well that's because samsung pay also
utilizes MST which stands for magnetic
secure transmission which essentially
mimics the physical swipe of a credit
card through magnetic waves which
neither Android pay or Apple pay do
basically what this means is anywhere
you can tap or swipe a credit card
you'll be able to use Samsung pay
without the store having to upgrade
their hardware in order for you to do so
it's completely secure through
tokenization which creates a unique
identifier for processing the
transaction which means you never have
to worry about your actual credit card
number being compromised in order to use
Samsung pay you have to have one of
Samsung's latest devices like the s6 s6
edge note 5 and s6 edge+
and of course the upcoming s7 and s7
edge all four major carriers in the US
are supported but samsung pay will also
work on some smaller carriers like US
Cellular MetroPCS and Cricut setting up
Samsung pay is actually pretty simple
you start by downloading the Samsung pay
application from the Google Play Store
if you don't already have it once
downloaded the app will ask you to
register for a Samsung account or sign
into your existing Samsung account which
is required to use the service from here
the app will ask you to verify payments
with either a pin or your own
fingerprint but if you want faster or
more secure payments it's best to use
your own fingerprint from here you're
ready to add your card of choice and you
can either register a card by using the
phone's camera or enter the info
manually you can add up to 10 cards in
total and major credit card companies
such as Bank of America City Chase u.s.
Bank American Express and most recently
Wells Fargo are all supported but if
you're unsure if your
Bank is supported you can see a complete
list on Samsung's website but what is it
like to use Samsung pay well here are my
experiences from using Samsung pay for
the last couple of days at various
different places and I'll let you see
for yourself better make up your mind
what do you mean oh hey didn't realize
you were there so uh anyways I'm
actually on my way to a target right now
I'm going to be picking up something for
a baby shower that I have to attend this
weekend so I figured it'd be a good
opportunity to try out Samsung pay which
I've actually never used before I've
used Google Wallet and Android pain
stuff before the past but Samsung pay
this me at first okay so hopefully you
know it works and
I will be documenting the entire process
so wish me luck
just fill it up the machine I just left
target I got what I needed for the baby
shower and I used samsung pay for the
very first time and it worked just like
they say it does pretty much any
terminal that accepts credit cards where
you can swipe or tap your credit card it
basically just works like normal like a
normal credit card so I just put my
finger on the fingerprint scanner and
the transaction literally went right
through within seconds and that was all
there was to it
so now I'm on my way to a FedEx I have a
couple of packages that I need to ship
off and I'm gonna try to use Samsung pay
out of FedEx I don't know if it's going
to work
Oh throw them yeah okay
but everything else does yeah
just like my cars so I just tried to use
Samsung pay at FedEx to pay for shipping
for a package that I needed to send off
and it just did not work it actually
froze up their computer and they let me
try to ice they were kind enough to let
me do it two times and I froze up two of
their computers which is kind of
hilarious but yeah it didn't work it
actually did read my card information
and the info popped up other computers
but after that point it just would not
process the transaction and that's when
it locked up their entire systems so
today is day two of using Samsung pay
and the goal for today at least for me
is to try to hit up some more local
spots around town instead of hitting up
the bigger chains I will hit up a couple
more big chains as well but those places
to me are a little bit less interesting
because I know it most likely will work
so I want to head up to the smaller
spots places that you're not gonna find
in every single city and see how well
samsung pay works at those places so
right now I'm at McDonald's
we'll go barbecue
hold it right over that Levin
took it took a little bit
so just got done eating McDonald's for
the sake of Samsung pay and as you might
have seen it was throwing up an error
when I held it up to the NFC part of the
terminal and I tried it a couple times
and kept throwing up some sort of error
I'm not sure exactly what it was but
once I moved it to the magnetic strip
part of the terminal it went through
just just fine so I'm not exactly sure
what was going on there but it did work
so not a huge deal but it did take a
little bit more time than I kind of
wanted it to but now I'm on my way to a
local mobile shop or bubble tea shop to
test out Samsung pay over there they do
have a magnetic strip terminal I believe
there is no NFC so hopefully it's going
to work so I'm on my way there now and
we'll see how it goes
it is really freaking sunny so I just
went to a local boba shop here and they
did not have a magnetic card terminal
like I thought they did so that was a
fail and then I ended up seeing this
donut shop right next door to it and I
went to that hoping that they would have
one they did have one but not one that I
could actually use not one that I could
actually use myself so now I have this
delicious drink and a delicious box of
donuts but right now I think what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go to the
world market and try to use Samsung pay
there
yes
it is still freaking sunny sorry about
that guys but I am done for the day I'm
done spending money I think I've spent
enough but as you guys just saw I bought
the high shoes and the green tea Kit
Kats here at the world market and it
went through perfectly fine it was
flawless the only thing I had to do was
actually approve the amount on the
screen but otherwise it went through
just fine as if I were to actually
physically swipe a card so you know
samsung pay works really well and
actually I like it a lot it's pretty
cool so before I wrap up this video I
wanted to leave you guys with a couple
of takeaways and takeaway number one is
the amount of banks that Samsung pay
supports is actually very limited right
now it's a very finite amount of banks
so my debit card that I wanted to use
with Samsung pay that I've actually been
able to use with Android pay for a long
time now works perfectly fine but it's
not supported through Samsung pay so
that's just something to be aware of
your bank may not be supported and in
order for me to actually use Samsung pay
I had to use a personal credit card of
mine which I didn't really want to do
but I did it for the purposes of demoing
Samsung pay and the purposes of this
video takeaway number two is I love the
fact that it supports MST because you
can use Samsung pay at a wider variety
of places because of this so basically
any place that you can tap or swipe a
credit card you can use Samsung pay and
that is not a joke it is true so I love
that about samsung pay and that's what
basically gives them a leg up over
Android pay and Apple pay but that's
really going to do for this video
hopefully you guys enjoyed it and found
