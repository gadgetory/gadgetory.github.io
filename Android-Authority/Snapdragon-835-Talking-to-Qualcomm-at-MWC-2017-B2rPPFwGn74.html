we're here at Mobile World Congress 2017
I'm here with Keith Preston from Kolkata
Keith great to see you great to see you
he looks like having a great show me and
you've got a quite a great booth going
on here and you've got awfully lots to
talk about particularly the Snapdragon
835 tell me a bit about that yes we're
really excited about the 835 we
announced it at CES first products in
terms of handsets are being announced
here at the show at Mobile World
Congress but we're really said about the
835 we expect a lot of success so we
were just talking earlier about the
unique aspects of the of the eight three
five let's start with the application
presence ten nanometers that's leading
age JUnit tell me a bit about that yes
so it's the first product I'm ten
nanometer so when I mean first product I
don't just mean mobile I mean any device
in the world okay on ten nanometer so 10
nanometer provides what you'd expect in
terms of new crosses technology better
performance better power better area and
the things that are of increasing
importance in the handset space are
visible area and power so 10 nanometer
gave us a power advantage also allow us
to shrink the package of our chip by
about 35% which allows OMS to keep the
same visible parameters of their phone
we had put in more functionality or
larger batteries that was the talk to
somebody out it with the set of his area
into the silicon cost fabrication
because it's actually a large part of
the overpricing of these things so
reducing that is very important in terms
of the economics
yes certainly got it yes we couldn't
produce the same chip if we were in the
previous generation process so it's
important that for us to get that
smaller package get that lower power
while at the same time
functionality substantially well that's
a great claim you couldn't produce the
same chip on it on a grater so even at
40 nanometers you have to go to tend to
make the a 3-5-2 chipper that's going to
be that's absolutely right yeah all of
the cores that are integrated in our
Qualcomm design course and we designed
the course in parallel with the process
so we designed them all specifically for
10 animator so let's just talk about the
courtroom and I know these you've got to
try of 280 calls in them and this is the
first time you're doing the built on
cortex technology with a little bit
about that yeah that's right so so
there's there's different CPU types one
you can just use the exact same CPU from
arm one you can take an architectural
license and design of McGraw ronzo
this is a different program you've
partnered with arm so it's built on
cortex technology and it's a it's
similar to what you get from arm but
there's been some modifications
including the implementations that are
designed specifically for the Qualcomm
chip
I wouldn't ask about the secret sauce
but we're all kids we'd love to know but
I know you're not gonna tell us but
that's that's great that you you've got
is it is a custom core in the sense that
you've had a major input into how that's
been customized isn't it well yeah
especially on the implementation side so
from from a core design
there's the fundamentals are mostly from
arm but in terms of implementation it's
ours and the key to is willing to make
sure we don't look at the IPS discreetly
we want to make
look at things from an SOC system
perspective that works well with our
chosen buses works well with our cash
structures interfaces well to our TPU
DSP because as you know especially for
mobile the length is a lot more than the
CPU and more and more of the
applications are actually moving from
the CPU to the other course because
customers want to get the best power
performance they can so as time
progresses they're moving to more
specialty course I must have noticed
that in your presentations you deliver
the 8:35 as an overall solution and from
camera DSP graphic you're not just
saying hey we've got this call with you
it's the overall solution they gives you
that great experience on mobile as a
whole package yes for example for your
other customers obviously their
connectivity is key on camera is key
camera pre and post processing audio
processing video processing machine
learning many of these things are going
on on whether it be the GPU or our
industry-leading DSP and that really
also reflects the changing face of the
mobile market maybe worth talking to me
is about music about AI and VR they are
here we are today saying hey off chips
are built to take into account those new
experiences that happen yeah that's
right in many new experiences I mean you
know what the algorithms are you know
their specific scale or a vector
processing you know for example some of
these machine learning algorithms
provide certain levels of multiply
accumulating functions those functions
are best done in the DSP that's one of
the reasons our DSP we added vector
extensions so even perform a lot of
advanced mathematics with in low power
as an envelope as possible doing it in
the holoband nor than the self to it
yeah not in the generic processor so the
generic processor is great for you know
application loading or
some of the physics and some of the
games obviously the GPU is important for
running the games and graphics but then
the DSP is where a lot of the algorithms
come in for camera pre and
post-processing for audio processing or
sensor processing and for machine
learning for example if you compare the
CPU Indian 35 which is a great CPU but
you compare the CPU versus the DSP it's
about 25 times more efficient on running
many of these algorithms panicles DSP is
really just nobody the right name
nowadays it's so much more complicated
maybe it's already there so it's really
yeah that's really a good point sir so
DSP is kind of a historical name you'll
see more and more some of the others are
calling things you know vision
processors are a multitude of different
names but the fact is that the DSP is
found the underlying functionality we've
added extensions to it and with those
extensions specifically designed to
manipulate pixels for images or or sound
or the machine learning and artificial
intelligence so for example with the
8:35 is the first time we support
tensorflow
so someone designs a machine living
algorithm a tensor flow we have a
software stack that efficiently
distributes that load across our course
and if the decent DSP is free that then
is the most efficient core to process
that tensor flow algorithm and it's
really important so the days of true
heterogeneous computing upcoming or the
republic's yeah they're absolutely here
nothing - no doubt about it in you know
we have about a 25% power advantage on
the a priori fibers 5820 part of that's
the node but part of that also is the
header gene
processing and the software that's all
involved so if someone's trying to run
image recognition or facial recognition
or advanced always listening processing
for audio the death can be done in a
low-power envelope and increase our days
of use so it's really hard to make
things much more capable and improve
battery life but we've done that with
the 8:35 and a lot of that is because of
the energy is computing the emission
now you mentioned the the GPU for
specially good consumers that's often a
big ticket item do want time to be about
the GPU and yeah so so we advanced the
GPU by about 30% in terms of capability
from the previous generation it's the
same family but every we typically
promote the new family about every two
years the adrenal 3 adrenal 1405 this is
in the adrenal 5 family but then the
second year that we come up with the
same architecture we find out ways to
optimize it and so we've improved it
roughly 30% we're really pleased with
our GPU because not only is the
performance great but the power is great
so if you go on you run a manhattan
benchmark or something or pick pick your
own graphics benchmark you can measure
the frame rate we have a you know either
on a par or leading framerate across the
best in the industry but then when you
measure the power it significantly
better than anyone else and we have a
pretty strong graphics team internally
that's one of the things that makes the
a35 great a really power performance all
this is about its amped isn't it between
these two things you've got battery but
yet we want great framerate we want
great processing speed that's right we
actually are even though a peak
performance matters I'd say it matters a
lot more historically much more now that
focuses on sustain and that's because of
the use case for example let's say you
slide in this for a dreamer here we are
etc for the VR experience you want you
don't want to lose frame rates after
you've played the game for 10 minutes or
something you don't want it to overeat
and so peak performance going idle is a
use case that maybe mattered more than
past that it does in the president in
the president what cost any customers
want is to be able to run their game
whether you're using the handset or
they're using some like pokemon go for
AR or they have a virtual reality mode
to have equal sustained performance was
trying to first use it till they're done
and because of that it's performance at
power is the critical benchmark
absolutely well case message great
speaking to you my name's Gary seems row
and row Authority we're here at Mobile
World Congress stay tuned for more news
and interviews during this week and
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
