York right now and I'm here as a bras
and offices and I'm just checking out
they're connected space here showcasing
the power of Verizon FiOS and what you
could expect in the future as we
continue to see a lot of connected
products in the home and basically what
they're showing here is how there's no
degradation and speed latency so you
know if you have a Google home you're
streaming 4k over your network or even
playing games it's not going to
sacrifice any new speeds so behind this
door is that this brand-new space so
let's check it out ok before I show you
guys what I saw this face we all know
that our homes are currently going
through this type of revolution now my
place I already see in the moment you
get through the front door just because
I have a ring doorbell they're showing
me who's there and once I enter through
the door there's also a sensor that
tells me when it's open or closed thanks
to the piper system and speaking of
Piper I have two of them the first being
the original Piper while the other one
is the night vision equipped model now
there are so many connected devices
already in our homes that we don't think
about from the security camera streaming
boxes video game consoles and much more
there is an apparent revolution when it
comes to home connection so let's get
back to the verizon fios space they
didn't hold back one bit when it came
down to getting out of the place and I
was kind of overwhelmed by the sheer
magnitude of how many connected devices
were there and kudos to the interior
designers they called in to help them
because it featured a very clean and
colorful atmosphere
well I won't go into every gadget that I
found there some of them that's where we
include the insane amount of smart
lights they're not only work Phillips
hue light bulbs use but they in leverage
the Philips hue light strips to act in
certain areas five out of the six
ginormous wall-mounted television sets
we're streaming 4k content of some sort
which is protecting for any home network
when you think about it and we even
check out a few smart appliances there's
really I'd love to have a space decked
out like this but the point of Verizon
crafting the space in the first place it
the rest attention on the infrastructure
essentially the underlying thing here is
the wall power of Verizon FiOS is 750
megabits per second instant Internet
service when you think about everything
that's there it's pretty impressive that
the network speed wasn't impacted
negatively I was skeptical of course
considering that one router was managing
everything so I tested out using rucola
speed tests on a PC and you know what
it's over delivered by achieving a
download speed of 862 megabits per
second while the upload speed was added
even more impressive 903 megabits per
second but here at home my dilemma is of
course speed and latency has Comcast
Xfinity and a cable provider I'm able to
choose from and with that I just noticed
the more devices I tack on to the
network so in addition to all the home
connected stuff my laptop my PC all the
smart phones all the tablets it does
take its toll and eventually I end up
seeing degradation in terms of speed and
latency when said that my current
Xfinity plan is cheaper at 85 dollars
per month versus $150 per month for the
verizon fios is 750 megabits per second
instant Internet service the difference
alone is evident and how might be it
slowed down tremendously time that's the
main distinguisher between these two
services yes
turning on a light at home using an app
on our Android device while away doesn't
seem like it's going to take a whole lot
but other things such as uploading
videos to YouTube streaming a television
show or tapping into a security camera
won't take us long with the Verizon
connection speed and latency will only
become more crucial as more connected
budgets are introduced at home so if
you're very particular about that you'll
probably want to do your research on the
one hand you can pay less for slower
service but for those looking for
instant connection instant service and
instant play you'll want to take into
consideration this drive and FiOS 750
made with per second package now if I'm
going to get my space at home to look
like the one I saw at verizon's offices
that'd be pretty sweet so if you guys
want to learn more about any of the
stuff I talked about in this video you
