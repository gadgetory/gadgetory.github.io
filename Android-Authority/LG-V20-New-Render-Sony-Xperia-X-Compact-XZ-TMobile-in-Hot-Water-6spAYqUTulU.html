us another look at the LG g20 this time
in black the image here seems to match
other renders we found as well although
it's a little bit tricky because of the
different angles the top speaker grille
the front-facing camera position the
secondary ticker display and the volume
rockers on the left hand side are all
accounted for presumably the blurred out
parts of the screen are there to help
protect his source sadly this picture
doesn't show us anything new about the
possible module nature of the LG v20 the
leaked render does show a button on the
bottom right that could possibly be to
detach modules just like the g5 but
there are any other visible clues in
this picture now there's not a lot more
details about the LG v20 other than the
fact that google has confirmed that it
will run android nougat right out of the
box now many of you will know that I'm a
big fan of Sony especially Sony's
compact line and we've heard rumblings
that Sony's not only putting out an
xperia x compact but an Xperia x10 a
general lack of leaks and information
about Sony's new flagship phones all
we've had to hold us over is the Xperia
XA ultra and a leak of what looks like
to be an upcoming flagship also known as
the f8 3 3 1 but now we may have a
clearer picture of what to expect thanks
to a catch from Sony's check website
they have a listing for an experienced
compact and an Xperia x2 website spills
no specs but we can deduce from Sony's
historic trend of releasing phones of
varying sizes now the mysterious
question is could the xperia x z indeed
be the fa 331 I think they're related
but that's not all we have the renowned
a leak stir Evan Blass aka even leaks
managed to snag a snap of the xperia x
compact and what do you know it looks a
lot like the front of the fa3 3-1 as a
reminder sony is expected to have a
press conference rake before Aoife 2016
kicks off on September 1st at 1 p.m.
Berlin time now I know what you're
thinking you're looking at that image
and saying Jase come on Sony's just
doing the same old
same old there's no innovation they're
giving us the same design as they've had
for years now that may be true but who
else is doing what Sony does I mean you
get waterproof you get expandable
storage you get sexy sleek design and
the only ones to give us a truly
flagship powered smartphone in a compact
size it's not broken don't fix it now
let's talk unlimited data plans that
aren't unlimited well it seems the
uncarrier 's new unlimited plan is in
hot water with the digital rights group
Electronic Frontier Foundation
one of the major gripes about the plan
is that you'll be stuck with Bing ons
video quality cap of just 480p unless of
course you wish to dish out an extra 25
bucks a month which AFF strongly feels
runs afoul of the principle of net
neutrality now that's a pretty solid
argument and one of the other major
gripes is that they're so-called
unlimited data plan is unlimited to 26
gigs a month now I know what some of you
are thinking who are over 40 26 gigs a
month that's the ocean of data not if
you're a teenager watching Netflix all
summer long you can burn through gigs
like wildfire it's not and the issue is
that you shouldn't be able to say it's
unlimited if it's obviously not
unlimited do you guys have the same
problems with your data plans your
carriers let me know in the comments
below
if you guys will remember from like 15
years ago when people were making money
hand over fist in the dot-com bubble
remember we didn't call it a dotnet
bubble or dot org bubble we didn't call
them dot biz billionaires we called them
dot-com billionaires
because that's the power of a dot-com
now why is that because no domain name
extension tells your story with the same
degree of trust as a dot-com or dotnet
domain name.com and dotnet domain name
extensions inject credibility into your
online presence save 15% on domain names
and web hosting when you use our coupon
code Android at domain.com check out
when you think domain names think
domain.com thanks for watching Android
army
my name is Jase love to connect with you
right here on Twitter I'll see you next
week on Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
