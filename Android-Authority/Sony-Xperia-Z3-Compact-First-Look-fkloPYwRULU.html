what's going on everybody and here is a
live look at the sony xperia z3 or z3
compact now what we're looking at here
is a compact august version of the set 3
that has a lot of the same
specifications and it's just a smaller
version of it that still packs a lot of
the same power now you're going to be
getting a lot of the same specifications
underneath that include the snapdragon
801 the adrenal 330 and the 20.7
megapixel camera that gives it a lot of
power when it comes to your camera
optics now it's the same package for the
most part that we've seen in previous
Sony Xperia offerings especially the c2
so you're not seeing a huge improvement
over all when it comes to this new
iteration but that's alright because we
do have a somewhat refined design all
around and just give it an even better
feel and look taking a look at the size
of the compact we do have a four point
six inch screen that this time around
has the bumped down to 720p resolution
which might not be the biggest draw for
some of you out there but for a small
screen like this 720p resolution should
be more than enough you can see here
that I'm actually reaching everything on
the screen quite easily and the 4.6 inch
screen really allows for a very easy
handling experience surely better than
most of the larger phones that are
available out in the market right now
now like I said I'm giving you this live
look at the phone because I'm going to
be getting a much better in-depth look
at it in a more controlled environment
as we are here at the launch events on
the show floor that Sony has just
announced these particular phones now
taking a look at quickly at the camera
experience we're just going to jump
right into it here's the camera and we
do have a lot of the same modes and
capabilities that we had before we have
a lot of the same modes a few of them do
come in here including ones like face in
and also a are fun and as far as the
capabilities go we'll head on over to
the manual mode and you'll see the
ability to change the resolution from
everything from a twenty point seven
down to eight and all the way down to
even two so you have quite a bit of
freedom when it comes to the settings on
the actual camera itself but it's
largely the same experience that you had
before now here is one feature that I'm
actually quite excited about I don't
have a PlayStation 4 just yet but when I
do get it I'm probably going to end up
using this particular device more often
than not because as you can see down
here I have an icon for connected ps4
now this new line of these said three or
z3 phones and the tablets allow you to
remotely connect to your ps4 in order to
stream the content from your ps4
straight to these phones and tablet
which is a great feature especially if
you're going to be inside of your house
and you have to give up your position on
the TV you will still be able to you
your PS or play those games straight to
these devices and not have to take away
your experience from the actual game
itself you'll be able to take it with
you on the go inside of the same network
that your ps4 is connected to and of
course we still have this in great build
quality that is here including IP
certification obviously when we're here
at the Sony booth and they're going to
have a lot of different sort of examples
of what it's like dousing this thing
with water and it has a very good
certification on here so I will be able
to withstand the elements we have done
tests to see the to test the durability
of the c2 and other Xperia Z phones in
the past they have tested very well in
our drop tests and other water tests
obviously so we do expect the same to be
with this z3 and z3 compact but largely
we are looking at just some
optimizations in the outside and some on
the inside as well it may not be a huge
update but then again that's the reason
why we have a bi-yearly release schedule
from Sony you will get incremental
updates but they will prove to provide
an even better experience if you so
choose to be on the bleeding edge in
this case we have it even more refined
design but also a good experience
underneath including the connections to
playstation networks and PlayStation 4
so that is the Sony Xperia z3 compact we
are going to take it even more in-depth
look at it including a look at it
against the z1 compact which I do have
on me and ready for a comparison so keep
it tuned here at Android authority for
all of that best coverage and for even
more on the Sony Xperia z3 line here at
etho Berlin 2014 because we are your
