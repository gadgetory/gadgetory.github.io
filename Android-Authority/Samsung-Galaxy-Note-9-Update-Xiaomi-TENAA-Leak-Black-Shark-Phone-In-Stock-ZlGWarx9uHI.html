galaxy no 9 could have eight gigabytes
of RAM and count'em 512 gigabytes of
storage but there's a catch only if
you're lucky what does that mean exactly
well it's sort of anyone's guess but it
could mean that Samsung has not yet made
a final decision or more likely that
variant will be exclusive to certain
markets namely China but ice universe
also shared two alleged images of the
Galaxy Note 9 on Twitter showing that
the smartphone might be similar to its
predecessor at least from its front they
reveal the flagship could sport a curved
display with minimal bezels surrounding
it however the images appear to be a bit
sketchy so take them with a grain of
salt antenna has revealed a new Xiaomi
phone with a notch another feature that
suggests that this isn't a flagship
phone is a five point eight five inch
TFT LCD screen that's 20 to 80 by 1080
as opposed to IPS or an OLED display the
phone seems to have plenty of decent
features such as a large 3900 million
power battery rear fingerprint scanner
infrared blaster support a headphone
jack dual camera set up at least one
camera is a 12 megapixel shooter and a
5-megapixel selfie camera so when xiaomi
came out with their game centric black
shark phone they quickly ran out of
stock now is that because it was wildly
popular or was it because it was
purposely engineered that way by Xiaomi
no real way to know just yet but good
news if you're looking to buy one
because according to Giz China Xiaomi
plans to replenish the black shark stock
and hope to sell more as a result
according to black shark technology CEO
woosh amine the company encountered
production issues that led to limited
stock with those issues now resolved
black shark sales will open up again
this Friday June 1st now the CEO didn't
make clear how many units would be
produced but he said that the phone
would no longer be difficult to get as a
refresher the black shark features a
six-inch 2160 by 1080 resolution with an
89 aspect ratio a snapdragon 845 chipset
either 6 or 8 gigabytes of RAM or 64 or
128 gigabytes of
storage and a beefy 4,000 milliamp hour
battery that supports quick charge 3.0
