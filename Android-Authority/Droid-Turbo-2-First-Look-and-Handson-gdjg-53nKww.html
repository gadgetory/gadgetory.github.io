authority and I'm here at the Verizon
and Motorola event in New York City
because Motorola and Verizon have
partnered up again to announce two new
Droid phones
the Droid turbo 2 and the Droid Maxx 2
we'll be covering both here on Andrew
authority but for now let's take a
closer look at the droid turbo 2 this of
course is a Verizon exclusive like last
year's joy turbo now durability and
reliability were the main selling points
of the phone with his huge battery and
gripping materials and this year
Motorola has taken the new Droid turbo
even further in these departments as
this is a world's first smartphone with
a shatterproof screen yes that's right
I dropped this phone on concrete screen
face down at least four times from
shoulder height and the phone screen was
as good as new Motorola claims this
technology is called moto shatter shield
which contains five layers that absorb
shock like it's rigid aluminum core and
this AMOLED display is actually a
flexible one so it actually bends during
a drop to keep it from shattering so
challenge accepted motorola this is
definitely gonna be a lot of fun to test
out and see just exactly how much it
takes to finally shatter this screen so
make sure you stay subscribed here for
that but from what we have seen so far
the durability of this phone is truly
remarkable now speaking of that screen
here we have a five point four quadrant
the AMOLED display which is a little
bigger than last year's Droid turbo at
point two inches bigger the display
itself looks very good of course if
being an AMOLED screen we have really
beautiful colors they look very vibrant
here nice and saturated deep and true
blacks as expected from an AMOLED screen
it may not display the most accurate
colors or be the brightest screen but
we'll need some more time to play with
it in different lighting conditions and
a few moments of playing with the phone
we're very impressed with this display
inside the droid turbo 2 we have a
Snapdragon 810 processor with three gigs
of RAM so on paper it's a bit of a step
up from the Moto X pure then when it
comes to the battery motorola still did
not skimp on the capacity at three
thousand seven hundred and sixty
milliamp hours however that is a little
smaller than last year's three thousand
nine hundred million power battery so be
interesting to see how this used droid
turbo performs motorola does claim
however that the droid turbo 2
a full charge can last for 48 hours
along with the Motorola's turbocharger
which can give the phone 13 hours of use
in just a 15 minute charge it also
supports wireless charging the phone is
running Android lollipop 5.1.1 out of
the box we're hoping for marshmallow of
course but hopefully this update isn't
too far down the road with the software
being close to stock Android with this
being a Motorola phone we have the
famous Motorola features like the moto
display that activates with small
movements or gestures like waving your
hand over twists to launch a camera and
flick to launch a flashlight so far we
haven't run into any crashes or hiccups
the software seems to be holding up very
well with this near stock Android look
and feel but we'll see if the droid
turbo 2 can hold up after weeks of use
another great addition to the droid
turbo 2 is that now users have the
freedom to customize its design with
moto maker it's been great to see
Motorola expand moto maker to pretty
much any motor Volo device that comes
out these days so users can design the
droid turbo 2 with the soft grip and
leather materials that can be found on
the Moto X pure what I have is this nice
white soft grip backing that has a scaly
pattern to it and of course the nice
nylon that users of the original Droid
turbo know and love there's a lot going
on on the front of the droid turbo 2 we
have the little sensors for the motor
display the 5 megapixel front-facing
camera along with a front-facing flash
and now we do have a front facing
speaker located at the bottom and even
though it looks like there are two
speakers on either side of this large
verizon logo it's actually the right one
that plays the sound the speaker sounds
pretty good it sounds very crisp but
nice trouble to it and it gets pretty
loud too but we'll have to do some more
comparisons before we give our final
verdict however is definitely good to
see a front facing speaker last year's
droid turbo featured a pretty great 21
megapixel camera and this time around we
also have a 21 megapixel camera with a
dual LED flash we can probably expect
photos of the same quality found in the
Moto X pure and this year's droid turbo
2 has a bumped up 5 megapixel
front-facing camera as well to hopefully
capture a little more detail we'll be
testing the camera in depth later for
our full review there is no official
word yet on full pricing of the droid
turbo 2 but we do have monthly
installment plans $26 per month for the
32 gig model and
$30 per month for the 64 gig model so
based on a 24 month payment plan we're
looking at six hundred and twenty-four
dollars and seven hundred and twenty
dollars respectively and by purchasing
the 64 gig model you will also qualify
for a design refresh so within a year if
you're not happy with your color scheme
or text you're backing that you chose
you can get a new Droid turbo - with
your updated design choices which makes
the 64 gig model that much more
appealing Verizon also has a new limited
time training program where you can
trade in your old smart phones for up to
three hundred dollars and this even
includes phones that have cracked
screens the droid turbo 2 will be
available to purchase on Thursday
October 29th along with the other just
announced Droid Maxx - which we have
also covered so make sure you check that
out here on under Authority and yeah
that's been our first look at the droid
turbo 2 from motorola make sure you stay
subscribed for more in-depth coverage
and reviews of this phone and our
website Android Authority calm as we are
