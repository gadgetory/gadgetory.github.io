by bitdefender mobile security hey it's
Josh regard from Android Authority
what's going on everybody and here we're
taking a look at the lenovo s 660 now in
terms of design the s 660 also comes
with a brush metal design that is
similar to the much larger and more
powerful phone from lenovo the s 860 but
keeping the similarities going the 660
also comes with quite a large battery
resulting in a thickness of 9.3
millimetres small overall size does make
it easier to hold and use with one hand
however in terms of the display the s
660 does come with a 4.7 inch IPS
display with a qHD that's 960 by 540
resolution display in terms of the color
and brightness you do get the good
brightness that IPS displays generally
have and the colors do seem to come
through quite well even though they
might seem a little bit washed out at
times when it comes to performance under
the hood is of the same 1.3 gigahertz
quad-core MTA is found in the other
devices as well and also one gigabyte of
ram so performance is more than
satisfactory for a smartphone at this
price point the internal storage is only
at 8 gigabytes but you do get the
benefit of microSD expansion now the
cameras for this type are pretty
standard with an 8 megapixel rear
shooter and a point three megapixel
front camera what is actually impressive
is the battery as it does a tribute to
that thickness and it comes in a
capacity of 3000 milliamp hours and in
terms of software like with the other
Lenovo smartphones launched you get that
customized UI that does away with the
app drawer completely this will get some
getting used to and if you aren't
careful with all the apps and the
widgets that you download you're
probably going to get a very cluttered
set of home screens very quickly however
taking advantage of some of the
organizational tools like the folders on
there should help you out a little bit
as far as the apps go you do get the
full do-it suite of apps that were
recently introduced by the company
including the security Chariton sync it
snap it and see it applications for a
number of different tasks priced at $229
this is aimed more towards the
international emerging markets with
features such as dual SIM support and
the lenovo s 660 is somewhat looking to
take on the Moto G and so there you have
it for this quick look at the lenovo s
660 this is the smaller of the bunch but
it still comes with a very impressive
capacity in its battery at 3000 milliamp
hours along with the same processor that
it permeates throughout to the three
phones that Lenovo announced at MWC 2014
