the future but this week in what we
thought was going to be Joseph Hindi Zab
sins for a while there we brought on
nirav gondia to come with us and talk to
us about flagships versus mid-range and
if it's even worth it to buy flagships
now that the mid-range game is getting
better and better every year now Joe did
eventually get online just in time for
him to join in so we have five people on

so how about that money doing what
everyone was to take Joe's throne and
didn't joke lies it's ridiculous cuz
I've only told one joke two of them all
I turned I did have to did not i do like
two weeks in a row and now I I keep
forgetting to do it because I you know
for those listening we sort of the
podcast super late tonight because of me
because I got slightly i watch explain
what so I'm me yeah I guess it's the NHL
playoffs what you want for me and I
bought a new 3ds games are just like I
had like my headphones is like watching
the game and playing video games and I
saw my phone with blinking like crazy
just do what she like where the where
the hell are you man it's understood
podcast I did not think that I was like
oh it's 1130 I just chose on the
silent do to do to do I have no
obligations tonight well one of the
auxiliary benefits of Joe being
massively late let's not let him live
that down is that we actually have a
guest with us we started off this
podcast as a four-person thing but we
always were open to having more people
on and one person who's been super super
eager to be on the Friday debate podcast
is right over there near ave hey guys so
um Ravi came on fairly recently and he's
a writer with us and if I'm not mistaken
you might be doing some videos pretty
soon right yep I'm basically trying to
get involved on anything and everything
nice because you know why not very good
um well he's across the pond and by that
I mean he's out in the UK so it's really
late for a review right now so not if
you're mad at anybody be mad at joe yeah
joe we gonna have words off oh great
everybody wants to talk to me now how
are things going on that side of the
earth right now in your waiter of it uh
if I don't have to hear from another
politician on how they're going to
promise the world deliver nothing
they realize that they haven't got any
money to deliver anything I'll be a
completely happy man yeah I've been
following the news as well there's a lot
of that going around but then again we
have the presidential race coming up
here in the US and everyone is all about
how Hillary Clinton ate a burrito a few
days ago I don't know if you guys saw
that news story at all no but my
favorite thing that they've done is a
wiki link or WikiLeaks has like a red
arrow pointing right in their logo and I
guess Hillary Clinton has a red arrow
button right in her logo and they're
calling it like copyright infringement I
do not realize it's a WikiLeaks started
complaining about it that there was a
copyright on a red arrow pointing right
so you learn something new every day you
would be surprised just how many were
dig lyst things out there are
copyrighted like well who was it a Paris
Hilton actually coined and trademarked
the phrase that's hot really well we're
we're super happy to have navi on and
you know what with the topic that we
have this week and i'll go ahead and
have brushy sort of explain how we came
to the topic for this week which may be
the way we come up with topics most
weeks luck coming up we are going to
talk about flagship phones and mid-range
phones but i'll leave to our sheet to
explain exactly what we're going to be
talking about right now okay so some of
you may have saw that we shared on
google plus a pole where we had a few
different ideas that we thought of as a
team and then we let you guys decide
which ones you were most interested in
hearing and so basically we just want to
talk about which flagship I mean
nowadays now that the mid Rangers are
getting better and the gap is listening
between the two our flagship still worth
it for the average consumer basically
all right so there are a lot of phones
that we take a look at here at Android
authority and obviously you got folks
like me and lon generally taking a look
at the flagship devices but then we have
plenty of others on the team that take a
look a lot of mid Rangers but that being
said any of us who have gone to like say
a CES or at mwc will have had time with
mid Rangers as well other than that you
know we're probably using mid-range
phones or flagship phones on our own
times I know I know Joe has the m9 now
and Ravi wrote a
he wrote a piece about the m9 and just
before we got on the podcast they were
already about to get into a debate about
that phone so how about some let's start
off with our guests with the Arava here
so when it comes to flagship devices I
remember you just started looking at the
galaxy s6 and now you have the m9 my
thoughts so far about this crop flagship
devices that we're seeing for 2015 I
mean until the s6 they were just more of
the same I mean ok so the G flex 2 it
looks really nice but it's almost
identical to last year's just with a few
tweaks the thing about the chief looks
too is it's unique take the m9 and it
just looks like an m8 at least in my
opinion and I know Joe is not going to
be happy right now apologies in advance
Joe well maybe not the Essex the s6 edge
if there's anything about them is that
big like the edge especially oh my god
it it's so nice because it's so unique
there's probably the geek inside me
that's going it has to be unique to be
different and be worth it but the whole
point of a flagship is to show what's
possible I don't think the m9 I don't
even think unless Sony completely
radicalized there's EDD for that's
coming up whenever they announce it I
don't think the Zed Falls going to be
good enough a flagship kind of to
justify the price point you need more
than just your average oh here's what we
did last year and we're going to do a
little bit better it's the problem that
Apple has is the problem that everyone's
had but Samsung is the first to really
go okay clearly the galaxy s5 didn't
sell in the you know 50 gazillion that
we wanted to they only sold 40 so we
need to rethink the whole world and the
whole world's going to come to an end
unless we do this what did they have you
have possibly what's the best looking
android smartphone ever made no possibly
so Joe so give us a recap real quick
you're using m9 how long have you had it
for now oh just over two weeks okay so
how has your experience been with it
thus far my experience has been really
positive um it comes down to semantics
really like how you do
fine a word and you know like you know
Robbie's you know flagship is what's
possible um in my mind's eye that the
flagship is just the thing that they do
the best foot forward is all it really
is it's the phone from which all other
phones revolve around and in you know in
under that definition HTC One m9 is the
flagship phone for HTC and you know I I
acknowledges I think was last week at
the week before I acknowledge that the
HTC One m9 does not have a lot of
razzle-dazzle not a lot of unique stuff
from prior years but um I also said you
know last week week ago that it's okay
because HD of the HTC One series is
probably still among the best design
smartphones it the the problem is that
the design is getting old for people
because they want something new and
something you know different something
ridiculous like the s6 edge and that to
a lesser extent the G flex 2 and you
know that the standard candy bar you
know premium but I mean keep Mon this is
still an all-metal phone with some
really nice have really great bill
qualities and ridiculously good you know
stereo front-facing speakers it's not
like it's not bringing anything to the
table it's not like you know a galaxy s5
where it was like you know what is this
supposed to be different from you know
it's it's it you know I mean yes five
was not a great phone this is still a
great phone it just doesn't have you
know the wow factor and we talked about
the wow factor a lot of times especially
with Sony because so I mean you know nur
obviously something like oh yeah the z4
is gonna be sorry said for I don't know
how to say it yeah unless I do something
radical like Sony doing something
radical with their smartphones is like
toilets suddenly flushing differently
like it just doesn't you know it's not
gonna happen so you know the s6 edge is
going to be the winner this year in
terms of like wow factor and
razzle-dazzle but that doesn't mean that
the other smartphones or the other
flagships are bad it just means that
they're not as unique and you know
uniqueness is not a it's certainly you
know part of what makes a device good
but it's not like the one hundred
percent contributing factor whether or
not device is gonna be good or not you
know
yeah perhaps oh I love the analogy with
toilets that interesting with it it's
like honest basic Saudis mobile
divisions going down there anyways oh
holy we had a whole freakin podcast
where we all agreed to that we really
did but then neither the leaks of the z4
or the Zephyr yeah you know and you know
they're not they're not going in the
toilet per se but I guess they're
they're making it clear that with that
with a half year release cycle they know
that they're not going to necessarily
keep up with the latest and greatest
that's out there um I would stop short
of saying that they are in the toilet um
I just thought it was I just thought it
was funny that you know you could get a
new model toilet and then the could the
company's saying stuff that's new about
it when there really isn't look at some
bday now it's not like kind of like
exactly it's like the s6 edge is like
the toilet with the seat warmer whereas
the HTC one and nine is the toilet that
flushes it's like at the end of the day
they are both freaking toilets they both
freaking flush and it you know after
five minutes of sitting on one like
you're gonna notice the seat warmer
anyway so chillin just not a lot about
this apparently I have not so we're
worse so we're essentially establishing
what a what a flagship is especially
since we have some of the phones that
have come out already krushi and feisty
uh have you guys had any time with the
with the flagships that are out now I
know grocery you had some time with the
G flex 2 when we were out at sea yes but
what the Essex and the m9 have you guys
spent any time with those phones yet I
have yeah ok well which ones all of them
now Oh yep so would you when your
thoughts on how the flagship game is
working it because where i want to go
from here is we're establishing what a
flagship is but then the much more
loaded question coming after that is
what exactly establishes a mid-range
products and that's something we're
going to get into in a sec to me um I i
agree with navi i'm not impressed by the
m9 i mean it's not that's a bad phone
it's not a bad phone per se it's just
not what i would expect from a flagship
to me it feels more like a mid-ranger
honestly um it just I guess I kind of
think that you know flagship is they're
throwing everything with
possibly can especially now that which
we can we'll talk about later but now
that the gap has lessons and you're
seeing you know you're seeing quad cores
and even you know you're starting to
even see 1080p resolutions in the
mid-range and now that you're seeing all
of this the gap has listened so much
that the flagships need to raise up the
bar and I think Samsung did a great job
with that but HTC the spec said it
brings to the table we're seeing from
some adventures other than maybe the
Snapdragon you know 810 you know and so
I guess I just feel like the m9 hasn't
done enough to raise that bar and I'm
not for sure I have the Z forward rumors
claim that it's going to have an
all-metal body we weren't confident
enough on that rumor to post about it on
our site but that is the the going rumor
and supposedly it could have a which I
don't know this would make even sense
but supposedly will have a fingerprint
scanner in the power button I don't know
how that would work but that's what
supposedly they're do is gonna be a
humongous power button I know that's
what i was thinking it's like I don't
know how the heck they would even pull
that off but it was a semi credible
leaker so I'm not gonna get into a whole
lot but so there's that and then the LG
g4 I'm excited about it but I'm not for
sure if I personally like the leather
look I mean I think it's teach their own
I'm not necessarily impressed by the
look but I know there are people who
enjoy that um but I don't know I guess
the point is that I feel that a
flagships definition is something that
goes above and beyond and they need to
set themselves apart whether that's
design whether that's you know hardware
is harder to set yourself apart from any
more is the thing is I just don't think
hardware's where it is it has to pretty
much be design or software at this stage
you know hmm alright how about you
feisty have you spent time with the the
new flagships thus far I've touched the
m9 but but that's it so far the guy at
the local frys store he you know he had
an m9 out was willing to let me play
with it however when I asked about the
the galaxy s6 and the edge he's like you
can have it for zero down on a two-year
contract carrier that you really don't
want to use I'm like yeah great thanks
yeah I just want to see it alone
alright so um so we've been pretty
effective with the new and this is
coming from HTC Samsung LG obviously the
g4 is coming up in a couple weeks and
I'll be out there getting all of that
stuff ready for the masses to see what
that supposedly leather backing even
though that was a pretty substantial
league is going to be like well LG has
confirmed it now by the way oh they have
enough okay yeah they did this morning
well I can't wait to see what that means
yeah this is a very interesting move if
there's a guy who signed out it's more
dead cow on the back of my phone can't
wait for that I just don't have the
bothers me about it is anyone i think
that the stitching is odd i just don't
like the stitching in the middle wall
doesn't look good it looks like all it
that's what bothers me about it it's not
leather it's not leather that bothers me
it's the the placement of the stitching
i think is what i don't like about it or
even at least it's not fake stitching
like the gutter like yeah like the
Galaxy Note 3 with the poor bad yeah it
definitely lastic molding stitching on
the side of it to make it look authentic
even though there was no actual leather
or stitches on the pink at all it's they
yeah they officially said if like what
they called it like veggie edged I mean
aged leather or something so yeah it's
it is officially leather it's not it's
not a pleather or anything you know it
is actually legit veggie veggie what I
don't know it was like veggie aged or
it's the way that it was done was with I
don't know that's what it said on the
thing they beat the counter death with a
stalk of corn not for sure I'm not a
leather experts I'm never sure what that
means to say yeah they said a vegetable
tanned there we go vegetable tanned to
heathers cover I'm not exactly sure what
that means but I'm looking at all the
little connoisseur uh it sounded for a
second better take a wild guess that the
acidity from the vegetables it just
stains yeah probably so I don't know
well then that is a thing but it will
tell ya I'm not an expert on my first it
sounded for a second owner of you wanted
to chime in on the g4 say yeah i mean
the g4i the g3 was probably one of my
favorite devices i liked it apart from
little bits and bobs but
is something about that leaked design
that just kind of I mean the leathers
just an accessory it's one option but I
think that just the fact that they put
that leather leak out there always
leaked out there and I've got very kind
of my views are that companies the
pretty much everything themselves
whether they like to admit it or not the
fact that they've put that leather out
there from what I saw it's already put a
lot of people off it even though it's
just about cover yeah exactly it's uh I
really don't know what to expect from it
because it's it I do applaud them though
I mean they haven't confirmed it but if
you look at the early leaked images
there appears to be at least three
models that still have a plastic back so
if you don't like the leather at least
you have an option you know well then
the LG is why why why was that the leak
then that's what i was asking but also
the is it is it almost as if LG is
trying to go moto maker in a way or
something like that like ours is there
gonna be a wooden back or something like
that well i found it yeah i found it
interesting that the word choices i mean
granted yes it is technically a cover
but they didn't say in their official
confirmation they said as a leather
cover they didn't you know and I you
could interpret that as maybe it comes
with plastic but you have the options of
buying let you know the way that they
they worded it it's hard to say if it
actually comes with it or not I can you
know I can just already imagine having a
leather-bound phone in my pocket and
there's going to be just that if I'm
wearing like a pair of tight jeans that
that one section on my thigh is gonna be
sweaty as hell like I can't I'm not
looking forward to that at all but okay
we have so we have established what
flagship basically means to us but we're
going to get back to Russia's point that
the m9 might not necessarily feel
flagship we might feel closer to
mid-range but I wanted to go back to our
guests here in our ave on what
constitutes a mid-range device to you
and if you're able to give some actual
device examples I'll be great to see
this is probably the topic that you
could talk for 10 hours on because
everyone's gonna have different views
but my opinion is that a mid-range is
determined by price to kind of give it
some context because you get mid-range
devices that you make classified
mid-range such as I don't know just take
one of the minis as an exam
I think s5 mini or an s4 mini sorry that
that launched and it was like it is only
50 quid cheaper than the normal one but
the specs were stuff you'd might find
donor under a 50-pound phone so I can't
look to classify mid-range devices by
price and if I was going to talk about
what classifies like the best mid-range
is the ones that bring flagship
experiences it doesn't need to be
flagship specs it just needs to be a
flagship experience if you take like the
Xperia z3 compact and you took the
experience at 320 a compact bought the
exact same experience but to a lower
price point and it was the mid-ranger a
lot of people preferred it to the actual
was dead 3 itself but it wasn't as an
example the other kind of mid-range I
probably think about our like though
honor phones or while I even like the
likes of one plus one I would always
consider that as flagship device based
on the specs but because of where their
pricing it to kind of who they're
targeting if they're made the ideal
mid-range is one that kind of brings the
flagship specs to a mid-range price
point but is targeted the main consumers
the ones who can't afford to spend 500
pounds on the phone or in dollars 800
pounds I've conte under dollars off
contract on the phone the ones you can
only spend 3 400 or they want maybe
fifty dollars down on a phone that kind
of that's how you classify what two
mid-range and if you kind of look where
everyone's going it's but seeing the
flagship that are the be all and end all
but then everyone seems to be kind of
toying with trying to release this
release a flagship or flagship like
device in the mid-range just like Google
and deeper the Nexus until they made the
Nexus 6 and ruined everything well
that's a good point i was thinking about
price also and when you were saying that
price would make a mid-range i was
thinking like so what is a 1 plus then
is that like the mid-range killer like
it but it really isn't but um so yeah
it's a mixture of the two feisty where
do you where do you land on this this
this defining of a mid
yeah well yeah I'd like to think of it
as more than just a price tag but it
kind of is just the price tag determines
what a mid-range your phone is mom I
think there's more blur in between
budget and mid-range than there is
between mid range and and flagship at
this point and certainly that's changing
as the the flagship sorry as the
midranges get more and more powerful the
oneplus one for example I mean price
wise we like you guys just said we
considered a kind of a mid-range but it
certainly flagship material in the spec
sheet so yeah you look at those
specifications and nope it was like
pisces tablet is causing some problems
yep nope that goes there goes feisty
feisty what by the way back momentarily
focus these after these brief messages
all right so um yeah the Friday debate
podcast brought to you by fly grip on
the so grouchy how about how about you
going to chime in there um so feisty i
think is just about coming back on it
are you back there feisty oops i'm back
yes oh my goodness man go 45 sorry i
know it keeps dropping where did I where
did you lose me um somewhere in oh we're
numb the the line between mid range and
flagship was starting to blur yeah oh
wow we're at the beginning i rambled on
for two minutes you guys just ignored oh
no skype now you're talking about like
the what I was I mid-range was getting
more powerful like the one plus one yeah
and that's about where you cut out also
it was just me and I was ignoring a nice
job over there host yes
so yeah I mean really what I'm saying
there is uh yeah really just agreeing
with navi and joshua so far it the price
is ultimate definer for a mid-range ray
everybody's out you know if you're not
running the latest and best processor
and maybe down to just the one or two
gigabytes of ram not running the most
amount that's currently available for
flagships then you know the simple
definition it's not a flagship its
mid-range but certainly I mean there's
some budget phones that look really
great as well if you want to consider
like the Moto G range you know
performance wise never mind the spec
sheet performance wise there that's kind
of a mid-range phone in my books but
we'll stay at a budget for today we're
talking flexi i guess i would i would
personally consider the Moto G more of a
mid-range ER because of its experience
even if its pricing is even lower yeah I
was about to bring that up the Moto G
the middle I think it's about an example
for sure yeah yeah so the Moto e
obviously being the budget phone but
then they're always going to be those
people out there um this is just me sort
of pontificating here the the they're
always going to be people out there who
look at a phone that is about maybe sub
four hundred and still say that that's
too much in terms of price you know so
two people like that I suppose they
would say something like oh the Moto e
is the real mid-ranger it still provides
a decent experience and then they
realize they use the word decent and
then um so it's uh yeah price does have
a lot to do with it but specifications
and experience so brushy you were saying
that moto g would can be considered more
your mid-range let's say a line would it
be yeah I mean I find it interesting in
a way that I guess in my phone at this
point you have flagships you have
mid-range let me have you shouldn't
buy you know I guess you know I don't
even consider budget a category I figure
at this point you know to me midrange is
isn't really it is price to an extent I
guess anything but that price can can be
wildly you know anywhere from 180 to
like you know 400 bucks maybe you know
um to me at mid-range the only major
difference in
more between a mid-range in a flat I
think you know I thought was interesting
face was saying the blur between bit but
between budget and mid-range I think
there's a blur between all of it at this
point you know the budget mid-range
high-end you know there's the like I
said you're sitting octa cores and
you're seeing 1080p even and you know
lower-priced phones at this point you're
starting to and so uh you know I guess I
i feel like i would consider Moto G a
mid-range phone I wouldn't yes as a
budget price but I wouldn't consider it
a I guess to me when I think budget i
kind of think derogatory you know it's
garbage you know you did it it can
barely run you know it has you know you
could have like one app open at the time
hail or else it will crash well yeah
well which which begs the the the I was
about to say secondary but really the
third question here which is you know
who exactly who exactly is who actually
is the person defining what is a
flagship or a mid-range because we're
talking people in the West right now
it's all of us right now true hey you
know and we look at flagship oh that's
the phone that we want everyone's gonna
want that then mid-range oh you know
that's a good choice to have in the end
of the budget but two people two people
let's say in like developing countries
it's a whole different scale which is
what really intrigued me about this
topic is you-know-who so who exactly is
asking because we have a very diverse
audience in android authority and there
are plenty of people who only dream of
having flagships and oh yeah i think of
you asked a lot of these people what
they consider budget I think they'd
probably say sub-100 at this point you
know exactly they're like low and ruin
yeah exactly i think that would be
budget I guess I just feel like Moto G
Moto e maybe budget you know ty end but
you know it's a higher end of the budget
spectrum to me you know I guess I feel
like once you get above you know about a
hundred and you know $175 let's say once
you get close to 200 bucks I'd say
you're mid-range you know yeah exactly
and even though the blur and pricing I'm
sorry Feist none of those NAR everything
Oh was it Navi yeah that was me I'm so
where does this then kind of put the
likes the Chinese manufacturers who are
basic where would you put show me
everything I would say I've used a few
of theirs and I've saved but some are
there I think I can't remember which one
I used it was ridiculously cheap but it
would offer the Moto G style experience
or just not a smooth but it was well
under it was like under a hundred pound
sterling layered uh so it was about one
hundred and twenty dollars there you go
maybe I thank you for that rabbit it's a
good point yeah it's definitely you know
there is there like I said there's just
such a blurring of the lines anymore it
you know it's that's why I guess I felt
like you know flagships need to stand
out because it's just you don't need to
spend a lot of money to get a good phone
anymore you know bottom line you know I
mean my wife has a moto G and it's would
I use it as my daily driver / probably
not it's close there's just a few things
that keep me from considering it you
know worthwhile for me but would I
recommend it to someone who isn't
necessarily doesn't need a massive
screen doesn't need you know wasn't
gonna be watching videos on it much sure
it's a great phone I mean she's had no
issue with it whatsoever and it does
everything that my neck you know I use
the nexus 5 primarily now getting ready
to replace it but anyway it does
everything that my phone can do and it
just doesn't do it quite as well and so
like I said it's yeah there's definitely
it's all you know it just it makes you
appreciate how far we've come though cuz
there definitely was a major difference
between budget mid-range and flagship
like three years ago yeah yeah I
remember the galaxy ace yeah the galaxy
ace bone that phone was awesome first
ball that phone had one of the most
dedicated aftermarket developing
communities that I have ever witnessed
in my lifetime I used to work a lot I
pretty much everybody knows this point
before I worked in android authority
used to work at XDA as a writer and I
was writing about weird ridiculous crap
that they were doing with the galaxy ace
right up until i left XDA and that was
2013 the problem is you could do all
sorts for the galaxy ace says you went
to turn it on ago sorry got enough no
memory yeah i'm not saying i wanted to
have problem just I was just remarking
on on that they're after market
development is really really truly
impressive I think like maybe the gala
cs3 the HTC hd2 and maybe the HTC evo 4g
on sprint were the only other phones
that had like just such a huge community
of people that were trying to make the
phone not suck and it was really
impressed me all right well I'm tuner
obvious point actually uh you talk about
the Chinese manufacturers you know
that's that's that goes back to what I
was saying earlier about how different
markets have different ways of scoping
these things because obviously we're not
we think in terms of moto G because we
don't even have our hands on Xiaomi
around here you know you have to buy
that via other channels like you know
going eBay or something like that and
even though even then you're ever in the
UK you guys have Huawei's and we don't
here in the US which I wouldn't apart
from the PA we have huawei and we don't
because it's kind of let's put this
where the mate seven was six months ago
and it's still more available mmm i
allus creates going to be available here
before the mate seven is and when then
when huawei announcer mate 7 vodafone UK
were listed as one of their partner
networks it's been seven months we're
still waiting oh yeah is that Huawei its
new budget fonts coming to the US though
we're trying to snap to hmm it's a
hundred and eighty dollars snapdragon
for it's basically a moto g no it is
it's basically my review at te
everything's a moto g and yeah but it's
called a yeah well yeah ok budget
mid-range i gets to me there i don't
know there's a lot of blurring ok i'm
sorry there mid range I it's like
exactly I know it's a it is identical to
the Moto G spec-wise except for I
believe LTE is about the only major
difference I think it's displays not as
good as the same resolution but it's
it's like a TFT you know so it's not
quite as good of a display hmm so really
what I'm going from this is there's
really no industry standard and each
manufacturer is kind of setting their
own idea of budget midden flagship yeah
and yeah that was actually something up
I wanted to talk about for a second yeah
I mean let you guys talk about you know
like
lot of what you guys are saying is like
really existential like you know like oh
is the experience of the one m9 makes it
feel like a you know a mid-range phone
but then you know the experience that
you know what I look at something like
that the question I always ask is what
are the corners that they're cutting and
the thing is that you know you can add
that up in almost every instance and see
like literally where the price goes like
doesn't the Moto G have like a
Snapdragon s4 Snapdragon 400 or for 10
or something like s4 pro what does s4
pro was on what it was back in the day
yes go pro in the first one yeah yeah s4
pro than a 400 guys we're in the email
address that you know it was a
Snapdragon 400 in both moto g's yeah so
the I mean you know you have it when was
the last time Snapdragon 400 was the
flagship cpu right was it like two years
ago maybe longer no she was never a
flagship yeah oh yeah you're right but
you know you look back you know like at
the s600 are the Snapdragon 600 was in
the 1m yeah the other one m7 and the
galaxy s4 and then you know the Moto G
has the 400 so you can see you know
where they cut that corner and then you
know how much I have one gig you know in
today's flagships they all have three
gigs of ram so they like and you know
the camera is probably you know 8
megapixel from 2013 also and is it's you
know when you look at these kinds of
things that you can see where they cut
the corners to lower the price and I
think what the real difference is from a
couple of years ago is they found better
corners to cut to you know to where they
don't have to you know drop down into
that you know because you know mid-range
back in the day was like you know a year
pray and something else I guess I'm kind
of going in circles I'm sorry about this
guy's but you know you got to think
about that the differences in processing
power from one year to the next for a
good long time I mean we went from
single cord a dual core 2 quad core like
what three years yeah so you know so you
look back you like all right so we
released a mid-range flagship with last
year's flagship specs that was going
from a dual core to a single core and
then going from a quad core to a dual
core and like obviously it's going to be
a whole lot worse but now you know it's
all it's all quad cores now
and we're getting into octa-core is now
in the quad core still great device I
mean my note 3 still runs lollipop
pretty much flawlessly and it's a
Snapdragon 800 you know quad core
processor and that's a mid-range phone
today you know based on how much you can
buy it for so I think that you know that
you have all touched on it like just
like little tiny bits here and there but
at the end of the day it's really is
where do they cut the corners any and
you know with what and it may not even
be specs in the phone it could also be
something like you know um this is gonna
sound really terrible i'm not gonna
listen examples but like you know
quality assurance you know maybe quality
assurance gets a little bit of a you
know takes a little bit of a back seat
to keep those costs down a little bitter
they hire a smaller staffer there you
can't ramp up production is like a the
oneplus one well i was gonna say one
plus one yeah they had some quality
assurance issues and they've had
production issues because their team is
very very small and that's how they keep
their costs down and I you know so I
when I think of a flagship I think of
something that doesn't cut any corners
and you look at the galaxy s6 in the s6
edge the One m9 the LG g4 up maybe
hopefully the Sony Xperia z4 and you
look at you know three gigs of ram the
most recent processing package the best
screens available today well the HTC One
was a calculated risk but they got the
bigger batteries you know they're not
cutting slack on the batteries they're
not cutting slack on the camera sensors
now in HD sees you know against HTC here
they really screwed up their software
but that you know the hardware is still
good like what I'm holding in my phone
are in my hand right now is a 650 dollar
phone there's no ifs ands or buts about
it it is aluminum it's got a huge
battery in it the three gigs they ate
the octa-core 64bit cpu from snapdragon
you know it's got everything that a
flagship should have it has the best
that's available today and that's the
way that I look at flagships versus
mid-range you know you look at the you
know the one plus one it had a what was
in it a Snapdragon 800 bird 801 which
phone again the one plus 100 8a the 800
now right so that was you know the 80
ones in the 80 fives were already out
then they were using the last year's
processor so they
I cut a little bit of cost there and you
know that's I think there is still a
very good very solid line that you can
draw between flagship and mid-range and
I think it's just once you ask the
question where do they cut the corners
okay now so that's what the rifle one
plus one was a etowah now that i think
about it wasn't it was a doing well it
was still almost positive is a no one
okay where they releasing the 805 time
it was announced it was announced when
it was first announced they said 800 and
then they change their mind right before
release yeah I'm almost positive that
okay yeah yeah I do what's that like
eight and a half nine months between
houseman really hyperbole hyperbole for
comedy guys I'm not actually it was nine
months I was expecting to hear Mike drop
after joke said all that stuff think
it's like as I SAT here and listened you
guys talked for like ten minutes about
it and I'm like you know you guys are
all saying the exact same thing just in
different words and you're not pushing
it out as much because he like I think
feisty said it at some point and then
like russia says I'm like all you guys
have said it at some point I'm just kind
of summing up what everybody's saying
cuz i agree with it you know it's you
know you're not gonna get you know the
galaxy s6 edge camera on a mid-range
device so obviously there is a big huge
line there and yellow mesh or on a One
m9 m what Dylan of it so okay Joe I
completely get you there but hold up
didn't HTC cut corners with the one m9
display you said it was a calculated
risk there's a calculated risk because
of the battery not because of the price
it's still a I mean it's only fifty
dollars or hundreds less expensive than
it is a hundred dollars that's expensive
than the galaxy s6 I just looked on
amazon it's 750 bucks for factory
unlocked galaxy s6 650 bucks for factory
unlocked HTC One m9 so it's a hundred
dollars cheaper but I mean it's a
calculated decision based on the battery
because 1440p sucks up a lot of battery
it wasn't like something they're like oh
we're trying to cut costs and cut game
to get it out at a lower price because
it you know I mean at least over here in
the States everything is zero dollars
down everywhere right now so okay on all
right unbusy talking about where you cut
corners let's take something like and
the Huawei honor 6 plus
the specs list on that is flagship it's
got a very very good display it's
completely solid it's got break it's got
great but I think it's a quad-core karen
925 or an optical karen 925 one of the
two it's got two or three gig ram where
are they cut corners for that because
what some chickweed what was fun is a
tee on a 6 plus the honor our six all
right I'm gonna go look this up really
quick keep talking promise i promise i'm
listening I just haven't seen this phone
I think I look I think out of all of us
only i have only actually no ave and i
have messed with the honor 6 plus i
agree with you is Erin Ivie there or it
has managed to be a phone that is pretty
affordable for a lot of people and yet
it has the same specifications as a lot
of the flagships out there and if you're
comparing it to the m9 yeah on paper it
does definitely sound like it's kind of
keeping up with the m9 which is
considered a flagship high-end let's say
expensive device well I you think I'm
looking at here what the hell is
hisilicon Karen okay 25 ok so hisilicon
karen is josh you on da game hisilicon
karen processor is basically to huawei
what XE nose is too samsung it's their
in-house made processing system
processing package i should say and to
that point it works it's gold wonderful
it's so good and adds I've been
impressed by it with him 87 the mate 7th
floor I mean if you I've been playing
with the p8 and wow the kirin knowing 30
stocks man 35 depending on the version
is outstanding to the point where
although while a kind of mu mu i is
probably slightly heavier and clunkier
than senses the PA it's a lot faster
than my m9 i can see where joe i can see
we're just coming from though because we
have so many snapdragons in America that
when you see anything different like
MediaTek rhinos media tackle a well I
don't know it's a thing no I know what
media tech is an egg's knows I know what
all of them are I've just never heard of
the high silicon it's all today yeah
it's Huawei's that's probably the one of
you don't have to outsource their chips
you know to another company they so they
get to cut prices a little bit that way
that you know there's also that thing
you guys remember that the nexus devices
were sold under
cost in order to gain market share right
you guys remember that or they were
trying to promote the Play Store or
something like that they're trying to
make the nexus devices super cheap to
encourage other people to sell cheap and
I remember there was a big it was a big
thing about it the the the nexus 4 was
sold under cost so that people would buy
it well you could say the same thing
about the oneplus one also they they
they sold it but like way below what you
would expect that phone to be just so
they can get you know recognition and
yeah like you said it's probably they're
probably other taking a hit to it or you
know they were taking advantage of the
fact that all the stuff was done
in-house I mean you don't have to
outsource and stuff you know
distributions a little bit easier you
know getting all the parts together um
you know it is and another thing you
know first of all I don't think anyone
should be having any software
discussions of any kind until Android
fixes the memory bug absolutely none I
will not hear it okay no offense I'm not
saying anybody stupid or anyone's needed
or anything I just simply refuse to talk
about any software optoma optimizations
and he's how software acts or anything
like that until my system stops taking
up 1.1 gigabytes of RAM for no frickin
reason and that is Android and google's
fault not the one m9 not any other
device not any manufacturer that is
androids problem so until Android fixes
androids problem I don't really want to
hear about well you know the software
runs better because you know it's it's a
matter of if the system if Android is
taking up so much RAM that the stuff
that's already installed on the device
can't run then it's not really that
stuff's fault you know that's why the
that's why Samsung started putting three
gigs of ram in their Galaxy Note devices
because s-pen took up extra ram it
wasn't for performance it was because
they had extra software extra bloat that
needed to run and in this case I mean
Android these days is heavier than
TouchWiz so I mean you know if if the if
the wall way you know thing is using up
less ram than senses then yeah it's
going to be a little bit more study on
the one m9 it's just gonna happen I've
noticed it too mmm so this is what i
mean so this is what Joe's like after
midnight after watch after getting riled
up by a hockey game really yeah you've
been on a brother that's he has been so
much so much
so much of our conversations are so
philosophical like how does the device
feel and you know how well does it work
in your day-to-day activities you know
depending on whether you watch videos or
play video game you know the fact of the
matter is if software were absolutely
perfect you know you'd probably not see
too much of a difference and the
software isn't perfect and for once it's
not the fault of the OEMs and that's
something that really gets on my nerves
because like four years you know for
years and years and years OEM skins were
given the worst rap and you know that
they've all been you know streamlining
their stuff you know this year's
TouchWiz is like what the best touch
switch of that TouchWiz of all time
right yes the best touch wedgie you know
and no sense no sense d bloated a few
years ago and all that jazz like OEM
skits are getting smaller and smaller
and smaller and better and better and
better but now Android screwed up royal
and it's just like the idea life hearing
something like you know well HTC Sense
is you know bloaty and bad no it's not
no it is not HTC Sense is not blody and
bad at all it's Android screwing up the
works this time well I agree with you
about sense not being bloody I've got
agrees well because as much as it sounds
like I hate dm9 and would like to throw
it off a bridge I love sense yeah I
think it's still by far probably one of
the best Android interfaces hell I've
been using sense since the HTC hd2
windows mobile hmm that's how back I
that's how much I like HTC's interface
and it gets better and better every
single year yeah i wanna i completely
agree that sense is kind of like up
there with the best interfaces on any
device whatsoever yeah i'm not saying
anyone doesn't like it or anything like
that it's just it's frustrating to hear
you know like you know oh you know this
device lags this device stutters like
you know mmm i can't think of a
different way to phrase this but um it's
it would just be a it's impossible it is
impossible to comment on the experience
of any device running Android 5.0 or 5.1
right now it is impossible because
Android is broken currently it is broken
and there is no denying that the memory
bug is right there you can google search
it right now
and find evidence of its existence in
both versions until five point two or
five point one point one comes out and
that memory bug is fixed and these
flagships are updated to that so that
the memory management is actually
functional I think it's really unfair to
compare experiences because right now in
KitKat has the superior experience right
now guys hey that's the log I mean I
can't if I could run KitKat on my 1am 9
I'd be freaking running KitKat on my one
at nine cuz I I mean I hate lollipop on
this phone right now and I think that
that I think that's part of the thing
that makes it cuz ain't I agree it feels
like a mid-range phone sometimes but
that's why is because the software is so
unwise dright now that it's it's causing
little blips in like my applications and
it's just it's frustrating it really is
let me tell you what happen to be here
the other day with this moto G he's got
5.5 o to install death would and you
know it doesn't stutter very much
talking about that experience but I
tried to make a phone call yeah I
couldn't get through it just kept
crashing the phone I these are phones
first right not yours first could not
make a phone call so it's sounding to me
Joe that okay so so back to our question
yeah yeah we've talked yeah we've danced
around that we haven't even been I
wanted to make sure we covered all of
our bases and Joe definitely make sure
that which is which is great I'm just
I'm just I'm just drinking the chain
over there brother so uh Joe on the
question of our flagship still worth it
if the mid-range game is getting a lot
better it's sounding to me so just since
you are an owner of an m9 and despite
your gripes about the m9 experience at
the moment would it be safe to say that
you would still prefer the flagship
lines because of what the mid-range may
or may not be able to offer we have
reached the point where the answer that
question is exactly the same as it is in
the laptop market do you need a
two-thousand-dollar alienware laptop no
then don't get one you know it's same
thing with flagship phones these days if
you don't need something you know with
the eight cores in the three gigs if you
need something just search facebook and
you know calls people well
don't get a moto G or you'll end up like
feisty but um I know can't make a call
goodness but you know you know you know
we're getting to that point we don't
need it anymore I mean you know I can
render videos and do my job on a
six-hundred-dollar 700 laptop these days
I don't need the $1,500
two-thousand-dollar razor aces raag
flagship you know alienware laptops and
it's the same thing with smartphones I'm
not so high up you know on my HTC One m9
love that I say that people absolutely
need to buy these things they you know
you can totally get away with getting a
mid-range phone and have a totally great
experience but just realize that
something you know a corner was cut to
get to that price point and it's exactly
the same thing with laptops you get a
seven hundred dollar laptop you get up
you know a gtx 660m with probably an Ivy
Bridge I seven process I'm an integrated
graphics that's what you're gonna get
that's good not necessarily but
especially for though but you know if
you're playing league of legends or
world of warcraft like you're ever gonna
frickin notice you just have to turn the
graphics down the medium you'll never
know you can still render videos on a
660m i used to do it all the time but
you know the people who benefit from
something as powerful as a flagship
phone or a flagship you know laptop or
power users are the people who are going
to be pushing this phone all day and
night doing all kinds of different stuff
and I mean let's face facts you know the
way things are I mean people just don't
need that that much anymore well how
about where you were going earlier about
build quality in the aluminum slabs
sitting in your hand right now it would
would be would it be safe would it be
what did suffice to say that people who
really want that particular aspect but
they don't need the rest would that
justify someone going for a flagship
over a mid-range because are there any
mid-range devices that are offering that
kind of design feel I'm thinking about
that right now and I'm sure that there
are like I'm sure that there are some of
the Xperia z3 compact right yeah I've
gotten my hands on that but I me that
that the build quality on that is
fantastic mm-hmm um I mean the glass
back i don't like glass backs you know
because I'm i drop things on carpeted
floor
in my my nexus 4 shattered being dropped
on carpet the back did so I don't like
last backs anymore but uh you know I
mean there are mid-range flagships that
have decent build quality I just don't
think you're gonna get I'm gonna sound
like such a shill right now but ACC not
the only that does this you know a phone
that's been especially shaved out of a
single block of aluminum you know you
know you don't get the same phrase like
she seemed paying you by the iphones the
same ways isn't the iphone machine out
of a single block of aluminum it's just
all buzzwords honestly like still I mean
it's not like um you know I mean the
galaxy s is six you know it's the same
thing isn't like it's the whole the
frame is entirely aluminum with like a
piece of glass shoved in the back of it
um you know I mean these are you know
this required some effort to build
whereas you know you look at like a
nexus 5 Nexus 5 was a slab of plastic
you know I'm holding one in my hand it's
a slab of plastic with a spray rubber
coating on the back of it essentially
you know this phone was did not take a
lot of effort to make and you can feel
it when you pick it up like it feels
like a hollow little phone you know and
you can hope I don't I remember you did
you do a drop test on a nexus 5 and it
broke so bad you could see the circuit
board we don't talk about that cuz i did
it in front i did it in front of the
android statues in san francisco oh yeah
that's nice my remembering is like you
drop your phone and it's like I really
one was like sacrilegious is sacrilege
yeah you can see that you could see the
yellow circuit board on the back and
like it's like that's obviously where
they cut the corner that and the camera
and the battery yeah oh well you know
we're really lucky that we're using
skype for this call because with the
many things we've said about Google and
lollipop and the fact that I dropped the
nexus 5 the days after i came out at the
Google headquarters if we were using a
house it boo we good thing you will have
been cut off like right then in there
well yeah you were you were saying Joe
but no is it that you can have a great
experience you just you know I'm not
saying you can't have a great experience
I'm just saying that there were corners
cut to get it down that low
and as long as you understand that and
you understand you can cut you can get
different corners cut depending on who
you go with you get the Xperia z3
compact you're not compromising build
quality you're probably compromising
something else but you know but it
display a gardener of it it was sorry i
was just saying on this entry compact
will be just a despite uh 727s early so
they played literally like one penny for
that because after just trying to get
them out of the warehouses at this point
but he not you so you sacrifice little
bit of screen do you get a better batter
you get a better battery and better
build quality or you can have the
up-to-date specs and maybe have a lesser
battery-less your screen or bless your
camera you know like you just have to
know what you're getting yourself into
and you can have you know i don't use a
camera on a smartphone hardly ever so
this that the camera issues on every
phone i've ever owned doesn't apply to
me i don't care say I'm glad you brought
that up now as I I'll go ahead and
answer the question right now is I don't
think that like especially with the new
crop of flagship star coming out now I
do think that there's a distance again
between the flagships in the mid ranges
primarily because I am that kind of user
I need a great camera I want to Seattle
for a few days this past weekend and i'm
sure people people have seen in the
camera shoot out for the essex that I
put out and I brought both of my
production cameras with me My gah for my
gx7 I brought both of them with me
expecting to take pictures everywhere
and on that first night my my buddy who
we were staying with Broadus thoughts a
pike place market and I didn't have any
time to grab my cameras they were so in
my luggage I just had my s6 edge on me
and I just started using that it was on
that day that I realized I don't need to
bring my cameras with me everywhere all
the time anymore and that is just simply
an experience that even in the in the
flagship game I can only get on an S six
because lord knows what what's going on
with the m9 software upgrades whatever
its camera just doesn't do it for me
same thing with the G flex 2 the g3 and
the g3 they they're kind of their there
they're not too far away that it's laser
guided autofocus is auction is actually
really great but in terms of quality i I
need my s6 edge now and you just won't
be able to get anything like that in the
mid-range market I do think that
especially if you look at it
lens no pun intended it's going to have
that that discrepancy and that that that
gap is is widening I don't I love the
mid-range game don't get me wrong i but
but I I understand the mid-range game in
terms of other people I'm very
empathetic to the people who need to
spend less on the phone but for for the
flagship game oh man like where we're
kind of at a crossroads now there's this
there's this evolution that I feel like
it's happening this year and I can't
wait to see what the g4 does despite its
weird looking leatherback that looks
like a crotch I'm just gonna sign but
yeah and then this is it for but I was
going to go over to Navi anyway so the
what were you gonna say how would you
answer this question arriving oh yeah I
was actually just trying to come in and
answer this because i was i was going to
talk about first he on your point of
cameras is kind of off topic but i did
warn you in advance that i rambled for
it england pretty much um probably the
note for is when smartphone cameras
finally became good enough to use anyway
angry and then the s6 has kind of taken
it cuz I've I probably only ever taken a
hundred pictures across in four years on
a DSLR like out and about I'm one of
these people who shoots on this photo
know me on this phone because you know
why the hell not it's the best camera is
the one you have on you and that's
obviously what smartphones Allah for
answering this question going back to
one of the 109 obviously they haven't
done a mini version this year but in
previous years you could have got the
HTC One mini which brought the same
design but completely tanked on the
specs I think was it the first one mini
that had a cute like qhd not quad HD but
quarter HD display yeah I think it was
something 60 quid cheaper than the
original yeah I remember that was the
one m7 mini of another second in in in
their defense that was back before OEMs
understood how to do that yeah you know
because it was a point with a from the
Moto X 2013 on forward OEM finally
figured out how to do a mini mid-range
kind of phone without screwing
everything up so everything before that
I kind of give it a wash you no just
like all right that was a learning
experience you guys did it wrong you
would nobody you're totally right that
but
balls like I'm not saying it didn't if
it was freakin garbage but she's you
know I was selling phones back in that
day and I remember selling about five
and four of them didn't work before they
even left the shop oh no oh my goodness
so that means you technically so online
basic basically yeah and then a couple
more came back as well okay so did you
have morn arriving uh oh no sorry I was
just that was me alright so let's go
road if I see then how would you answer
this question on on flagships and
midranges because you're well you just
give us a story about the Moto G not
really doing it for you so where would
you stand then on the mid-range /
flagship battle yeah there's two kind of
ways of looking at this I absolutely
believe in budget / mid-range devices
but you guys already know I've got a six
basically budget phone sitting here on
the desk but the reason that I have them
the reason that I want them i almost
said need them it is for specific
reasons i mean one of them is purely
being used as an mp3 player which i mean
i bought it for twenty dollars an mp3
players twenty dollars you know it
doesn't make much of a difference so and
if you have those sorts of needs or you
can split up your devices for single
purposes really or you know just a few
purposes / you know maybe you have one
that's dedicated to the doc in your car
you know it's a dash cam kind of thing
or music player mp3 is obviously you
know or just one phone specifically that
maybe it's waterproof and you take it
swimming you know it in these particular
cases a mid-range and even the budget
ranges I think are priceless but exactly
what you said all I've got is these mid
and budget rage phones I tried to do
something with it something legitimate
with it and it completely failed me so I
really I mean I'm shopping for a
flagship level phone right now
at the m9 I'm not sold on it that the g6
is as well I just so I'm really hoping I
don't know about the LG but I think I'm
waiting to see what the Sony's got the
Zed 4z for and I think that you know
right now i'm holding out to see what
they bring to the table did you say GG 6
earlier just trying yet that's why i was
gonna like cs6 i'm sorry it's not as
late here but I'm Pisces been holding
out on us tonight he's got the g six
already yeah or mumbling through I
apologize one day we're gonna do a
podcast like early in the morning and
you know what it might actually help
Navi in particular if you'll be able to
do a podcast in the afternoon rather
than what is it now almost six o'clock
for you it's called just six but yeah
sure guys listen if you want to do one
early in the morning for you guys I am
super happy for sure hey you know what
meet meet meet you guys it's approaching
last call here's what is interesting
because uh whenever we did the
scheduling I mean we're up to wide
episode 12 13 now like we always we
always just a faltar going at night here
in the US winning I'm totally okay with
it okay um alright so safe ramble on for
17 minutes at a time sorry about that
about all the pot I think about how much
lollipops sucks and I'm fed up with it
now I guess imagine fed up with lollipop
just imagine Joe going doing something
very random during his day and you cease
like a lollipop on a table just smashes
it it's like damn you lucky all
right so now we have brushy brushy where
do you stand on the flagship and
mid-range so actually you know I agree
with you that the I think 2015 exciting
year period for all of the sides of it i
mean i've seen some really exciting you
know mid-range devices too and i'm
really interested to see we're seeing a
lot of growth of devices that don't
quite fit the mid-range definition but
don't quite fit the flagship definition
either you know the one plus you know
I'm 1 + 2 i'm sure will be along that
line le TV you know
having their new phone super phones as
they call them and those look really
impressive Snapdragon 810 yeah they call
me super ten Snapdragon 810 you know you
know all the high-end specs you would
expect from a flagship but they're going
to come into the u.s. supposedly and
they're aiming for like a what four
hundred five hundred dollar price tag um
you know and you're seeing the zenfone 4
I mean up for I'm sorry zenfone 2
zenfone 2 you know and that's an
impressive phone right there I've I
haven't had the opportunity to mess with
it yet but just watching lawns review
and just doing my research on it um i
actually have considered buying one as
one of my main phones yeah you know just
because I support I want to support
growth in the mid-range because I think
it's uh I think it's important that more
people be able to afford smartphones and
be able to you know I think it's I want
to be able to you what that sorry bruh
she going no it's alright what's up
Robbie I was going to say do you think
we're at a stage where it's no longer
just your budget mid-range a flagship do
we need a level in between budget and
mid-range and another level between mid
range and flagship I think I think we
kind of do it's just it's hard to uh
it's hard to find the line I think we
already do I mean cuz like i said i
consider the Moto G a mid-range but then
the zenfone 2 is a mid-range yet the
difference in specs is slowly
substantial yes you know why don't we
just move over to like how we do it in
taxes in the US we have upper class
upper middle class middle class middle
lower class lower class someone salty
about paying taxes the other day or poor
homeless and then Joe handy so hey guys
look at it you bring up the yeah you
bring up the zenfone 2 which I thought
was a good I have been thinking about
the whole time we were doing this like a
sous is an interesting company where it
seems as if the phones now not really
counting the PadFone and the zenfone
zoom which could be conserved fringe
products but their mid their actual like
real top like their their their flagship
phone let's differentiate between
flagship and high-end
at this point yeah it's the zenfone 2 is
considered their flagship it's not what
we would consider a flagship but it's
close I mean performance wise I mean
four gigabytes of RAM it's kind of hard
to beat I no no yeah personally I would
love to see what that zenfone zoom is
like and I'm still I I hope one day I'll
be able to pick up that panasonic lumix
phone yeah I know you were hardest phone
to come here you have it there we have
it here 799 pound sterling sana I know
one part I know two people have bought
it that mean they're both the same
person and the bottom twice within about
an hour have you heard any like real
world reactions to like how it works in
them in daily usage or what um not
really I think the common consensus is
the camera is incredible the rest isn't
no I was kind of expecting that to be
honest yeah to that point I mean there's
another whole different market that we
could talk about it different podcasters
you know that the fringe products the
the Maxis of the world or the zooms or
the lumix camera phones of the world but
yeah brushy you were did I didn't catch
it if you finished your point on on our
question here um well basically uh
something up actually a lot of what's
been said there are a lot of great
phones out there um like I said I've
actually i'm at the point where i'm
ready to buy a new phone and i haven't
decided I've actually not for sure if
I'm gonna stay with the flagship I've
like the zenfone 2 impresses me and I I
may end up granted i think that the four
gigabyte model still gonna be four
hundred dollars or so so it's not it's
like it's not quite mid-range and it's
not quite flagship in the pricing cuz i
mean if you look at like LG their their
pricing for their flagships this point
are only around 500 or so so you know i
don't know about the g4 who knows that
could go more expensive but i doubt it i
have a feeling that g4 will be around
500 to 600 dollars somewhere in there
and so do people need you know down to
the actual question do people need
flagships anymore it comes down to you
know what Joe said in a way I mean do
you mind those cut corners I mean and
it's true they're all having cut corners
i mean the the zenfone 2 uh it has an
intel processor which I don't mind intel
processors but I know a lot of people
consider that right there a deal breaker
you know in the mobile world and it's
also the design i mean it's it's an
attractive-looking mid-ranger but it's I
don't know if I would call it unique
either it's you know basically they took
the LG you know G design from the g2 g3
and then they put the power button on
top which is a weird placement and so
basically they kind of just bastardized
different elements from other you know
you know one which is usually what the
what the you know what companies do in
the mid-range or in china too for that
matter which this is an attorney's phone
but you know my point is basically
you're not gonna get a you not gonna get
a high-end design you're gonna be
missing out on a few small specks but if
you're willing to if you're okay to live
with that then yeah there's no point in
getting a flagship a lot of the reason
to get flagship at this point is for the
status of it to be honest I mean you
know to your nerd cred basically you
know that's a big reason to do it at
this point I mean yeah there are other
reasons I actually agree with you Josh
that if you're into camera experience on
your phone yeah you're not gonna get it
on a mid-ranger that's just a fact to me
that that's what that that's the line
really you need to be though coming from
a nexus 5 anything I can go to a
mid-range and I've like this camera is
awesome you know so cuz I have a nexus 5
which has a nice sure you go back to a
flip phone and yeah I just can't resolve
and I'll be like oh brushy oh you just
don't know but you know um so yeah I
mean but I do think that tub the answer
this question there is no cut you know
there is no a you know the answer is
very personal depending on who you ask
and I would say it's very regional to
you know well for us you know for a lot
of people in markets were you know
merging markets etc we aware that you
know for the u.s. let's be honest I mean
the difference for us to raise you know
three hundred dollars as opposed to us
raising six hundred probably isn't a big
deal to us
a three four hundred dollar price
difference to someone in a developing
country or an emerging market over will
you want to call it um that's a huge
deal you know yeah that's always where
I'm gonna go when it comes to questions
like this is I'm always gonna think
about like my relatives and the
Philippines and I've said this a couple
of times on the podcast before but like
you know my dad goes back to Philippines
and brings back phones that we don't use
anymore just for the people that he
knows back there so when I think about
mid-range devices in that sense like oh
yeah mid-range devices are really
closing the gap that's amazing you know
and I can't wait to see you know all of
my friends and relatives back in the
Philippines actually using these phones
you know and having the kinds of
experiences that I can have on a
flagship maybe just a little bit lesser
you know but but still you know they'll
be don't have their foot in the door and
that's all that they need really but
yeah if you don't have a lot of money
you know whether you live in a country
where you just don't make as much sure
you just don't make as much wherever you
live uh is it worth it when you you
don't know it's not in my opinion if you
have money to burn sure yeah there's
there's benefits i mean there's obvious
benefits design you know there's specs
that there's obvious benefits but if
money's tight no save your money you
know we're also i look at it anyway you
know yeah you know i have i have two
kids and i have a lot of commits so to
me I that's the reason of Nexus 5 is I
got a flagship like I mean it was a
flagship device but I got a flagship
like experience but it wasn't expensive
and you know yes I could afford a
flagship device but I would rather spend
that money on you know things for my
kids or vacation or you know so just
depends on what your priorities are
bottom line you know grisha's humble
bragging right now I just saying it
might ask one question when you guys are
ready yeah sure it kind of back tracks a
little bit here in the topic of you know
what is mid-range what is flagship how
much weight do you guys put on
benchmarks like n22 benchmarks and stuff
myself personally it's an afterthought
yeah but what do you guys think I I feel
the same way especially in the flagship
game there's really little that like if
we were to put into our reviews listen
listen listen Shing personally I
don't think that the common consumer
which is who we mostly cater to would
look at that and say that this number is
higher than this number i'm going to go
for the higher number when there's so
much more to a phone that matters um i
think that it has to do with the numbers
themselves i don't think it matters
because the numbers are always so close
anyway I mean it's like oh and just like
I don't know how to to scoring works
pacifico this phone has a 35,000 and
this phone has a 35,000 and to this
phone has a 30 4098 clearly it's lagging
behind the competition guys so um like I
think that if it's like a huge gigantic
number of like once it you know getting
the 35,000 and then another one's
getting like you know 15,000 I think
that matters I think that's what I think
that's worth looking at but if it's you
know like you know it's really close to
it no it doesn't matter at all well on
the problem with benchmarking is correct
me if I'm wrong because I'm not I don't
put a lot of weight into benchmarking
but I mean I know it's a very it's an
inconsistent thing I mean you can run a
benchmark multiple times and get
different results within a certain
variants right oh yeah well you you
should be doing the edible tests on the
same boy yeah I suppose you'll come up
with an average but I'm saying it's just
I guess to me it's just I just don't
think it's worth putting weight in you
know that that's why I said there has to
be that huge gigantic gap there like if
it's you know a couple even if it's like
30,000 a 35,000 nah don't worry about it
but you know again like you know if it's
something so gigantic sigh half the
score like one third the score one
quarter the score then I'd probably look
into that other device and see why it
scored so low you know maybe they cut
corners on the on the GPU in the CPU you
know the SOC you know is you know
there's something going on there that's
preventing that phone from doing
anything you know well I know Rob pretty
much by our time this is totally off
topic but I kind of got thinking about
it just watching a lot of the reviews
recently that you know that we've been
putting out and stuff and maybe it's
always been this way but it seems like
recently we're seeing a lot of phones
that in you know Josh you'll be able to
comment on this for sure we're seeing a
lot of phones that we get a repartee you
know
they automatically they set a reputation
and the thought of a certain way and
we've even seen this with smart watches
and then all of a sudden it's a few
updates later and they're they're way
better it seems like we're seeing more
devices that are optimized out of the
box no of court no definitely has
that always been the case or is it just
more recently now it just seems like
I've been noticing it more recently it's
been no more recently now because
Android is messed up no jobs like Josh
to you I mean I think that's been up at
always issue to be honest or I mean it's
been it's been okay in the past it was
more the case with some manufacturers
than others but it does yeah it does
seem like that that is because it seems
like every phone that's coming out I'll
like you'll see some posts about oh this
updates now fix the battery issue or
this updates now fix this well this is
what this is the thing that I always
think of when I when I see those is just
how much can you really fix with a
firmware update and you know what what
the thing that bothers me most about it
it doesn't bother me too much that the
firmware updates have to happen after
the launch but what bothers me is that
they just kind of assumed that they can
fix so many things in a device that's
already completely packed together no
injustice outlets you know and they
promised a lot but this is the thing
that pisses me off most about it is um
if I'm doing a review and you know maybe
maybe we have some representatives from
the companies in our ear you know and
and you know they're they're looking for
this or that and you know they're
helping tests and stuff like that
especially when it comes to our first
looks and stuff like that when they keep
telling us that we shouldn't show this
or that or they would like it for us not
to because there's going to be a
software update anyway and this is all
in terms of like embargo stuff usually
would be mad about it is if this is the
production unit just because you're
going to update something later doesn't
excuse how it performs now and that's
the problem always gets me when it comes
to stuff like that this is something
I've commented on before I don't think
it was in the podcast but I think I've
written pieces about it before um
android is an extreme as it has an
extremely Spartan release cycle um you
know you look at like everything else
like everything else in technology how
often do things get refreshed every sing
year you know like we're not getting a
PS five in this year we didn't get one
last year you know I'm rocketing one
next the year after this one you know
it's it's going to be several years
before the xbox two in the PS five come
out and you know like you know
televisions are the same way I think my
i bought my television ATP television
like five or six years ago and 1080p
televisions have made very little
strides since then and you know so the
way I look at it you know think the
reason why you no cell phones and you
know the android the OS and everything
is just everything so Spartan you know
that they have the next version of
android is going to be out in freakin
six months and they haven't even fixed
the one that's out yet you know and a
she sent us back to law is not bashing
yeah well it's a little part of a larger
point crushy I do that Samsung's already
working on the s7 HTC is already working
on the m10 LG's already LG probably has
it it was probably already working on
the what is it they're releasing for
this year right yes they're probably
already working on the five like the the
the time frame to get these things right
is so slim that you know it's inevitable
that eventually you know the shells
gonna crack and you're gonna have these
phones that have issues out of the box
and it takes the manufacturers a little
while to fix them like everybody's
behind schedule and i hope i have long
touted that Android and OEMs should like
take a year off he's like next year no
flagships make us deal with it screw us
the consumer bed get your stuff together
you know you know fix the fragmentation
a little bit fix android a little bit
makes you know get these phones working
and prepared and then you know next year
it's so fast and it's constant I mean
Samsung is not only working on the s7
they're working on the note 5 and
probably on the note 6 right now and
it's like obviously these phones are
gonna have issues when they come out
because I mean they don't have the time
anymore to do anything about it
everybody wants it right now immediately
it has to up refresh every year and
that's also part of the reason why I
don't care that that m9
like the m8 the m7 who cares it's it's
still a good looking phone it's just not
new and exciting you know like they
didn't have time to come up with a new
design so be it you know it happens
hello it sounds like I'm an apologist
and I kind of am i guess but you know
I'm siding with OEMs and on Google with
this one like you know it you have to
fix this now it has to be perfect right
on release day and then you know it's
gonna take him three or four months to
fix all the issues with the phones are
out now and then you look at that they
got eight months to polish and you know
finish everything up entirely so yeah
you know it's just it's so Spartan in it
so I keep saying that word it's just
it's just march forward march forward
march forward march forward and you know
no one wants to just stick around and
fix what's wrong now it's always got to
be what's next and i think that's a lot
of the reason why the culture of android
as a whole is I mean everything now is
irrelevant in eight months anyway so
what do they care if the camera software
is a little messed up you know well on
that I do i do believe that we have very
thoroughly answered the question so
those of you who have been on the pole
which was our first poll for the friday
debate podcast hopefully you guys were
able to get a lot out of this and i'm
pretty sure you were able to we were
able to go in a lot of different places
not only in terms of this question but
also in terms of joe's feelings on
lollipop yes so thank you for all of you
that did not vote for us to talk about
lollipop because that was an option some
people in the comments or something was
that that was number three I think in
the poll oh yea though some people in
the comments were saying like I want
this one this one and this one so
technically to kind of got with the ones
I think we did it well it was all over
the place what we did it that said
before i get into the OH what was it to
these we didn't talk about what were the
other two which one topics you mean
which does did we not discuss uh gaming
and like play store stuff yours yours
the stuff that's your domain all right
great they both suck congratulations we
had all five
we didn't talk about tablets if they're
worth owning and they suck to all six my
steez out now I disagree tablets are
awesome no there they are tablet my
droids have like I use my tattling four
hours a day now they're freaking awesome
now I'm playing shadowrun so much on my
shield right now so with all these
budget phones i have to have the good no
whole new angle do this we didn't think
