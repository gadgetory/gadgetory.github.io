to you by domain.com now consider for a
moment that when Google designed Android
they designed it to be a simple user
experience but if you're new to the
platform and just got your first Android
phone you might not know it with all the
bloat and crap where on your phone yeah
I'm looking at you Sammy alright so
today's show is based off an Android
Authority comm article written by our
own Android brother Mike Hearn you can
go to that article and read it it's in
the show links below I talked about
marks opinion and my own and I want to
hear your opinion in the comments below
let's get started software like
Samsung's TouchWiz and HTC Sense are
among some of the more popular
third-party interfaces used with Android
but there are countless others and while
some of the best Android powered devices
in the market use manufacturer built
software there's a nasty consequence
that comes with this practice due to the
popularity of gadgets like Samsung's
Galaxy Note product line and HTC One
series some casual tech fans are under
the impression that these third-party
developed interfaces are coming straight
from Google all right so let's clarify
some things for the uninitiated what
we're talking about here is the software
skin that goes over top of pure Android
why do manufacturers put their skins on
Android why not just leave Android pure
and vanilla well they're trying to
distinguish themselves from their
competitors to create an experience that
is uniquely Samsung uniquely HTC etc etc
that's what we're talking about when we
say skin bloatware or crapware because
for many enthusiasts like you and me we
don't want people put and junk on top of
our beloved Android but for some people
they don't know the difference all right
so mark goes on in his article to point
out that his uncle a former iPhone user
bought his first Android phone and after
a while did not like it and went back to
the iPhone because he said and I quote
there's too much going on on Android and
that's a good point now I know some of
you are busting at the seams right now
because you're thinking if
guy only knew what Android can do I mean
forget just about custom roms there's
apps like Tasker that can get granular
detail and customizing every little bit
of your phone it's so much more powerful
and you're right Android is more
powerful hands down pretty clear you can
do much more with it but here's my point
most average users don't care that you
can do more with Android that anger is
more flexible and more powerful they
don't care
I got a host full of those people you
know what they want to do they want a
text and call they want to browse their
social networks and they want to do some
casual gaming the core activities of a
smart phone for the average user now you
and me because you're a freak you watch
youtube videos on mobile operating
systems yeah here's the point I know
you're going to freak but Android does
not provide a significantly better
experience on those core activities than
the iPhone does it just not let's face
it it doesn't androids virtues are much
more beyond that it's with customization
of flexibility so when you say to
someone you just don't know what you're
missing well they don't care that
they're missing it that's the point
now Merc goes on to argue that the
possible solution to this is better
marketing and that if the average user
understood the power latent in their
Android phone they'd be much more likely
to appreciate it I would argue they need
to go a big step further than that and
possibly consider making two versions of
Android Android light versus Android Pro
making Android PO easily accessible for
us power users but make a compelling
case for those core four or five
activities in your smartphone to be
better than any other mobile operating
system out there I mean Google is the
engineering god of the universe right
now let's put those brains to power and
make those four or five core activities
better than anything else now if you
really want to educate the average user
Google by Sprint and make texting free
for everyone who buys a Nexus device
that'll educate the average user that's
the kind of thing that is going to move
the needle and move those mainstream
people into lovin Nexus devices
that's the kind
thing we need to think about or how
about this as Google Fiber expands give
all new Nexus owners a Wi-Fi credit mmm
see I don't believe marketing or
educating the average user is going to
really move the needle because the
average user doesn't want to be educated
they don't care enough what they care
about is compelling reasons to move
platforms so the question of the day is
what compelling reason can you imagine
that would cause you to move platforms
what would cause you to move to
blackberry to move to iOS one reason let
me know in the comments below so my
friend is starting a new company and
we've been playing a fun little exercise

I'd love to connect with you right here
on Google+ or Twitter now I'm going to
answer a question that I get a lot and
that is about the music that I use in
the show so in the show links below
there's two links one to incompetent
calm there's a lot of royalty-free music
that I use there and there's Android I
keep saying Android his name is Andrew
girl or her I linked up his SoundCloud
page I use two of his stuff one is
called the iPad or a Magic iPad unboxing
that's really popular I use it for the
product shots and there's another one
called solace and that's also really
popular
the other two are Proctor in the intro
Proctor is something you can find online
I forget where I found it and the second
one is data flow data flow is the music
that I use right after the
TRO and I don't think you can find
dataflow because it's private and I
can't share it it's something I only
have permission to use but it's all
linked up below you want to forget about
my brothers in Android Josh Joe in the
tech ninja Kevin Lonnie Chris Gary Nash
and Taylor all working super hard
deliver the best Android content on the
web but I want to point something out
ash who is one of our newer hosts here
he had he has produced an epic video on
the history of Nexus and if it's not out
today when I've linked right here I will
link it up very very shortly but it's
right there at the top it is epic he put
like a month's worth of effort into it
it's awesome show him some love and
learn about the history of Nexus you
will seriously earn some serious geek
cred if you watch that whole thing
because it's awesome fantastic job
apparently is going to be part 1 and
part 2 but it's length up there I should
see you guys next week on Android Q&amp;amp;A</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
