google play edition treatment can be
someone considered a nexus 8 well with
that in mind how does it compare to the
original Nexus tablet well that is what
we're here to find out because it's josh
Vegard from android authority what's
going on everybody and this is the LG G
pad Google Play edition versus the Nexus
7 in one corner the Nexus line continues
its tradition of minimalism and in the
other LG returns to the tablet game
seemingly knowing what piques the
interest of the customer the nexus 7
gets a soft touch plastic build and puts
the Nexus logo in landscape on the back
which provides a very sleek look the
tablet is actually quite pocketable and
can be easily gripped in one hand
speaking of which it just feels really
nice in the hand with that soft touch
plastic on the other hand the gpad takes
a mix of plastic that meets in the back
with an aluminum slab in the middle that
aluminum slab is definitely an addition
to a pretty good build quality to begin
with and it makes the entire device
quite attractive especially in black
which is what this google play edition
comes in the 8 point 3 inch screen does
make this a little bit less pocketable
but it is just over just a little bit
over the zone of comfort for a one
handed grip while one could argue that
the aluminum slab on the back of the LG
G pad does afford it maybe a couple more
points in terms of its overall build
quality we will say that both of these
tablets feel really nice in the hand and
ultimately it is up to what size you
need but of course that is because of
the displays when it comes to those
displays it is an unabashed battle of
sizes as both of the screens otherwise
offer similar experiences a 1920 x 1200
resolution is found in both of these
devices and the pixel density might be a
little bit lower in the larger screen of
the G pad but it is a bigger screen
which means the tablet will be farther
away from your face making text
ultimately still more than adequately
sharp anyway now a 7-inch screen is not
too shabby at all and you'll have a good
time watching HD content on this
wonderful screen but if you want
something just a little bit bigger and
you really want your media to really
stand out because of a larger screen
eight point three inches in the LG G pad
just might do it for you so ultimately
it comes down to which one is better for
you in terms of the
sighs once you get underneath the
surface things start to look a little
bit more similar you might think that
this battle is a little bit one-sided
but just because the Snapdragon s4 probe
returns in the nexus 7 here doesn't mean
it isn't updated after all the Nexus 7
comes with the Krait 300 variation of
the s4 pro which actually puts it closer
on par with the Snapdragon 600 that is
found in the LG G pad I have really had
no problems with the Nexus 7 in terms of
its performance ever since its release
and even if it says s4 pro it definitely
feels more like 600 performance in my LG
G pad google play edition review Armando
Ferreira commented that the LG tablet
might as well be sporting the Snapdragon
800 because it feels like it does well I
tend to agree but the good part here is
that the Nexus 7 even with its
Snapdragon s4 pro still manages to not
fall that far behind at all once we make
it to hardware really depending on how
you look at it the LG G pad actually
somewhat benefits from not being a Nexus
device after all the nexus 7 keeps it
pretty simple 16 or 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage is not expandable and
it does have a battery with a decent
capacity and thus provides good
longevity the LG G pad on the other hand
does have an SD card slot at the top
allowing it to have more media via your
SD cards and then it comes with a
massive 4600 milliamp hour battery that
provides very good longevity on the
screen that is a little bit larger and
with the processor that's a little bit
more powerful otherwise both of these
tablets pretty much have all the same
bits and pieces inside that allow it to
perform a lot of the same types of tasks
so in the end if expandable storage is
something that you really want and I
know a lot of you out there really pine
for it well the LG G pad has got your
back in this comparison when it comes to
the cameras stock Android makes its
appearance on both of these devices and
thus provides a similarly minimal
feature set either way it comes with
panorama HDR and also the photosphere
however both of these 5 megapixel
shooters provide only really decent
photos and pretty comparable ones at
that tablet photography is a little more
accepted with these smaller tablets but
your phone in your pocket probably
provides better pictures anyway so you
should probably put this one aside and
let the other ones do the work and
finally we make it to the software which
is really the crux of this comparison
after all what makes this such an
important battle is stock Android
Android 4.4 KitKat brings the
quintessential experience from the Nexus
to the first google play edition tablet
LG G pad now gets the experience that us
Android purists really love the
simplistic notification drop down with
the power widget shade the simple home
screens the app drawer and the powerful
google now application all alongside
these aesthetic choices that the new
version of Android KitKat brought into
the fray it is also optimized for speed
and gives you exactly what you need
quite elegantly actually in the end what
is so great about the google play
edition of the LG G pad is that if you
wanted the stock Android experience you
don't necessarily need to go for a nexus
anymore but of course the deciding
factor here is obviously the price with
the Nexus 7 coming in at two hundred and
twenty nine dollars at the base model
and then the LG G pad coming in at three
hundred and forty nine dollars does $100
justify a somewhat larger screen
expandable storage and perhaps arguably
somewhat better build quality well let's
see that is what makes this comparison
so great because even if the price point
of the LG G pad is still a little too
steep for you then you can get the nexus
7 it's just a little bit smaller but
comes at a much better price point for
all that it is able to do and it is very
stellar and does all of it very well but
for a hundred extra dollars if you
wanted a mid-sized nexus or stock
Android like experience you have it in
the LG G pad between the Nexus 7 and the
Nexus 10 with a couple of extras
built-in for your benefit as always
