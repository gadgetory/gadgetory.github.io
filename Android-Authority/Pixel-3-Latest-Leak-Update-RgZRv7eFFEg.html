three probably the biggest question on
everyone's mind regarding the pixel
three is whether or not we'll adopt the
controversial display knotch
a bloomberg report this week cites
people familiar with the matter saying
that the pixel 3xl will have a notch
display but the same sources also add
that the standard smaller pixel 3 will
not have a notch display I don't know if
that means we're gonna have thin sexy
bezels or some big-ass chin yeah I'm
looking at you pixel - in an interesting
twist
according to win future Google is
partnering with Foxconn subsidiary fi H
mobile to manufacture the pixel 3 and
pixel three XL FH mobile isn't a new
entrant either they produce HMDs Nokia
branded smartphones also also a senior
XDA developer forum member Miraz 9000
shared quite a few images allegedly
showing the pixel 3 excel from all
angles and of course the images also
reveal that the phone could feature a
notch which not everyone is a fan of
they also tell the same story as
previous rumours which is that the
flagship will sport a single camera on
the back - on the front and dual
front-facing speakers and no the
headphone jack will not make a return
now let's talk about power shall we the
pixel duel is unsurprisingly rumored to
arrive with the snapdragon 845 processor
when future reports that unless qualcomm
has a slightly upgraded processor ready
for the google pixel when it's time to
produce it can only be the snapdragon
845 chipset RAM and storage options
aren't known yet but 4 gigabytes - 6
gigabytes of RAM and 64 to 120 gigabytes
of storage options are safe guesses now
let's talk about the all uber important
camera capabilities bloomberg reports
that the new phones will feature
upgraded but still single lens cameras
the larger phone is apparently packin -
selfie cameras though ostensibly for
improved bokeh trickery authentication
and wide-angle shots now when it comes
to release dates the past two
generations of pixels have been revealed
on October
fourth will that be the same the third
time around well win future guesses that
it would actually be sometime in August
or September but the sure thing is that
you'll be able to get this phone for
Christmas so let me know what you think
do you and have big anticipation of this
phone do you like it I certainly love my
pixel I don't not a fan of the chin and
I wish that they had a much smaller
model there's actually another rumor
that is actually gonna be three versions
of it but we don't have a lot to
substantiate that wouldn't it be great
if there was like a 4.5 inch and a you
know 5.2 inch and some 6.3 inch or
something like that that would be
fantastic
a guy can hope let me know what you
think in the comments below or on
Twitter like me do you like ultra-thin
phone cases if you don't have
butterfingers and just want protection
against everyday wear and tear our
sponsor has super-thin cases priced just
right go to MN and Al case calm and use
