Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly we
got a lot of stuff to talk about this
week so let's get started nova launcher
is currently selling the prime version
of their iconic launcher application for
a mere 99 cents and our readers have
informed us that it's even less in other
regions we don't know how long the sale
will go for but it's definitely going
right now get it quick because it won't
last forever the waffling by Google to
release their contacts and phone
application to the Google Play Store
continued this last week first they were
up and then Google took them down but at
the time of the making of this video
they are back up again they're totally
free but it seems like you can only get
them on select Nexus devices for right
now amazon announced a new initiative
called the streaming Partners Program
the object of this is simple with your
prime subscription you can access
third-party streaming services such as
AMC at Showtime stars indie flicks and
others the big players like Hulu and
Netflix aren't available to the surprise
of well no one but this could make
amazon prime a little bit more fun after
a long wait google has finally released
a family plan for google play music
it'll be fourteen dollars and
ninety-nine cents per month and can be
shared with up to six family members in
select regions you'll also get youtube
read access that's an excellent deal for
pretty much everyone and you can get it
right now Dropbox announced that it was
going to shut down its mailbox and
carousel services in early 2016 while I
know there are some people who will be
upset about this the truth is that
neither service really took off and they
were never really as good as their
competitor apps they will join Google
helpouts as great ideas that very few
people actually used for even more
android apps and games headlines updates
and new releases don't forget to check
out this week's newsletter which is
linked in the video description below we
had a ton of stuff that we didn't get to
include here that you may find
interesting if you so choose you can
head to the written companion which is
also in the video description below and
sign up for the newsletter using the
form there and we'll send it to you
every single Sunday okay folks here are
the apps and games that made a big
splash this week as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find those links in the video
description below five miles is a new
application that performs a lot of the
same functionality as Craigslist it's
essentially a classified service that
lets you sell things post services and
job openings and a whole
lot more the app uses GPS and zip codes
to find listings in your area and you
can do things like post voice
descriptions register with Facebook and
there's even a built-in messaging system
it's a little rough around the edges but
do keep an eye on it because it's going
to be awesome eventually swiftkey
symbols is a new very different type of
keyboard instead of words and letters
swiftkey uses symbols to allow people to
communicate this is a great application
and can potentially be useful for those
with autism or other various
communication disorders it's a bit
simplistic right now when users are
already asking for more symbols but
still this is a pretty great little
thing snaps wipe drawer is a new
application that kind of gives you a
second notification shade except for
this one has a bunch of widgets in it
think of it like a little stash for your
widgets so you don't have them
cluttering up all of your home screens
it can be configured to be available at
any time you want it there are also some
release date bugs but that's to be
expected don't let that prevent you from
giving it a shot because it is pretty
nifty the age of empires world
domination is the latest age of empires
game to launch on Android unfortunately
we didn't get a chance to try this one
ourselves because it is only available
in select markets right now but you can
expect a full release sometime in the
near future once all the kinks have been
worked out we can tell you that it's
going to be a freemium model which is
different from prior titles so it won't
cost you anything to try it after a long
wait microsoft has finally released
cortana to the wild as expected the
application and service are a little
rough around the edges but we have no
doubt that microsoft will cure the bugs
and improve the service over time much
like google did with google now it's
totally free to download and use so
there's no harm in seeing it for
yourself it's also worth noting that you
must have a PC running Windows 10 and
opted in to Cortana before you can use
the application once again I'm Joe Hindy
