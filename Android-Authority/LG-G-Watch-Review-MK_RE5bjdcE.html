entirely new ecosystem and it lives on
our wrists androidwear there's no doubt
all of the major manufacturers are going
to be getting in on the Android wear
train and for the last couple weeks I've
been enjoying it on LG's own wearable
hey it's Josh regard from Android
authority and this is the LG G watch
we're going to be seeing a number of
different ticks on the Android wearable
whether may be square or round it but LG
decided to keep things pretty simple
almost utilitarian really a square face
is surrounded by a pretty sizable bezel
all around it is constructed of plastic
- the glass for the screen there's a
noticeable amount of weight to the unit
itself but that's to be expected of a
watch that holds a considerable amount
of power underneath the surface up top
and on the bottom are the areas where
you can insert pins for whatever bands
you decide to use even if they aren't
the ones that come with it but it's
important to note you shouldn't be using
a cup for it the way that I used to with
my pebble this is because the back of
the unit has the charging pins that sits
squarely on the charging dock so you
don't want to be covering that up with
no logos or buttons anywhere this watch
depends entirely on touch inputs and
when you run out of battery it simply
turns back on when it gets enough juice
from the charging dock when sitting on
your wrist the LG G watch sits pretty
comfortably despite there being no curve
on the back but after that it's pretty
minimalistic Lian in the most simplistic
way I can put it a screen that's
strapped to your wrist one compared to
its other Android wear brethren the LG G
watch could be considered the most basic
but that can be as much of a plus for
users as it might be a minus for others
of course the screen is what matters
most here especially in the case of the
G watch because it doesn't have any
other methods of input a one point six
five inch IPS screen comes with a 280 by
280 resolution which sounds pretty small
but remember that this is a watch we're
talking about here nonetheless its
colors are adequate enough and do
justice to what you would end up seeing
throughout from cards to maybe the
occasional photo if you so choose to
view them I've been hearing a lot about
outdoor viewing and while it certainly
doesn't look great when the Sun directly
bears down on the screen what is it that
we do anyway when that happens to our
regular watches we shade it with our
other hand or move away from the
direction of the Sun and when done in
this matter it's
that hard at all to see what you're
looking at as far as touch sensitivity
goes I haven't had any problems with it
thus far we aren't looking at any
multi-touch functions in Android wear
but taps and swipes are registered fine
throughout getting among cards and
tapping screens the trigger to trigger
functions work as well as they should so
when you aren't willing to use your
voice the screen does the job just fine
performance is handled by a Snapdragon
400 chipset and finally 512 megabytes of
RAM for how seemingly simplistic the
Android wear operating system should
feel it came as no surprise that lag was
minimal navigation looks nice and smooth
and since multitasking isn't really
necessarily a thing traditionally with
this Android ecosystem that wasn't much
here to bog down the system while I did
experience the need to restart the watch
a few times in my usage it came
primarily after certain new third-party
applications kind of crapped out it's
more about the programming bugs rather
than the core functions which all worked
a treat voice recognition is a breeze
but it is worth mentioning that if you
are using Wi-Fi on your smart phone that
it is connected to you might experience
a bit of a delay I always got immediate
results when sticking to 4G on my smart
phone and yes Android wear does mean
that you need an Android smartphone for
it to work making it a required part of
the hardware aspects connections via
bluetooth create the bridge between the
wearable and your phone and all
communication occurs as such after that
you're not looking at much more than the
microphone for voice recognition which
works expectedly well the sensors for
pedometer and waking capabilities and
the vibration motor inside the vibration
motor is something that I kind of take a
little bit of exception to because to be
honest it's just not all that strong I
would really like it to really shake on
my wrist so I have definitely
confirmation that my notifications are
rolling in everything is encased in an
IP certified body which means that you
can let the G watch get wet and you
won't have any problems therein but
water does register touches on the
screen which could cause some problems
for those of you who let's say shower
with your watches on and as far as
battery life goes it should be expected
already that battery life on a screen
that is strapped to your wrist probably
doesn't bring a whole lot of longevity
but after making a couple of smart
decisions I found that you can really
eke out the most from the LG G watch for
one thing don't let the screen be on all
the time and when you don't need it to
go off like when you're sleeping you
the watch by swiping down from the top
doing this can get you a day and a half
to two days which is actually really
nice and it's also a big plus that the G
watch charges pretty quickly you can get
it charged in about an hour
resting on the included charging dock
and finally in software we find the true
Android wear but it's important to
remember one thing this is a system
still in its infancy and what we see now
can drastically change in even the near
future which is why it's great that this
is already pretty good to begin with
so basically Android wear is a
notification hub the notifications that
you get on your phone appear on your
watch in the form of Google now like
cards that you can swipe through swipe
over to the right and you'll find more
functions in a number of different
applications like for hangouts you can
dictate responses to messages and for
email you can archive or delete messages
initializing any installed applications
requires you to either say ok Google or
tap on the watch face which can be
customized with a number of built in or
installed replacements if you're
familiar with voice commands on Google
now you will know how to get around an
Android wear say anything from playing
specific music to start a timer to
remind me to do something later and it
will perform the said task according to
the app that you have listed out in the
wear application found on your smart
phone but it's when you start to think
outside that box that things become
pretty interesting and if you look in
the Play Store you can find plenty of
examples already all the cooks for
example will set up a shopping list on
the watch for any recipes that you want
to put together
Evernote gives you pretty easy access to
your recent notes and your to-do lists
and RunKeeper can display your stats on
your watch while you're trying to break
your PR now these are only a few of the
applications that you can find in the
Android wear specific section of the
Play Store that is accessible from the
Android wear app but there are so many
more applications and functions that you
can unlock if you dig deeper into the
Google Play Store already I have a new
watch space that allowed me to select my
own background a game that I can play
when I don't have much else to do and an
application that allows me to trigger
tasks or actions easily it's really just
a little bad things you notice and very
small ones like the small annoyance of
having to swipe right to change the
songs playing or the pretty obvious in
accuracy of the pedometer app or the
instances when you swipe cards away that
you can't easily get back
but those are really just small gripes
in a much larger picture that altogether
creates an exciting future for wearable
tech already there are developers hard
at work in just the previous week when
this watch was released looking to
perfected their own apps and with more
coming on the horizon Android wears only
direction to go is up the LGG watch is
popping up in multiple outlets but can
be found on the Play Store for two
hundred and twenty nine dollars it's
obvious competitors are the currently
unreleased Moto 360 and its main
competitor the Samsung gear live that
comes in at 199 dollars for a little
less money the gear life brings a
different design that some might like a
heartrate monitor and a pleasing AMOLED
screen so those might be factors that
sway you away from the minimalism that
is the LG G watch other smartwatches
available boast their own operating
systems like the Samsung gear line with
Tizen or the pebble the latter of which
I will be doing a full comparison with
soon and so there you have it the LG G
watch our smartwatches for everyone
honestly no even watches on their own
are not ubiquitous it's far from a
requirement in daily life the way a cell
phone is let's say and after all it's
still tough to define what a SmartWatch
really is is it a computer on your wrist
or a watch that just so happens to be
capable of more I tend to prefer the
middle path a SmartWatch is first and
foremost a watch that can tell you the
time and other really basic information
but dig deeper underneath the surface
and you'll find functions that
complement not only your smartphone life
but your daily life in some ways as well
do I expect smartwatches to be on
everyone's wrist no definitely not for
quite a while at least but if you are
even remotely interested in having the
world not just at your fingertips but
always at the ready on your person then
Android wear is a wonderful place to
start and the LG G watch is the watch
that prevents to you Android wear with
no frills and no fuss for better or
worse in a currently hypothetical world
where smartwatches are ubiquitous the LG
G watch is most like a swatch pretty
simplistic minimalistic but gives you
the essentials in a very unassuming way
and if anything on the LG G watch being
able to consistently perform voice
commands always blows my mind away as
always thank you guys very much for
watching and I hope you enjoyed this
review of the LG
gee watch if anything the G watch along
with the Samsung gear live which I am
reviewing currently and the upcoming
moto 360 are great examples of how
Android wears off to a pretty good start
and we're looking forward to what comes
in that ecosystem so keep it into
Android authority for that and all the
rest of our coverage of Android we're
here and beyond keep it tuned teardrop
with some likes on our videos because
we'd love to see those thumbs up
