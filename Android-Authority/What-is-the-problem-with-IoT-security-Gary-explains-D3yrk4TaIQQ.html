Authority now you've probably heard of
this term Internet of Things things that
are connected to the internet everything
from a mobile phone to your PC to light
bulbs fridges security cameras things
that are kicked into the internet and
you also probably heard recently in the
news that there is some security
concerns about the whole idea of the
Internet of Things well what are those
security problems what are the
challenges that are being faced today by
IOT manufacturers well let me explain so
first of all let's just do a quick
overview what is IOT the ease of things
it basically means anything that's
connected to the Internet now previously
we've used the internet through
connected things PCs laptops smartphones
tablets but now we're into a new era
where there are devices kept to the
internet that are not being used or
interacted with by people all the times
when I use my mobile phone to connect to
the Internet to browse the web or to use
an app that needs the Internet I am kind
of controlling what's going on but there
are a whole bunch of new devices that
kind of sit independently on the
Internet and we want them on the
internet because we want to be able to
talk to them at some point during a day
or during a month for example if I have
a security camera that's recording
things that going on in my home I go
away on holiday then maybe I want to
just kind of log in and see what's
happening around my house to make sure
everything is okay so I'm not
controlling it directly but I'm kind of
querying it or kind of looking at it
once in a while now there are reports
that are suggesting that we already have
over six billion into the fing devices
on the internet already and that number
just going to grow it could grow as much
as up to 20 billion within the next few
years now the problem is is that when
you use your PC or your laptop or your
smartphone it's got a whole bunch of
security features built into it
firewalls for example maybe antivirus
maybe there are some security issues
inside the actual computer selves like
address space randomization you don't
even see but I know it's there and the
people that build these things know that
there but these things seem to be
missing from the internet of things so
why is that and what's the problem and
how do we fix it now the reason why this
has come to the forefront recently is
because websites like Twitter and many
other popular websites went down for a
day or so because they were suffering a
thing called a denial of service attack
in fact it was a distributed denial of
deserve service attack now what does
that mean basically if a website offers
a service like Twitter any popular
website to be able to use it you need to
be able to access it and if you bombard
that website with too many requests too
many users but not real users fake users
then the service can't cope but it just
groans under all that stress of all
those requests coming in and so what
hackers do is they target certain
servers in this particular case a
targeted a service called Dyne for
dynamic dynamic naming that you actually
provide the host naming the DNS service
for sites like Twitter and quite a few
other popular ones and they target that
particular service now think about it
there are millions of people that use
services like Twitter and Facebook and
all we've on every single day so having
a million users or 10 million users
isn't an issue for these services so to
really bring them down to their needs
you have to really send literally
gigabytes of data packets requests to
these services in a very short amount of
time and the only way to do that is not
through one PC or 10 pcs you need
thousands and thousands of PC now in the
past what would happen is that maybe a
PC was infected with a virus of some
kind and that virus had behind it a
command and control center which was
used by hackers to tell that PC now
start sending requests to this
particular website and if you replicate
that over thousands and thousands and
thousands of machines then you could
start to bring the the web service got
down to its needs a denial of service
that service was no longer available now
what happened recently was when Dyne was
attacked hidden
and Twitter fell and because of and the
other sites because they this was a
unique type of attack it wasn't launched
from a PC which many have been launched
before but it was actually launched
using IOT devices particularly was
launched using a set of security cameras
and some network attached storage now
why is that well a few little while ago
a few months ago a new piece of malware
was released on the internet that just
searches for IOT devices and tries to
take them over and tries to use them for
their nefarious activities now why was
that so simple as I said on your PC
you've got a firewall you've probably
got antivirus that are a whole bunch of
security features built into your PC but
we're discovering is that all of these
IOT devices security cameras networked
towards light bulbs whatever they are
have no security whatsoever in fact they
even maybe have a default access like
you can log in using admin admin or you
know admin password or something like
that and what's happening is these
devices are coming out of the factory
consumers are buying them and actually
they're exposed to the Internet
and because they've got Internet
connectivity they've actually got a
small computer inside of them maybe an
arm microcontroller or maybe even a
cortex a protist of course it's a five
or a cord it's a seven and they might be
running something like Linux or one of
the simpler microcontroller operating
systems now that means they've got full
internet connectivity the protocol
Bluetooth they've got image processing
they've got lots of computing power and
the hackers are able to take those over
and use them to launch these DDoS
attacks now what that really means is
that IOT developers really neat up their
game when it comes to writing the
software for these devices I mean I I
remember not even only a few years ago I
would get pieces of equipment from
making my telco provider that the
default password was a headman Adly now
the latest one that I got actually the
password was I think it's like 16
characters long maybe even more quite
long and it's labeled on the back of the
modem and that's different for every
single device so you can't just log into
all of these mo
using the same username a password you
happy has a unique one and it's a strong
one and that's what all devices need to
be able to do at the moment that this is
not happening so here's a quick
checklist of things that need to happen
from a developer's point of view and
consumers need to be aware of it so that
we bring up these IOT devices up to a
certain level of reasonable security now
the first one of course is
authentication you can't just login with
admin admin or admin no password and
that is exposed on the internet so
anybody can just start finding an
address of a machine and just connect to
it and do whatever they want to it
that's just not allowed has got to have
decent authentication the password needs
to be unique for every device that rolls
off the factory and that password needs
to be kind of on a label or something so
the owner can log into it but other
people can't the other thing that I ot
developers need to be really care about
is leaving any kind of debug interfaces
it's this so many examples of people who
thought they would leave some kind of
hidden backdoor because that helps them
to kind of perform Diagnostics it helps
them to kind of monitor what's going on
with their devices but actually even
they think they're hidden security
through obscurity that doesn't work in
the end it's discovered in the end the
password is found out and then all of
those devices it could be millions of
them across the world are then suddenly
laying bare for hackers to get into
course every IOT device should use
encryption if it is doing things if you
are talking to it is uploading things in
the cloud if it is sharing data that
should all be encrypted so that only the
people that are made to see those piece
of information can see them and never
transmit passwords in the clear
never transmit personal data in the
clear if you can do don't run any data
in the clear always send it with
encryption and the same for privacy you
don't want these IOT devices to reveal
things about where they are and who the
owner is and how long they've been
running and what you know always kind of
stuff that needs to be hidden that only
the right people can see that and if
there is a web interface built into the
device it needs to basically be a robust
web interface
shouldn't be open to things like SQL
injection vulnerabilities or it
shouldn't be open to cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities it should
really be a secure web interface and
lastly but not least every IOT device I
mean every IOT device from a microwave
oven to a light bulb to a really
sophisticated home security system or
even to things that are monitoring
factories and cities every IOT device
should be able to be upgraded so that
when and I say when security issues a
fan because they're always going to be
found but when security issues are found
the devices can be upgraded and those
security vulnerabilities can be closed
but there's a key thing about this when
an upgrade performed the device needs to
check that it's actually performing a
legitimate upgrade a legitimate update
to its firmware and that's done using
signing that software should be signed
using certificate and the device should
check little certificate has the right
signature on it and only then should
actually say it's going to upload and
install the new firmware now why are we
in this situation well basically the
problem is cost a lot of these devices
are being aimed at the consumer market
and basically the companies that are
making them are saying we want to make
this quick we want to make it cheap and
want to get it out the door and security
is like issue number 522 on their list
it's not important to them at all now we
as consumers have power to make sure
that it doesn't happen anymore
don't buy IOT devices that you've read
reviews of them on the internet and you
discovered that they don't treat
security well
don't buy IOT device that don't offer a
firmware upgrade path so that when there
are security issues found they can be
upgraded just don't do it and then the
power of the consumer will force these
companies to take security seriously I
really mean it if you do it if you buy
cheap IOT devices that don't have a
security model that don't have a
security answer then you're actually
just going to propagate this problem and
make it worse so be a sensible consumer
and buy products that have got a track
record with
curity now maybe it isn't the developers
themselves that our fault although
ultimately of course they're the ones
wrote the code but probably this
pressure is coming from higher up in the
company from management from product
management from the bosses who are
saying we want this now we want it cheap
and we don't care about security but a
word to those type of people just notice
in the end security a lack of security
will actually be your downfall
because if it comes out that your device
is responsible for certain sir certain
activities and your device was insecure
and in fact you had a very blase
security attitude then actually that
could be the downfall of your whole
company you lose everything let me give
you a simple example there was an
example where Charlie Miller and a
colleague of his actually managed to
find some security vulnerabilities in a
Jeep
and they told Jeep about these problems
and Jeep basically didn't do anything
about it and then after a certain amount
of time Charlie Miller and his colleague
went ahead and actually published these
findings and then Jeep were forced to
recall all of their jeeps and make
certain modifications to them and that
cost them billions of dollars now it
wouldn't have cost some billions of
dollars if they took security seriously
it wouldn't have cost them billions of
dollars to employ a few people whose job
just was to look at and test and check
the security on their cars now you might
be not a big company like Jeep but if
you're trying to sell products and then
you find that people no longer buy your
product because they've got a bad name
then you can go out of business and
you're going to lose your money you're
going to lose your livelihood so it's
important to make sure if you are a
manager if you are a boss of a company
making electronic equipment make sure
security is key it's top of your list
because that could be your downfall and
consumers have the power to do that now
it isn't all doom and gloom there are
lots of solutions out there I'm just
thinking now things like Linux of course
that comes with lots of good solutions
including firewalls if you're dealing
with microcontrollers you've got things
like free are toss that's an operating
system real-time operating system that's
got lots of built-in security features
and then of course there's things like
embed OS from arm that offer not only
just a real-time
operating system for microcontrollers
for IOT devices they arm actually offer
a whole range of services from the
programming of the device including the
servers in the cloud and including all
the stuff to do with firmware upgrades
and device deployment and end-of-life
management and all these things they
have everything and that all part of the
EM bed OS ecosystem if you buy into that
when I say buy actually it's really not
a piece of like that most of that stuff
is actually open-source freely available
if you invest into that then you pretty
much guarantee that you're going to get
yourself an IOT device that is covered
through all its different phases so
there we have it basically IOT the
problem at the moment is people are
producing cheap quick devices they put
in lines yet they don't have any concern
about security but you wouldn't buy a PC
that does that you expect your PC to
have a fire we expect it to have some
kind of Windows Defender some kind of
antivirus you expect it to have updates
Microsoft issue updates every month
Apple issue updates the next
distribution up updates it's always
being upgraded to fix and repair
security issues now we need to have that
same mindset when it comes to buying
connected devices that are permanently
on the internet and actually are part of
our lives security cameras and things
like that we need them to work properly
and we need them to be safe you don't
want people spying on your house while
you're away because they hacked into
your camera you don't want that baby
monitors that was a terrible example
people hacking into baby monitors and
they could see what your pay
doing you don't want this kind of thing
you want to make sure you buy secure
devices well my name is Gary Simms from
