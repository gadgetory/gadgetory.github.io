original android hangout show on google+
I'm Derek Ross and I'm Scott Anderson
this week we're joined by favorite
special returning guest dan Charlton of
team at kernels welcome Dan nice to be
here thank you so Scott little guy on
the agenda this week we're going to be
talking about verizon to start out we're
also me going over some device news a
little bit of rumors and some updates
including HTC's new 5-inch phone also
we're going over some ICS and jelly bean
updates over-the-air updates we're also
going to be doing some routine ramen cm9
cm10 and over there updates and then
we're going to be going on talking about
samsung first apple kind of in their
patent war right now just give us more
information about that and then also
we're going to be talking about
samsung's cortex a15 and the x5 dual and
then we are also going to be talking
about a smartphone drag race that was on
YouTube and yeah I have no smartphones
could actually race with apparently they
can write yeah that they can oh and I
forgot we're gonna be talking about
jelly bean app encryption that Google
kind of put on hold due to some issues
but we'll get little more to detail
about that in a little bit all right so
a little bit of carrier news here
verizon this week let the world know
that they can continue to charge you
money if you continue to use more data
than their current plans uh basically
basically that's what it boils down to
um you know they have five tiered data
plans available further share everything
plan you know fifty bucks for a gig 64 2
and so forth all the way up to a hundred
dollars for 10 gig a month then they
decide to let everybody know oh wait
there's more so for 412 gig you can pay
110 dollars for 14 gig 120 16 gig 130
1840 and last but not least if you want
to use 20 gig
data a month yep you're going to be
paying out one hundred and fifty dollars
so not a whole lot of news but they're
going to charge you for it anyway so now
they actually officially have these
plans available for you with a shared
everything plan so it's not that I guess
uh no um 20 gig for 150 versus half that
was costing you 100 for 410 so yeah
you're saving money the more data you
use that's good to know and you know
you're not not get enough nickel and
dimed outside murder you I personally
think they should start off the tier
with 54 two gigs and then 64 for and
then 70 first six baby fawn you know
since everybody's using data obviously
no I those of you that aren't
grandfathered in you know but they're
giving you unlimited calls and texts you
know those things you don't use anymore
oh you mean the texts that we use over
data apps right yeah yeah yeah that's
the biggest thing about these shared
data plans that that I hate is that they
bake you in by saying look you have
unlimited calling and unlimited text you
know what I do two minutes of calling a
day and it's hey honey i'm here at work
hey honey i'm leaving work I don't do
any text messaging that not often if
someone you know most people send me a
gtalk message you know which is data so
you know everyone's not gonna text books
maybe i used google voice for my texting
so it's all don't know stay here so but
you know what they're gonna give that to
you for free and charge you because they
want us to use data because they're
making a killing off of data and it's
going to be ever more so in the future
if they realize that it's just data and
that's what's you know attacking their
network so they say and that's what
they're going to charge people for so I
mean they say that but you also look at
verizon that is actively pushing people
off of its own dsl services to try and
replace their like main line like main
internet service with LTE at these
prices they can't do it at these prices
now the speed is good but the yeah the
speeds great especially compared to dsl
but like three
we hustled internet connection 20 it's a
month for a hundred and fifty dollars
are you what I think we're gonna really
see a big change shifted parodying here
is in a year and a half when voice over
LTE is more than or and you do away with
uh your calling and texting plans yeah
everything goes over data so you're
gonna you know you don't have 100
minutes a month or two hundred minutes
you know whatever there's no more minute
plans it's here's this chunk of data use
it however the hell you want you know
already just about it or whatever that
if you use the other plans offered to do
it but if you have a voice over IP so
some setup yeah pretty much already do
that the problem isn't it you can't do
voice over LTE the problem is that you
can't handoff voiceover data on on LTE
to voiceover cdma you're actually
running the voice over IP and just
shuffling that across LTE network is not
a challenge well it looks for let's
briefly talk about that i didn't put in
the agenda because as everybody knows
why maybe not everybody's a lot of
people know i was on vacation to past me
so i'm trying to piece together the show
here what's popular what's not popular
to talk about one of the things i
remember reading in the news earlier in
the week was that that metropcs is the
first carrier in the US to roll out
voice over LTE i don't know where it's
starting i don't remember all the
specifics from the the the article that
i read but if it is coming it is
happening in a tiny little carrier like
you know compared to the big guys you
know it is starting to the first to do
it so I mean the industry's going that
way and we're starting to see it already
so let's so let's talk about another
carrier here real quick in the US Sprint
is doing something neat there they're
giving the needle AAA free tablet if you
buy a new smartphone and they're giving
away the ZTE optic which is a 3g tablet
7 inch screen it has a 1280 by 800
display 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
processor i believe the
the processors it's an s3 so it's a
little order it's not a newer s4
processor has a gig of ram 16 gig
storage 5 megapixel rear camera 2
megapixel front camera and it comes with
Android welcome so you know it's not the
greatest tap let on the planet but it's
a free tablet so what what select phones
do is this if you buy any smartphone is
it if you buy it with a contract kind of
three years and not to now it's a it's a
new smartphone purchase I I'm not a
hundred percent sure on the contract
other out uh assume you'd have to have a
contract yeah you know I was or how much
I think were to buy this tablet
off-contract how much would do you think
it would cost probably not a whole lot
like two three pilot or three hundred
dollars yeah minute city which I don't
get as a negative i just made me make
very inexpensive products yeah um but I
mean this is kind of nice I mean
initially sprint was offering it for a
hundred bucks up with a two-year
contract oh yeah the two-year contract
you got ad in although yeah there's
probably the the you had to pick up the
contract on the tablet for if you're
getting it for free yeah yeah remember
this is a 3g tab and they want you to
use date or they want you to pay a
monthly fee on it so yeah it's not quite
free yeah I mean it's a sorry I for work
yeah it's pretty hardware and we're
gonna make you pay a monthly fee on it
so but it's a the type of one so six
months old so I mean it it's a free tap
I don't want it six months old yeah make
a pretty old okay now februari I find it
even less impressive thinking about
where it should have been six months ago
I'll tell you what if you don't want a
free tablet don't don't get a new
smartphone and don't tell them no good
as new smartphone just don't take the
tablet you know um or if you want you
want you know me so it has honey come on
up yeah it's all right you know I see
ICS has been out for nine months now
jellybeans been out for a month um but
don't worry the developers
you're back you can get cm9 on it or
cm10 both about everything working
except for camera and bluetooth so you
know I'm sure those will get worked out
the near future but there is this there
is a deaf community before and it's not
a huge deaf community but there is one
for it so I'd get it and I'd cancel the
data right away probably an ETF for that
hey the early termination fee right well
it's actually working knowledge for the
tablet though fileom to pin you know
$175 $200 termination fees so now you're
getting a tablet for 200 bucks if your S
Pen 200 bucks I know perfect tablet you
can get to our boat what is that which
was that that is that you can find it
it's at my said 325 mine sent three to
five shipping days and it has been so
not this last Thursday but a week before
that unpaid I ordered it so this guy
right here clothes on hey get it the
oven have you met that one here oh oh
that's the one to you look Scott next
hangout next show if you're not holding
up a nexus 7 here there's gonna be
health care well it'll be on google's
fault because i only three to five days
all right I and doesn't just PSP connect
was going to do a quick little tan to
hear those of you that have been
following us for a while might know that
Scott does not root and rom his devices
however pre-show during a brief chat
about reading and roaming Scott said he
might dive into the nexus 7 routing and
in roaming he might run his first ever
custom rom on on his first ever android
device starting with the Nexus 7 I don't
want you to do it alone Nexus 7 because
I personally feel you need to do it but
hey people get if it'll get me into room
and ramen and not deal with carrier
stuff then yeah it was must be the
devices since we're talking about some
devices let's let's talk about a couple
a couple devices he had hit the hit the
market or rumored or you know cemetery
she popped out about the past week um
the HTC endeavor c2 also known as HTC's
rumored 5-inch phone / tablet tablet
whatever people are calling these days
so apparently i'm guessing the endeavor
c2 is more of an internal code name I
you know I think I think that'll be
changed most likely when it gets
released but uh the current rumors put
it at a 5-inch display a 1.7 gigahertz
quad-core tegra 3 plus that's a that's
pretty beefy 1.7 gigahertz especially
because I don't know many devices out
there that have that and an October
first rumored launch date so we'll
follow that over the next two months
here and see what happens see if it
actually comes to fruition the Sony
Xperia GX got unboxed in Japan no it's a
on Japan's NTT DoCoMo carrier for nine
hundred and sixty bucks about US dollars
um that's not on contract that's that's
an expensive that's a thousand-dollar
phone that's so for your thousand-dollar
film what you get um you can android 4.4
nobody like me and you know what doesn't
elevate four thousand dollars i I don't
you know it would be like at the latest
and greatest you get last year's stuff
yeah you know what song he's been
submitting the code to Android's open
source project em on the upgrading thing
has it they'll be updated soon they have
to so it has a 4.5 a 4.5 5-inch HD
display I give your ram 16 gig onboard
storage microSD slot 13 megapixel rear
camera and a 1.3 front shooter so no not
not too out of the ordinary there but
4,000 boxset that's a new flagship phone
up I would have expected a little bit
more than that so that's all bad things
it does have a Mitchell and it does have
NFC so there
and I've seen there you go and the back
that's definitely a top end phone that
that does seem a little pricey though
yeah the like an unlock samsung galaxy
s3 the international one goes for I want
to say around 650 or 700 so you're wise
to watch yeah I don't know that's that
seems very high for an unlocked phone
yeah I'm assuming that's the unlocked
price I really hope that's not the on
contract price that's yeah we have the
card that you were to have grand on
topic yeah all right so uh next device
to give us some info this past week and
the HTC One X is getting four point oh
four sense 4.1 started rolling out in
the EU improve system performance camera
smoother animation and it comes with a
free copy of dead space so there you go
more free bloatware not bad the coolest
thing in my opinion about this is it the
menu bar that was plaguing sense for has
been resolved to no longer our sense for
users gonna have our the meander the
Phantom menu button chillin up on the
bottom for certain apps that shouldn't
be there in the first place so that
that's very good so those of you that
own the HTC One X you can look forward
to getting at in the near future you
don't have it already and is your menu
are we fixed the solution is still not
the most elegant but realistically the
problem I mean HTC is kind of getting
cold for it but it's really not their
fault problem is people like the
facebook and twitter app developers not
bothering to follow guidelines on how
they're supposed to be building apps for
ice cream sandwich and jellybean yeah
yeah but you know what and then whose
fault is that has that issued to its i
would have to say it's on those
companies about the guidelines they make
it very clear they have like weekly on
their developer blogs like weekly videos
and like yeah almost but you may enforce
it you can make themselves pretty
well yeah but I they might need to do
more enforcing in order to actually get
them to do it all right all right so uh
the samsung galaxy s3 is a hit in blue
and in white there's a possible leak
possible rumor that a black version is
coming so if you didn't like the white
one didn't like blue one or didn't get
it yet soon you might be able to get a
black there's a red one too there is a
you are right the red one there's a red
one only 418 t yep which is really nice
I like the red one my friend is gonna
get the red one well that's good squad
that's gonna happy for your friends I am
I he had a 1x but then he decided to
know if we sold out what nothing I
didn't say anything alright so the
International uh galaxy s3 speaking of a
galaxy s3 is uh getting an over-the-air
update it is not jelly bean so shocking
get your tour is not it pitchforks ready
but it does include a new radio baseband
that supposedly fixes a battery drain
issue so congrats on better battery life
to those of you that on the
international sgs3 um the Photon Q is a
rumor it's coming out in the 19th here
in a few more days the atrix HD LTE was
supposed to launch a little over a week
ago on the second Bell says that it's
coming on the 14th so phone is an epic
fail it should be here in there are two
days whoa-ah we'll see that you think
think the atrix HD is going to be an
epic fail yeah there's some interesting
software stuff by motorola go um but as
a phone it yeah some interesting things
um with widgets I'll tell you what what
is with manufacturers needs to continue
cramming more acronyms at the end of
their device name you know I love it not
for DHT okay let's talk about the
transformer pad tf300t l
II yeah this is getting out of hand hey
so the yeah so you did I wasn't making
fun the the Pad 300 is getting an LTE
variant we weren't just left foot just
laughing at it it uh it is getting a LT
varying it's gonna start in august
sometime this month in germany and
austria so good that'll be nice yeah in
huye the popular yet to be popular but I
guess it's cocking already right Oh
raised eight point six million dollars
that's it I feeler you use Kickstarter
program officially ended this week so if
you didn't get in on the pre-order
through Kickstarter you still can I
guess my cost you an extra ten bucks but
hey it's it's 110 dollar gaming system
um and you know what I realize in like
nine months yeah so you're gonna have to
wait till the city wait seven months i
believe for you in it so that that's a
long ways away but you know what there's
sixty three thousand people that backed
it on kickstarter and you gotta remember
not it the average person on the street
that plays games has no clue what the
help kickstarter is you know what
kickstarter is for people that are you
know pretty much if you're watching this
right now or listening to this right now
there's a chance that you might know
what kickstarter is where I've heard it
before but outside of that you know your
your your husband's your wives your
grandmother's your grandfather's aunts
and uncles there's a chance that they
have no idea what Kickstarter is so to
get 63,000 orders already that's that's
pretty much that's pretty amazing I
think and then we wanted to raise what
nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars
which I don't know what they could have
done with that amount of money I mean if
they're truly wanted to make this thing
you know well I need but then maybe the
production run was it's going to cost
XYZ for a production run and these are
your costs and so forth the production
and manufacturing so this is the amount
of money they want and then it is that
they had smaller numbers in insight um
not the type of reaction what they got
well yeah they got it six million
dollars that's insane but anyways if you
uh you can still check out who yeah and
get it for 109 bucks you can still
pre-order and then you'll get it seven
months or so but there's other things
happening was that's ridiculous oh yeah
but how is this device not going to be
woefully outdated by the time I only
comes out you know i'm honestly hoping
that over the next month or two as
they're getting the gun will say kinks
worked out of the system who knows
they're there and they're gonna realize
that you know we do a processor upgrade
or upgrade memory or do something and
threw something at it because by the
time this thing comes out as you said in
seven months is a long time in the tech
world you know a long time so it's going
to be it's going to be outdated when it
comes out so i hope they they use this
the extra funds that they generated to
that allows them to lower manufacturing
costs by doing more ball quarters and
allows them to upgrade the hardware a
little bit that would be very nice or
make the hardware easily upgradable that
could be also an interesting and then it
would be harder i could replace an arm
cpu yeah it could maybe it's going to be
like dropping another know maybe maybe
it'd be cool soldering kit in the mail
yeah there you go oh not it that's not
gonna work oh let's talk about some ICS
and jelly bean updates official update
some so HTC Thunderbolt and desire s
owners you were not forgotten dude the
Thunderbolt they've been talking about
this for years since roughly november of
last year yeah yeah so they've been
thought up for a while um but wait it's
right when ICS came out okay but HTC
said on facebook it's coming soon so
they haven't forgotten about it it may
happen mean august is a long month it's
like doing in HTC's terms is very
relative time
so much like their kernel source comes
out soon after device release really
which I mean several logs down the road
when they get yelled at enough to
finally bother releasing it I got I
gotta learn to remember let you finish
your rant parts are talking about
something I I need to let I need the way
as a way to say he yes yes something
hateful we want to say about this all
right so so uh the motorola razr is
getting ICS in the UK and Nordic
countries you may have already have it
if you're in those parts of your so if
you don't have it start spamming your
update button now we were the dumb phone
razor we're talking about that old
school flip phone are we talking about
now we could be talking with a new one
although done if the old school of flip
phone is getting ice is gone premium
arrest my razor that would be awesome my
razor from six years ago is getting yes
you know a big pool laughs in the face
to all the Thunderbolts of the world
that still don't have ICS my flip phone
I fears before yours next one you have
anything mean to say about this Oh see
now you just open it up to allow it just
kind of scared alright so to vodafone in
australia kept with their their plans
and jelly bean started rolling out this
week to the nexus s once again if you
don't have a jelly bean on your Nexus S
and Vodafone is your provider start
spamming that system update button and
enjoy jelly bean damn ok ok alright so
so let's talk a little bit about routing
in ramen is uh mentioned earlier um a
new app came out this week an
over-the-air update center that allows
any developer any wrong developer to to
use it to update their apps the the app
will add and remove over-the-air updates
from a centralized database it'll check
for updates on device boot it will
manually install an app it from if
someone runs are none Apple manually
install a rom if you
manually check for it it'll download the
rom and flash it directly or you can
manually do all that and it'll you can
tell it to wipe data you can tell to
what cash now it before flashing yada
yada yada also known as the same things
that do manager and raw manager can do
um I personally don't understand all the
rage that is going on how this is
amazing that this is out there because
this functionality already exists in
view manager and rom manager but it's
good to have another provider another
developer doing this it just means
though you know it's good for the
community somebody might come out the
feature that somebody else doesn't have
and you know at the it's good for open
source it's good for the community so
it's nice to have another choice out
there do what since Scott since you
don't do any routing I can't ask you
this question but dan did you run gu
manager or raw manager and get updates
that way in the past you know i'm i have
gotten the updates but i'm usually just
find them annoying because I look if I'm
looking to update my rom I'm gonna go
and I'm gonna do that I don't want
something number five minutes to tell me
that I need to do this yeah yeah I
understand I remember back on when you
and I were big into be y know we had a
system update that didn't need you know
new manager and wrong manager to tell us
an updated it was using me you I zone
system update it went out to me why not
us and told us there was an update and
it downloaded and flashed it and it all
so this is all but this type of
technology has been around for a while
it's yeah it's nothing groundbreaking
but it's nice to have another option out
there and it's nice to have it easy for
those people that just want to run a
custom rom and they aren't all about you
know going in and man you know where do
I go to get an update and so forth now
it'll take care of it for you so it's
nice those apps exist so another big
thing to hit the routing enrollment seen
this week well I was laying on the beach
was cm9 hit hits table so
cm9 now is available for over 50 devices
phones and tablets and a lot of people
are saying so why release a stable
version of cm9 when cm10 has been you
know preview released alpha release
whatever tons and tons of devices
development for cm10 is heavily underway
why still released a stable cm9 well
that's you know to complete their goal
you know these guys do this for free
they do this because they love to do it
so yeah it's nice to have goals and it's
nice to say you completed a goal but
besides you know personal gratification
think about all the phones that are
going to run a buggy version of cm10
jellybean for a while you know some
devices are easier to port to jellybean
than others so it's nice to have a
stable rom to fell back on if you can't
run a buggy version of jelly bean on
your i don't know no note your galaxy
note you know if it's even available for
that just as an example maybe something
doesn't work just right in and maybe
bluetooth doesn't work or something you
know so you need bluetooth so now you
have a stable bill to fall back on so
it's not so I'm glad that CM completed
their goal if it shows a little bit that
their goal minded which is good they
didn't just give up and move on to
bigger and better things so so speaking
of cm10 and jelly bean I never owned an
HTC dream or the HTC g1 anymore to want
to call it the g1 was the first
commercially available android phone
came back came out in 2008 and it's nice
to know or neat to know that it is
running jellybean right now there's a
small development community around it
still and one of the developers was able
to get cm10 running lon now that doesn't
mean it's ready for a daily driver that
doesn't mean that it's not laggy it
doesn't mean it's not slow but
as a concept to mean cm10 jelly bean is
running on a four year old phone right
now so that that's cool so if you have
your old tank the thing that just won't
die your original android phone just for
just for laughs you can go ahead and put
cm10 on it let me know how let me know
what you think then last but not least
for routing and roaming let's talk about
Google now for ICS Google now is
available for every ICS AOSP build wrong
all you need to do is install a couple
apks flash zip file and you're good to
go now Google now was available for a
while but you know voice wasn't working
well now voices is fully working it it's
it's not using obviously it's not using
the jelly bean speech engine because you
know near on ICS but Google now is
working with cards showing up and from
inside google now you can hit the
microphone button and do a voice search
and it'll use the ICS speech-to-text
engine to transcribe what you're saying
and talk back to you and the results so
it is full Google now plus search avoid
search and voice to text so this is
using the same engine as the ICS version
so you don't get the offline support her
oh yeah crap the flash files that I saw
it had the offline database built into
it or your option of I did not know that
because that would be something that you
know a feature that would be worth
noting if you did have the offline
capabilities even know I saw they had a
couple of different sort of
developmental versions and each one is
released as a with offline support or
without offline support there are six
different versions if I remember
correctly yeah yeah so some of them you
know have
nearly everything working but one thing
is bugging everything I am then the next
guy has that bug fix but some other
thing I broke another process yeah for
example you might have two cards show up
for weather instead of one you know but
the the latest APK that I was reading
about just before the show has nearly
everything fixed as nursing new cards
voice text to text works notifications
work so it looks like they might have
just got everything figured out
everything fixed but it is fully working
if you're running on AOSP rom so if
you're running cm9 feel free to flash it
and you have people now and voice search
capability like those of us with
jellybean have cool moving on Scott you
had mentioned earlier that Google was
forced to temporarily disable the new
jelly bean feature for copyright
protection on Android apps also known as
Darren also knows yes it's anti-piracy
you know the yeah the new security
feature was to make it harder to pirate
apps we're just good I'm all for that I
really yeah well it had to be disabled
um because some purchase apps not all
some this looks like some live
wallpapers and some older apps weren't
working correctly anymore and the
reasoning for that if paid apps aren't
installed in the standard app partition
yes my are currently it's my new
system they're not yes yeah on the new
system the other not installed and /
data / app they were installing to a
encrypted directory which is located /
mount / a sec in the new way in the new
way yeah okay yeah so the old way is /
data / app for paid apps and the new way
where's my age but
as for paid apps so apps were designed
to go into a certain partition CERN
directory and they were they were
causing problem not all apps were able
to run from that location without
causing issues what was happening is but
basically they couldn't find their data
so a user would reboot their phone and
then have they lose all for setting to
have to go back in or reconfigure the
app because they didn't wear their data
was so like a paid launcher for example
yeah every time you reboot your phone
it's just like you download it again bro
okay yeah it wasn't widespread not all
apps had that issue but well no because
the problem isn't really so much the
Google did something wrong as it is the
pd app developers aren't following
google directions which is kind of
google's fault because this is a pretty
significant change and there are a lot
of paid apps out there so you can't
really just kind of make that drastic of
a change without there's a little
building consider you try to program
that yeah there's a lot of apps that are
old that if you have been there for a
very long time yeah I'll get updated but
anyways it's good to know that a bug
report was filed with Google they're
aware of it and they temporarily
disabled recopy protection for for apps
I wonder when they're gonna bring it
back on once I figure out a workaround
yeah I wonder how long that's gonna be
oh yeah I guess part of the problem was
the way that the partition was mounted
and dismounted off on starting up and
shut down so maybe moving it higher than
opera Robin I don't secure cash for it
okay right like they did they write the
things just into this sort of generic
cash which gets flushed on a device
reboot because that's the more secure
thing to do but they can't then dump
that to slash data because they're not
under right to slash data because that's
not where they're installed ya know they
need to basically had a secure and
reboot surviving cash for that
alright so let's uh let's talk about
some patent wars over the past week one
of the neatest things in and in my
opinion that is Android related besides
just general litigation fighting that we
were able to find out is we actually got
well we got to see actual samsung and
iphone sales numbers which she find out
that obviously apple sells a lot of
devices and some sells a lot of devices
only talk about those numbers right now
but they sell a lot and you know they
make a lot of money on but one of the
neat things that we learned was two
years ago back in 2010 Apple offered
Samsung thirty dollars per phone and
forty dollars per tablet as for royalty
fees for licensing and that's pretty
expensive when you look at it when you
look at a foam that might cost you know
an unsubsidized phone maybe cost him you
know 400 bucks or something they wanted
for thirty bucks per phone that's crazy
so obviously samsung said no then that's
weather and uh that's why their
litigation right now but are also
already paying niven is really sure
probably somewhere between five and
twenty five dollars per phone to
microsoft yeah yeah which you know
microsoft hasn't been able to fully come
out and say which patents android is
violating but they believe that you're
violating some so well i mean that's
that's the thing with patents is that
you don't actually have to be violating
them you just have to sort of have the
clout to get people to sign an agreement
thinking that you do have it that is you
know um anything else about patent wars
come out that sparking interest this
week no you guys haven't been all this
because the if you guys haven't been
following it it's actually pretty
interesting the back and the fourth and
how they deal with it now what they're
using to either prove or disprove some
of the accusations is rather interesting
i've been
following it so it's it's been a good
read and hopefully Andrew it comes out
on top it's not an Angela issue it's
definitely getting portrayed as that but
it's not the issues that are at play
here just aren't sweeping android
problems it's display stuff fits and
it's all about Samsung in particulars
design choices and whether or not their
designs are too similar to Apple's
designs it's not that Android looks too
much like Apple it's that samsung's
version of Android looks too much like
Apple yo so before we move on to the
drag race here it's the quick skim over
see if we ask it over see if we have any
questions here so apparently Motorola's
saying the Bionic is getting ICS in the
early q3 well uh yeah well none not too
many carriers stretch the motorolas ever
her manufacturers are ever accurate when
devices are getting updates as the woody
if you have a bionic I wouldn't hold my
breath if I were you yeah take
everything that they say with a grain of
salt let's talk about a drag race so you
know we've seen you know samsung galaxy
s3 vs. the iphone 4s being used as
hammers being used as all sorts of you
know thrown got been thrown down stairs
been dropped from a few feet see which
one's balance which one's break and
everything so we've seen all sorts of
drop tests and brake tests and it comes
out that the galaxy s3 with its Gorilla
Glass is extremely adorable it's just
you know it holds up at Windsor Essex
pretty hard to break oh yeah so
I guess an excellent doctor Deb they're
like no I don't know what I wouldn't
call on I'm not commented I don't say so
the next logical step is to pull the
phone behind a car I guess you know me
that's my next logical step all right
what other possible drag no I mean yeah
so if you're coming up with creative
ideas if you have fifteen hundred
dollars to blow and you want to break
two phones the next logical step is to
pull behind a vehicle oh great one
caller be convinced somebody to give you
the phones for free yeah yeah or
convince Lisa hey Annie Ben I need to
make a viral video are we do that
actually android authority did do that
with the the drop test as well the first
one anyways so what so what somebody did
is they place the phones face down on
the road and the guy hopped in the trunk
he had the phones attached by a string
and the phones were taped with gorilla
tape to the back of the phone so they
were laying face down I'm gonna fall out
and he hopped in the car and his buddy
drove off and you see the phone bouncing
back and forth tskinnak and then they
they trained the terrain changes a
little bit it's not smooth the phones
are bouncing like a skipping rock
everywhere and you know what the galaxy
s3 was completely usable and worked fine
it had a couple scratches and chips
around the edges but the glass was
perfectly fine I mean it is nuts i I
couldn't believe it now you enjoy
turning them on which would have proved
a lot but he didn't turn on your right
my turn it down it would have took it
would have proved a decent amount more
real nice okay so it was a glass test
maybe not phone function test yeah I've
seen people using iPhones were shattered
screen so just cuz your screen is
shattered doesn't mean you can't use it
yeah but yeah so the anti phone was
completely shattered it lost the glass
test uh you know I I wasn't surprised
after seeing previous
doesn't any iPhone have Gorilla Glass no
you don't have really glass but they
have what the front was go gorilla glass
in the back was not know Scott soon no
I'm pretty sure it's not as I thought
that the sgs2 has the gorilla glass 2
though yep there's to do there's many
versions of grills best other Eric you
to the same guy has version 2 I thought
the iphone 4s had the old version the
version one on the front and then just
regular tempered glass on the back woven
the version one on the front and the
version one wasn't that good the STS
long enough having to impractical ass no
agree but I'm getting this oh no well I
yeah oh I don't know about the iphone
but the gosh you know a lot of shattered
iPhones gorilla glass 2 alright let's
see we have any questions here before we
wrap up early this week I've been
vaguely I believe the app encryption
problem is that the a sec partition is
mounted after Dana okay it makes sense
as we're saying it was a during the boot
process and shutdown process how was
mounted and dismounted he says so that
the system sees the app data first and
doesn't see the related app installed so
thinks it's safe to delete the data a
sec is then mounted and says hey where
the hell's my date at an android says
all you wander a minute ago bro so we
deleted you okay I got you all right
thanks Ben it's appreciated okay there's
not any other questions here feel free
to let us know if you have any topics
you want us to talk about and we'll try

as my main computer for any things i
didn't have it on vacation or mr. i
didn't obviously have a laptop or a
desktop on vacation i had my galaxy
nexus of my nexus 7 so i use that thing
every morning when i woke up to you know
