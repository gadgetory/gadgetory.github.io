brought to you by domain.com so let's
talk marshmallow and all the
improvements we hope it brings to our
beloved Android now the number one thing
especially for all as hardcore fans out
there is customization while Android M
offers such features as arranging quick
toggles and having a possible dark theme
it's still no match compared to custom
roms theming and changes to the core
look of the OS are nothing new to the
rooting community in his time Google
allows this deep customization in stock
Android now number two is way overdue a
better tablet UI Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich had a dedicated tablet UI which
made the tablet and phone experience
very different jelly bean unified the
tablet and phone UI to look and act very
similar while keeping them separate and
lollipop basically made them
indistinguishable this is a good and bad
thing while the experience is now the
same no matter what device you're using
there are any special software features
that make having a tablet worth wild
which leads into our next section now
number three is a big one if tablets are
going to become a serious tool for
productivity and that comes down to
multitasking and RAM management multi
window multitasking is nothing new for
owners of smartphones that come with
customized versions of Android like
those from Samsung or LG but until now
it has not been included in stock
Android while still in the experimental
stage this feature is now in the Android
M Developer Preview it enables apps to
be opened simultaneously in all four
corners or two side by side the only
problem is that it doesn't necessarily
look good and closing apps in this way
may reveal others that are behind it
this can lead to a confusing experience
which I'm hoping will be addressed in
coming updates also the RAM management
issues that should have been addressed
in KitKat
still exist today and without these
issues being fixed multi window apps and
heavy multitasking do not seem possible
on stock Android just yet and can we
talk better lockscreen and widgets
Google introduced lock screen widgets in
Android 4.2 and sort of remove them in
lollipop swiping left or right now opens
the camera or phone there's no option to
add widgets and swipe between them like
you could in jelly bean or KitKat
however the notifications are actionable
so there is still the ability to change
songs and do anything that you could in
the notification shade this method works
but is not as pretty or as useful as it
used to be having the ability to add
widgets like in jelly bean or KitKat
with actionable notifications would be a
very nice improvement now a big issue
really big is privacy and permissions a
pops made a slight appearance in Android
4.3 jelly bean it let you control which
apps you can take advantage of with
permissions if you didn't want Facebook
being able to see your location you
could block the app from being able to
do so
unfortunately this feature was removed
in Android 4.4.2 KitKat
being able to control app permissions is
a must-have and it would be a welcome
addition to Android M or any future
Android release and a big issue for the
geek community is full backup and
restore now this is nothing new in the
root community one of the best things
about being able to unlock or root the
phone is the ability to install a custom
recovery CWM recovery and TW RP both
offer ways to make Android backups which
back up the whole system in case
something goes wrong this only takes a
few clicks and the options provided are
very customizable restoring it is also a
breeze with just a few steps Google is
getting closer with the ability to
backup app data in Android M and the
ability to add accounts and the home
screen layout using tap and go this is
relatively convenient compared to old
versions of Android but it doesn't
compare to a full system or store or a
dedicated app like titanium backup now I
know that this is a bit of a pipe dream
but we would love the ability to remove
bloatware without rooting our phone
carrier branded devices are known to
come with a lot of bloatware 18t
installs apps and the double digits on
branded devices and even the Nexus 6
when it came out AT&amp;amp;T is not the only
one at fault however most of the
carriers have come with some sort of
bloatware that you can't get rid of no
matter how hard you try unless of course
you root your phone disabling the apps
and settings will get rid of them in the
app drawer and prevent them from doing
anything but they still take up precious
space on your device so what do you
think am I missing something let me know
in the comments below what you'd like to
see in Android M so someone asked me the
name of my website I told them and then
they promptly forgot
but they were able to find it because
they assumed as 90% of the population
does that there was a dot-com extension
so they were able to find it without
getting distracted going to someone
else's website that's the power of a
dot-com because no domain name extension
tells your story with the same level of
trust as a.com or.net domain name
dot-com and dotnet domain name
extensions and Jack credibility into
your online presence and who doesn't
want more credibility you can save 15%

I want to clear something up earlier
this week we did an Android weekly show
and part of it I made fun and criticized
hallway for the slogan on their Huawei
watch where they say a wearable to be
worn and I said this was a very poor
choice of words and I made fun of it
comparing it to the litany of other poor
Chinese English translations their sites
out there that just feature this right
where they show you a sign where it was
in Chinese and English and the English
translation is completely off and
misleading that is part of my job that
was entirely fair criticism as someone
in my position that is part of my job a
wearable to be worn if you think about
that is redundant a wearable means
something you are able to wear a
wearable to be worn is then redundant
that's like saying a drink to be drunk a
car to drive a light to turn on it's
ridiculous it's it doesn't mean anything
what exactly does it mean and Huawei
with their budget and size should have
known that I don't know how that made it
past their marketing department if
they're filled with people who are not
native English speakers and I realize if
you're not a native English speaker that
may seem kind of appropriate but it's
not it's redundant it's absolutely
horrible it's a very poor choice of
words so I want to put that out there it
was not racist because I'm not
criticizing Chinese people I'm
criticizing the marketing department
that put that copy out let me know what
you guys think in the comments below you
don't forget about my brothers and
sister Android we're working super hard
to be your source for all things
