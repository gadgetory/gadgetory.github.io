brought to you by domain.com alright so
it's hard not to get a little bit
excited because we got images and videos
surrounding the galaxy s6 that suggests
that not only is it a top hardware-based
but it actually might be a one-handed
device please let me tell you the leaked
rain is just chugging along this week we
received a benchmark that if genuine
confirms our high expectations in the
hardware department now there's no major
surprises here the list confirmed specs
that have been heavily rumored in the
past with the 5.1 inch 1440 x 2560
display 3 gigabytes of ram a 20
megapixel camera and an exynos 7420
processor the benchmark score is way up
there the overall score is sixty
thousand nine hundred and seventy eight
and this comparison is with the note for
running an X oh noes 5433 and shows that
3d graphics performance sees the biggest
improvement setting people with direct
knowledge of the matter Bloomberg
confirmed this week that both the galaxy
s6 and the s6 edge will feature all
metal bodies and Samsung's most advanced
processor chips both devices will
feature a 5.1 inch screen and metal
frames manufactured by the Chinese
supplier BYD electronic said the sources
did you hear that a 5.1 inch display and
if I can just speak to the non phablet
fanatics in the audience right now
that's pretty amazing imagine if the
phone had thinner bezels than the last
that user experience might be very
similar to my Nexus 5 only much more
powerful see I had the original Galaxy
Note which was five point two inches but
the bezels were thick and the phone
itself was very very thick so with a
much thinner phone thinner bezels all
metal design could be interesting slap
cyanogenmod on there mmm what do you
guys think would you buy it now for
those of you who are fans of the oneplus
one but have lamented because you
actually can't get an invite the wait is
over at least if it's Tuesday one plus
is making its no invite events or
occurrence with the one plus one set to
go on sale with no strings attached
every Tuesday announced on the company
blog this week the new system will see
both the 16 gigabyte silk white model
and the 64 gigabytes sandstone black
model go on sale without any invitations
the events will open every tuesday at
12am pacific 3 a.m. eastern ADM british
and 4pm hong kong time and will last for
a total 24 hours one plus is not giving
up on its invites anytime soon the
beloved system will remain in place for
the other six days of the week and users
buying the one during the open windows
will still receive invitations to give
away to friends all good news sadly
though it must be said that this is only
for the global variant of the one plus
one all our friends in India and
Indonesia won't get to join the fun now
for those of you who are fans of nvidia
tegra k1 while we receive news of the
Tegra x1 and it's looking pretty sweet
Nvidia's Tegra x1 mobile
system-on-a-chip was one of the big
announcements in CES 2015 and it's
probably not a surprise to you that
nvidia is apparently working on the
successor to which shield tablet which
will contain the company's latest
processing package nvidia even made the
bold claim that after we see the
demonstration of this new chip that it
will redefine the future of gaming look
forward to seeing that and that all will
take place on March third just before
the start of the Mobile World Congress
and NVIDIA has been up to big things
lately with their latest system on a
chip on the market the Tegra k1 which
has been running very well on devices
like the Nexus 9 now its successor the
Tegra x1 was announced in CES in January
expanding the availability of high-end
64-bit mobile processors on the market
the Tegra x1 Nvidia tablet seems
inevitable but we can't wait to see it
demonstrated in a few months now I got
