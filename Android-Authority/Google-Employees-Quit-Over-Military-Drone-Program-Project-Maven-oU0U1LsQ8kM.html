protest over project maven project maven
is a military drone program and these
Google employees feel that it runs
counter to Google's unofficial motto
don't be evil
back in April about a thousand Google
employees voiced their opposition to the
company's involvement in a drone warfare
program initiated by the Pentagon this
week almost a dozen Google employees
quit their jobs in protest to what has
become known as Project maven although
the exact number of employees who quit
is not known gives motor reports that
the quote mass exodus is about a dozen
employees in direct result of Google's
involvement with Project maven a
military pilot program which aims to use
AI and machine learning to analyze
objects in drone footage the employees
in question believe that the company's
involvement in a government warfare
program violates the ethical nature of
Google's motto which is don't be evil
and also feel that Google's refusal to
adequately address employee concerns
represents a drastic working environment
change the only course of action left
according to the employees was to quit
now before things get too hot and
political let's just go a little bit
deeper although the exact nature of
project maven is under wraps it appears
that the military program could
theoretically be used to give drones the
ability to analyze objects before an
attack for example an algorithm would
help a military drone analyze footage of
an enemy base of operations and
determine whether it was a legitimate
target or not now depending on what's
really important to you you could see
that in very different ways you could
say this is a great thing right because
this ensures that we reduce collateral
damage it reduces the chance that we're
going to hurt innocent people and that's
a good thing or you could say no that's
dangerous and horrible because you're
further removing human decision-making
and human lives from that potential
conflict resulting that the battle from
your side looks more like a video game
because you're not actually risking
American lives
you're just risking the other side's
lives or you could say no that's the
point that's fantastic we are protecting
our interests defending our borders
without having to risk soldiers lives
that's fantastic but if the history of
previous drone usage is any indication
this technology tends to be used for far
more than it is publicly stated it will
be used for many of you may be surprised
to know that Obama not only embraced but
vastly expanded Bush's drone program he
killed many more terrorists and many
more innocent civilians than Bush did if
you have the power it is very difficult
to restrain yourself from using it for
other things than you originally
intended to do and this is a risk not
just for Google but for anybody who has
awesome power guys I know this is a
seriously hot topic but I really do want
to hear your opinion on it please let me
know in the comments below or on Twitter
