or authority now this is my fourth video
this week where i've been covering the
major announcements from arm at
beginning the week we looked at dynamic
the way of putting heterogeneous calls
into a single cluster we looked at the
new cortex a 75 then looked at the
cortex a 55 and now finally we've come
to the new GPU the mali g72 so the
question before today is what new in the
GPU and when we see it in a smartphone
well let me explain so arms Mali GPU is
the most popular mobile GPU in the world
you'll find about 50% of all smart
phones and also it in other industry
anything that need a display which can
display complicated graphics you will
also find Mali GPUs in there in fact
armed partners shipped over a billion
Mali GPU in 2016 so that's an amazing
number and now arm have announced the
g72 so a bit of a recap last year arm
announced the new architecture the
Bifrost architecture for its next few
years worth of GPUs and we had the G 71
which were announced and the G 71 is
what you find in the galaxy f8 you also
find it in the any phone is powered by
the quirian 960 and then we also have
the G 51 which was a area efficiency GPU
so that we aimed at the mid and low end
Footwear a ton of silicon is at a
premium cost and now this year we've got
the G 72 now the G 72 is a refinement
and an improvement of the G 71 and gives
us greater performance but also it has
been optimized for some special use
cases which we'll talk about in a moment
so starting with the performance now
there are two numbers here I want to
give you one is 40% increase in
performance which is an amazing number
if you think about it 40% better
performance in phones that we're going
to see in 2018 compared to phones that
we had in 2017 and that's because of
improvements in the Mali GPU itself but
also there are other improvements
we'll be things like the ISO know the
manufacturing node that's used to put it
into silicon and maybe the number of
shader calls that have been added in and
so on
so basically in 2018 we can expect to
see foes that are 40% better GPUs and
2017 if you look at just the GPU itself
if you took today's g72 and you compare
it comparing it against the g71 in
exactly the same kind of chip in exactly
the same setup built exactly the same
Factory the g72 is 25% faster than the
g71 now as well as raw performance
numbers arm of also been working to make
sure the g72 is fully optimized for high
fidelity games what we mean by high
fidelity games is not your kind of your
your crusty road games where it's just
kind of simple 3d graphics but games
that are bringing that kind of console
level and PC level graphics to a
smartphone the example that arm of given
is the after pulse game and the
developers of after pulse worked closely
with arm to make sure that the game
could bring out the best graphics on a
mobile device
now the g72 has taken that even a step
further and they've concentrated on
optimizing the internals of the GPU so
it gets the best performance for these
high fidelity games now in technical
speak high fidelity games means games
that have a high number of vertexes
games that have complicated shaders of a
program that run inside of those cups
programmable shaders are complicated
codes and ones that apply special
effects to the actual graphics that we
see now that's more than what you get in
a sort of a standard game these are
games that really are pushing the
envelope for mobile gaming and basically
armors made sure these high vertex count
these hot complicated shader programs
can run mega efficiently on the g72 in
fact arm are saying that in the
internals the bandwidth of data flowing
back and forth the amount of data blood
flowing back and forth inside the the
processor can be reduced by up to 40% on
the high fidelity games using the G 72
compared to the G 71 now another area
where we are seeing the envelope being
pushed for mobile GPUs of course is with
virtual reality and just recently we had
Google
oh and at Google i/o there were lots of
announcements around VR mobile VR
they're announcements around headsets
that just have everything built into
them
of course we're expected to see Molly
GPUs in those kind of VR setups daydream
support for devices like the Galaxy s8
and basically the Molly g72 has again
been focused on optimizing for the use
case of VR to make sure all of those
extra techniques that we need to apply
for VR can be done efficiently in the g7
t2 now Robert configured written an
excellent article over and Android of
course comet looked at the challenges
faced by mobile VR today and I highly
recommend that you go and read that
article to understand what needs to
happen for the future for mobile VR to
continue its stellar growth and of
course the other big area where we are
seeing great strides of course is
machine learning and AI again Google IO
we go back there and we see that Google
made lots of significant announcements
again about machine learning at Google
i/o got things like tensorflow light
there are other things coming down the
pipeline and it goes arm recently
released their computing library which
allows the CPU and the GPU to work
together to solve machine learning
problems equals that's a cortex CPU
together with a Mali GPU and the SDK
decides where to give the jobs to which
part of the SOC
to get the best results another Margie
Margie 72 has again putting several
optimizations to make sure that machine
learning can run the most efficiently on
that platform one other optimization
worth mentioning is the fact that the
Bifrost architecture supports up to 32
shader calls now we haven't seen a 32
shader called GPU actually out in the
marketplace yet however the Samsung s8
is kind of pushing that boundary up
towards that end and so for the G 72 arm
have made sure that the 32 shader core
version is actually fully optimized so
maybe I don't think maybe in 2018 but
maybe in 2019 we're going to see some
very high shader core count in G 72
gpus but for the moment that is
available now to their partners knowing
that it's fully optimized for that full
set of 32 shader calls
so to recap what we've basically got is
a 25% increase in general performance of
the g72 compared to the g 71 and that
can go up to maybe 40% when you consider
new configurations that are available
and different manufacturing processes
that will be available during 2018 we've
also got the optimization for the 32
shader cores and actually the G 72 is
less dense 20% less dense than the G set
one which means you get more GPU in less
of an area now one of the amazing things
we saw with the G 71 was how quickly it
made its way into a hand fit now
basically arm create these GPU designs
and they give it to their partner so
that would include people at Samsung and
people like while way now while way
actually from the moment they receive
the designs for the GPU from arm they
actually managed to get it into a
product which is the mate 8 in just
eight months fro from the moment they
get the design you've got to have it in
a product it's going to be manufactured
shipped and out into the marketplace in
just eight months that was the Huawei
mate 8 with the G 71 in it now I we
expect this rapid deployment of the
technology to continue so in 2018 we're
definitely going to see phones with the
Molly G 72 inside of it and we may see
them sooner than we when we previously
thought because this this speed of
development is continuing so watch out
the beginning part of next year maybe
even be in part of this year to see
announcements for SOC s with the G 72 in
it I'm going from Andrew authority and I
hope you enjoyed this video if you did
please do give it a thumbs up if you
liked the video you liked the other
videos I've made miss series do
subscribe to and royalties YouTube
channel and hit that notification bill
so they always get announcements or when
we release a new video and last but not
least do go over to Andrew authority
comm because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
