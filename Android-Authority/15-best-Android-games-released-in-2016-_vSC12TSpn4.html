handy the Android authority app guy and
it's about that time of year to round up
the best new Android games that were
released in 2016 if you want to check
out any of these games for yourself you
can find those links in the video
description below
overlooks constellations is an
atmospheric puzzle game that takes place
in space
it features slower mechanics that focus
more on chilling out rather than
fast-paced action your task will be to
grow your planet to be larger than all
of the other players
the game features 150 levels full
Android TV support various modes and
maps online multiplayer support and more
it's a bit expensive at $9.99 but you
can download the game for free and play
it a little bit before deciding to drop
the money I asphalt Xtreme is the latest
racing game from Gameloft unlike prior
titles in the series extreme features
off-road vehicles along with off-road
tracks currently the game has 35
vehicles although we expect that number
to grow over time like other games in
this series you'll have access to online
multiplayer mode it's a good-looking
game with simple mechanics that also
works as a great time waster for racing
fans
it's a freemium game which is the worst
part about it but it's still pretty fun
clash royale is the big supercell
released from the last year thankfully
they actually did a pretty good job
clash Royale is a card-based PvP game
where you duel against other players
much like other supercell games there is
a ranking system where you improve by
beating other players you can also form
clans share cards and earn various
rewards for playing the game it's
intensely popular which means you'll
have opponents to play pretty much all
the time
it's freemium which does suck but at
least it's social features are really
strong don't starve fills itself as an
uncompromising wilderness survival game
your job will be to explore the world
finding various things defending
yourself and staying alive the game has
charming graphics and open world to
explore and some of that classic indie
developer quirk it also has some popular
features like an offline mode so you can
play the game even without a web
connection it's a pay once game so you
won't be bugged by in-app purchases the
only downside is that the controls
aren't quite as good as the PC version
but really who expected that anyway
exploding kittens is a card game that
was originally funded on Kickstarter the
basic premise is that everybody plays
cards and draws until you get an
exploding kitten card if you don't have
a defuse card
you lose the game the winner is the last
player standing it features online
playing capabilities for up to five
players you can also get the base game
for a dollar ninety-nine and buy
additional content for the game through
in-app purchases it was one of the most
funded mobile games on Kickstarter for a
reason and it's because it's fun
Square Enix released a ton of good games
this year Final Fantasy 9 is pretty much
as good as it gets it's a complete port
of the original PlayStation version for
those who are interested along with the
25 plus our story line you'll have
copious numbers of side quests to do and
plenty of places to explore the port
also includes add-ons that make you
practically invincible and rich if you
just want to play through the storyline
its insanely expensive at twenty dollars
and 99 cents but it does go on sale
fairly often and there are no in-app
purchases never alone KY Edition is a
puzzle platformer with a fun little
storyline you play as a girl and her pet
Fox you control both characters and use
them to overcome obstacles you normally
wouldn't be able to with one character
the game also comes with tons of lore
decent graphics and plenty of other
goodies it's relatively inexpensive with
no in-app purchases and those who have
an Nvidia shield tablet or Android TV
can get a slightly better version of the
game for a little more money pinout is a
fun little pinball game in a market that
doesn't have a lot of good pinball games
pinout is a hybrid of an arcade pinball
game and an infinite runner you'll be
launching the ball through various
obstacles for as long as humanly
possible it looks good and the controls
are pretty easy to learn what makes this
game special is that it's a pay once
game in a genre that is dominated by
freemium titles it's a good time killer
that won't bug you to spend even more
money Pokemon go did something that no
other mobile game before it was able to
do it caused such a stir that people
hated it on principle just because they
hate popular things it broke many many
mobile gaming records including most
active users in case you've been living
under a rock pok√©mon go as a gamer you
use your GPS to go hunt and capture
pokemons in the real world even if you
hate the idea of it no one can deny how
unique it really was it used your GPS
Bluetooth camera and mobile connections
in ways that no other game has and that
includes ingress which made it a truly
mobile game it was a cultural phenomenon
and as it turns out it was pretty fun
and unique Riptide GP renegade was one
of the best racing games released in
2016
it features wave runners instead
cars and the developers did a great job
integrating the waves into the mechanics
of the game the story goes that you're a
racer who got busted doing an illegal
street race you must race your way back
up through the underground and back into
the GP circuit it's an inexpensive pay
once game with no in-app purchases and a
lot of replay value
it also has online multiplayer modes if
you're into that super phantom cat is a
platformer where you play as a cat that
jumps on platforms it takes a lot of its
inspiration from the 8-bit and 16-bit
games of old so you'll likely see a
number of themes from your favorite old
platformers that includes things like
disappearing platforms collecting coins
and tons of bad guys to jump on or over
it's a free to play game with a single
in-app purchase technically that makes
it a freemium game but it's about as
inoffensive of a freemium game as it
gets the room 3 is the latest release of
one of the best puzzle game franchises
in all of mobile gaming this iteration
surpassed its predecessors by being
larger and longer than before on top of
that there are various endings to play
through which adds a surprising amount
of replay value
it also supports cloud saving and
redesigned touch controls from the
previous games for a dollar ninety-nine
you really can't do much better than
this one
the 4 point 9 out of 5 star rating on
Google Play also makes it the highest
rated major game released this year
Titan Quest was originally a PC game
that was released in 2006 it's been
remastered and it's now on Android with
this game you'll get a huge hack and
slash adventure game with tons of stuff
to do it boasts 30 character classes an
open world and a redesigned gameplay to
work better on touch screens the
developers boast a 60 hour playtime
along with no advertising and no in-app
purchases this is one of the precious
few open-world RPGs that isn't a
freemium game and is definitely worth a
shot Zen jiz an atmospheric puzzle game
that does things a little bit
differently it doesn't keep score there
is no timer no leaderboards no stars to
earn and there isn't even a tutorial
you'll jump right in figure everything
out on your own and then progress at
your own pace the game tells a story of
a character named Eon who was trapped
between worlds your goal is to solve all
of the puzzles and find out what
happened it's one of the most relaxing
games released this year crash-lands is
simply a masterpiece for those who
haven't tried it you play as an
intergalactic trucker who is stranded on
a planet after being attacked your job
is to build a base fight off bad guys
and explore the planet
it's a rather large planet with tons of
bad guys and resources for you to
acquire you then use those things to
craft various items and build your home
base it features 500 craftable items a
self-managing infinite inventory RPG
elements for character progression
creatures that you can tame and even a
decent combat system there is even cloud
saving mixed with cross-platform support
so you can play the same save file on PC
or mobile it's pretty much everything
that people have been asking for in a
mobile game a story tons of content and
a huge open world the best part is that
it's reasonably priced at $4.99 with no
in-app purchases there really isn't
anything to hate about this game and it
checks virtually every box that we can
think of that's why it's our pick for
the best Android game released in 2016
