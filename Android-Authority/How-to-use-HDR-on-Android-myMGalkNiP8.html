Channel I'm Kate
among the many magical things that my
Android handset lets me do mobile
photography is one of my top favorites
the stock Android camera provides enough
features for photography that both
amateurs and pros alike can enjoy
including HDR photography
what is HDR how does the Android cameras
HDR feature work how can you effectively
use HDR on your Android device in this
video I'll talk about the HDR feature on
Android and how to maximize its
potential HDR stands for high dynamic
range this imaging method involves
taking three or more pictures of the
same subject at different exposure
levels an underexposed image and image
with normal exposure and an overexposed
image professional photographers then
use photo editing software to combine
these images into one with more detail
and equal exposure HDR on android uses
the same basic principles but needs less
manual intervention in a nutshell HDR on
Android fixes exposure and balance
especially with photos shot in bright or
dark settings this correction produces
photos with more detail than usual
imaging modes can produce before
proceeded let's check first whether your
camera supports HDR the best way to find
out is to look around in your camera app
on most Samsung devices you'd usually
find it under the list of shooting modes
in the camera settings on certain HTC
devices such as the One X and desire X
is under the camera scene section on
Sony Xperia phones it's usually in the
camera settings menu on the Nexus 4
you can quickly activate HDR mode right
on the viewfinder screen just long tap
on the viewfinder and tap the HDR icon
sadly I couldn't find HDR on the Nexus
10 or the Galaxy Nexus at other times
the HDR feature comes under a different
label on the Samsung Galaxy camera for
instance
you won't find HDR but you'll find a
similar feature that Samsung calls rich
tone capturing HDR photos is just like
capturing a normal photo just enable HDR
mode first before capturing photos since
your camera will be taking three or more
consecutive shots keep your hands steady
while taking a photo if a tripod is
available use it point your camera at
the subject use tap to focus if needed
and if it's supported then capture the
image by tapping the shutter
voila you have your own HDR image while
you most likely get only one image file
when using HDR on samsung devices you'd
usually get two image files one with HDR
and the other with normal exposure check
the file names the HDR image file
usually looks similar to this capturing
HDR images is easy but is it all right
to use HDR all the time when is the
right time to use HDR high dynamic range
mode is best for landscape photography
if you go on a trip for example and you
want to capture the image of the
stunning landscape against a bright sky
like this one use HDR that way the
details of your landscape photo will
have an enhanced background and
foreground see the difference
HDR also works great with portrait shots
especially when the background is bright
most of my friends always advised me not
to take photos against the light but
with HDR I can get away with it most of
the time you can even use HDR in a dim
environment like this here's the subject
in normal mode and this one's the same
subject in HDR mode which one's better
HDR can also be used to remedy low-light
scenes if the place is dark and you
don't want to use flash use HDR you'll
get improved photos if you do HDR is a
handy feature on any Android camera but
there are certain limits to its use for
instance HDR won't work well with moving
subjects because HDR mode takes three or
more photos in succession another
occasion where you won't want HDR is
when you want to capture realistic
colors on your images if so disable HDR
because it will alter the colors and
exposure of your image I showed you
earlier how to check for the presence of
HDR on your Android device if you can't
find HDR anywhere your device most
likely doesn't support it but that
doesn't mean you can't use HDR you can
still capture HDR images in the help of
Android apps the HDR camera plus app
available on the Google Play Store
or is one such app it lets you capture
HDR photos and instantly edit your work
within the app let me talk a bit about
how this app works here I'll use a non
HDR phone the Samsung Galaxy Nexus this
is how the camera looks like this area
is the viewfinder this small thumbnail
here is a preview of the last photo that
you took this one is the virtual shutter
button this cogwheel is the button for
the settings menu and this slider is for
zooming in or out before shooting an
image first set the image size for the
photo then go to advanced settings and
toggle the option to edit the photo
after taking it let's leave the other
settings as they are for now now let's
take some HDR photos this works just
like any other camera app point focus
and shoot and here's our HDR image
because we've enabled the editing
feature the image editor screen will
appear
you can select preset filters or
manually set tone mapping parameters
such as exposure color vividness
contrast and micro contrast after
editing remember to save the photo
awesome you now have an HDR image taken
by a non HDR phone thanks to the HDR
camera plus app mobile photography
becomes more fun with camera features
such as HDR on your Android device in
this video I showed you how HDR works
and how to maximize its use on your
Android device I hope you find this
video helpful for more Android guides
