Authority I'm here to show you really
quickly what the Google pixel to launch
it looks like on the Galaxy Note 8 it'll
actually work on any phone running
Android lollipop and above so we'll show
you how to do that in just a little bit
but let's take a look first like the new
pixel 2 phones you'll see that the
Google search bar appears on the bottom
of the home screen just above the
navigation buttons but the familiar
swipe of app drawer is still in place at
the top of the screen we've got the new
at-a-glance widget which shows the date
and the current weather conditions but
it'll also alert you to upcoming
calendar events about half an hour
before they occur and current traffic
conditions both of these can be disabled
from the home screen settings if you
only want the date and weather displayed
though hopefully some more options will
arrive in an update in the near future
like upcoming reminders maybe flight
information or even parcels that are
about to arrive if you tap the date
it'll open up the calendar for more
information and tapping the forecast
opens more detailed weather info the
Google search bar of course works the
same but it'll actually open the search
bar at the top of the screen while your
keyboard pops up at the bottom if you
want the google app to live on the
leftmost home screen then you'll
actually need to install the APK as a
system app if you just install that APK
as you normally would then you won't
have this functionality to install the
old launcher as a system app you'll need
root access of course so just download
the app and then move to system slash
app once it's there just change a couple
read/write permissions and reboot your
phone one other thing that's worth
mentioning is that a couple of features
are not going to be available if your
device isn't running Android Orio like
on the galaxy note here you'll see that
I'm missing a few options that are
present on the pixel running Orio
including the toggle for notification
dots the ability to change the app icon
shape and whether or not you want to add
new apps to your home screen of course
because the pixel to launcher is just a
launcher it's not going to affect any
other additional functionality other
features like the s-pen on the Galaxy
Note 8 will still work fine so pop the
pen out and you can use all those
features as you normally can there's a
couple of other google pixel to apks
floating around right now including the
new google camera so be sure to hit the
video description below for some links
to android authority well we will take
you through everything that's new as
always guys thank you so much for
watching hit that like button if you've
enjoyed this video be sure to let us
know if you want to see more videos like
this subscribe to the channel hit that
notification bell trackers down on
social and stay tuned
Android authority because we are useless
