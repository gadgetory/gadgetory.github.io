by bitdefender mobile security and in
strasbourg are from android 30 what's
going on everybody and hopefully you saw
the Nokia X and X plus a quick look that
I gave like here we have the excel as
you can see here it is a much larger
device as compared to the 4-inch screen
that's found on the X and the X plus we
have a 5-inch screen here this is a
larger device as you can see I'm just
barely able to reach with my thumb and
pinky over here on the diagonal there
but as far as a design goes it does have
that blocky look that has that is in the
Nokia X and is pretty much permeated
throughout Nokia's a general line of
smartphones as a really sturdy feel it
is a little bit lighter than your
typical Nokia phone
however this really flat sided look and
design does allow it to be pretty easily
held in the hand the button layout is
over here on the right side with the
power and volume rockers right over here
for easy reach a little bit lower on the
phone and overall it's a very sturdy
looking device you really don't get the
same side this is of a low quality build
and at the same time you know the design
really exudes what Nokia do have just
these simple back button right here
which should allude to you already what
kind of user interface experience you're
going to be expecting but other than
that there really isn't a whole lot else
in terms of the design of the phone
like I said already you do have a 5-inch
screen right here and it is powered by
just like the other two phones it is
powered by a Snapdragon s4 that Clarkson
adds one gigahertz and in this case we
have 768 megabytes of RAM underneath
looking on the screen you do have a
different looking Android here nokia is
using android for the first time in
their smart phones here and it is a very
different looking one it's a little bit
like like the Kindle Fire operating
systems that you see on Amazon's
products in that it's very 4th and it
does not use Google Play services when
you get into the UI it does look very
much like a Metro UI with all of the
tiles and it's just a kind of long
scroll down for all of the apps and
whatnot and as you can see here there
are quite a lot of apps from the Android
ecosystem that is the point of these
phones is bringing Nokia build quality
with the Metro UI look but still being
able to use Android applications now
unfortunately you don't have Google Play
services on here so you're going to not
have Gmail and maps and whatnot you will
have the Microsoft equivalence of those
instead but going through all of the
applications it's pretty easy to see
that you are able to get them on here in
one way or another if not through the
Nokia Store then for the third-party
applications that's happened to the
Android ecosystem in order to download
the apps and install them on here it is
possible to sideload them as well but
that's something that we would say is
really your endeavor if you wish to do
so in the end you do have a pretty
nice-looking UI and there is also this
screen right here
that allows you to take a quick glance
at some of the most recent things that
you weren't able to do there is also a
stroller gear for music so you'll get
some contextual information there as in
ways of controlling some of the parts of
your phone an easy way on a second
screen so that's just a quick look at
that I got the Nokia XL here it is a
much larger device and they do come in a
pretty affordable price points however
even that this is a dual sim
I don't believe I'll be seeing me in
America not really anytime soon but it
really will come their way they tell us
that they are planning on getting there
but for now they're coming to selected
markers so the release will be a little
bit limited but until then we're going
to see what we can do to get our hands I
want to give you a full review of
Nokia's take on Android once again this
is Joshua DARPA Management Authority
we're here at the Mobile World Congress
in Barcelona Spain bringing you all the
great coverage make sure you guys stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
