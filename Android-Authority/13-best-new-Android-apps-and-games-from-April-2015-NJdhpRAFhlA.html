Hindy the android authority app guy
we're nearing the end of April of 2015
so it's time to round up all of the best
apps and games from this month amazon
has officially added tablet support to
Amazon Instant Video it's a little wonky
to use because it'll redirect you to the
instant video website in your mobile
browser where you then pick a video and
then it'll come back and stream it in
the application it's not the most
ergonomic solution and there's still no
chromecast supports but if you have
amazon prime it's worth a shot android
for work is a platform for companies to
manage workflow earlier this month
google released the platform on android
devices included his admin control
support along with dedicated android for
work saps inches mail calendar contacts
docs and chrome you can also password
lock it to prevent access and admins can
remote wipe it if need be the only issue
right now is lack of supported devices
adventures of poco eco is an adventure
puzzle game that revolves around looks
and music the premises you're to help
poco and his tribe find the sounds that
they lost the design is pretty good and
the music isn't half bad for a mobile
game some have lamented that the puzzles
are a bit easy but the general consensus
is that this game is pretty decent it
costs just shy of two dollars and it has
no in-app purchases google handwriting
input is a keyboard that allows you to
actually write out your messages instead
of typing them out on a keyboard or
speaking them out loud it works pretty
well even if your handwriting is pretty
bad it's also totally free to use with
no in-app purchases and could be a fun
keyboard to use if your device as a
stylist although finger writing does
work as well it's true that har stone
was actually released several months ago
but back then it had one glaring issue
and that was there were no support for
mobile phones earlier this month
Blizzard updated the application to work
on phones and all rejoiced there were
ways to surpass the prior six-inch limit
but it's much nicer to have official
support for smaller screens if you
haven't tried it yet it's available for
download right now hello is a new
application from Facebook that acts as a
dollar replacement app it not only
replaces your stock dollar and lets you
make actual phone calls but it
integrates very closely with facebook
messenger service so you can make calls
over that as well when you want to it'll
help so help organize your contacts
based on their facebook info it's very
similar to hangout seller but you know
for facebook joe danger was a hit game
on iOS before making its way to android
where it's actually had limited success
so far it's a stunt gamer you must pull
off tricks and navigate obstacle courses
to get the highest possible score it has
ok graphics easy
and around 20 hours of gameplay
according to the developers it's a game
that doesn't take itself too seriously
and it's also relatively inexpensive KX
music player is a music player with an
equalizer it supports a wide range of
codecs that includes bass boost
virtualizer effects reverb presets and a
whole lot more in terms of you I it's
fairly simple to use and new users
shouldn't have any problems navigating
the interface there are some bugs here
and there and it is a bit simple
compared to something like power amp or
n7player however it's a solid option for
those who don't need a lot of flashy
features magica ex magica is a 2d
infinite runner style game with an
actual storyline you play as a girl who
is looking for her kidnapped friend you
must have feed a slew of bad guys in
order to do it the game features ok
graphics and sound track and easy
controls the game also includes boss
fights and some good artwork as well it
caused southeast saddest game in this
genre although there are a few bugs here
and there so do beware Mortal Kombat X
has finally been released to the Play
Store after months of leaks and
announcements unfortunately it's
currently in the midst of a soft launch
so it's not available for all markets
yet the classic fighting game features
many of your old mkay favorites a
familiar battle system fatalities and
other ODEs to the franchise when it's
released for everyone it'll be free with
in-app purchases but until then folks
patience riff is a new video platform
release by Facebook the idea is pretty
simple you upload a video something
you're doing then someone on your
friends list can add some video of their
own then their friends can add even more
video and it continues this way until
the post dies there are some bugs and
compatibility issues early on but this
is actually kind of a fun idea if you
have friends that aren't you know
terrible people service Lee is a root
only application that helps you manage
the processes on your device the idea is
to keep processes from running when you
don't want them to run and help save
battery life by closing down apps that
keep waking up your device you can get
all the pro features without paying for
the pro version although we do recommend
that you do that to support development
if you have root you should definitely
try this one out last up this month the
original tomb raider has been remastered
and re-released to android by Square
Enix those who enjoyed the good old days
of laura croft can do it again for those
who have never played tomb raider before
this is an action-adventure game with
some puzzle elements the controls aren't
the best but you do get used to them
after a while and there are a few device
compatibility issues otherwise this is a
classic and really quite cheap for a
square enix game once again I'm Joe
