the best products that we saw at CES
2018 imagine a world where your
smartphone powers your laptop now why
would you need that well as our
smartphones get more powerful fewer and
fewer people need a larger computer but
a full keyboard and a bigger screen can
be helpful and that is why Razer with
their project Linda is trying to merge
the razor phone into one of their larger
laptop concepts you simply slide the
razor phone into a trackpad area of the
customized razor blade stealth chassis
and it automatically starts powering the
laptop you almost get a one-to-one view
of what you would be seeing on your
Android phone but you can use the screen
of the razor phone as the touchpad Razer
plans on making the laptop display
mirror the 120 Hertz quad HD display of
the razor phone that way you can get
high resolution playback of pretty much
any piece of media and you'll be able to
have a much larger canvas in order to do
all of your work and play there are a
few use cases here including using the
larger apparatus as a way of finishing
projects that you originally started on
the razor phone or while the razor phone
is docked it can play a video while
you're getting that work done on the
bigger screen sure it's just a concept
for now but it's a really cool one
speaking of concepts we finally have a
tangible example of what an under glass
fingerprint sensor would look like now
we know that they were becoming this
year but vivo started it off with a
partnership with synaptics this
wafer-thin optical sensor sits just
between the display glass and the actual
all LED panel and Peaks through the
pixels in order to register your prints
wake the screen and a small portion on
the bottom of the phone will tell you
where to land your fingerprint synaptics
ensures that clear ID is just as secure
as current sensors that you might find
on plenty of other smartphones but it is
marginally slower in practice if you're
able to get past that slight delay
you'll also realize that nothing about
the phone needs to change in order for
you to still have fingerprint security
so for certain phones this might be the
way that we can get all screen all the
time by not having to cut the bottom in
order to have a fingerprint sensor home
button no matter what your opinions may
be on smart watches it's good to see
that Skagen is coming out with their
first touchscreen enabled smart watch on
top of all of their already great hybrid
offerings the Scoggin falster runs
Android wear but it also looks
incredibly nice because of this
minimalistic design that it's Skagen is
known for now it is missing a few
features that other Android wear
vices bring to the table like a heart
rate monitor built-in GPS and LTE
connectivity but if you're looking for a
classy smart walk shot also doesn't
break the bank
well the Scogin falster might be one of
the prettiest and smooth uh smartwatches
that we've seen so far VR is still
running strong and this daydream VR
headset is a standalone unit from Lenovo
The Mirage Isola is powered by the
Snapdragon 835 with four gigabytes of
RAM and microSD expansion is available
you still get the daydream controller
and to seven hours of battery life and
six degrees of freedom
all without cables or even a smartphone
it also has a much better weight
distribution because it's not hindering
itself on the weight of the smartphone
so that it feels a lot more comfortable
than plenty of other daydream headsets
Lenovo is tentatively pricing it at
under $400 and it will go on sale in
quarter two of this year at first there
was Google wallets and then there was
Android pay and up until now they have
been living side by side we're awarding
Google pay a best of CES 2018 award
because well Google is starting so
finally understand mobile payments and
also they're starting to understand
proper naming conventions our next award
goes to a potential competitor to the
one plus 5t the honor view 10 sports a
six inch full HD plus display has the
Kiran a 90-70 processor six gigabytes of
RAM and dual 12 and 20 megapixel cameras
making it a beast on the spec sheet and
at CES 2018 honor just announced that
it's coming to the United States
we were already impressed with the view
10 during our brief hands-on time and
pricing availability might still be on
the way but we expect this phone to
launch at around five hundred dollars
adding to an already good library of
honor phones that are pretty affordable
watch out for this phone in 2018 one of
the biggest stories coming out of CES
2018 is the fact that Google assistant
is appearing on so many different
devices and that includes smart displays
now these displays are supposed to be
Amazon echo shows biggest competitors
we've already seen a couple from Lenovo
but this is one we're really excited
about made by JBL there's an eighth inch
of 720p display two front-facing 10 watt
speakers a rear-facing passive radiator
for even deeper bass along with support
for 24-bit HD audio streaming the only
unfortunate part about the JBL link view
is that you're going to be able to buy
one this summer we can't wait to get our
hands on it and you can stay tuned for
our review of it once we're able to use
it during those summer months let's not
forget a
putting Google into your big TVs with
Android TV you now have the Asus rogue
PG 65 what is being considered a big
format gaming display this is a 65 inch
4k g-sync Android TV with 120 Hertz
refresh rates ultra-low latency and has
a Nvidia shield built-in now the price
will no doubt be high when it goes on
sale but considering that it means you
don't need a gaming monitor and then a
smart TV also you put the boat together
it might end up seeming kind of
reasonable and of course you'll be able
to play PC games on it as a monitor or
just jump into the actual shield that's
built in and be able to play any other
games that you want from your couch
rather than your desk there are a lot of
