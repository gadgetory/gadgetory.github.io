Hindy the android authority app guy and
in this video we're going to take a look
at some of the best applications that
were released in january 2014 first up
is bad hotel in this fun little time
waster you must build a hotel that can
sustain damage from all of the terrible
things that are trying to destroy it you
essentially start with a core and must
build around it to protect it from such
things as birds that have bombs it's
quick but fun and only costs a couple of
bucks in the Google Play Store if you
want something a little more heavy Deus
Ex the fall is a good option it features
a full 3d graphics experience in this
game you can choose what genre you play
you can either do stealth mode or
all-out action mode it's your call the
graphics are nice the story is competent
and unlike most of Square Enix is games
its price is somewhat reasonable form
heroes saga is essentially candy crush
saga with a new skin instead of dealing
with candy you instead deal with fruits
and vegetables otherwise the essential
premise remains the same you must mix
and match specific icons to complete
levels there are hundreds of levels and
it's free to play so if you need
something to keep you occupied for a
while this isn't a terrible option Final
Fantasy 6 was released in January to
mixed reactions some people think the
game needed more work and that the new
graphics weren't enough other people
didn't care and picked it up for
nostalgia value alone it's very
expensive at 16 bucks but this is one of
the best RPGs of all time despite the
nearly non-stop line of complaints the
game itself still Garner's a 4-point
vibrating in the Google Play Store so
there is that jelly is a brand new
social network from one of the same
minds that brought us Twitter in this
network you take pictures of things ask
questions about it and other people will
answer if they know the app itself could
use some work as the interfaces whatever
the opposite of intuitive is but it is
free and we assume they'll update things
to make it more enjoyable eventually
private text was released in response to
that ridiculously stupid security issue
with snap chat in private text the
interface takes you back to nineteen
ninety which is kind of lame but the app
itself works perfectly fine with this
you get a totally private messaging
service where your message is actually
self-destruct after a period of time it
requires a pin like BBM and it looks
was designed by Netscape but if you need
a private messaging service this is a
pretty good app to try we talked about
recollect a few weeks ago and for good
reason it's a brand new app that helps
remind you of things that you need to do
using it is fairly simple you define the
addresses of your home office grocery
store etc and then you create tasks you
need at those locations at certain times
then when you're near those locations or
the time approaches recollect will
remind you it has a pretty good design
and it's also free small fry is an
infinite runner that takes place in the
ocean in the air and in space this
surprisingly addictive game took up more
of my time than I'm willing to admit to
because it's simple quick and fun you
play as a fish you tap the screen to
dive and that's really it folks the fish
jumps all on its own and using this very
simple control scheme you just need to
avoid the bad guys it's harder than it
looks if you've got a question chances
are that stack exchange has the answer
or if they do not there are people who
use that exchange who probably know the
answer now they have an official app and
it works really well using it you can
browse any one of their bajillion
subsidiaries and get answers for
everything from programming to speaking
Italian and even gaming it's
well-designed and it's easy to sign up
so if you've got questions this app
probably has the answers we reviewed
talent for Twitter and at the end of
this video will provide a link to that
Talon is a dark theme Twitter app that
costs two dollars and all things
considered it's a pretty decent Twitter
application you get a few fun features
like live streaming support and talent
pool plus there's a theme engine so
purveyors of the theming arts can make
it look how they pleased with Twitter's
dastardly token limit looming you may
want to pick this one up while you can
we also reviewed you to me and since
this blogger has a penchant for
educational apps it's highly recommended
that you go watch it using this app you
can view and enroll in classes that
teach you anything from 3d modeling to
programming and even stuff like cooking
second languages and yoga there are free
and paid classes should you want to take
them and it can be fairly handy for
people looking to get into something new
