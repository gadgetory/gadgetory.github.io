and we're here at CES 2017 which is
coming to a close and you know what that
means
we're going to be giving awards out to
the best of show here at the Consumer
Electronics Show of 2017 in front of me
are three different awards for three
different properties and we gave awards
to 11 total devices and products rather
that we felt were the best of show this
year and we're going to have three of
our representatives from each website to
give you the list and to give you the
reasons why we gave those products the
best of awards this year what's up guys
want hear from Android 30 and first up
on the list is the zenfone AR and
although it's not the first tango ready
smartphone it's definitely the first
truly high-end one by high-end we mean
it's got a powerful snap during a 21
processor under the hood as well as an
impressive 8 gigabytes of RAM the look
is definitely distinctive and that's
because it has to house all the various
cameras that makes quality augmented
reality possible it's easily one of the
most high-tech smartphones we've ever
seen so it was a natural choice for best
of CES 2017 next up we have the Samsung
Chromebook pro and plus it seems as
though Samsung has looked around the
notebook market and combined all the
best qualities they file there with
their own distinctive strengths like a
yoga book these devices can be folded in
half to serve as a tablet since their
Chromebooks you have full access to the
Google Play Store meaning you'll be able
to use all your favorite apps best of
all it's got pressure-sensitive s-pen
that's perfect for drawing or jotting
down notes now we found the honor 6x to
be a pretty impressive mid-range er you
actually get specs that are closer to
what you might see in flagship devices
but you only have to pay 250 bucks for
it instead of 700 to 8000 we've seen
similar devices in this price range but
what really sets the honor 6x apart is
this killer battery well even a lot of
today's high-end devices will die out on
you in the middle of the day the honor
6x has a battery that's capable of
lasting two whole days we like the
Phoenix 5 family for how much tech
Garmin's they will pack into a wearable
when price was no object yes the Phoenix
5 lineup is a bit pricey but they might
be the most powerful trackers we've seen
all three of these watches naturally
come with basic fitness tracking for
running swimming and hiking and they are
water resistant up to 100 meters the
Phoenix 5 standard is clearly designed
for men and these smaller 5s is
women for those looking to go all out
the 5x comes loaded with a ton of extra
features including pre-loaded topo us
mapping hey guys johnathan vise here for
tab times our very first best of CES
2017 has got to go to the ThinkPad x1
from lenovo now this isn't a cheap
laptop by any means with a price tag of
over $1,300 but lenovo has certainly
pulled out all the stops in terms of
crabbing specs into a thin lightweight
design it's powerful as an elegant
design and is easy to travel with
there's lots of love here dell is the
next company that knocked our socks off
in the laptop department showing off the
dell XPS 13 2 &amp;amp; 1 we've seen a lot of
convertible laptops over the last year
but in some ways this model feels like
the first time it's truly been done
right sure it's a gorgeous device but it
also has formidable specs to the tune of
an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor a
beautiful quad HD display and a battery
that Dell says can last for over 14
hours of use the Dell XPS 13 takes a
page out of Apple's book by ditching all
of the USB type 8 connections in favor
of USB type-c inputs with Thunderbolt 3
support fans of doodling or taking notes
on the fly will like the accompanying
stylus and it also has a fingerprint
reader for added security and of course
the screen detaches from the keyboard to
serve as a tablet our next award goes
again to Lenovo for the légion y72 it's
a gaming laptop that's surprisingly thin
competitively priced at 13 99 and
specifically tricked out for virtual
reality if you are a vibe or rift fan
looking for a laptop that won't break
the bank this looks like the ideal
choice out of CES 2017 the NVIDIA GTX
1060 under the hood keeps all your VR
experiences running smoothly and the
légion y72 actually comes with a
built-in application that converts a
variety of traditional PC games into a
VR experience the design is great the
specs are potent and the price is right
the légion y72 is definitely worth
checking out a surprisingly lightweight
Ultrabook Samsung's updated notebook 9
is a
our house of a slim laptop ready to take
on certain pro version from a competitor
with a 15-inch display this Intel Core
i7 laptop is packed with 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 Ram and measures in at just over 2
pounds the best of all Samsung is
claiming upwards of 15 hours of battery
life per charge combined with rapid
charge technology this is a device you
may be able to take out of the house
without taking the charger how's it
going everyone I'm Adam Alena here with
sound guys and the first award that
we're giving is to Blue Microphones
satellite headphones these have two
drivers in each ear cup then bluetooth
4.2 and produce sound via 45 millimeter
drivers but it's the second pair of
drivers that make these worthwhile sound
quality can sometimes get lost during
the active noise cancellation process
but with two drivers there's one
dedicated to sound and another that
handles the ANC we still have to put
them through the full review process so
keep an eye out for that no pricing has
been announced yet but they'll be
available this spring House of Marley
announced a few new products this year
but the ones that caught our eye were
the smile would make them et headphones
there's nothing really insanely new
about these but the build quality feels
great and because it's House of Marley
they're made of recycled materials
there's controls right on the neck piece
for controlling volume and playback but
the best part has to be the price which
is only $59 good quality for a low price
if you're waiting for CES to see what
durable do to the speaker's would be
announced the Altec Lansing sonic boom
should be on your radar Altec Lansing
says that it's everything-proof which
practically means it has an ip67
certification and though it's still
pretty big it floats on the back it has
three USB outputs to charge your phones
a standard outlet for regular things you
might need to plug in and a 50 foot
range to top it all off for sub $300 as
always thank you guys very much for

choices for the best of Awards at CES
