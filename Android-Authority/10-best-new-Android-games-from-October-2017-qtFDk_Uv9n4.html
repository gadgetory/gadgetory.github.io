handy the Android authority app guy and
it's about that time to round up the
best new Android games that were
released over the course of the last
month if you want to check out any of
these games for yourself you can find
those links in the video description
below another lost phone laura's story
is the next game in the lost phone
franchise the player finds a lost phone
and their goal is to find Laura the
phone's owner this is accomplished by
digging through the phone to find out
information and there's a note-taking
app a gallery a messaging app and a
whole bunch of other stuff to go through
it's a sleuthing game and that means
there aren't any difficult mechanics to
learn however it is a lot of fun
figuring out what's going on the game
runs for three dollars and forty nine
cents with no in-app purchases
Batman the enemy within is the latest
game from Telltale Games it follows a
new story of Batman in a fight against
the Riddler the game follows many of
Telltale's hallmark mechanics and those
include point-and-click mechanics and
episodic adventure narrative and fun
comic book style graphics the game comes
with five episodes the first episode is
free while subsequent episodes run for
$4.99 or you could just buy them all at
once for $14.99 into the Dead 2 is the
sequel to the popular into the Dead game
this game has a lot of the same flavor
as the first game you run you kill
zombies and you try to survive this new
game adds a storyline more varied
gameplay mechanics and a dog companion
to the mix it also comes with various
challenges decent graphics and a lot
more
it's a freemium game however it's
otherwise a very solid title Middle
Earth shadow of war is the latest Lord
of the Rings game it follows the story
of talian and his fight with saurons
army the game is freemium and you should
expect some freemium elements with this
title additionally the game includes
action RPG combat mechanics various loot
to collect and various Lord of the Rings
characters to collect as well other than
that the graphics and sound are decent
and the mechanics are fairly simple to
learn it's already fairly popular and
it's worth a shot
Knight Run is a new infinite runner game
it features minimal graphics and a
simple premise your health trains as you
run and your goal is to collect hearts
in order to remain alive while also
avoiding other
the obstacles are a little difficult to
get used to at first however it does
come to you over time
unlike most this one isn't a freemium
title there is only a single $0.99
charge in order to remove the ads
otherwise is a clean fairly decent
little time waster Pokemon Playhouse is
a new Pokemon themed kids game it is
nothing like the prior Pokemon games and
the age recommendation for this one is
ages three to five thus you won't find
anything challenging or difficult
whatsoever there isn't even any dialogue
to read that makes it great for kids and
probably a little boring for adults the
mechanics are dead easy to learn plus
the Pokemon are absolutely adorable in
this one it's totally free to download
with no in-app purchases or
advertisements stranger things the game
is exactly what the title says it's a
game that takes place in the stranger
things universe you play as various
characters from the show and each
character has their own special
abilities you use those abilities to
solve puzzles in order to progress
through the storyline it has retro
graphics delightfully smooth controls
and simple gameplay mechanics it's also
entirely free with no in-app purchases
or advertisements and might be the best
game in that category taps is an
interesting little puzzle game players
have to game boards to start with and
the idea is to tap tiles on one board
until it matches the other board each
tap adds one to the tile count as well
as the adjacent tiles the game's
difficulty scales the further you go up
and it also features four hundred levels
variable difficulty settings
leaderboards and a whole lot more the
free version of the game does contain
ads but the pro version removes the
advertising symbol we'd park is a comedy
adventure game with a new our theme
you play as five random people who show
up in a weird town one day for some
reason your goal is to figure out that
reason the game comes with retro
graphics plenty of jokes and five
playable characters you also get two
difficulty levels a hint system and more
jokes the narrative drives the game
forward and it is a bit expensive at
$9.99 however there are no ads or in-app
purchases Wreckers revenge is a puzzle
platformer from Cartoon Network you play
as gumball and the idea is to launch him
from platform to platform without
getting yourself killed the goal is to
save all of your friends complete the
various levels and obtain cash for
in-game pow
or UPS the mechanics are a tad wonky but
otherwise it plays fine is definitely
not the deepest game ever but on the
flip side of that coin it's also
difficult to knock a free game that
doesn't have any in-app purchases and
that about does it for this one folks as
usual you can check out any of these
games for yourself in the video
description below if you want to check
them out also don't forget to click
