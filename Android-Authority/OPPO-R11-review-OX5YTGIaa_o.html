android authority and this is our video
review of the Oppo our 11 it's not an
accident that the Opel r11 looks a lot
like the iPhone 7 plus the r11 is
catered towards mainland Chinese
customers who view the inspired by Apple
design philosophy positively almost as a
way to pay homage to Apple well we are
dismissing criticisms or ethical
discussions of such practices we're
focusing our review on the design itself
rather than the design philosophy so
what does the r11 offer well it's pretty
much just a refined version of the r9 s
it has a premium all-metal body that's
also thin and light the rear is very
slightly curved too so the phone is a
group of your hand
combined with the protruding side edges
you should not have to worry about this
phone being too slippery to hold the
center home key on the r11 may look
tactile but it's capacitive so it
doesn't press down the r11 s fingerprint
reader is embedded within this key so
you can simply tap it to authenticate
the reader is super quick to easily the
quickest scanner I've ever used you may
have guessed that Opel placed the back
button to the right of the home key
well this layout is non-standard some
including myself prefer it the side keys
are illuminated but the illumination is
pretty dim but it's nothing you won't be
able to get used to for the display
we're looking at a 5.5 inch 1080p AMOLED
panel we'll let you decide whether 1080p
is an acceptable compromise from quad HD
resolution aside the display looks great
with punchy colors there's still some
drawbacks though the maximum brightness
is high enough for most cloudy days but
you'll have some trouble on sunny days
weirdly the r11 lacks a proper
oleophobic coating so it's essentially a
fingerprint magnet the r9 s had the same
exact issue so we're disappointed that
Oppo is making the same mistake twice
if you're coming from pretty much any
other device expect some difficult to
remove fingerprints with the r11
under the hood the r11 has a quad-core
qualcomm snapdragon 616 nice upgrade
from the 625 found in the r9 s to be
frank every day performance is really
just mediocre it's a mid-range chip so
you
can expect 835 affordable flagship level
speed with that said the minor
sluggishness is easy to get used to and
is difficult to really notice unless
you've used some of the higher-end chips
there's four gigabytes of memory which
is enough to do some basic multitasking
in addition to being an unlocked dual
sim smartphone the Chinese Oppo our
lemon partially supports us 4G LTE
networks bands twelve and seventeen are
missing so you'll only have partial
coverage carrier aggregation will also
be limited so you might notice some
slower data speeds this partial support
was likely intended to help global
travelers more so than US citizens the
r11 even includes the Oh roaming app
which lets you obtain affordable cell
phone service in over 50 different
countries without needing a local SIM
card if you'd like you can instead use
the second SIM card slot in order to
expand the phone 64 gigabytes of
internal storage with a micro SD card up
to 256 gigabytes something to keep in
mind the r11 lacks NFC so you
unfortunately won't be able to use
mobile payment apps like Android pay it
does still have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack though but there's a
downside the jack appears to read too
deep inside the smartphone thus there is
limited compatibility I wasn't able to
get my personal headphones to work so
you should just plan on a worst case
scenario having to use the pair in the
Box the side firing speaker is actually
pretty good moderately loud with minimal
distortion it's not on par with
front-facing speakers but it's still
better than we expected we don't have
any numbers to share in regard to
battery life since the software
prevented us from collecting data but
the 3000 milliamp hour battery seems to
provide pretty good battery life we
never had trouble getting through a full
day with moderate to heavy use the
built-in Volk fast charging allows you
to charge from 0 to 70 percent in just
30 minutes or to 100% in just 65 minutes
one of the fastest rates out there ready
for a head-scratcher the Opel r11 6 was
a legacy microUSB port for charging and
data transfer we're having trouble
understanding why Oppo hasn't made the
transition to reversible USB type-c for
their flagship smartphone as it's been
out for nearly two years now the dual
cameras are the unmistakable highlight
of the r11 the high resolution pair work
together to provide up to 2
optical zoom in order to match the
camera hardware capability over work
directly with welcome to customize the
spectra 160 image signal processor and
the effort appears to have paid off
you notice that our day time sample
images are sharp and have accurate color
reproduction and just check out that
excellent dynamic range when using the 2
times optical zoom and just came out
with about equal quality the image
processing is quite slow at 3 to 4
seconds with this amount of zoom though
so it's not best for scenes with a lot
of action there's also a hardware
software hybrid depth effect as part of
the portrait mode the edges can be a tad
off especially in non-ideal lighting
the images can still come out as fairly
convincing as we anticipated images
taken in low light are softer and
noisier with a good amount of lens flare
especially with a secondary camera color
reproduction is still decent though and
the images are pretty bright for the
amount of light actually available
optical image stabilization would help a
lot here though YS would also help with
the video capture the phone records up
to 4k with the rear cameras but the
footage can be pretty shaky more so a
two-time zoom oval states that the 20
megapixel s 2.0 front-facing camera was
treated as important as the rear cameras
and it does a really nice job the camera
app is pretty standard easy to use yet
powerful basic controls are here and you
can quickly access an expert mode to
control the more technical details
although it runs Android 7.1.1 you get
all those color OS 3.1 skin makes the
software experience feel more like iOS
the notification panel toggles have been
replaced with a control center and the
system apps use many design elements
from iOS for example unlike some other
Chinese Android skins color OS doesn't
positively take inspiration from iOS it
feels as if the focus was placed on
cloning rather than developing a good
user experience for instance dismissing
notifications is a two-step process even
though there's no separate notification
panel view like there is an iOS speaking
of notifications we cannot get our
Chinese unit to send any from
third-party apps we made sure to enable
notifications for each app and disable
all three battery life optimizations for
each app but to no avail
we ended up having to carry around an
extra phone entirely during the review
period in order to receive important
emails and urgent hangouts messages we
hope that this issue will be fixed very
soon as it's a pretty big deal there's
also a bunch of other minor annoyances
as an example you can only adjust one
audio profile at once in addition if you
import a Chinese unit you'll need to
install Google services yourself
thankfully this isn't a hard process but
for the best experience you better just
go with a global unit the Oppo our 11 is
now available in China and gold rose
gold and black for 3,000 UN global
availability is yet to be determined the
Oppo our xi has a lot going for it it
has great cameras a premium all-metal
design and good battery life
however the r11 also has a large number
of compromises the software user
experiences poor performances only
mediocre and there are many small issues
the r11 is a good value but we cannot
recommend it over competing options you
can spend just a little bit more we
suggest you go with the oneplus 5
instead as it's very similar to the r11
with the same great cameras a nearly
identical design much better software
and better performance and that will be
all for this video please be sure to
give it a thumbs up if you liked it and
