Android or authority now over the years
smartphone makers I had this trend of
producing mini versions of their
flagship devices to remember the s5 mini
or the Galaxy s4 mini from Samsung well
now fall in the success of the oneplus
one oneplus has taken effectively taken
the internals of that phone and put them
into the oneplus X but the oneplus X has
a smaller screen it's just five inches
down from 5.5 inches course Sony has
these 8 v range and in those 8 5 range
you've got the lead 5 premium the normal
is 85 and the ZIF I have compact the
similar phone but with a smaller display
a Motorola has the Moto G which in many
respects is really a mini version of
what we find in the Moto X range for
today we're going to look at these three
phones there's 8 5 compact the oneplus X
and the Moto G and see which really is
the best mini phone now before we dive
into looking at these phones I just want
to address this idea that 5 inches is
now a mini phone if you remember way
back the first Android phone that came
out had just a 3.2 inch display on it
and since then phones have got bigger
and bigger and bigger
and now when people talk about a mini
phone they actually mean one that's 5
inches which personally I find is a bit
ridiculous but of course 5.2 and 5.5
inch devices are becoming really the
norm so now we're looking at these mini
phones and we'll actually see that the
oneplus X is a 5 inch device the one the
Moto G is a 5 inch device and only the
z5 compact is smaller than 5 inches and
of course that means it could be quite
attractive to a certain segment of the
market but there you guys wanted us say
5 inches is now Miele personally I think
that's crazy but that's where we're at 5
inches is now a mini phone so that's
when you look at today for the first
thing we can look at with these three
phones is their prices there's quite a
big price difference here between these
devices at the top end we have the Sony
z5 compact which cost 429 pounds in the
UK which is 600 euros in mainland Europe
you can find it on amazon.com for around
five hundred and twenty dollars but
there are some listings
as high as $700 now the other end of the
scale we have the Moto G which cost just
one hundred and eighty dollars for the 8
gigabyte version and only two hundred
and twenty dollars for the 16 gigabyte
version and they're somewhere in the
middle we have the oneplus X which cost
two hundred and fifty dollars for the 16
gigabyte model now of course that's
quite a big difference in price ranges
and we will see that reflected under the
different tests and things we're going
to talk about these phones today so tech
bear in mind when we look at a phone
you've also got to take in consideration
its price as well as a big difference in
price these three devices also differ
significantly in terms of design the
design of the Zed 5 compact should be
instantly familiar to anyone who's
acquainted with sony's other Z devices
particularly the z3 compact it looks
like the Zed five and the Zed five
premium but of course in a much smaller
body it features the signature button
layout including the dedicated camera
shutter button and a new large power
button which also houses a fingerprint
reader
overall the Zed 5 compact feels nice in
the hand and is easy to handle mainly
due to its size and symmetrical design
the oneplus X has dual glass panels and
a metal frame which gives the device a
premium feel way above its price point
the metal frame utilizes micro cuts that
contribute to the handling experience
without scraping the skin or feeling
uncomfortable to the touch
while the Zed 5 compact has a dedicated
camera button the oneplus X has a
dedicated alert slider which allows you
to switch between do not disturb mode
that silences the device completely
priority only interruptions or the
normal all notifications mode the Moto G
is certainly the bulkiest of the three
devices mainly due to its curved back
but with the curved back you get access
to a moto maker which means along with a
swappable backplate users can now bring
customization to the next level through
Motorola's website you'll be able to
choose from front back and accent colors
as well as personal engravings as well
as its high level of customization the
Moto G also has front-facing speakers
and ipx7 water resistance which means it
can withstand immersion in water up to
one meter for 30 minutes so which has
the best design
that depends on what you want the
ability to customize the Moto G with
motor makers are very attractive for
those who want to personally define
their phones look and feel having said
that the Moto G is certainly bulky
limousine 5 compact on the oneplus X
unfortunately sony has managed to put
the volume rocket in the worst possible
place on the dead 5 compact which I
personally see as a major design flaw
what this means is if you want subtle
slim and elegant then the oneplus X has
the better design if you want
customisation and bright colors then go
with the Moto G 2 of our three phones
have a 720p HD display while the other
features a full HD screen you might
think that since the Zed 5 compact is
the most expensive of all three then
that would be the device with the HD
display but you'd unfortunately be wrong
those 85 compact comes with a 4.6 inch
display with a 720p resolution resulting
in a pixel density of 323 PPI although
it must be said that the resolution and
pixel density work perfectly well for
such a small display you are left
feeling that for this price you should
be getting something more having said
that the colour reproduction is good
due to the triluminos display with its
x-reality engine enhancements the
oneplus X features a 5 inch AMOLED
display with a full HD resolution
overall the display experience is
excellent and everything you'd expect
from an AMOLED screen is there including
deep blacks and good levels of contrast
oneplus has also taken advantage of the
AMOLED display tech in its software by
including an ambient display feature it
is triggered by waving your hand over
the proximity sensor which then causes
the screen to show a minimal version of
the lockscreen for a quick glance at
your notifications and at the clock that
leaves the Moto G which features a 720p
display unfortunately because the device
uses a 5-inch display up from 4.5 inches
from the original Moto G the pixel
density is the lowest in our group at
just 294 pixels per inch
wherever the display is IPS which gives
it good viewing angles and the screen is
protected by Gorilla Glass 3
so clearly the oneplus X is the winner
here full HD and AMOLED there isn't much
more that you could ask for
although the Zed 5 compact has a smaller
screen
has not compromise on the internals the
said five compact uses an octa-core
Snapdragon 810 backed by an Adreno 430
GPU and two gigabytes of RAM there is a
32 gigabytes of internal storage and the
option to add more via a micro SD card
the Zeta 5 compact is IP 65 an IP 68
water rated which according to Sony
means you don't have to worry if you get
caught in the rain or you want to watch
dirt off the phone under the tab as for
sound the Zed 5 compact features dual
front-facing speakers meaning the sound
is always protected directly upwards and
outwards the speakers can get quite loud
especially considering this is a 4.6
inch phone however at the highest volume
levels the sound doesn't lose depth and
can be a bit squeaky when it comes to
the battery the Sony is ed5 compact
features a two thousand seven hundred
million power unit which is more than
enough for a small phone like this you
should be able to get five hours of
on-screen time over a period of between
36 and 42 hours of standby
it also supports quick charge - and
don't forget it does include a
fingerprint reader
unlike the Zed 5 compact and the Moto G
the oneplus X uses a 32-bit processor
rather than a 64-bit processor this may
seem like a real disadvantage for the
oneplus X however the good news is that
the company picked one of the best
32-bit processors available for
Snapdragon 801 the X also offers dual
SIM support however the secondary SIM
slot also doubles as a micro SD card
slot which will certainly be appreciated
for those who want more than 16
gigabytes on the battery front the
oneplus X packs of two thousand five
hundred and twenty five million power
unit which is pretty standard for a
phone of this size with moderate usage
the device will allow you to have three
hours of on-screen time which we admit
is pretty average however it's good when
you consider the price point thus and
buy time however is quite impressive
though unfortunately there is no fast
charging functionality at this point is
worth mentioning the oneplus X doesn't
fully support 4G LTE in the USA because
it lacks a couple of key bands
although the international coverage is
much better those in the USA should
think twice about getting this phone if
4G is a requirement as I mentioned a
moment ago the Moto G packs
64-bit processor however it isn't a
high-end 64-bit processor it doesn't
mean it's lacking in terms of everyday
usage however it isn't going to break
any speed records accompanying the
Snapdragon 410 processor is 1 gigabyte
of RAM on the 8 gigabyte model and 2
gigabytes of RAM on the 16 gigabyte
model if you are going to buy a moto G I
would really recommend going with a 16
gigabyte version for both the extra
storage and the extra Ram although most
roller has included a removable back
cover the 2470 milliamp-hour battery is
non removable however that shouldn't be
a problem as the Moto G has impressive
battery life you should be able to get
five hours of on-screen time over a 16
to 18 hour a day if you do run out of
charge however notice that there is no
quick charge which means you need to
plan accordingly when you want to fully
charge the phone again which can take
around two hours so in terms of hardware
the Zed 5 compact is the clear winner
you get flagship processor 2 gigabytes
of RAM NFC a fingerprint reader
front-facing speakers and a great
battery of course I said 5 compact has
that premium price tag so that's what
you'd expect from it when it comes to
the other two the processor is better in
the oneplus X however consumers in the
USA would be better going with the Moto
G in terms of general performance the
Snapdragon 810 in the 0-5 compact
provides a snappy user experience the UI
is smooth and there aren't any lags you
won't find yourself wishing there's a
different CPU in this phone also the
gaming experience is very good the
Snapdragon 801 in the oneplus X is a
great processor package home don't
expect the same levels performance as
the Snapdragon 810 for daily tasks like
writing email dissing to music watching
the occasional video and general web
browsing the oneplus X doesn't skip a
beat whoever Joe did notice the
occasional stutters during his review of
the device my personal feeling that this
is because of refinements that are
needed in the oxygen OS because I didn't
experience the same things with the
Snapdragon 801 powered zark Zedd won
the Moto G is the slowest of our three
devices and it doesn't score very well
in many of the benchmarks now talking of
the benchmarks you will find full
details of all the benchmark scores in
the written companion that goes along
with this video and you'll find that on
our website Android Authority home
looking at the performance result it is
clear that you get what you pay for the
better the performance the more the
device costs the z5 compact is the clear
winner however in terms of price
performance it seems that the oneplus X
has a lot to offer and now we move on to
the cameras on paper the camera in the
Zed 5 compact should be the best in our
group the Ted 5 compact uses a 23
megapixel Sony Exmor RS sensor comes
with a wide-angle 24 millimeter G lens
and offers 4k recording also the
built-in app has a lot of features way
beyond just HDR and panorama in reality
though the results from the z5 compact
have been disappointing when compared to
other flagship phones and in this lineup
the z5 compact camera performs as well
as the others but unfortunately not
better the oneplus X comes with a 13
megapixel rear camera and uses phase
detection autofocus and has HDR the
camera application is the same as the
one found with the oneplus 2 which uses
swipes on the viewfinder in order to
switch between the various modes which
include slow motion time lapse and
panorama there isn't much manual control
available except for basically just
picking with you want to use HDR or not
the oneplus X is guilty of some of the
classic smartphone pitfalls it's great
in good lighting conditions but quality
deteriorates drastically as conditions
worse and taking shots will always
require you to have a steady hand this
actually becomes a bit of an issue when
you capture video as it tends to get a
bit choppy as a data issue - the oneplus
x requires a little more diligence to
get good shots but for its price point
we're II don't fault the camera that
much unless you take a lot of video that
is the Moto G also features a 13
megapixel rear camera and has an F 2.0
aperture along with dual LED flash the
sensor is the same one that Motorola
used in the Nexus 6 and it features a
HDR mode + is capable of shooting
EPV do in daylight the camera produces
colors that are vibrant and captures an
impressive amount of detail in
particular HDR mode makes a big
difference to images and does a good job
in lighting up shadows daylight
performance is definitely impressive but
sadly as the Sun drops so does the
camera performance the Zed 5 compact
comes with android 5.1.1 lollipop by
default and it will receive an upgrade
to Android 6.0 marshmallow at some point
in the future sony has added a light
skin on top of the stock Android
experience and also included extra
features and some Sony related apps as
well as those software for managing the
fingerprint reader there is a myriad of
device connection options including the
ability to wirelessly play content on
your z5 to other devices there is also a
theme library than the power management
there are several different power
standby mode including stamina mode
ultra stamina mode and low battery mode
the oneplus X comes with one plus is
oxygen OS which brings a mostly stock
looking Android edition to the device
much of it is really familiar as it is
based on Android 5.0 5.1 lollipop and
lollipop inspires the interface
including a patented app drawer and a
quick settings menu oneplus have added a
new feature called shelf where frequent
apps favorite contacts and user-defined
widgets can be stored there are
different input options available with
users given the choice between
capacitive keys or on-screen navigation
keys and there are also gestures like
double tap to wake the Moto G features a
near pure Android experience based on
android 5.1.1 mean you'll have access to
the Google now launcher with just a
couple of Motorola specific apps thrown
into the mix the first of this is moto
display which shows you waiting
notifications all the time automatically
when you pick up the handset or pull it
out of your pocket motor display is very
useful when you consider how many people
don't carry a watch and check the time
on their phone it definitely helps
improve the battery if you're one of
them
there's also quick gestures which lets
you accomplish simple things easily a
double flick of the wrist turns the
flashlight on or off while a double
twist of the wrist launches the camera
however this latter feature can be a
little too responsive meaning you might
activate the
camera just by picking up the phone from
the table if you want a stock Android
experience then you will get that from
the Moto G if you are looking for
something more customized then the z5 or
the oneplus one might be giving you what
you are looking for however overall the
three devices offer a good software
experience and you won't be disappointed
with any of them and there you have it
my look at those three devices now often
when manufacturers make mini versions
their flagship devices they cut down on
the specs and they cut down on the price
and the mini version is nowhere near as
good as the flagship version well that
isn't the case with the compact z5 it
really is a flagship phone put into a
smaller chassis with a smaller display
however it comes with a flagship price
it really is quite an expensive device
and the oneplus X and the Moto G are we
half the price of those in five compact
so if we - ask me Gary if you had 550
dollars and you wanted to buy a five
inch or sub five inch display phone what
would you buy truthfully I would buy 2 1
plus X devices or maybe I'd even buy a
oneplus X and a Moto G and then use the
spare change to treat my family to a
nice day out well why don't you use the
comments below to tell me what you think
about these three devices is any one of
them a favorite of yours also while
you're there don't forget to subscribe
