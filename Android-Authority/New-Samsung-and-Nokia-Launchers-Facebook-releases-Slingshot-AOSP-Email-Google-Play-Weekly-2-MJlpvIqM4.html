Hindy the android authority app guy and
this is google play weekly we have a
whole bunch of ab news this week so
let's get this intro over with first up
this week are some application updates
from Google Drive and Google Hangouts
the hangouts update was simple because
it contained pretty much just nothing
else but bug fixes Google Drive had by
far the more interesting update but
sadly not by much there were some UI
tweaks like multi user switcher expands
in line and not any drop-down menu
anymore like it used to and there are
doc creation shortcuts on the floating
bar on the bottom now again it's not
much but those were Google's updates
from this last week you may have heard
of a popular application called clash of
clans well now the developers supercell
have come out with a new game called
boom beach if you're a fan of clash of
clans than the graphics most of the
gameplay mechanics and the premise won't
be all that new to you if you own an
iPad or an iPhone this also may not be
new to you because this was released
their first the concept is simple you
build a base build up an army use that
army to raid other players or you can
raid the NPC's in campaign mode what's
really great is that it's free to play
in the google play store right now with
some in-app purchases should you choose
to buy them what's bad is it super still
appears to be becoming a one-trick pony
and that's kind of sad if you're a fan
of cyanogenmod and are currently running
cyanogenmod 11 that our next bit of news
is going to be really interesting
cyanogenmod has released the theme
showcase app what this app does is allow
you to manage your themes and apply them
at will if you've been using the latest
CM 11 nightlies then a lot of this won't
be new to you because you have some of
this control built right into the theme
section in your settings if with this
app you can install themes styles icons
boot animations and more when you
download and install compatible themes
of course there are a few problems it's
only compatible with cm11 some people
are having trouble installing the
application and there aren't that many
compatible themes just yet eventually
these issues will be ironed out and the
CM theme engine is going to get a whole
lot more fun to use as if the mobile
messaging platform wasn't saturated
enough Facebook has released another new
messaging platform called slingshot why
this wasn't directly integrated into
facebook Messenger or whatsapp as
anyone's guess but with the release of
slingshot we now have
messaging platforms all from the same
parent company and frankly I think it's
pretty stupid here's how slingshot works
you send photos and videos and the only
way the other people can see your photos
and videos or if they send you photos
and videos in return yes it sounds like
something you'd see advertised on a site
that pedals pornography but that's
pretty much how it works if you want to
try it it's free in the google play
store right now ok guys so get this the
part of nokia that microsoft didn't buy
just announced an android launcher it's
called z launcher and we don't have all
that much information on it yet aside
from some demo videos so here's how it
works it's another contextual launcher
that tries to guess which apps you want
much like everything me launcher or a v8
if none of those apps strike your fancy
you can use gesture controls to draw a
letter and the apps and contacts that
start with that letter will appear for
you it has the potential to be pretty
nifty but it is only in pre beta right
now if you're interested we have a link
in the written companion where you can
go and try it out who wants to see some
trending applications as usual if you
want to check any of these applications
out you can find the links in the
written companion which is in the video
description below first up in trending
this week is peak peak was recently
updated to version 2 point 0 which
brought a lot of new features you can
now see the application when you turn
your screen on even after the polling
time has ended there is also a new
algorithm in place to make motion
detection better aside from that there
have been a number of bug fixes and
performance improvements that fix a
number of known bugs it's a fun
application and you should definitely
check it out over the last year or so
apps with new functionality have
beginning news but apps with nice
designs have been getting a whole lot
more news in the spirit of that lets say
hello to another well designed alarm
clock called lifetime alarm clock this
app looks really nice and include some
features that aren't necessarily new but
seem more polished in this application
this includes smarts news wake
challenges and more to add to the
peripheral experience of having an alarm
clock Nokia isn't the only huge company
coming out with a launcher this week as
it turns out samsung had a hand on our
next application called terrain home
this launcher goes directly after Google
now launcher because it does the same
sort of sidebar thing that has a bunch
of cards that contain information in
them and eventually learns which ones
you really want this is actually really
cool because Google now didn't really
have a competitor on Android before this
and it's available for non stock Android
devices on
Google now unfortunately it's only
available in North America and it is
only a beta release for now which means
it will be bugs yo is either the dumbest
application ever or one of the smartest
here's how it works it attempts to
communicate as much as possible with a
single word which is always yo this
seems really dumb at first but when you
look at the use cases it can be a pretty
awesome little tool let's say you follow
a local sports team they can use the app
to send you a yo whenever the team
scores you see it to understand the
meaning and move on without any
extraneous activities there are a lot of
uses for an app that communicates
quickly with just one word if you happen
to be creative it's free in the google
play store right now and prepare
yourself because you're probably going
to hear a whole lot more about this one
last up this week is for all of you
stock android fans out there the AOSP
email app has been released to the
google play store in an effort to break
as many applications free from the
actual rom as possible google has
released the email app it's only
available to stock Android devices which
kind of sucks but if you fall into that
category you no longer have to wait for
rom updates to get the latest version of
the email app it's in the Google Play
Store from here on out once again I'm
