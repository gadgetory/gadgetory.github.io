Android authority and back at Mobile
World Congress this past February Nokia
unveiled their first three Android
smartphones ever with the nokia X which
I currently have in the house right now
the Nokia x+ and the Nokia XL and this
has been something a lot of people have
been clamoring for a lot of people
really wanted that Nokia look and feel
that Nokia build quality that Nokia
design except running Android and we
finally got that at Mobile World
Congress sort of let's take a closer
look at the Nokia x one of three of
Nokia's first Android smartphones
alright so here is the nokia X or the
box anyways and as you can see it is a
dual SIM device so it's great for
traveling especially internationally but
since we didn't do an actual unboxing
video I figured I'd show you what came
inside the box before we get into the
actual device itself but inside the box
you have your typical paperwork a
microUSB charging cable and a pair of
bright red earbuds which I totally
didn't expect considering this is a
rather budget device and here is the
Nokia X itself and from a design
perspective it does exude that Nokia
look and feel that we've become familiar
with and although it doesn't feel quite
as premium as Nokia's high-end flagship
devices the build quality actually isn't
all that bad and it actually feels
pretty solid in the hand it is a little
bit on the thick side at ten point four
millimeters but overall it feels pretty
small and compact on the right side
you've got your standard power and
volume keys which are actually pretty
tactile and responsive and then on the
top you've got your 3.5 milimeter
headset jack your microUSB port on the
bottom and on the back you've got your
three megapixel camera and a single
speaker and then flipping around to the
front you have a single back button
instead of your standard array of
Android buttons the outer shell is also
removable giving you access to the two
SIM card slots the micro SD which
supports up to 32 gigs and the 1,500
milliamp hour battery specs wise the
Nokia X is rocking a four inch display
with WVGA resolution a dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 processor inside
was 512 megabytes of RAM and Adreno 203
GPU and four gigabytes of internal
storage now obviously these are very low
end specs you're definitely going to see
pixels on this
play with its low resolution it also
doesn't get very bright and I'm sorry to
say but it's got pretty poor viewing
angles as well the performance of the
nokia X also leaves a lot to be desired
as it is rather sluggish in day-to-day
usage scrolling can be a little janky at
times and while native applications like
the dialer messaging and contacts open
up reasonably quickly third-party apps
like Facebook Twitter or Instagram took
several seconds to load which over time
got to be a little bit frustrating to
say the least
typing on the nokia keyboard was also
rather difficult as well as it generally
tended to lag every few keystrokes and
on a 4-inch display the keyboard felt
very cramped and inaccurate and I found
myself having to type a lot slower than
I normally wanted to web browsing
performance isn't the best either as the
default browser has a hard time
rendering a page and you'll notice it
quite a bit especially if you're trying
to scroll quickly to get to where you
want to go as far as gaming is concerned
I wasn't able to push the GPU to its
limits because the selection of games
from Nokia is rather limited and the
games that are available aren't very
graphically demanding but the game said
it did play like fruit ninja and Temple
Run 2 it actually handled them pretty
well so if you stick to pretty basic
games you shouldn't really have any
issues and just like the rest of the
phone the camera is low-end as well
coming in at only 3 megapixels which is
pretty low compared to what Nokia puts
on its high-end offerings the camera is
very slow to fire and the option from
within the camera are very limited as
well there's also the note tap to focus
because this is a fixed focus camera and
with a 3 megapixel sensor the pictures
are pretty much exactly what you might
expect them to be there's not a whole
lot of sharpness in detail and this is
very apparent if you zoom in on them
even the tiniest bit Pella reproduction
seems decent but overall it's a pretty
underwhelming camera but you shouldn't
really expect a whole lot from it
anyways the most frustrating part about
using the Nokia X though wasn't the
display it wasn't the performance and it
wasn't the camera it was actually the
lack of integration with Google's own
services and for someone like me who
uses a lot of Google's own apps it made
it rather difficult to use the Nokia X I
couldn't check my two gmail accounts I
couldn't listen to Google Play music I
couldn't use hangouts I couldn't watch
YouTube I couldn't even download apps
off of Google Play or do anything Google
related for that instance and even doing
a quick google search on Nokia's own app
store will leave you with nothing but
a bunch of third party applications now
this phone isn't all bad there are some
positive things that I like about it
like the battery life for example even
with these small 1,500 milliamp hour
battery I was still able to make it
through a full day just fine I will
admit that I was connected to Wi-Fi the
majority the time that I was using it
and although this phone does support 3G
it doesn't support 3G on t-mobile's
network which was the carrier I was
using it on and because this phone
doesn't have any Google services you're
not having to deal with a lot of data
syncing in the background which also
helps preserve battery life as well the
most talked-about
aspect of Nokia's line of Android phones
is probably the UI it looks like Windows
Phone and it even acts like Windows
Phone so why is it just not Windows
Phone well presumably it's because of
the wider range of apps and although you
can't download apps from Google Play
nokia says that virtually any Android
app will work if you're willing to go
through the trouble of sideloading them
what I actually did to get Instagram and
Apex Launcher there are still some
elements that do remind you that this is
still in fact Android like the widgets
for example which are very familiar and
the settings menu although slightly
different is still very much intact some
of the features that Nokia added I
actually found to be quite nice like the
double tap to wake which we've seen on
other devices like the LG g2 and the HTC
One m8 so I was pleasantly surprised
when I found this feature built-in and
there was also a glance screen which
basically shows you the clock for a
short period of time if you leave your
phone sitting idle the lockscreen
notifications is also a really nice
addition and a simple swipe to the right
will take me directly into the
notification and he swipe to the left
will dismiss it entirely
and speaking of notifications your
notifications don't appear in a
drop-down shade like they normally would
on a typical Android device instead
you're using what Nokia likes to call
Fastlane which can be accessed with a
right or left swipe on your main home
screen Fastlane essentially aggregates
all green notifications and any recent
activity all into one it's nice to be
able to have everything you need at a
single glance but it can become
cluttered rather quickly if you've
opened a lot of apps or received a lot
of notifications
the Nokia X is priced at 89 euros which
is roughly 120 US dollars and is
available now in emerging markets like
India and Kenya but if you're somewhere
else like say the United States for
example then you want to get your hands
on the Nokia X or any of Nokia's Android
offerings you can find them on websites
like eBay or even Negri alike
Tronics for roughly 140 to 150 bucks so
there you have it guys this has been the
Nokia X it's definitely a phone that is
geared more towards emerging markets
with its relatively low end specs and
while it is being powered by Android
you'll find that the experience is very
different from your typical Android
device but that's pretty much it
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video
