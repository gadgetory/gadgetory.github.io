with gaming thanks to Nvidia and a new
version of the popular line of devices
updates their Android TV box to a
slimmer but more powerful companion for
one's entertainment center if you've
never pulled the trigger on a smart hub
for your large TV this might be the one
you've been waiting for
it's J VTech T what's going on everybody
and this is a review of the new 2017
Nvidia shield TV while the Nvidia shield
TV never really did take up a whole lot
of room next to our televisions the
latest bass Edition is significantly
smaller a larger shield TV pro is also
available that adds a micro SD card slot
and a much bigger built-in hard drive
but in this version of the shield of
those two missing features still leave
room for two USB ports and Ethernet port
and the HDMI port where all of the magic
flows out connected drives can be used
as a removable storage to transfer data
to and from the internal 16 gigabyte
drive but most users may want to install
a USB 3.0 solid-state drive like I have
formatted to be used as device storage
with this solution I was able to add a
much-needed 200 plus gigabytes for apps
and app data the included remote is very
similar to the previous model showing an
apparent focus on voice search with the
large microphone button there's also a
touch sensitive area beneath it where
users can slide a finger in order to
change the volume and it's pretty slick
the same sliding action can be done on
the bottom of the updated shield
controller which has also been slimmed
down and now has much more of the
angular lines and shapes found in much
of Nvidia divine language buttons for
general navigation are found in the
center and an audio jack underneath can
be used for routing sound and recording
to one's headphones we really like the
build quality of every piece of kit in
the Nvidia shield TV but the updated
controller definitely completes the
gamer focus package it's still one of
the best controllers we've ever used in
android period
let's throw ourselves right into the
Leanback interface of the shield TV
operating system I can show you this
easily because of the powerful built-in
recording and broadcasting capabilities
of the shield where I can record high
quality footage of not just the games
but also the overall interface
commentary is recorded using either the
microphones on the controllers or via
inline mics unplugged in headphones the
audio isn't all that great and you don't
have a whole lot of control over the
volume of the voice recording or even
the volume of the game audio as they're
all recorded at the same time so this
may not be the best solution for any
hardcore gamers really looking to share
their playthroughs the shield has always
been focused on gaming and that
experience has been updated since the
previous model Nvidia grid is now
GeForce now the streaming service that
marry a subscription streaming with full
game purchases not every game is
available in GeForce now but a pretty
sizable library is included with the $8
a month subscription the most recent
triple-a title put on GeForce now is no
man's sky and games like Batman Arkham
origins and Tomb Raider can be launched
immediately after starting one
subscription GeForce now in a nutshell
allows gamers to stream content straight
from Nvidia zone servers with the right
internet connection it is almost
surprisingly effective user input was
good enough to get through fight scenes
without any issues as Batman in the
Batman game or Wei Shen in Sleeping Dogs
and despite some loss of quality when
the internet connection got a bit weak
the experience was still smooth and I
could feel capable of doing full fun
playthroughs if you have a powerful
enough router you can have a smooth
experience but I would highly recommend
taking advantage of the Ethernet
connection for best results your gaming
mileage may vary however I can see a vyd
gamers not really buying into GeForce
now when they already have all of the
games included and when games they want
aren't going to be supported by the
shield personally I didn't have an issue
with this because I have yet to play or
finish many of the included titles what
a completely different level of gaming
can still be achieved even without in
videos backing and that's through the
Android side many Android games have
been properly ported over to Android TV
and Nvidia makes it as close to a
comfortable console experience as
ever I've made the point before that
Android is a great place to revisit or
even introduce people to classic titles
like Final Fantasy 9 and Jade Empire
both of which are happily installed here
and when the gamepad is supported the
gameplay is immensely better on the
bigger screen and without the
touchscreens of one tablet or
smartphones some titles are missing
oddly enough many of rockstars titles
are absent like bully or many of the 3d
Grand Theft Auto games but with the
large number of existing games already
in the Play Store there should be enough
to keep someone busy on what can really
be described as their Android console
the viewing experience is still
incredible with everything from Netflix
the network apps like Comedy Central
available for Android TV I find it odd
that basically any podcast application
is missing but that is easily fixed with
the built-in Google cast support where I
find a bit of a hole in the new shield
TVs features is Google assistant Nvidia
made a huge deal in their announcement
that Google assistant was going to be a
part of it but it seems that the
existing Google Voice Search just got a
facelift to look more like it for
example Google assistant on the shield
TV doesn't do the daily briefing instead
showing me the search term results from
YouTube there are a few other functions
that I use on Google assistant with my
Google pixel that somehow did it make it
over to the shield TV I believe that
Google assistant on the shield should be
as good as Google home especially if
someone is using it first thing in the
morning or in the background for any
other daily household tasks but even
then the new shield TV is a worthy
update to the original but might not
appeal to previous owners if they don't
own a 4k HDR capable TV many of the
features of this newer version have come
to the previous shield TV via software
updates but we will admit that upgrades
from the Tegra k1 to the x1 might be
enough to entice users for anyone that
has waited to make their televisions as
smart as possible with the shield this
new version is a powerful little Android
console with a delightfully short list
of caveats NVIDIA has continued to
provide the most capable apparatus for
making mobile gaming a little bit more
grounded and thus potentially that much
more enjoyable it's a simple equation
when it comes to the Nvidia shield TV
you come for the TV but stay for the
game
give it into Andhra 34 even more about
to be in video shield TV and more about
Android TV in general we do think it's a
great way to play games primarily on a
bigger screen but it's still one of the
best ways to create a smart experience
for your existing television the Nvidia
shield TV is available now for 199
dollars but the shield TV pearl is
available at 299 dollars if you want the
extra features and a little bit more
harddrive space
keep it into Android 34 even more about
this and beyond MWC is only a month away
so you can stay tuned for all of our
coverage of that and even more because
we are your source for all things
