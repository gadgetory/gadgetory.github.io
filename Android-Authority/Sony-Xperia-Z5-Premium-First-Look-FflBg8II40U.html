Authority and it was bound to happen
eventually but we finally have our first
4k smartphone this is your first look
and hands on of the sony xperia z5
premium so starting with a design the
sony xperia z5 premium looks and feels a
lot like many other Sony devices in the
past it has the same iconic design with
a clean rectangular slab and it's mostly
made of metal and glass so you have a
metal frame around the sides and you
have glass on the front and back like
many other Sony phones as well it's also
completely waterproof so the biggest
difference with this device is that
you'll notice that it's a lot larger
than usual at least for Sony standards
it's a 5.5 inch smartphone and it's
actually similar in size to the Galaxy
Note 5 but it's a little bit taller and
just a little bit thicker but just feel
really good in the hand the metal glass
does feel really nice but like many
other phones that have a glass back it
does tend to be a little bit of a
fingerprint magnet now the star of the
show is obviously the display so it's a
5.5 inch screen with 4k resolution
making the Xperia z5 premium the first
phone in the world with a 4k display and
that puts out a whopping 806 PPI which
is totally insane and with this pixel
density and with this resolution it's an
extremely sharp and crisp looking
display it's also very vibrant very
saturated has great viewing angles the
only thing I noticed was that it doesn't
get all that bright especially come in
comparison to something like the note 5
or the galaxy s6 it doesn't get quite as
bright so it's a little bit difficult to
see outdoors but otherwise it's a
fantastic looking screen and it's
something you really have to see for
yourself in order to really appreciate
but to be honest I'm not really entirely
sure if I can really see the difference
between a 4k screen and a quad HD screen
but regardless it is a fantastic looking
display no matter how you look at it the
remaining parts of the z5 premium are
pretty similar to the regular z5 so
inside you're looking at a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 810 processor paired with
three gigabytes of RAM so performance
shouldn't really be in
issue at all and in my little short time
with the z5 premium it seemed very fast
and snappy and fluid I didn't notice any
sort of lag or stutters or anything like
that so it should be fast enough to keep
up with the rest of the competition for
storage on the z5 premium you're looking
at 32 gigabytes of internal storage but
if that is not enough for you there is a
micro SD card slot to give you extra
storage and there's also a fingerprint
scanner that is embedded in the power
button that is basically another
differentiator with the z5 here and this
is very different from all the other
fingerprint scanners that we've seen
which normally have them mounted in the
home button or on the backside but
having it on the side where the power
button is definitely makes a lot of
sense because that's where your thumb
normally rests to power on the phone so
it makes a lot of sense to have it here
and it's actually really convenient and
it works extremely well it's actually
very fast at unlocking the device and
setting it up is pretty simple as well
you basically just sort of keep on
tapping on the button until it registers
your fingerprint it's very similar to
other implementations that we've seen on
other devices of course with the rest of
the hardware it comes with the usual
stuff that you might expect like Wi-Fi
Bluetooth GPS and just in case you are
wondering a does ship with NFC onboard
now with all these power-hungry specs
and the insane 4k screen a lot of people
are expecting that the z5 premium is
probably going to take a pretty big hit
in the battery life Department but
obviously we can't really say too much
about it right now but the handset does
have a 30 for 30 milliamp hour battery
inside and that should hopefully do the
trick and Sony actually swears that the
phone will provide two days worth of
battery life on a single charge but
we're definitely going to have to wait
and see if those claims are actually
true now although we haven't had a
chance to test out the camera on the z5
premium we do have pretty high hopes for
it just due to the fact that Sony has a
pretty good track record when it comes
to cameras and of course this one
happens to be a 23 megapixel Exmor RS
sensor with a super fast autofocus some
say glass is more important in this
camera is well equipped with a 23
millimeter wide angle F 2.0 G lens and
if you like selfies that 5 megapixel
front facing shooter should be good
enough likely not amazing but on
what front-facing camera is as far as
the software goes you're looking to
android 5.1.1 with Sony's Xperia Y on
top and the Xperia Y will feel very
familiar to you if you've used it before
in the past and it's very close to stock
Android experience with just a few Sony
customizations put on top like these
small apps for easier multitasking and
the built-in PlayStation integration
which is great if you are a gamer but
otherwise it's a very clean experience
and you'll definitely enjoy if you
enjoyed that closest dock experience
with a few extra bells and whistles so
there you have it guys the sony xperia
z5 premium is posed to go against the
big guys literally and it does seem to
have all the right weapons for a good
battle exact us pricing and availability
is still up in the air but do you expect
to pay a premium price as always thank
