officially announced the HTC One S nine
packs a five inch full HD Super LCD
display with Gorilla Glass a two Giga
hurt octa-core MediaTek Helio x10
system-on-a-chip two gigabytes of RAM 16
gigabytes of on-board storage a 13
megapixel rear camera and a 4 megapixel
front-facing camera boom sound speakers
and a 2,840 milliamp hour battery and it
also ships with Android marshmallow the
phone has an official web page in
Germany and will retail there for 499
euros or roughly $561 us now judging
from these images this looks a lot like
the m9 the back of the phone has the
same design for the camera and antenna
lines and the side view reveals the same
two-tone approach as well the front of
the phone is clearly different however
and it's here that HTC may be on to
something or at least trying to evoke a
new design language as far as the
pricing goes however $560 is seemingly a
lot of money to be asking for what is
internally at least quite similar to the
now old HTC m9
let's talk googles dream team Google
Ford uber lyft and Volvo have just
teamed up for a mighty lobbying
coalition to make sure the interests of
self-driving vehicles are represented
it's called the self-driving Coalition
for safer streets and their angle is to
promote the statistical certainty that
self-driving vehicles are hands-down
better and safer than human drivers the
lobbying group is headed by David
Strickland who is a former administrator
of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration these are the guys that
sponsored our show just last week this
is a solid leader for the group
considering that the organization is
tasked with coming up with regulations
to govern self-driving cars by this
summer self-driving vehicle technology
will make America's roadways safer and
less congested the best path for this
innovation is to have one clear set of
federal standards and the coalition will
work with policy makers to find the
right solutions that will facilitate the
deployment of self-driving vehicles now
for the
be who hate YouTube ads there's news for
you
well ads have become the cost of doing
business in a world where we've grown
accustomed to getting our content for
free although YouTube does have long ads
that are skippable before videos Google
is pushing out a new ad format called
bumpers which are unskipable six-second
shorts placed in front of the video that
you selected to watch in the AdWords
blog that announced the new format
product manager Zach loop I compares
these bumper ads to video haikus current
ads placed before videos are often
full-length ads that can be skipped
after a few seconds however these ads
have a hard cap of 6 seconds making them
a lot more like vine videos than
traditional video ads YouTube is
targeting mobile users who tend to
prefer snackable content so you can
expect these new short form ads to start
hitting your smartphones sometime soon
however you can always opt out of this
by buying into the YouTube red
subscription which actually brings a lot
of bang for your buck let us know what
you think of this new ad format in the
comments below now let's talk the
Facebook messenger which now supports
group calls Facebook is pushing to make
messenger the one-stop solution for all
your communication needs whether at work
or play and it's pretty understandable
why the service has 900 million active
users every month and Facebook is
looking for ways to monetize that if
they can scoop out some of the usage
that's going to competitors like Skype
and Google Hangouts it's basically all
aboard the gravy train currently you can
have up to 50 people at a group call
which sort of signals that Facebook is
targeting the working world with this
feature still if it can handle 50
separate lines then a three-way debate
about dinner between friends should be a
piece of cake what messenger still lacks
however is video of course this is
something that hangouts and Skype still
have a stranglehold on however we'd be
really surprised if Google didn't
integrate this feature over the next
year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
