Kevin the tech ninja and today I'm going
to do a roundup review of my top
portable chargers now what I always do
is give you a mini review of each one
give you the pros and cons of each and
let you decide which one is the best for
you
you ready let's begin the first portable
charger is the sub 50 dollar lime fuel
blast l1 56 X this version that I have
is the older one as the pro was just
released at the exact same price point
around $50 this version that I have is
two ports at two amps well give this
charger four and a half stars at 1337
reviews is that it packs a strong punch
and fifteen thousand six hundred
milliamps and for the size of this
battery the charger isn't much larger
than some smart phones it's a solid
brick and it may surprise people how
light it is and it uses a soft touch
rubber that you see on LG devices like
the Nexus 7
there's an LED indicator on the side of
the battery charger to let you know how
much power is left it has an auto off
feature so when it's no longer used it
just turns off or if you plug something
into it it turns back on you can charge
a device by using a simple USB cable and
plug it into the power source the cable
that it comes with is two and one it's
lightning port and USB although it may
not be something you use it does have a
flashlight on it as well and since the
ports are 2 amp the charging speeds will
be pretty decent for phones but a bit
slower for tablets the next portable
charger has even more reviews at Amazon
with 2500 and a 4.5 rating this is the
Astro 5 II charger by Ankur this charger
also has two ports on it and a
flashlight the first port is a 1 amp and
the second is 2 n on the other side
there's a USB micro for charging the
house is glossy and pretty slick to the
touch the LED indicated is blue and it's
pretty bright it shows 4 bars when it's
full and this 2 has the auto off and on
feature physically is not as long as the
lime fuel but it's a lot heavier and it
feels chubby and it's so slick I found
myself reaching for the lime filled
majority of the time
but for 50 bucks this is a decent
charger and all the cons I mentioned are
not really anything that takes away from
the true experience the next portable
charger well I'm not sure if I can call
it portable but I had to have it in my
list
this is the ravpower extreme series
power bank this charger is only a 2 port
charger and the range output is between
5 volts 9 12 16 19 and 20 the unit
itself is extremely large it's about
double the thickness of my laptop and
it's a little over half as long an LCD
display is on it so you can see what the
voltage is and exactly how much better
is left and just like the other two
chargers it does have the auto off
feature as well now the way it works it
comes with three generic cables and you
actually put the tips on top of the
cables now before you purchase this you
should consult RAF Powers website to
confirm that it has the tips you need
the tips have a female end on them and
the cords just connect to the extensions
now if you lose your cords or you want
to use a normal USB cable you actually
can for your device now for some reason
if you still need to use those tips
those cords are required that it comes
with although it's bigger it does not
charge phones any faster than other
chargers since it has a built in over
current protection which is actually a
good thing because if you supply an
overcurrent to a device you could fry it
if you want to charger that does a
variety of different devices then look
no further the smallest portable charger
that I have on my list is the newly
released tilt energy 2k portable charger
what makes this charge unique is that it
has a built-in plug into it so you
actually can plug it right into the wall
and it charges it directly now once it's
done charging it actually turns off
automatically that you could plug your
device right into it now just like all
the other tilt products it comes in a
variety of different colors now this is
only twenty-two hundred milliamps and
it's designed to give you a bump charge
so if you're down to 20% you can plug it
in and on some devices you end up at
around 80% which should last you the
rest of the day or until you get back to
a charger the auto off feature is great
and it actually works with no issues it
has battery indicators and it uses
different color combinations to show you
how much batteries left
these colors are tough to see outside
since they are lower powered LED now to
rather see le
the bars also I wish it had a cable
built-in to make it even more portable
last up is the only charge on the list
that does not have a battery pack built
into it but it has a really unique and
useful feature this is the revive
restore ra4 this portable charger uses
four sets of solar panels this allows
you to absorb more light then you can
actually plug directly into this to
charge your devices these panels fold
out to measure about 3 feet long now
what's important to know is if you do
not have enough light coming to it it
will not charge the device at all now
what really makes this tough is that
there are no indicators to let you know
that it doesn't have enough Sun or does
have enough Sun so pretty much you plug
it in and guess but once you do have
enough Sun you go ahead and plug it in
and it starts charging your device it
charged as quick as if you had your
phone plugged into a computer it also
has a nifty pouch that allows you to
store your devices in it and also where
the USB ports are located it has eight
nylon loop so you can easily attach it
to something if your person that goes
camping or you're not near a wall port
for an extended amount of time outdoors
this is pretty much the way to go
and that is it folks that was my review
roundup now I try to include different
types of Chargers that will work good in
different scenarios like traveling when
you're at work or even out in the
wilderness naked and afraid
