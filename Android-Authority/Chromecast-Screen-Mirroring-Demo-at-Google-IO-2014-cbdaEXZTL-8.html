Andhra Authority I'm here with David and
we're going to be taking a look at a
demo of the chromecast screen mirroring
that is a feature that's going to be
coming in the coming months for the
chromecast it's a feature a lot of
people have been wanting and we're gonna
take a look at just how well it works on
this huge Sony TV right in front of us
so David going to take it away cool
great so what we're gonna be doing is
we're gonna be showing the cast screen
functionality so I'm gonna open up my
quick settings pane here I'll hit the
cast Screen button and I see the name of
the chromecast that also appears in the
television behind us living room and I'm
gonna tap that and immediately my screen
is actually mirrored to the TV so this
is really valuable for a variety of
reasons
one is you can use really cool apps like
Google Earth and they mirror really
really fluidly really well so if we load
up Maui
we can see a really really smooth
transition here and so we can share the
content that's appearing on the really
really small screen that we all use to
huddle around with everyone in the room
and if I rotate the phone we can see
that it looks even better when it's in
landscape than portrayed I can show you
another couple things too so one case
that I can't show you because this is
just a demo phone is apps that don't
already natively support the chromecast
they work great with Android mirroring
and another case that I'd like to show
you is simply displaying a tab from the
Chrome browser so let's say we wanted to
look up Android authority and load it
here and immediately we can see it on
this enormous screen in front of us
appreciate that by the way absolutely so
as you can see the new mirroring
functionality works really really well
with the chromecast it just extends the
different use cases that people have for
it makes it even more valuable and it's
coming to all chromecast users soon
all right great well that was just a
quick look at the screen mirroring as
you could see in the background there on
the sony tv it worked really well and if
you could sort of sync up where you see
the phone kind of doing it's doing its
thing you'll be able to see it's
actually really responsive the latency
is actually very low and Google Earth
looked wonderful on there so that was
just a quick look at the chromecast
screen marrying everyone can look
forward to that feature coming in the
coming months I know I am for sure so
keep it tuned to Android authority for
all the great coverage especially when
that feature comes out and make sure you
stay tuned here for the rest of our
coverage here at Google i/o 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
