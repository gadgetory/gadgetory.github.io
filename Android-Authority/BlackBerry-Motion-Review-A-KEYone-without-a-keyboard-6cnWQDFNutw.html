successful smartphone for blackberry it
brought the modern Android experience
and combined it with the classic
BlackBerry physical keyboard but it
definitely wasn't a phone that appealed
to everyone and not everyone wants a
physical keyboard and that's where the
brand new BlackBerry motion comes into
play it basically takes everything that
made the key one so great bumps up the
specs in a few key areas and does away
with the physical keyboard one thing
that I really appreciate about
blackberry right now is that they're not
afraid to do things differently in an
era where dual cameras bezel is displays
and curvy sleek pebble like designs are
all the rage the BlackBerry motion sort
of bucks all those trends and it all
starts with a phones design it's made
completely out of metal so it's still
very high quality and it feels great in
the hand but it has completely flat
sides and chamfered edges and it has a
very sharp and angular look to it it's
also a very asymmetrical design the top
is rounded whereas the bottom is
completely flat and the top forehead is
a lot smaller than the bottom chin but
the bottom chin is a lot bigger for good
reason it has a front-facing fingerprint
sensor designated by that blackberry
logo and this is actually a physical
clicking home button versus a solid
state home button which I thought was a
little bit interesting but it's also
flanked by some really large capacitive
keys which I liked a lot because some
smartphones have really tiny capacitive
keys and they're very hard to press so I
appreciate that these keys are nice and
large and they're really easy to find on
the back side there's a faux carbon
fiber pattern which not only looks
really nice but it's also very soft to
the touch and gives the phone a lot of
grip the buttons on this phone are also
really high quality they're made of
metal so they're very clicky and tactile
and they all live on the right side
which I don't mind you have the volume
rocker up top the power button in the
middle and blackberry signature
convenience key which has a nice Ridge
texture to it but I kind of wish these
buttons were in a slightly different
order because when you hold the phone
your thumb naturally rests on the
convenience key instead of the power
keys so I kind of wish the power button
and the convenience key were swapped
because
blackberry motion doesn't have a
physical keyboard taking up a ton of
space that gives you a lot more room for
a larger display so what you have here
is a 5.5 inch LCD with 1080p resolution
and it's not the most attention-grabbing
display but it is a pretty good-looking
screen it has vibrant colors good
viewing angles and outdoor visibility is
not really that big of an issue my
biggest problem with the screen though
is that it has this durability coating
which is meant to protect the screen
from scratches but it makes the screen
really hard to keep clean from
fingerprints and it's also very tacky to
the touch it's almost as if there's a
screen protector sitting on top of it
even though it's just pure glass inside
it has the same exact specs as the
BlackBerry key one so Snapdragon 625 and
4 gigabytes of RAM and it's not the
fastest performing phone it's not gonna
blow you away in terms of benchmarks and
yes you will notice the occasional
stutter from time to time and certain
applications like snapchat don't perform
quite as smoothly as they do on other
flagship smartphones but generally
speaking it's a very good performing
phone it still launches apps quickly and
it still plays all the graphically
demanding games extremely well so even
though there are the occasional stutters
I never felt like it broke the
experience the biggest benefit to the
Snapdragon 625 is the battery sipping
properties and when you combine that
with a huge 4000 milliamp hour battery
you get a recipe for some very long
lasting battery life and I love the
battery life on the motion it easily
last me a full two days with a
consistent six hours of screen on time
which is really impressive and that's
even with pretty heavy usage with a lot
of gaming a lot of YouTube watching a
lot of viewing streams on Twitch so I
really love the battery life on this
thing there's no wireless charging
though even though it has a non-metal
backside but you do get the standard
Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 whenever you
need to fill up as far as hardware is
concerned you'll be pretty happy to know
that it does come with the headphone
jack and it also has expandable storage
via microSD if you need more and it's
also ip67 water and dust resistant so it
has all the bells and whistles of a
20-17 smartphone or at least all the
bells and whistles that we would expect
from a 20-17 smartphone the
cameras on the BlackBerry motion are
exactly the same as the cameras on the
BlackBerry key1 so you have an 8
megapixel camera on the front a 12
megapixel camera on the rear and the
camera itself is very simplistic you
don't really get a whole lot of shooting
modes outside of the basic stuff like
panorama and slow motion video you're
not gonna find any fancy background
defocusing effects or portrait mode on
this camera and the camera itself is
just ok you can get some pretty
nice-looking shots in well-lit or
outdoor situations with vibrant colors
great contrast and pretty nice detail
but it's very quick to fall apart in
low-light situations
photos are very noisy very washed out
and they're typically overexposed
especially in the highlights and the
camera is just very sluggish and low
light it's slow to capture and it also
constantly hunts for focus that it makes
it very cumbersome to use in low-light
my favorite part about any blackberry
Android phone has to go to the software
not only because it's really close to
stock Android but also because
BlackBerry's customizations are all
really useful it starts with the
BlackBerry hub which aggregates all of
your social media your text messages
your emails etc all into one place
making it really easy to check so you're
not jumping back and forth between
multiple applications just to check all
of your notifications there's also a lot
of other really nice touches like the
swipe up on app icons to open the apps
widget and the privacy shade which
basically blacks out your entire display
except for a small little window to make
it harder for other people to read
what's on your screen and of course with
this being a BlackBerry you get
BlackBerry's best-in-class security
software with DTEC which always ensures
that your phone is secure and your data
is always encrypted the biggest drawback
to the BlackBerry motion right now is
its limited availability it's currently
only available in select markets like
the Middle East and Canada no US
availability just yet so hopefully
that's coming soon but like I said the
BlackBerry motion is a key one without a
keyboard and a few upgraded specs and if
that's exactly what you're looking for
the BlackBerry motion is your answer
let's just hope it comes to more regions
sooner than later because it's a pretty
awesome smartphone that I think a lot of
people will want to get their hands on
so that wraps up this review of the
BlackBerry motion I hope you all enjoyed
