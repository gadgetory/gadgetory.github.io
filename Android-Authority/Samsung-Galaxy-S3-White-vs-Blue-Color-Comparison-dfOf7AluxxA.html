coming at you from the best Android site
on the web and run Authority comm today
we've got a color comparison between
three variants of the Samsung Galaxy s3
now I know a lot of viewers have been
wondering which version they should get
because this phones come into a lot of
carriers all around the world and so
we've got a few variants right here
we've got our t-mobile Galaxy s3 in the
pebble blue we've got our sprint version
of the galaxy s3 in white and we have
our international version in white as
well now my opinion is that both of the
finishes are great I like the white
finish it's a little more sophisticated
but the pebble blue is just awesome now
we want to hear your guys opinions so
make sure to comment and we're gonna be
setting up a poll on our website so you
guys should check that out but let's
just walk through the finish over these
phones we'll start with the pebble blue
as you can see the back almost has a
mirrored finish on there it's really
really nice looking it's a very metallic
more metallic and I would expect it to
be when I first got it um the screen
color blends in nicely the black bezel
just looks awesome on here and then you
can't really see the soft keys which I
think Samson did a great job doing the
soft keys are just almost completely
hidden when you're checking this phone
out and then it's not until you actually
pop it on that you can see the soft keys
there so it's this really nice nicely
hidden in the brushed metal there and
then you pop this off key on and boom
there it is
now the nice out physical home button
looks great in the pebble blue the
chrome accent right around it looks
awesome then our matching buttons of
course on the sides our LEDs look
awesome embedded in the pebble blue
finish and then when we take the back
off the pebble blue I wouldn't really
worry about the finish getting lost you
can kind of just bend this around it's
really malleable and the finish is gonna
stay on there for a long time
anyways we'll just check out the white
version of the Samsung Galaxy s3 so this
is our sprint version so we're gonna
have a little bit of care your branding
back there but it's not gonna differ
from the international version so we'll
just take a look here and as you can see
it's just a nice white finish kind of
reflective we've got the Samsung
the international version and then we
have sprint on our regular version I
went health side by side we can see we
have chrome accents on the white version
then we've got our blue accents on the
blue version and we can just tip these
up get a go to look for everywhere these
little power icons more noticeable on
the pebble blue you just take the back
off of the white version for Sprint this
one will also hold its finish very well
the entire thing is actually made out of
the white plastic and then there's just
uh you know there's like a there's a
flat white on the inside and then
there's a nice shiny finish on the
outside now as far as soft keys go we
can see that Samsung did a nice job
hiding them on the front of the white
version but then once we pop them on we
can see them very very clearly we've got
our nice a soft key menu button and then
we've got our back button now anyways we
have the nice chrome around the white
button here I do have a zag invisible
shield on the front of this so we can
get a good look at the Sprint version
without the invisible shield on there
we've got a nice chrome accents all
around the camera and the sensors are
more noticeable on the white version
than they are on the pebble blue just
because of the color blending and then
you can actually kind of see this a
light sensor here on the pebble blue
more than you can see it on the white
version anyways we want to know your
opinions guys what do you all think do
you like the white version or do you
like the pebble blue version which one
of you guys gonna buy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
