really focus on mobile technology on the
future technology talking a colleague
Andrew before about battery breakthrough
six thousand cycles before it starts to
degrade so we're looking at the bolt
here now this is a completely electric
vehicle it's one hundred percent can we
talk to the king just tell us a little
bit more about it about the range maybe
the price point kind of way absolutely
we're going to be at least a 200 mile
range vehicle we're going to offer this
vehicle with the current incentives it
would be approximately thirty thousand
dollars so it's well within the price
range of the majority of customers and
most importantly from a packaging
perspective it is a small car but you
get inside of it and the spaciousness is
just phenomenal it's amazing the size of
vehicle that you've gotten in obviously
this is our concept vehicle you know
there are some differences however I
will tell you that the overall
spaciousness in the field of the actual
production car is very similar so it's
pretty exciting and one of the things
that's most exciting that we can't talk
about yet but I guarantee you you and I
will be talking about it's a level of
connectivity that this car is going to
bring it's going to step up you know I
think General Motors is a very good job
and and is a leader within that space
but when this car comes out I think
think your socks will be taken right off
the bat it's a pretty what I myself to
take it up it's pretty impressed I mean
you know our generation you know and I'm
starting a little bit older
but the younger demographics simply
aren't buying vehicles you know everyone
has a mobile lifestyle living in the
city you know it's a hassle have a big
car cars have been you know an enormous
financial responsibility but I mean
everyone has a supercomputer in their
pocket so can you just give us a little
bit of a glimpse into what is your
guys's thinking around the integration
with mobile and you know so there's
there's a lot of things that we will be
talking about relative to the urban
mobility that you just mentioned this
car is going to bring in some features
that have never been done before and
relative to the connectivity I'm the
same way I use my phone I live and die
by my phone I'd like my phone that just
basically be right part of my car when I
get into it and have that happen
instantly I think you know when we get
into production and we can get you guys
into the vehicle you're going to see
that level of expectation that i would
expect and that i would hope your
readers would expect to just fall right
in line with exactly like hey why hasn't
this always been this move because it's
that easy yeah and it's the way it
should work right it's great when you
pick up new new phone technology and
something happens and it's just
completely intuitive and automatic and
that's how we're making this car android
auto apple carplay i don't know if we
can go and talk about that just yet
pretty much going to happen now it's a
cool feature yeah something I've been
thinking about which is the weaknesses
of Android auto you know it's kind of
harmonized across all the manufacturers
and you guys are obviously taking a deep
plunge but it's a really it's the
initial stages I think back to the first
version of windows or you know first
version android or even the first
version iOS and how far they've come in
terms of improving I'm disability so
no I think we're gonna see a lot of
really great integrations in the future
yeah I do and it's and you know in the
past to be quite honest with you and
it's not something that probably you
know your audience understands but when
working with the automotive companies we
have a certain time line of developing
vehicles and a phone development is a
significantly shorter development
timeline right so to take that timeline
and think it can just immediately apply
into a car it's incredibly difficult
right we have regulations and there's a
lot of validation and time that has to
be spent with them and you know we've
been working a lot with the different
you know with Android with Apple trying
to get ourselves a line on how to make
this happen and we've made some massive
steps then it's going to allow us to be
able to better adapt you know their
six-month development timeline to be
able to take that into our car quickly
right so those are the type of things
where I think this car is going to
really start to really move the needle
because we're really well aligned now
with those come help salute and I have
to applaud you you know 14 different
vehicles with Android auto apple carplay
enable that you guys going to roll out
this year so that's the biggest roll out
that we've seen yet there's no other
manufacturer that compares yeah we want
to be the leaders in connectivity yeah
we understand you know personally I
understand it and our company and our
senior leadership they understand how
important that is and how easy it makes
your car life yeah it just effectively
makes it you know easy and that's what
we want to make it do effortless
absolutely so what's the weight of this
car and what are the size of the
batteries the way to the battery is
relative to the overall weight of the
vehicle so the battery is a significant
mess yeah of the vehicle we're not going
to talk about specifics around the
battery or where it's located okay um
obviously it's a 200-mile car so it is a
significant size battery you can infer
on where it essentially lies and if you
could choose one the Volt of the bolt
usain bolt EV bowl TV would you which
one would you choose which one do you
think is a better fit for people well it
depends on your lifestyle right I can
tell you from for myself I have two kids
I have a Newfoundland and a little dog
so the Volt wouldn't be the right car
for myself this car would be a perfect
car for
in terms of real-world application if I
wanted to drive go see my grandma could
I bring the power cable and everything
kind of just lateral yeah absolutely
yeah I mean you can bring the one-ton 20
charge cord you can stop at a DC fast
charger yeah you know the u.s. is
continuing to increase its level of
charging and infrastructure and and we
work hard we work hard with the
government we work hard with other OEMs
to continue to build that infrastructure
how long would it take to charge this
vehicle on a home connection um we're
not going to get into charge times just
yet obviously we're still doing a lot of
development to make that better and make
it faster yeah but I feel very confident
saying you know Pam alluded to it
earlier 40 they are eight more than
eighty percent of the drives in the
current gen volt are done on EV only in
that car had 40 might less than 40 miles
range I expect that to be over ninety
percent with the 50 miles angeles Chevy
Volt absolutely so then we need step
into a car like this how often are you
going to actually deplete the 200 mile
range well it depends on the customer
but it's a pretty easy fill especially
overnight absolutely well I got to
applaud you guys for your leadership and
you know for taking the deep lunge
absolutely and what we definitely need
to talk when we start getting around the
high like service start a semi definite
we thank you very much thank you starts
to like with a signing off your android
authority at the Chevy tech event</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
