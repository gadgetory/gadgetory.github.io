made it into our hands so it's jaja
freghar from android authority what's
going on everybody and let me tell you
about the first 48 hours that I've spent
with the Samsung Galaxy s7 now like I've
already mentioned we've had the Samsung
Galaxy s7 and s7 edge which long is
reviewing for a couple of days now and
that's obviously not enough for a full
review so we wanted to test out the two
phones for a more extensive period of
time and we'll bring you that full
review pretty soon but for now let's
talk about the phone after a couple of
days of usage
but I wish my happiness I am
and you say
there is actually a OTG USB adapter
that's included that you can connect to
the micro USB port on the bottom and
then connect any other phone to the
galaxy s7 so you can transfer pretty
much everything between the two devices
first things first when it comes to the
design I cannot get over just how great
this phone feels in the hand this is a
perfectly sized device but there are
curves on the back much like the galaxy
note5
which make the phone sit so beautifully
in the Hat for a 5.1 inch screen it
certainly doesn't feel like a 5.1 inch
device here's a shot of me using the
actual phone and then here's the galaxy
s6 in my other hand now while these two
devices are roughly the same size it
actually feels like the galaxy s7 is a
little bit smaller and then of course
here is the s6 edge and with the s6 edge
you can turn it over and it feels like
the s7 mat aside from the fact that
Samsung basically took a shrink-ray to
the note 5 and created the s7 you have a
lot of the same elements from all of the
phones that came out from Samsung last
year pretty much every button is where
you would expect it to be and the camera
hump on the back is where you see some
streamlining as the camera hump has been
reduced greatly and is now much more
flush with the backing and gymnastics
are at a bare minimum as going from left
to right is incredibly easy and then
jumping up to the top really requires
very minimal movements when using in one
hand and one of the main additions to
the design and body of the s7 is that it
is now water and dust resistant and ip68
certification means that no dust will be
getting into the phone and if you do
take a tumble with the phone and it
falls into some sort of body of water
you can just wipe it right off and keep
on going the display of the galaxy s7 is
exactly what you would expect a Super
AMOLED screen with quad HD resolution
bringing very high pixel densities and
very punched out colors AMOLED displays
tend to add a couple of points to a
device but we've also seen them on
plenty of devices over the last year not
just Samsung devices in this case
however the Super AMOLED display is
still providing the real punched out
colors but maybe we're getting so used
to the AMOLED construction that we only
really see the differences when we put
it up against an IPS or an LCD display
and of course there is the always-on
display which so far hasn't hindered the
battery life
not one bit a very fraction of a
percentage is what is taken up every
hour when you do have the always display
on and in my case I like to have it
display the calendar now we can move on
to performance and the version that I'm
using is actually a European version
that has the Exynos 88-90 with Mali
graphics backing it up performance on
here has been nothing short of amazing
honestly because a samsung has really
done a good job of optimizing its
processor for its own software and it
really shows it's very smooth and even
added transitions in and out of the
recent apps screen provide a very
seamless feeling experience and I've
been really just putting a lot of
applications in the background and
multitasking as much as I can and I
haven't seen any applications really
crash or have much slowdown at all if
there's one thing that we need to do a
little bit more it's gaming on this
device and speaking of that we will do
some benchmarks to compare the exceed
O's 88-90 with the Snapdragon 820
version that we will get here in the
States but until then you can rest
assured that the exceed O's 88 90
continues what the Exede knows has been
able to prove in previous devices like
the note 5 and the s6 before it but the
other big addition is of course the
microSD card slot and we've already
started to take advantage of it
thankfully with ace and disk 200
gigabytes microSD card that I've already
put into the phone inside of the device
you get 32 gigabytes of on-board storage
but once that ends you are able to
bolster it with expandable storage but
now we can finally talk about battery
life and though more extensive testing
will be done for a full review that will
be coming very soon I can tell you that
over the last couple of days battery
life has been pretty great 3000 milliamp
hours is what you get inside of the
galaxy s7 and even though it's not as
large as the larger 3600 milliamp hour
battery of the s7 edge it still provides
much better battery life than Samsung
has ever been able to give on the first
day that I use this I took it straight
to the brode Museum in LA to get some
camera samples and I use the camera very
extensively throughout that day I was
still able to get three and a half hours
of screen on time even with that super
heavy usage the day after however I use
the phone more regularly more normally
rather and under that moderate more
general usage I was able to get over
five hours of screen on time
over the course of an entire day even
though we're going to continue our
testing so far we think that for general
users this phone will be able to go even
maybe about two days if you are a
moderate or more general user changes
also come in the camera we no longer
have a 16 megapixel shooter but now we
have 12 megapixels in the camera with
larger 1.4 micron pixels and each pixel
is a focus pixel in the sense that each
one is able to help with the autofocus
and the autofocus speed is actually
really great going from something that's
close to the phone to something that's
far from it only takes really just a
split second and it focuses cleanly on
the subject very easily the front-facing
camera does do a pretty good job but of
course it does not have oh is installed
and that means that you have to be
pretty steady when taking a selfie one
really nice thing about the front-facing
camera is that it can record video in
quad HD resolution which will be really
nice for those of you who want to record
maybe vlogs or any selfie videos but
moving to the rear camera we are going
to go through a camera shootout and see
all of the photos in a more extensive
way and we'll give you our opinions a
little bit later but for 12 megapixel
photos these are actually not all that
bad the only main caveats that I have so
far with the rear facing camera is that
in lower light situations it tends to go
a little bit warmer with the color
temperature and that is something that
you can fix in the pro manual mode but
in Auto it is a little bit annoying in
well-lit situations however things look
quite nice but with a lower megapixel
count you are going to lose some detail
in the finer points of the photo and if
you zoom into the photos you'll also see
that some noise reduction is trying to
compensate for this so the photos might
not be as sharp as they used to be in
the more megapixel heavy cameras in
previous iterations but the galaxy s7 is
still proving to be a pretty viable tool
for the general shutterbug and finally
in software we do have TouchWiz and if
you are familiar with TouchWiz from
before it's pretty much everything you
would expect it is easy to get into
because the fingerprint reader still
works wonderfully you just have to press
the home button to wake up the device
and then leave the finger there and it
unlocks pretty seamlessly from there
however TouchWiz still has all of the
more colorful maybe the more rounded
edge icons throughout the entire
interface
and there is still the app drawer even
though we mentioned in our hands-on
video from MWC that there is a galaxy
labs option that can turn off the app
drawer now that's something we'll touch
upon in the full review but until then
TouchWiz still provides all of the
different features even stuff like the
smart stay but a lot of the extra
features that you may or may not ever
use are all relegated to the same menu
area called advanced features now one
thing I should know is that this version
of the galaxy s7 which is a European
version does not come with the Flipboard
briefing home screen instead it comes
with a new news aggregator called update
so for those of you in the States don't
take this as the gospel truth when it
comes to what you're going to get in the
galaxy s7 TouchWiz this is just a
different news aggregator that is mainly
just for Germany Spain and other parts
of Europe there really aren't too many
more additions inside of TouchWiz
especially this time around except for
the always-on display and with the
always-on display you are able to put on
there a clock or you are able to put
there a calendar and you can even put a
couple of images on there but they are
predefined and you aren't able to just
put anything on the display we are going
to do more extensive testing on the
galaxy s7 including benchmarks comparing
the exceed notes and the snapdragon
versions and also we're going to do a
camera shootout so you can see what the
camera quality really is like on these
two phones until then keep it tuned to
Android thority for that and even more
our full review will be here within the
next week or so and you can stay tuned
for that and even more about Samsung's
new flagship s-- because we are your
