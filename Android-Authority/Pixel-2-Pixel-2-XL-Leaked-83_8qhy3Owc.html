the big hope the big expectations I hope
next pixel phones continued this week
with new images that reportedly show the
backs of both the pixel 2 and the pixel
2 XL prices for both phones were
reportedly revealed as well the leaks
come from droid life using unnamed
sources and they claim that the LG made
pixel 2 XL will cost 849 dollars for the
64 gigabyte version and 949 dollars for
the hundred twenty-eight gigabyte model
the somewhat blurry images of the phone
that were posted with the article showed
that the top quarter of its back where
its camera will be has a dark black
color the rest of the back which also
contains its fingerprint sensor will be
colored either in slightly gray or in
white the official names of the colors
will just be black and black and white
thank you google for not giving us some
sort of pretentious color like ocean
gray the smaller HTC made pixel 2 as
reported by drawed life will be priced
at six hundred forty nine dollars for
the 64 gigabyte version and seven
hundred forty nine dollars for the
hundred and twenty eight gigabyte
variant the leaked images show that the
top quarter of the phone will somewhat
match the color of the rest of the back
no panda phone for the pixel too
apparently it shows a just black clearly
white and kind of blue version will be
available now what I'm about to say may
be totally negated if the pixel device
has come out with some sort of killer
feature but I doubt that they will I
hope that I'm wrong but here's the thing
what is the point of pixel devices at
all what's the point of google making an
android phone of their own in the past
when it came to Nexus devices they were
meant to demonstrate to other
manufacturers what is possible with an
Android experience especially a vanilla
Android experience and they would really
push things and they really improved a
lot of things and other manufacturers
would follow suit and they made them
affordable
now the pixels are going to be priced at
a premium level no problem
but give us
thing unique push the envelope do
something whether in design or function
operation I don't know what it is but
why are you giving us kind of a phone
for a premium price what's the point
what are you doing I don't know what do
you think let me know in the comments
below what killer feature would matter
to you did you really love the pixels I
mean the the camera on the original
pixel was fantastic yes but yeah I don't
know if that's gonna be enough this time
around let me know right here on Twitter
or in the comments below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
