going on everybody and we have another
note seven in twenty second segment for
you so I have a lot of people in this
video so hopefully you guys enjoy but
I'm gonna go ahead and do mine now the
Galaxy Note seven of course is number
seven in the note line but it has a lot
of the galaxy s features especially the
curved screen
what's nice that there's also a curve on
the back so means that the phone feels
really nice
other than that however the arm too many
groundbreaking new features the iris
scanner is awesome and I think it's
actually quicker than I thought it was
going to be so that's cool and then
sharing gifts using the s-pen will be
really nice out of time great oh it's
mr. mobile himself look at me Here I am
you got 20 seconds to tell me about the
note 7 okay go the Galaxy Note 7 is a
phablet and people say I should retire
that term but no it deserves it
it amplifies screen size while also
adding additional features it's going to
be a very big phone for the mainstream I
think it is also going to disappoint
some hard core note fans who expect
things like quantum leaps in specs and
capabilities this is out of a bee
Danny wing it what's up you got 20
seconds to tell me about some note 707
Galaxy s7 edge with a pen kind of the
same features some new stuff like HDR
and you got some pen features and stuff
like that but it seems like it's pretty
much the same I think that's pretty much
in a nutshell I mean I think that's it
so I think the Galaxy Note 7 is probably
the most refined galaxy don't
it's nothing too groundbreaking or crazy
but you can't really complain with a lot
of stuff that it has it has a larger
screen a big battery wireless charging
fast charging progress seek our water
systems and the estin of course and then
it can scan your eyeball so it's pretty
cool
Tom you got 20 seconds so tell me about
the note 7 and go exactly like the note
5 design-wise
spec wise exactly like the Galaxy s7
edge the note 5 had the carp on the back
this one has more carve on the front
still as a carve on the back I don't
know it's kind of all matching me the
Irish standards cool it does actually
work a lot faster than I thought it
would but I just don't think it's
necessary
all right 20 seconds note seven go note
seven plate it's slimmer it's not as
wide as before one cooks great our
scanner okay but I definitely like the
slim this all right Eric
all right you have 20 seconds to tell me
about the what you think and know I was
not thinking I was gonna want to have
another new device because a lot larger
the s7 edge just the perfect size and
actually they end up being pretty much
the exact same size as the s7 edge so
I'm having up with it I think there's a
lot of really nice new features all
right well hopefully you guys enjoyed
