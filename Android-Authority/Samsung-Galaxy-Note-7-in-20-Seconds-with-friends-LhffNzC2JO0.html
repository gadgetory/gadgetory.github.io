what's going on everybody and we have
another note 7 in 20 seconds segment for
you so I have a lot of people in this
video so I hope you guys enjoy but I'm
going to go ahead and do mine now the
galaxy note 7 of course is number seven
in the note line but it has a lot of the
galaxy s features especially the curved
screen what's nice that there's also a
curve on the back so it means that the
phone feels really nice other than that
however the arm too many groundbreaking
new features our scanner is awesome and
I think it's actually quicker than I
thought it was going to be so that's
cool and then sharing gifts using the
s-pen will be really nice out of time
right oh it's mr. mobile himself we look
at me Here I am all right you got 20
seconds to tell me about the cop 07 okay
go the galaxy note 7 is a phablet and
people say I should retire that term but
no it deserves it it amplifies screen
size while also adding additional
features it's going to be a very big
phone for the mainstream i think it is
also going to disappoint some hardcore
note fans who expect things like quantum
leaps in specs time and capabilities
this is son of a bee
Danny wing it what's up you got 20
seconds tell me about the node 7 and no
seven y'all see s7 edge with a pen kind
of the same features some new stuff like
HDR and you got some pen features and
stuff like that but it seems like it's
pretty much the same I think that's
pretty much in a nutshell I mean I think
that's it so I think the galaxy note 7
is probably the most refined Galaxy Note
whatever
it's nothing to groundbreaking are crazy
but you can't really complain with a lot
of stuff that it has it has a large to
the screen a big battery wireless
parking fast charging microSD card water
resistant and the Aspen of course and
then it can scan your eyeball so it's
pretty cool
Tom you got 20 seconds so tell me about
them in 07 and go exactly like the no.5
sign wise spec-wise exactly like the
galaxy s7 edge the no.5 had the carp on
the back this one has more up on
the front still as a car on the back I
don't know it's kind of all matching me
the Irish scatterers cool it does
actually work a lot faster than I
thought it would but I just don't think
it's necessary
all right twenty seconds note 7 go tell
million note 7 white it's slimmer it's
not as wide as before waterproofs great
our scanner okay but I definitely like
to swim this all right erica griffin hi
all right you have 20 seconds to tell me
about the galaxy note 7 what you think
and go I really like the size of it I
was not thinking I was going to want to
have another note device because a lot
larger they s7 and just the perfect size
and actually they end up being pretty
much the exact same size as the s7 edge
so I'm having up with it I think there's
a lot of really nice new features time
oh alright well hopefully you guys
enjoyed this 20 seconds segment video
