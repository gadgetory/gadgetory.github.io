with Android authority
it appears that Xiaomi has taken the
expression go big or go home
quite literally with a six point four
four inch me max but how well does the
me mags perform day-to-day is an
affordable mid-range smartphone let's
find out in our video review of the
Xiaomi there's nothing particularly
shocking about the me Max's design
that's not necessarily a bad thing as
the phone's aluminum construction gives
it a premium look and feel some design
aspects make the device easier to use
like the side tapers on the rear and the
perfectly positioned power button and
fingerprint reader the top and bottom
plastic caps which presumably how's the
phone's antennas are fairly continuous
with the rest of the design in both
color and feel they do seem to be the
culprit of some creaking noises while
holding the phone however and maybe a
major cause of the phone's weak
structure it bends with just a bit of
pressure which is disconcerting to say
the least
the me max is poor build quality shocked
us as Xiaomi has generally done an
excellent job in the past at this end
even lower price points the me max has
three illuminated capacitive keys sit on
a very slightly curved 2.5 D glass and
follow Xiaomi standard layout the
displays side bezels are notably small
although we do wish that Xiaomi would
reconsider the use of a black border
around the display the me Max's standout
feature is definitely its large display
and at 6.44 inches
this phone is undeniably huge the size
definitely requires a few changes in how
you use your smart phone but in exchange
for a superior media consumption
experience well it would have been nice
to see quad HD here instead of 1080p the
display on the Mac still looks great
with good viewing angles and accurate
color reproduction sunlight readability
is a tad below average however and the
sunlight mode decreases the displays
contrast significantly on a positive
note the glass is coated in Corning
Gorilla Glass 4 which we don't see very
often at this price point
as has been the case with other qualcomm
snapdragon 650 two devices the me Max's
day-to-day performance seemed comparable
to phones with higher-end chips like
this now Dragon 808 Xiaomi is custom
software me--why runs very smoothly on
the me max the base models 3 gigabytes
of RAM is generally enough for
multitasking there are different models
available as well although we do not
imagine the real-world performance
differences to be significant unless
you're importing the me max you can
expect 4G LTE speeds and great call
quality if you're in the US the me Mex
will still work on AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile but
it will be limited to receiving HSPA+
speeds it is unlocked and dual SIM
however and you can expand the phone
storage up to an additional 256
gigabytes with one of the SIM card slots
the fingerprint reader on the back of
the me max is accurate and in our
experience just a hair faster than the
one found on the Nexus 6p Xiaomi does
seem to have taken a step backwards with
the me max with the return of micro USB
the decision to not use USB type-c is a
bit puzzling at this point but it may be
appealing to those who are still using
the older standard and do not want to
purchase brand new cables the me Max's
single speaker can be found just to the
right of the charging port it sounds
pretty good
only slightly distorted at higher
volumes it would have been nice to see
front-facing speakers as they generally
offer a more immersive media consumption
experience but side firing is still
better than rear firing with that aside
the B max did very well on our battery
life testing thanks to its very large 48
50 million power battery although screen
on time vary quite a bit depending on
whether the phone was primarily
connected to Wi-Fi or cellular data even
the heaviest users should have no
trouble getting the me max to last a
full day
it also supports quick charge 3.0
although it does not ship with a quick
charge 3.0 charger so you'll need to
purchase one yourself if you want to
avoid several hour long charges the 16
megapixel F 2.0 rear camera with dual
LED flash proved to be a very capable
package in our test
it's one of the best we've seen at this
price point the me max captures detail
remarkably well its color reproduction
is visually pleasing without being too
unnatural in dynamic range is quite good
it's not perfect however as we found the
phone's autofocus to be too slow and
finicky for a considerable number of
situations even when holding the device
and subject still the me max would
slightly miss focus more than we would
normally expect it also tended to over
sharpen images to the point of
recognition in certain images low-light
performance was about average for the
price meaning that you won't be able to
reliably count on the me max for a good
image in darker environments we've
covered video eyes camera app quite
extensively at this point but I will
mention that it's pretty easy to use
while also offering manual control for
those who wish to take advantage of it
and that brings us to Xiaomi is also
well covered custom version of Android
UI 7 thankfully it is shipping with
Android 6.0 marshmallow and users can
look forward to many UI and functional
improvements with the me UI 8 update
which should be released within the
coming weeks and actually automatically
found its way onto our unit in beta form
Mui has received many mixed reviews from
western media as some have criticized it
for being too similar to iOS while
others have praised it for the amount of
Polish and coherency it offers after
using a day-to-day myself I think it's a
great alternative to stock Android
especially for users who wish to
customise and tweak the stack hats are
well designed the UI is remarkably
responsive and the ability to do things
like restrict data for specific apps is
invaluable to top it off new UI receives
weekly updates so you'll be getting bug
fixes and new features very often with
all of that said the software experience
for those importing the device is far
from perfect reseller loaded bloatware a
hellish bootloader unlocking process and
missing Google Apps are all major
hurdles that importers will face even if
you do get Google Apps up and running
from with the Installer app from the me
App Store there are still issues to be
had random google app crashes Google now
issues failure to place calls with
voice and the inability to do things
like consume DRM protected content can
make the experience less than ideal for
Western users the show mean Emacs is now
available in China in a number of
different models starting at $14.99 UN
or about 228 dollars each model is
available in either silver gold or dark
grey while the me max may not be the
best fit for the average smartphone user
it's a great option for those looking
for a very large device on the cheap
well we were disappointed with the
devices build quality found the imported
device software experience to be
annoying in some ways in which that the
phone would come to the US the me max
sale has quite a lot to offer for its
price its impressive camera excellent
battery life and smooth performance are
all great reasons to buy this phone the
mere size of the me max does feel like
unchartered territory for Xiaomi that's
clearly reflected in areas like build
quality if you can get past those quirks
however the Xiaomi me max is likely the
best extra-large option in its price
range thank you for watching our video
