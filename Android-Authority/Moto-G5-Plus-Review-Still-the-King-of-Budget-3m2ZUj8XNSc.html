authority and emoji has always been
Motorola's bread and butter and it's the
company's best-selling smartphone ever a
more or less revolutionized the budget
smartphone category and prove that the
words cheap and good could go
hand-in-hand when describing a phone
with so much competition in the
affordable budget smartphone space does
the Moto G still reign supreme let's
find out with the Moto G 5 plus the Moto
G line has never been about fancy bells
and whistles you won't find features
like wireless charging ip68 dust and
water resistance or dual cameras but
what the Moto G has always provided is a
reliable solid smartphone experience and
an extremely affordable price and for
some people that's all they really want
this year's Moto G 5 plus starts at 229
for the 32 gigabyte model with 2 gigs of
RAM and for double the storage and
double the RAM that will bump up the
price to $2.99 it's pretty much the same
priced here as last year's model and
each and every year you seem to get just
a little bit more for that money
remember when you didn't even get a wall
adapter included in the box the Moto G
has definitely come a long way since
then and yes some of this has to do with
technology getting better and cheaper
but also because the competition in the
budget space got a lot more fierce and
probably forced Lenovo to step their
game up so to speak it's got an all-new
design and instead of an all plastic
body with a removable back the g5 plus
has a metal back with plastic sides and
the entire body is sealed together this
means no more color customizations with
Moto maker anymore and you only have a
couple of colors to pick from with the
gold and the gray the metal doesn't have
the grip that you get from plastic of
previous Moto G's but it does make the
phone look and feel more high quality
the only thing that really cheapens the
look of this phone is the fake chrome
trim that surrounds the display and the
metal backplate
we all remember the days when a ton of
phones had fake chrome in an attempt to
look more premium it didn't work out all
too well back then and it doesn't work
all too well on the g5 plus here in 20
team it gets scratched up super easily
and just conflicts with what is
generally a pretty decent looking
smartphone
although Moto G's have never really been
known for their looks anyways so you may
not even care just like the frame of the
phone the power button and volume
rockers are also plastic but they're
still very tactile and the power button
has a Ridge texture to make it easier to
tell the buttons apart overall the build
quality is quite good and even though
the phone doesn't carry an IP rating it
does have a nano coating on the inside
to protect the phone from the occasional
spill on the top side is the SIM card
tray that can also hold a micro SD card
to expand upon the 32 or 64 gigs of
storage that you already have internally
and on the bottom is a micro USB instead
of USB type-c this is most likely a
cost-cutting move but it's not really
that big of a deal and probably makes
your life easier if you're coming from a
previous Moto G they did at least keep
the headphone jack which motorola /
Lenovo didn't do on the Moto Z the phone
does have NFC but only on the
international model so you're pretty
much out of luck with using services
like Android pay and other things that
require NFC on the US version there's
only one speaker on this phone which
also happens to be the earpiece but at
least it's front-facing and that's
really the biggest positive about this
speaker because otherwise it's pretty
average despite the really chunky bezels
all around it's still comfortable to use
in one hand and part of that is because
it doesn't have an overly massive
display it's a 5.2 inch IPS LCD with
1080p resolution and it's definitely one
of the strongest points of the g5 plus
it's bright enough to see outdoors has
excellent viewing angles and good color
reproduction in contrast it's obviously
not going to compare to a quad HD or
AMOLED screen but it all comes back to
the price and considering that it's a
very good screen for the money sitting
right below the display is the
fingerprint reader which does work quite
well for unlocking the phone and can
also put the phone back to sleep with a
long press the interesting thing about
this fingerprint reader is that you can
replace the on-screen keys and have all
of your Android navigation in one button
the one-button navigation option will
free up the entire display and pretty
much everything that you can do with the
on-screen buttons has somehow been
reconfigured into this button you swipe
left if you want to go back
right right for recent apps double swipe
right for Android new gets fast app
switching and of course tapping on it is
for home and holding down on it will
open up Google assistant
aside from Google assistant you've got
Android 7.0 nougat and just like
previous motor devices it's essentially
a stock experience with those few nifty
and useful Motorola additions like the
ambient display the flashlight double
chop action and the twist of the wrist
for launching the camera they've even
updated the launcher with a new folder
design and after that swipes up from the
bottom to give you more of that pixel
phone look and feel the stock experience
is a big plus but don't buy into the
phone thinking that updates will come
quickly because ever since the lenovo
acquisition motos updates or the speed
of them just aren't what they used to be
if you're looking for a phone that is a
benchmarking Beast this is not going to
be the phone for you but it does perform
very well in real world use it's running
the snapdragon 625 processor and the
experience has been very speedy and
responsive playing games on it has been
great and multitasking back and forth
between applications is also very smooth
especially with 4 gigabytes of RAM and
although I haven't used the version with
2 gigabytes of RAM I'm not so sure I
could say the same thing one area where
the snapped during 625 really comes into
play is battery life the g5 plus has a
3000 milliamp hour battery which is a
pretty decent size for a phone like this
and when you combine that with the
battery efficiency of the 625 you
actually have some pretty solid battery
life the g5 + easily last me through an
entire day even with heavy usage and I
normally would end the day with at least
30% battery life left that's pretty
impressive and then it has the typical
fast charging of course so you can top
off or fill up when you need to on the
back you've got a circle camera module
that sticks out from the body and looks
a lot like the one on the Moto Z but the
protruding camera on the Moto G actually
had a purpose and worked as an anchor
point for the Moto mods whereas the g5
plus just has a camera bump for the sake
of continuity I suppose the specs of the
camera also sound really good on paper
but the quality of the photos are just
average it's a 12 megapixel camera with
F 1.7 aperture and a surprisingly large
1.4 micron pixel size which should help
out in low-light despite not having
Oh is but Lola is the weakest point of
this camera the images really fall apart
with very little detail and over exposes
a lot and blows out highlights you'll
get much better result in daytime
shooting and with good lighting you can
get some great looking shots just don't
expect this camera to compete with an
expensive flagship even if the specs of
the camera may sound like a totally
could the Moto G 5 Plus isn't without
its flaws of course but considering the
price that you're paying there are
definitely a lot more forgivable it's a
phone that just tries to be a good phone
and it does what it's supposed to do
extremely well it doesn't have any fancy
tricks up its sleeve but there are
plenty of options for that if that's
what you want from a phone this is a
phone made for the masses and with a sub
$300 price tag it's hard to argue how
good of a deal this phone is speaking of
deals if you're an Amazon Prime member
it's going to be even cheaper if you're
willing to put up with lockscreen ads
you won't find very many phones that are
this good in this price category and the
g5 plus proves once again that moto is
still the king of the budget space as
