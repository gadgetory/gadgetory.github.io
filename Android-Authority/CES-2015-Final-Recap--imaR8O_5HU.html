authority what's going on everybody and
we're coming to you actually for the
final time for a recap of our days here
at CES 2015 yes we did bring you a day 0
chronicling a couple of days before the
show actually sorry and then we brought
you a day one and then it got crazy
after that so we're gonna bring you just
the last few days today is actually the
last day so you saw a lot of people from
the public getting into sea ESO it's
probably a madhouse there and you guys
could tell us a little bit about that
because they were able to come to the
show floor for a little bit today but
nonetheless we saw a lot of great
products ever since then I'm here joins
of course my lawn our fearless leader
Darcy and Kevin the tech ninja give us a
hooyah Wow so we're standing here in the
promenade between the link and I should
were in the link and behind us is the
famous high roller ferris wheel we're
gonna get on that probably in a little
bit and you'll see some footage of that
coming up in a highlight reel that I'm
gonna have for you but I'm we're going
to hand it off to Darcy and he'll tell
us about the last couple days mostly
today because you're able to kind of
finish off the week pretty strong right
yeah thanks Josh hey guys hope you
enjoyed our coverage here obviously
you're seeing a lot of incredible video
coverage from a wonderful team here I'm
at this point you usually I get kind of
sentimental and very grateful you know
we've all been working so hard to
deliver you the very best of all things
mobile technology and Android and we're
very very fortunate to have great
relationships with a lot of these
wonderful manufacturers that just want
to create awesome products you guys love
and our job is just report on everything
is objectively as possible to make the
highest quality content so that you can
see what's coming in the future
obviously I think you know we have our
awards coming up here but today we went
stop by blue who has some really
competitive price products sub 200 LTE
they're using a lot of Samsung's
technology a lot of amyloid panels they
have a 5011 phone coming sub 179 price
point other than that obviously I think
the major thing of the show would be the
LG G flex 2 and I'd like to pass it off
because it's a super hot phone yeah
here you go alright well yea though that
was what Darcy least you were able to
see today but over the last couple of
days we were able to see other phones by
let's say a sous the wonderful zenfone 2
for a really good price point that
brings some pretty compelling
specifications but you know really the G
flex 2 is probably our best in show we
actually have our first ever pilot
episode podcast talking about it the
Friday debate this week was about our
favorite item of CES and you can see
that already on the channel we will have
that podcast syndicated across all the
different channels but for now you can
see it at our Channel and make sure you
share on social media we're going to
have our podcast coming regularly the
Friday debate yes the G flex 2 for the
most part was our consensus but what I
wanted to do in this final recap was
just ask these two guys here who have
experienced their first CES what their
final thoughts kind of worried about the
consumer electronic show of 2015 what
was it like for you guys to be here and
to cover it with associated esteem yeah
it was it was awesome it was it was a
lot of fun I mean it was a lot of really
hard work as you guys probably already
know a lot of videos that we put a lot
of work into but it was a lot of fun
being able to see all these really cool
gadgets although I would have like I had
the opportunity to walk the floor one
more time to just kind of scope things
out without caring my equipment but
there's always next year but I'm just
happy I was able to you know meet
everybody on the team so we're not just
you know faces on computer screens
anymore well we all got a chance to meet
each other so that was really cool and I
was able to cross CES off my bucket list
you know I always wanted to attend the
show and I had the opportunity to do it
this year so I was so I'm I was super
excited to be here and there she was it
was a really fun time and I can't wait
to do it again it's just been a blast
sort of sort of mirror what lon was
saying that it was a dream of mine to go
to CES and actually check it out it was
really interesting actually being able
to see everything see how what all goes
behind providing good coverage so
getting access to devices before they
come out months in advance sometimes and
being able to be some people's first
look to see some devices a real humbling
feeling knowing that this is their first
expansion phone is in my hand so that's
a cool feeling to to enjoy that um you
know it really really being from Detroit
really reminds me of the Auto Show
except for its on a grander scale and
it's up things that actually are going
to come out officially it's really cool
just to see these new TVs and things
that are going to be feeling best buy's
I'm feeling amazoncom is really soon
hopefully in my living room especially
TV as a final sort of send off we did
talk about our favorite and worst items
at CES but now that we've had a couple
days since our last recap to sort of see
even more out there have your answers
changed at all was there anything that
really caught your eye over the last
couple days no my answer hasn't changed
it's still the of the 4k TVs from Sony
running Android TV but we did get to
check out blue today and they have some
really cool products actually like
they're really they have really nice
build quality they're really awesome
phones especially for the price like
what you're getting for the money it's
it's really kind of cool what they're
doing so I know a lot of people don't
really look at them too much but they're
definitely worth checking out especially
if you want like a really high quality
phone without print paying you know but
six seven hundred dollars to get one so
so check out blue is really cool a day
and you know they're worth worth looking
at if you're looking for a great budget
phone so just look at our you know our
awards our top picks at CES so we had
the fugu XL it's like an indestructible
speaker that sounds but in my opinion
better than the both sound like two or
three LG G flex 2 I mean p oled amazing
battery life and it's flexible I mean it
that's a hot ass phone HTC the desire 86
pretty good looking phone not totally
sold on it but you know we'll review and
check it out equipment the Sennheiser
that we saw up for sound guys calm we
saw the Sennheiser urbanite wireless I
mean the 500 bucks but man for me the G
flex 2 is still probably the number one
phone that i'm looking to check out but
zenfone 2 actually found a way to find a
way into my mind i can't i can't stop
talking about this in phone tune for
some obvious reason i don't know what it
is but it's in fun to just I don't know
what it is I mean I really love that
price point and for me as a person who
promotes getting out of a contract I'm
not a contract guy getting a phone for
two hundred bucks avec high quality is a
great thing even fit is an incremental
update something that you update every
year and still she
then spinach seven hundred dollars on a
phone that is only good for two years
anyway so big for his info big fan of
the zenfone 2 and the 4k TV that's going
to end up my living room really soon I'm
a huge fan of that for obvious reason so
for me to wrap up sort of what I enjoy
what I like pretty much anything we gave
an award to i mean there's we actually
all had input on that so the fugu
speakers to me it's really cool
especially if you want to put about a
pool you don't have to worry about you
know splashing it or if you had a party
or anything like that you don't want you
know it's people to spill on I me this
the person to the demo he was throwing
on the ground dipping it in water doing
all sorts of nasty weird things to it
and it actually still works so big fan
of that and yeah that's about it well
that should pretty much do it that's a
wrap for our CES 2015 you will see some
videos coming out still over the next
few days which is perfectly fine
obviously we have a cue to finish off
but nonetheless we are here super happy
to finally get to work as a team in the
flesh be able to be friends more than
just colleagues over the Internet and
that that is a sentiment that I share
and I'm sure we all do as well oh come
on haha but in any case make sure you
