taking a brand new look at the Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 now this is a device I've
been really excited about I got a first
look at it flow there in Berlin not too
long ago
it's got jelly bean out of the box a
massive 5.0 inch display but none of
that really matters let's just take a
nice quick first look obviously a very
substantial device but for those that
love web browsing and media consumption
it is going to be the device that
they're going to want to get so let's
just power the device to see how it
looks a very striking display 1280 by
720 resolution
it contains Samsung's next generation
AMOLED technology so it is going to have
extremely bright whites and with
jellybean we're going to enjoy iPhone
like 60 frames a second smooth operation
so what else do we have in the box here
let's take a look now we did acquire
this particular unit it is the
international version we did get it in
Hong Kong so it is going to contain some
stuff that is native to the Hong Kong
market obviously the GT and 7100 so we
have a Quick Start Guide blah blah
Chinese we have a warranty card
obviously a few Samsung specific stuff
promoting other products and what else
so padania here we have the headphones
in my experience actually Samsung has
provided quite good headphones so we
have volume control up and down and we
also have the ability through a variety
of click combinations to change the
music I like changing when I'm driving
on my motorcycle you know what I'm
talking about anyway so these are the
sort of gel in case earbud so likely to
have excellent bass response we'll let
you know how they opt we test them out
but looking good nice clean white now we
have a USB charger obviously native to
the sort of UK standard that Hong Kong
is known for a USB cable in here it's
interesting that they use qr-codes
obviously that's for supply chain
management
and then we have the UK specific power
adapter but Samsung seems to design this
so that it will be compatible with a
variety of out different power styles so
you can probably get that on their
accessory store that we just have a few
more hair buds for those that have
larger ears or smaller ears but of
course this is the focus this is the
marble white Edition very very nice and
clean very showy very flashy but this is
actually going to be my device from now
on it's my favorite device I think I
think that it's probably just probably
the best device on the market right now
jelly bean out of the box nice large
screen high resolution screen extremely
fast extremely responsive so this is
just an unboxing of the Galaxy Note 2
mobile white edition my name is Darla
cuvee and we are here from Android
Authority let us know what you think of
our videos guys thanks for checking us
