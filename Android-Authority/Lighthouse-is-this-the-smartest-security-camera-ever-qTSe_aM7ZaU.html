they're smart cameras but none of them
are really smart relying on user input
before performing actions what if there
was another way that was truly smart hey
how's it going guys it's nerve and is
this the smartest security camera ever
lighthouse is the first home security
camera that combines a regular
internet-based camera with the power of
AI and the result is a smart camera that
could be the best yet founded by a team
of ex autonomous vehicle gurus and the
first Inc you be Randy Reubens
playground incubator in Silicon Valley
lighthouse allows you to make natural
language request of its AI rather than
fall through hours of footage for
example you can ask who was jumping
around the living room between certain
times what time did your kids get home
and whether your dog walker came today
thanks to a custom 3d sensor and its own
AI lighthouse can also distinguish
between animals children and adults and
the halo outlines provide an easy way to
see at a glance who is who in our demo
it recognized the difference between the
male father and the female dog walker
for the times where there aren't unknown
strangers you get an alert straight to
your phone and you can then watch the
scene live in full HD from there you can
sound the siren speak through the camera
such as welcoming someone to your home
or warning them that they're on camera
or call the police all straight from the
app the biggest issue with most security
cameras is that you need to troll
through hours of footage to find an
incident with lighthouse we were able to
ask questions naturally to get straight
to the point
found a broken lamp ask lighthouse who
was running around or whether the dog
was jumping on sofa
there's also one minute daily recap
videos allowing you to view time lapse
videos of all activity and the best bit
is they automatically skip through any
periods of inactivity combining AI where
the smart security camera means that the
alerts are a lot better and this is
where lighthouse stands taller than any
other security camera traditionally
using a smart camera relies on you to
ask the right questions to find the
information you're looking for
lighthouse turns this on its head with
its alert system
which configu and something does or
doesn't happen for busy working parents
you can set up really useful alerts like
if you don't see the kids by 3:00 p.m.
when I'm away let me know Pinkney's the
dog walker doesn't arrive between 2:00
p.m. and 4:00 p.m. and if the dog jumps
on the kitchen table
let me know if you have parents
lighthouse could be a great way to
ensure that they're okay if your mother
usually comes down for breakfast by 7:00
a.m. you can set an alert so lighthouse
lets you know she deviates from this
which could be the fastest way to react
to any potential issues there's a lot
more to cut lighthouses current
capabilities and the company plans to
add further features based on feedback
from users once auto-ship in the next
couple of month will bring you a full
review once it's available but for now
check out the full post on android
