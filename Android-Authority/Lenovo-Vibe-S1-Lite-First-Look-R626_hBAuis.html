Authority what's going on everybody and
here we are with Lenovo at CES 2016
taking a look at their brand-new device
the Lenovo vibe s1 light and light is
definitely a way that you could describe
this particular device because at only
0.28 pounds this is actually a very
nimble device actually is really easy to
use Sochi from the left to right when
you're handling it in one hand and with
a 5-inch screen still at full HD
resolution it's an IPS display that
provides some pretty good colors and
definitely really good brightness as
well underneath the surface we have a
mediatek processor 1.3 gigahertz
octa-core and you also get 2 gigabytes
of RAM as well as 16 gigabytes of
on-board storage that can be bolstered
with a micro SD card that can be up to
32 gigabytes large going through the
interface however you can see that
lenovo is still sticking with one of
these interfaces that doesn't
necessarily have menu stock like Android
elements to it but that does make some
sense however because the vibe s1 light
is going to be available in markets
outside of the West so that is going to
be the trend as it has been for the vibe
series and we would love to see these
phones come stateside because we do
think that they are constructed quite
well have a very nice and sleek design
but also provide some pretty great
features at a really good price point
this one will be coming in at 199
dollars and will be available in the
spring one of the main features for this
phone however is a inclusion of a selfie
flash now we're going to open up the
camera right here we'll go ahead and
take a quick selfie there you go so we
have the flash right here on the top as
you can see and if I was going to take a
picture of just my camera right there
you'll see the flash go off now the
selfie flash is an inclusion that we saw
in the Motorola MOTO X of course and now
it's coming to the more budget-friendly
devices that Lenovo puts out however
this phone is not going to be coming
stateside it is only going to be
available in Pacific Asia and
unfortunately that's going to be the
trend as it has been with the vibe
series we would love to see some lenovo
vibe phones come to the United States
and also to Western markets because we
you think that they're constructed quite
well definitely very sleek and very easy
to use providing quite a few good
features for a very good price points in
this case the vibe s1 will be available
in January for the price of one hundred
and ninety nine dollars which is pretty
great to get a nice entry point into the
Android space with the inclusion of a
selfie flash if taking self-portraits is
really important for you and so that
should do it for the Lenovo vibe s1
light as we are taking a look at it here
at CES 2016 kicking it with Lenovo and
you can see even more from them when you
continue to watch our coverage of CES
2016 here at Android authority</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
