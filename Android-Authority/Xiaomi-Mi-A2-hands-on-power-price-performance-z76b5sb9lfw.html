how cheap can a good phone get well
Jamie for one seems intent on finding
out and its latest offerings in the
Android one program are pushing the
boundaries even further than last year's
wildly successful me a 1 this is the
jammie me a two hands on this year there
are to me a 2's the regular and a lite
version but don't let the name fool you
because there's a lot going on in the
lite version the main one misses out on
like a larger battery a headphone jack
and microSD expansion this is because
the me a2 Lite is based off the hardware
for the redmi 6 Pro which features all
those essentials the me a 2 on the other
hand is based on the me 6x which doesn't
instead the me a 2 delivers higher-end
optics in the camera for faster chipset
and more impressive top memory
configuration while the me a to light
aims to bring Android one right down to
Android goes doorstep with a 179 euro
starting price if you want to spend a
little bit more than you can enjoy the
different benefits of the me a too big
selling point here is the bump in camera
performance you've got a dual camera
experience with a primary 12 megapixel
sensor and a 20 megapixel sensor for
better low-light performance they share
aperture so the difference is what
Jeremy is calling super pixel a fancy
name for the familiar pixel winning
approach we've seen other OEMs take
where for adjacent pixels are combined
into one Jamie's trick is that it then
upscales the result back to a 20
megapixel image in portrait mode the me
a 2 will auto select the best camera for
the conditions but the rest of the time
you're going to have to toggle between
cameras manually
it's hardly hassled but if you don't
realize this seemingly insignificant
detail you'll always be shooting at 12
megapixels and getting worst low-light
shots then the 20 megapixel camera is
capable of the front-facing camera is
the same 20 megapixel sensor but at F
2.2 aperture instead of F 1.75 it also
supports 2 micron super pixels and comes
with front-facing HDR AI Beauty portrait
mode and a 45 hundred Kelvin selfie
light
on the meet a to light the secondary and
front-facing camera have five megapixel
sensors putting a clear split between
devices do you value photography and
performance or battery life expandable
memory and a headphone jack software is
stock standard Android 8.1 Oreo with a
promise of Android P as soon as it is
available there's only four non-google
apps here including a custom camera app
and a couple of new features in the
settings menu
perhaps the weirdest thing to get used
to if you're coming from the meet a one
is the back button is now on screen and
on the Left Google assistant Google Lenz
Google Play protect Oreo battery
optimizations and project travel are all
part of the package here not having to
worry about software at all means that
jammies hardware can really come to the
fore it also means multiple Android OS
upgrades and regular security patches
you'll miss out on a lot of what makes
Xiaomi Xiaomi in me UI but considering
the me a one made the top 10
best-selling smartphones globally in
February Android one clearly isn't that
much of a compromise for a lot of people
the display on the me a 2 has grown
since its predecessor at just under 6
inches it's full HD plus like the me a2
lights 5.8 4 inch IPS LCD but the light
variant has a notch while the regular
version does not there's only a mono
bottom firing speaker here so perhaps
more comprehensive audio support will be
next year's big feature request for the
me a3 you do get oreos audio codec
support if you're into wireless
headphones though I'd support 5 volt 2
amp fast charging but only the me a 2
gets USB type-c while the light version
sticks with microUSB again this is
partially due to their respective price
points but also based on the Chinese
originals upon which these phones are
based there's nothing wrong with using
an existing blueprint for a low cost
handset but it makes you realize just
how significant Xiaomi selection of
devices for future Android 1 phones will
be will be taking the meet a 2 out and
about to test its camera a little bit
more in the next few days so keep an eye
on Android Authority comm for that and
stay tuned for the fool me a 2 review as
always thank you so much for watching
make sure you do your thing here here
and here and I'll see you guys in the
next one because we are your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
