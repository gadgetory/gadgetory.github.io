Hindy from android authority calm and in
this quick video we're going to go over
some of the best deals for amazon prime
day if at any point you want to check
out any of these deals the links will be
in the video description below as
they're available it's worth noting that
this sale is for amazon prime users only

description below so you can get started
now we are an Android blog and that
means the best deals for us are of
course the android phones the first one
we'll talk about is the HTC One m9 and
this sale will be going on all day the
HTC One m9 has seen its share of
controversy but as an m9 owner I can
tell you that this is still a very solid
device it packs a snapdragon 810 octa
core 64 bit processor with 3 gigabytes
of ram a 5-inch screen a full metal
design and android 5.1 lollipop you'll
be able to pick this up for five hundred
forty four dollars and ninety-nine cents
which is sixteen percent off the listed
price of 650 bucks that's a fairly solid
deal for the one m9 next up is the
Huawei snap to this nifty little budget
phone already cost less than two hundred
dollars and comes packed with a 720p
screen LTE support for most gsm networks
a snapdragon 400 CPU and much much more
it's a great device if you need
something on the cheap and on amazon
prime day it'll be going for a hundred
and thirty nine dollars and ninety-nine
cents with a savings of twenty-two
percent off the list price last up is
the nexus 6 this is probably one of the
best Nexus phones ever released even
despite its gigantic size it comes
sporting the latest stable version of
Android with a beefy processor a 3200 20
milliamp hour battery and a gorgeous 6
inch screen usually this goes for about
five hundred dollars but on amazon prime
day you'll be able to get it for four
hundred bucks which is a really good
price okay so there gonna be other deals
that start and end throughout the course
the day that you can take advantage of
here are the ones that we thought were
pretty cool at the time of this
recording we actually can't reveal the
prices but we can't tell you what time
