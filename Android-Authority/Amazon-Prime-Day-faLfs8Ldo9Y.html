HTC One m9 has seen its share of
controversy but as an m9 owner I can

device it packs a snapdragon 810 octa
core 64 bit processor with 3 gigabytes
of ram a 5-inch screen a full metal
design and android 5.1 lollipop you'll
be able to pick this up for five hundred
forty four dollars and ninety-nine cents
which is sixteen percent off the listed
price of 650 bucks that's a fairly solid
deal for the one m9 next up is the
Huawei snap to this nifty little budget
phone already cost less than two hundred
dollars and comes packed with a 720p
screen LTE support for most gsm networks

it's a great device if you need
something on the cheap and on amazon
prime day it'll be going for a hundred
and thirty nine dollars and ninety-nine
cents with a savings of twenty-two
percent off the list price last up is
the nexus 6 this is probably one of the
best Nexus phones ever released even
despite its gigantic size it comes
sporting the latest stable version of
Android with a beefy processor a 3200 20
milliamp hour battery and a gorgeous 6
inch screen usually this goes for about
five hundred dollars but on amazon prime
day you'll be able to get it for four
hundred bucks which is a really good
price okay so there gonna be other deals
