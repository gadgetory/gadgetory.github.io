questions we've got answers it's a a Q&amp;amp;A
episode 3 4 jun 19 2013 Jimmy asked
which carriers will be getting the
galaxy s4 active well right now it looks
like AT&amp;amp;T will be the only carrier
carrying the galaxy s4 active that could
always change in the future but right
now there's a lot of talk about
exclusivity so I wouldn't bet on seeing
it elsewhere that said you never know
Kim says I'm a verizon customer and I'm
very unhappy with them why do they not
have the HTC One will they ever get it
while your anger may be justified fear
not verizon will indeed be getting the
HTC one right now it looks like the most
likely time that's going to happen is
July now nothing is concrete and that
could change in the future but right now
it looks like that's when it's going to
happen fingers crossed charne Charma
says I just saw on the news that Mark
Zuckerberg from facebook went to visit
Samsung in Korea will there be a samsung
facebook phone first things first I want
to say I hope not looking at the HTC
first Facebook is willing to go pretty
far to push its reputation but that said
Samsung likes to hang on to its brand
identity pretty tight still they like
money so with facebook wants this to
happen enough it just might oster says i
have an HTC One on t-mobile and was
wondering well unlocking my bootloader
void my warranty yes it will absolutely
void your warranty that's a big part of
why HTC sells the HTC one developer
edition you can have an unlocked
bootloader and still hang on to your
warranty if you're thinking about doing
this tread carefully Jacob says haaa hey
Jacob my first generation Nexus is
outdated and is slow and laggy I'm
planning to upgrade should I get the s4
or wait for the s5 well considering that
the s4 was released pretty recently
you're in for a long way if you do wait
for the s5 like 10 11 months at least
now you could wait if you wanted to but
I really don't
the point I think you'll be pretty happy
with the s4 and that's about it for this
