of the Galaxy s4 by now one with a more
rugged style and then another one that
was miniaturized but now we have the
version that is made for some super
instagramming hey it's Josh magar from
Android auto what's going on everybody
and this is the samsung galaxy s4 zoom
this is obviously a film geared towards
the photographer so we'll go through the
rest of the review fairly quickly as far
as design goes there is basically one
way to describe the s4 zoom it's the
most obvious mashup ever a mixture of
this and this the S which you're
essentially getting is a Galaxy s4 mini
molded to the back of a point-and-shoot
camera it's an interesting form factor
making a camera that can take phone
calls or a phone that has a beefed up
camera nonetheless having a general size
smaller than that of a five-inch screen
device is of course a good move for the
zoom the entire screen that ultimately
becomes the cameras viewfinder is easy
to handle on one hand at the bottom of
the screen is the classic Samsung button
layout once you come around the back
it's got the finger grip and larger lens
unit of the typical point-and-shoot that
lens unit pops out when you activate the
camera you get a complete button layout
on the side power volume rockers
dedicated camera button on the other
side a plug for the tripod mount is next
to a micro SD card slot there is
something I really don't like about this
form factor though as a phone you would
often lay your phone on its back but
with the s4 zoom it gets a little weird
under all that extra girth you can stand
a camera on its bottom like this but
with the s4 zoom not really as a phone
it's basically a much thicker s4 mini
even though the new elements on the back
might make it feel different you can get
a good grip on it but as a camera it
gets a little weird
the finger grip makes you think you can
hold it like a small DSLR or other point
shoot but then you could easily trigger
the button layout below the screen with
your thumb if you need to use one hand
you might find it a little difficult I
guess despite getting its camera beefed
up you'd have to generally handle the
or zoom with two hands the Super AMOLED
display on the s4 zoom is the same that
was found on the Mini 4.3 inches capable
of 960 by 540 resolution at 256 PPI
it may not be the sharpest display but
it still works well for a screen this
small for viewing just about anything be
prepared for the obviously smaller size
but for previewing pictures that you
have taken with the camera it's
definitely better than most
point-and-shoot screams a dual-core
cortex a9 clocked in at 1.5 gigahertz
it's backed by the Mali 400 and one and
a half gigabytes of RAM it's an adequate
package for the mid-range phone portion
of this device and is more than enough
to power the camera and to - scores are
obviously lower than most of the
competition but in practice it works
about as well as it should lag is fairly
minimal and loading the camera from
within Android is easy enough for what
this phone is supposed to perform
specifically performance is pretty much
where it should be obviously the camera
is the biggest portion of this hardware
section but it looks like Samsung made
that by design the micro SD card slot
helps bolster the eight gigabytes of
storage and then after that you don't
get much of what the other s4 variants
were given many of the sensors were left
out but you do get an IR blaster for
controlling TVs and related equipment
the way you put the battery into this
device did feel a little weird but this
23 30 milliamp power unit definitely
does its job for a device that has to
pull double duty the s4 zoom did a good
job for me as my go-to device for a
pretty long night out on the town by the
end of the night full of taking pictures
and taking calls I only killed half the
battery but more on that in a bit I'll
take care of the software portion before
the camera because you get what you
expect here the all-too-familiar
TouchWiz that makes the phone portion
feel much like the s4 mini without all
of the sensors you get the traditional
navigation experience with just a few
little enhancements for the phone it's
more of the same but for the camera it
just is more layers on top of what you
really need to get to and at 16
megapixels this camera certainly packs
more power than current top-tier
smartphones the larger lens unit means
the sensor is bigger and thus is able to
flood in more light more data and more
detail it also allows for a 10 times
zoom triggered either by the ring or the
on-screen buttons the app has been given
more controls for all of the new camera
power and retains all of the extra
functions originally introduced in the
s4 and then some the drama eraser and
best modes returned with scene modes
made specifically for various situations
like landscape or even waterfalls dual
recording is not here however the
addition of full manual controls helps
the photographer get just the kind of
shot they want but I found the controls
to be a little cumbersome as a
photographer I obviously prefer my dials
and reel buttons but the typical user of
this phone might just keep things on
auto anyway there is also the addition
of smart suggests which finds the best
three scene modes for what it perceives
to be the shot it is handy from when
you're unsure of what's best
I took my usual pictures for reviews and
from those shots it's easy to see that
this beefed up camera definitely holds
up you get a great level of detail in
well-lit shots and the three-point-one
aperture helps give pictures and
adequate depth of field you can see all
of that in this flower picture and in
this picture of dr. Oy
unfortunately even this souped up camera
still has the same limitations that most
other camera smartphones have to deal
with image stabilization leaves some to
be desired and ultimately the best way
to get awesome pictures is to get it
somehow on a tripod thankfully one of
the enhancements here is that tripod
mount but that's not all you want to see
because for a camera phone like this you
want to know how it helps the typical
smartphone shutterbug well I can think
of two instances that the last couple
photos already covered and that's broad
daylight and perhaps touristy photos
however I can think of two more right
now a night out and perhaps the
instagramming foodie luckily this past
weekend I was in Las Vegas where you can
get both of those done in one night
first initial impressions on taking this
phone out with me night out in the town
of let's say Las Vegas it's you're going
to be going out you're trying to get
dressed up like I am right now and
you're you're looking to look really
good but still have sort of a minimal
load in your pockets
because you know it gets in the way this
camera is definitely not good for that
so quick first impressions while I'm out
in Vegas with family for the weekend I'm
already not looking forward to using
this camera while we're out on the strip
trying to get through crowds of people
stuff like that I'm sure you can have a
phone and a camera and that is bulky but
at the same time even
this combination in your pocket feels a
little weird then a drink at my favorite
spots you can see here that low-light
shots are decent but a lack of lighting
makes the stabilization issue I
mentioned earlier even worse we ended up
at the Hakkasan Club here's a quick
video the super crowded action inside
now it should be fairly obvious that
nightclubs are far from ideal photo ops
you take a picture without flash you get
a light show you take a picture with
flash it looks like everyone is getting
high but in simple situations the flash
does come in handy and helps you get
good portrait pictures of your friends
now of course a night out in Vegas isn't
complete without some awesome late-night
food enter tacos El Gordo seriously
these are some of the best tacos you
will ever have sorry I'm about to
torture you a bit
this camera definitely excels at the
foodie pictures and you can see it here
get the focus just right and you'll have
a stylized photo of your food and good
lord those tacos were damn good
ultimately having a camera like this on
your phone does come in handy for
getting better than average shots
putting the two devices together can
pose a bit of an issue for overall
comfort though it doesn't feel as easy
in the pocket like a flat phone and then
there's the peculiar oversight of a
camera strap make sure you get one for
extra safety now there's the issue of
getting to the camera fast enough you
can set up the phone to activate
straight to the camera instead of the OS
or just use the lock screen widgets to
swipe over quickly but if none of this
is set you have to unlock find the
camera icon hit it and then let it load
when you really need to snap a photo
fast those extra seconds can really hurt
you can find the s4 zoom for around $500
unlocked at online retailers it's
unclear if it will ever make it to
carriers at least in the States since a
good point and shoot camera can cost
upwards of 300 or 400 dollars and an s4
mini comes in at four hundred and fifty
dollars unlocked I have to admit this is
a pretty good combo for that price and
so there yet the samsung galaxy s4 zoom
it is definitely a mashup or in this
case perhaps a jack-of-all-trades
because I really don't think that it
truly excels at any one function you
have to take a look at this device as a
whole package
the phone portion is as mid-range as it
gets but it does get the job done on the
other hand the camera is a very good
performer by cameraphone standards
beginners and amateur photographers will
enjoy having an enhanced camera but I
question whether it's worth the extra
girth and lowered phone specs especially
if the user already has a top-tier
device with a matching built-in camera
prosumers and photogra will probably
already have a good camera that the s4
zoom just won't be able to keep up with
I wouldn't use the s4 zoom as a daily
driver because of its somewhat awkward
form and of course I've already got my
own setup if you truly want your daily
smartphone camera adventures to get
enhanced but you do not want to lose
that phone part even just a little bit
then this device is probably the one for
you but somehow a part of me thinks
there aren't that many of you out there
