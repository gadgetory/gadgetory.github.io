name is Jace and we talk all things
Android in these parts and this past
week was really all about minis pluses
and compacts and the question remains
for those of you who are not phablet
fanatics can these manufacturers provide
us with flagship power in smaller
packages cuz come on people like me need
more one-handed lovin oh I should never
a set it that way yes that's right so
let's start off with the Samsung Galaxy
s5 mini it is official and as expected
it's sort of a neutered s5 packing a 4.5
inch HD AMOLED display the galaxy s5
mini is powered by a quad-core processor
spinning at one point 4 gigahertz along
with 1.5 gigabytes of ram 16 gigabytes
of storage expandable to six or four
gigs by the micro SD card slot the
device comes with 8 megapixel rear
facing camera 2.1 megapixel front facing
camera with a 2100 milliamp hour battery
all weighing in at 120 grams now to be
fair to Samsung the mini version still
does provide access to the ultra power
saving mode the kids mode and the
revised s health app does take advantage
of the heart rate monitor now for those
of you love the Moto X but wish it was
just a little bit bigger this rumor is
for you according to the rumor the
handset will offer a 2.26 Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 with 2 gigabytes RAM as
well as at 5.2 inch 1080p display it
will have a 12 megapixel rear camera 5
megapixel front facing camera 32
gigabytes of storage with a microSD card
slot twenty-nine hundred million power
battery and of course Bluetooth and NFC
now for those of you who are doubting
the expandable storage you should
remember that the moto g 4g LTE and the
Moto e did provide micro SD card slots
so that expandable storage is still
possible I am this close to calling it
the cold war between Android and iOS is
user interface display I think it's over
from the screenshots and first
impressions from Josh Android L looks
gorgeous one of the very nice features
of android l is the newly designed
notifications the notification will
float near the top of the screen and pop
up over any other application even in
full screen immersive mode now you
should know that Android L is not ready
for primetime just yet but you can
access a developer version there's
instructions on how to do so in the show
links below but the good news is is that
Android l's material keyboard is
available in the Google Play Store and
is stable you can download it i tried it
and it looks very good indeed now moving
on a good news about the sony xperia z
compact renowned xperia developer doom
Lord has been spilling the beans
regarding the Sony Xperia Z compact
according to the leak the slim down
flagship will come equipped with a 2.5
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 801
processor a 4.5 inch 720p display 2
gigabytes of ram a 20.7 megapixel rear
camera and a 2.1 megapixel front facing
camera now some of you may be thinking
Jace what's a 720p display doing on my
flagship device come on it's a 4.5 inch
display 720p is perfect and just in line
with the kind of battery life that most
of you want having 1080p and a 4.5 inch
display silly overkill ah clever don't
need tweezers though I got a tool that's
more powerful flavors gone now thanks
for watching android army my name is
Jace love to connect with you here on
google+ or twitter don't forget about my
brothers in andhra jobs joe in the tech
