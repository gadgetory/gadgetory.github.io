brought to you by the LG g3 especially
here in the States the LG g3 is finally
making it to the major carriers and also
on to store shelves so with the launch
impending we wanted to revisit the LG g3
and tell you everything that you need to
know about it hey it's Josh McCown for
management authority what's going on
everybody and this is what you need to
know about the LG g3 of course when
you're talking about the LG g3 you have
to talk about that quad HD display not
only does it come in at a 5.5 inch size
which makes it very accessible in terms
of playing video games and also for
videos and pictures you also are working
with a very high resolution display at
2560 by 1440 that means no matter what
you do on here when it comes to games or
videos or pictures or even text with the
high pixel density on here you're going
to have a very sharp display that will
give you everything you need in a very
attractive manner it's very easy on the
eyes and one of the most photogenic
screens that I've ever had the pleasure
of dealing with but of course that
screen would not be easy to use if the
entire device wasn't easy to handle in
the first place and on the LG g3 LG's
mastering of panels comes back again
with a small bezel that goes all around
this 5.5 inch screen when you're looking
at the front you basically just get a
huge screen and very little girth on the
top and bottom and even less on the
sides making this one of the easiest to
handle larger displays ever not only
does the 5.5 inch display usually mean
that you have to do some hand gymnastics
they are greatly minimized in the LG g3
but the design also lends itself to some
easy ergonomics when it comes to not
only the sides having no buttons because
that back button layout returns here
from the original g2 there is also a
slight curve on the back which is also
made up of a very durable plastic that
has a very attractive metallic feel of
this brushed metal on the back it just
gives it a wonderful look and provides
that subtle curve that makes this one of
the easier to handle larger devices
available in the market today
and underneath that hood you have a lot
of great power given the specifications
of the snapdragon 801 and the Adreno 330
with 3 gigabytes of RAM providing the
sheer power that you need to plow
through all of your videogames whether
they be the most intensive ones in the
play store or not and also to multitask
given the many tools that you have at
your disposal inside of the GUI the
specifications really make this one of
the most powerful phones out there and
the g3 definitely rocks this processing
package very well let's not forget
however that the back cover despite
having a very durable plastic feel and
also that attractive brushed metal look
is actually removable giving the g3 some
features that in the past were things
that we really wanted inside of our
smartphones especially the flagship ones
like a removable battery that can be
replaced with another unit if you need
that extra boost of power and also
expandable storage but that's enough
about the hardware let's go ahead and
jump into the software and talk about
the new GUI not only does it bring with
it a flatter look a much cleaner look
all around compared to previous
iterations it also hides a lot of the
elements that are easily accessible
still that used to clutter the operating
system in the past you also have various
smart capabilities like the smart notify
which brings you easy cards in a widget
on your homescreen to give you
information about missed calls or new
contact reminders or the weather you
also have the smart keyboard which
allows you to really cater the keyboard
to the experience of your liking
including the size of the keyboard and
how much it takes up the screen and then
finally the smart cleaning which allows
you to clean up the phone when it starts
to get kind of slow especially by
deleting and uninstalling the various
applications that you may not have used
in a long time but even now one of our
favorite features of the software in the
LG g3 was originally introduced in the
g2 and it's called the NOC code and has
been enhanced for the g3 to give you not
only the ability to turn on the screen
with a double tap on the turned off
screen but also the ability to create a
pattern code on a 2x2 square grid that
allows you to turn on the screen not
only from the prone position but also
when you unlock the phone you will be
able to do so using these taps the NOC
code is a great way of adding a little
bit more security to your LG g3 and it
is actually one of the more fun ways of
unlocking your device rather than just
these simple swipe over or any other
methods that are already there and
finally we make it over to one of my
favorite features of the LG g3 and that
has to be the camera on the back not
only do we have an enhanced camera with
is Plus that allows for even greater
stabilization on top of the hardware
stabilization you get software
stabilization you also have a new laser
focusing system and it's that little
area on the left of the camera optics
that shoots out lasers from from within
in order to see what the distances are
from all the subjects that you may be
capturing in your photo and it works
lightning-fast the camera itself is a
great performer enhance not only by the
focusing system but also by further
optimizations in the image quality so
you will be able to take a lot of great
pictures with the LG g3 and you'll be
able to do so very quickly because of
the laser focusing system and so there
you have it for this look at the LG g3
everything you need to know the g3 is
making it like I said already on to
store shelves and onto the major
carriers and it will allow you to enjoy
this phone if you're looking for an
upgrade or if you're going to be moving
to a new contract this might be one of
the better choices for you because it
provides quite a lot especially when you
consider that great quad HD display keep
it tuned here give us some thumbs up on
