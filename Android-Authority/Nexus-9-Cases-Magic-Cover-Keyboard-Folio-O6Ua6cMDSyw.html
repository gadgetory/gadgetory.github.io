Android authority and the Nexus 9 has
been out for a while now and Google has
always been really good with supporting
their devices with official accessories
so today we'll be taking a closer look
at two official accessories that you can
get for your Nexus 9 the magic cover and
the keyboard folio case first we're
gonna take a look at the magic cover
from the Nexus 9 and it's basically just
a flat rectangular piece of material
that attaches itself to both the front
and back side of the Nexus 9 via magnets
the cover also features sleep to wake
functionality to easily wake and put the
tablet to sleep just by opening and
closing the cover the magnets do a great
job of holding the cover in place but
one thing to note is the cover features
two different materials that adhere
differently to the screen one side has a
more grippy hard rubber like material
that holds itself to the screen a lot
better whereas the other side has a
softer more suede like material making
the cover more prone to sliding around
which could create issues with the cover
shifting out of place in situations like
carrying it in a book bag the cool thing
is the cover was designed to be like
origami so it features some pretty neat
tricks that you don't see from the
average smart cover you can fold the
cover into a stand and prop the Nexus 9
up at a steep angle that is perfect for
watching videos and movies or a much
shallower angle that is great for pretty
much anything else that you would
normally do on a tablet also if you
happen to have the cover on the back
it's naturally going to cover up the
camera but if you pull back the corner
flap it'll automatically fire up the
camera allowing you to quickly take a
photo which is a really nice touch next
up is the keyboard folio case in this
case serves not only as a means for
protecting your Nexus 9 but also gives
you a mechanical keyboard for increased
productivity the case itself feels great
the material on the outside is soft and
grippy making it really comfortable and
easy to hold on to and like the magic
cover it also latches on to the Nexus 9
with magnets while you will get a great
amount of protection with this case the
biggest reason why you would want to buy
it is for the physical keyboard for
easier typing the
keyboard pairs to the Nexus 9 via
Bluetooth which only takes a minute or
two but once you have it paired you are
ready to start typing the typing
experience is actually not too bad
there's no latency whatsoever when
typing and I used it quite a bit for
typing on Google Docs and responding to
instant messages it is a tad bit cramped
because you are dealing with a keyboard
made for a 9 inch display but otherwise
it's a solid experience the keys have a
nice amount of travel and there's a good
amount of separation between the keys
the keyboard also features some
extremely handy shortcuts like a
dedicated emoticon key and a search
button so you can conduct searches no
matter where you are within the OS some
other shortcuts include hitting Alt +
tab to open up overview or pressing
search and enter at the same time to
quickly take you back to your main home
screen you can also use the keyboard to
navigate around the OS if you'd like but
it's a rather slow process so you're
better off using the touchscreen for
everyday navigation the keyboard charges
by micro USB but according to Google
you're not going to have to charge it
all that often google claims that if you
only use it for two hours a day you will
get five months worth of battery life on
a single charge and so far it seems to
be living up to that claim I've only had
to charge the keyboard once so far and
that was when I initially took the
keyboard out of the box both the magic
cover and keyboard folio are available
now through Google Play with the magic
cover coming in at $39 it's available in
black limestone coral amethyst and mint
indigo the keyboard folio on the other
hand runs for a hundred and twenty nine
dollars and only comes in black the
prices are pretty hefty but that is
usually how it goes with official Nexus
accessories the magic cover is however a
very unique take on the traditional
smart cover and offers some nice
functionality while the keyboard folio
provides a great typing experience with
very respectable battery life so you are
paying for some very high quality and
reliable products if you choose to buy
them but there you have it guys for the
magic cover and the keyboard folio case
