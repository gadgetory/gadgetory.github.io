with Android authority and today we'll
be checking out xiaomi's latest flagship
smartphone the me 5 it's rocking a
Snapdragon 820 and it's relatively
inexpensive at around three hundred
dollars in China we've been using it for
the past couple of weeks and without any
further ado let's get started with our
full review the me fives design balance
is the best of previous flagship like
the 3d glass of the Mino with fresh
design aspects such as the physical home
button the curved Gorilla Glass for rear
angular metal frame and illusionary
basilis display combined to form a
recognizably flagship design and good
looks aren't the only thing that the me
5 has going for it as the phone is also
very comfortable and easy to hold in the
hand thanks to the glass rear and
gradual curves outside a forum details
like the me fives tactile power and
volume keys as well as its flush camera
optics are notably well implemented the
symmetrical bottom frame design is
visually pleasing in the IR blaster on
the top of the device is very nice for
controlling televisions and household
appliances unfortunately the glass pack
can have its drawbacks it's very
slippery on many soft surfaces and it
can be a fingerprint magnet especially
if you purchase the black model the me
5s one-handed usability is improved even
further by its relatively small 5.1 5
inch display while some are disappointed
that Xiaomi has gone with 1080p instead
of quad HD
we here at Android Authority are still
very happy to see 1080p especially at
this size 1080p panels are cheaper use
less power and the vast majority of
users won't be able to tell the
difference compared to quad HD anyway
besides it's not all about resolution
and Xiaomi has proven that with vibrant
and saturated colors deep blacks great
contrast and excellent viewing angles
sunlight readability was also very good
in our testing as was the adaptive
brightness feature regardless of the
variant you purchase you'll be getting a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 under the hood
which is one of the best ARM chips
currently available and that's very
apparent when using the v5 even for just
a minute
performance was very
even on our base model coupled with the
also very impressive Adreno 530 v5 I was
able to played every game we through
edit with ease call sounded excellent
for us on the v5 and colors also said
they heard us loud and clear and here
are the frequencies that the new five
supports do keep in mind that this is an
unlocked dual SIM device if you are in
the u.s. you'll be missing out on 4G LTE
but will be able to receive HSPA+ in all
areas when using AT&amp;amp;T and most areas
when using t-mobile xiaomi has embedded
a fingerprint reader within the physical
home button which is very accurate and
incredibly fast beating the Nexus 6p in
nearly all of our tests often times the
last screen is visible only for less
than about a tenth of a second if at all
although there are two speaker grilles
at the bottom of the device the left is
presumably a microphone as sound is only
emitted from the right grill the speaker
isn't bad it's definitely better than
the one found on the galaxy s7 in terms
of both volume and quality but its side
position and very minor distortion may
be disappointing Xiaomi did adapt the
USB type-c 1.0 standard with the me 5
which we were happy to see there's also
Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 onboard and
you can even get nearly 85% in nearly 30
minutes with a 3.0 charger unfortunately
the charger included in the box is only
quick charge 2.0 compliant battery life
was very impressive thanks to the 3000
milliamp hour high-density battery we
had no trouble giving the me 5 to lasts
through a full day of use and always
ended with very good screen on time
values comparable to those produced by
the galaxy s7 average users will have no
trouble using the nephi for a full day
and then some which is not always the
case with even higher end smartphones
the me fives 16 megapixel f 2.0 Sony
rear camera performed very well in ideal
conditions images came out sharp and
detailed with a good amount of dynamic
range the color reproduction is also
very pleasing with just the right amount
of saturation although there is an HDR
mode which works quite nicely we never
really felt the need to use it as the
default auto mode performs well enough
there's also a dual LED flash on
back which does help even out skin tones
the four axis optical image
stabilization does help quite a bit
in ensuring less motion blur but it
helps even more in low-light situations
unfortunately the camera does not do as
well in darker environments and we would
consider it mediocre relative to other
flagships digital noise is sadly present
and almost always noticeable and great
aspects during the day like great color
reproduction and detailed images are
unfortunately compromised that's not to
say it's terrible in low-light but it's
just not as impressive as the galaxy s7
or Nexus 6p the four megapixel app 2.0
front-facing camera also performed well
especially with its larger pixels size
the camera software is also what we
would expect from a flagship in terms of
quality with a variety of different
filters many different modes and control
over white balance focus exposure time
and ISO and manual mode if you're not
interested in tweaking all those
settings the auto mode is easy to use
and produces great results
the me5 is running Shaunie's custom
version of android mui more specifically
it's running new UI 7 / android 6.0
marshmallow well many have dismissed the
UI as being too similar to iOS few have
highlighted chummy's attention to detail
and the amount of customization me--why
offers throughout for example mui has a
respectable theme store allowing users
to change the look of the entire UI
there's also advanced features built-in
like call recording and scheduled
battery profile changes if you are
importing the device from China there's
a good chance that your device will come
pre-installed with bloatware and
possibly even malware so it's a good
idea to flash the global ROM in order to
return to stock me oh I with Google Apps
and services and the ability to receive
show Me's weekly updates however Xiaomi
has started blocking boot loaders and
some resellers have blocked updating
through the updater app so you'll have
to unlock the bootloader if you want to
avoid potential malware a process which
can take up to 10 days and remove some
features like xiaomi's find my device we
were also disappointed to find that many
of the features introduced in March
mellow and even lollipop are still
missing in new UI Google is now on tap
multi-user support and tabbed windows
for apps are ignore to be found at least
in me wise current iteration the Xiaomi
me 5 is now available within China you
want to buy from China that's great buy
from China in a few models starting at
1999 rum it be or about $310 each model
is available in either white black or
gold and comes with either 32 64 or 128
gigabytes of non expandable storage the
me 5 is an excellent phone it undercuts
the best smartphones in price but not
nearly as much in features although its
lack of u.s. availability and 4G LTE
support are a major hurdle for some it's
low light camera maybe somewhat
disappointing for a flagship and me I
could use a few updates there's a lot to
love about me 5 the b5 s design display
performance Hardware battery life camera
and software impressed us overall which
is astonishing at this price point
Xiaomi has yet again raised the bar for
what an affordable smartphone should be
which is why we strongly believe that
you should consider this is your next
smartphone if you are interested in
learning more about the Xiaomi me 5 we
have an even more comprehensive review
