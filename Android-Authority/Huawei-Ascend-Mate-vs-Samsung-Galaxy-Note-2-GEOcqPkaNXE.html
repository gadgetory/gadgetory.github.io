android authority at CES 2013 and we're
taking a first hands-on look at the
huawei ascend mate versus the Galaxy
Note 2 now I thought the Galaxy Note 2
was large device but it actually turning
out that devices are actually going to
get bigger so we have a 6.1 inch display
here with the resolution of 1280 by 720
it does feature one megapixel camera on
the front Galaxy Note 2 has a 1.9
megapixel they do feature the same
resolution but the display on the Galaxy
Note 2 is 5.5 inches versus 6.1 on the
ascend mate on the rear we have a both
feature an 8 megapixel camera just to
show you the difference in size
obviously quite more substantial
very similar in terms of width it's just
a little bit taller but going from 5.5
inches to 6.1 you can see the screens
are substantially bigger on the ascend
mate so the performance is probably
going to be comparable it does only
feature more gigs of RAM where's the
galaxy note 2 features two gigs
obviously I have a little bit of a
custom thing going on here with the nova
launcher it's always a launcher is
actually really really customizable as
we saw some of our videos we did indeed
for Berlin you can really make it look
however you like in terms of weight in
the hand you can see it as a very large
device it pretty much is going to
require two handed operation for most
things real web browsing and all that's
going to be a joy on this guy as our
watching movies but it has excellent
viewing angles on the images as you can
see I believe it probably corporate's
IPS technology the performance is a
little bit slower in the galaxy note 2
from my experience but just one show you
guys basically decide to size difference
we expect to see a lot more devices of
this stature coming soon in the future
so this is the first hands-on look of
the ascend mate versus the Galaxy Note 2
1.5 gigahertz quad-core 1 gig of ram 8
megapixel 4050 milla battery versus the
Galaxy Note 2's 3300 my lamp start
