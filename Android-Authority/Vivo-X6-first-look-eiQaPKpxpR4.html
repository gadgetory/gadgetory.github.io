ash here today I've got something cool
for you
so this is company called vivo you may
or may not have heard of them they
produced a bunch of smartphones and in
various pockets around the world
they're quite in demand so today I'm
here to show you the vivo x6 this is
their new flagship and this is a pretty
big deal for them why because they want
to make this international okay so the
box contains reading materials we'll
never really read along with the charger
microUSB cable and what's nice to have a
pair of headphones I'll let you know if
these are any good a nice addition we've
been seeing recently is the inclusion of
a case nice
so the phone itself is very reminiscent
of another well-known phone but it's not
all bad
it feels great it's pretty slim
measuring in at six point five six
millimeters it all feels very nice and
premium with its metal build buttons
feel good they're solid and this
capacitive buttons on the front so your
preference will either be for it or not
that displays a 5.2 inch 1080p Super
AMOLED panel from my initial usage is
actually very good and I have to say it
looks beautiful with viewing angles as a
match nothing wrong here alright guys so
it's about 5:00 a.m.
five hours sleep in this day day one now
technically so wanna go down to
the chemical in the breakfast it's done
pushing it all we have the MediaTek 6752
and they are an SLC company to watch in
the future I am sure in addition we have
all geeks around which you can really
notice it's a pleasure to use and
complements the overall processing power
so some of the features that make this
phone pretty cool is the fingerprint
sensor on the back and from my initial
usage it runs really well vivo claimed
noir point for seconds and I say this
definitely holds up its place in a
similar position to the Nexus 6p so if
you like that then you'll like this
another is increased charging speed so
the x6 contains two chips and dual path
charge circuits all in all this
basically means awesome quick charging
so less waiting around and when you have
a twenty four hundred million battery
this should be a good way to top-up so I
managed to top-up 40 percent of battery
within about 30 minutes of charge time
on the software side we have vivos fun
touch OS this is a really heavy skin so
this is going to be one of those make of
it what you will situations the life
seems to be very different in China as
is consumer behavior so this is a direct
reflection of that so there are no
Google services and to make up for that
there are a whole host of region
specific apps visually it's very very
similar to apples and very any the
software does have his touches though
there's a split-screen functionality you
can record screenshots with voice
recordings there's the ability to
program when the phone starts and shuts
down
very smart motion actions which affect
the screen lights unlocking and even
when you're in court a whole host of
cool stuff there's even dedicated
settings for DLNA USB OTG and VPNs
awesome stuff lastly we have a Neff 2.2
13 megapixel camera with phase detection
autofocus which vivo se is all super
fast and I have to agree this is true
pictures are a pleasure to take it it's
nice that you can use the fingerprint
sensor on the back as a shutter button
the software is nice to allowing manual
control over pictures so you're able to
do cool things like pull focus being
what it is I would have liked to see USB
type-c but it's not the end of the world
and the single speaker on the bottom is
typical or smartphone these days overall
you might think this phone isn't very
unique but the key thing here is
competition there's some nice stuff on
here from a
company definitely seems to know what
they're doing I'm excited to see where
they head with this you'll initially be
available in Southeast Asia or the price
starting roughly around $400 but this is
still yet to be confirmed if you think
of my important this here is some info
about what bands it works with and now
you know international version will be
coming soon and I'm told there will be a
whole host of updates and a few
surprises so it's worth to keep a look
out anyways guys thanks for checking out
this quick first impressions take it
easy and I'll see you soon
