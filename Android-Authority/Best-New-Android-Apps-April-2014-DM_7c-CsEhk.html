Hindy the android authority app guy
we're rolling into May which means it's
time to check a look back at all the
best applications released in april of
2014 first up is the amazing spider-man
2 out of gameloft it's your
stereotypical action adventure game that
features a superhero you play as
spider-man you take on both classic bad
guys and new ones the graphics are
pretty good and the gameplay is
enjoyable however it does cost 499 and
it also has in-app purchases people have
complained about it but if you don't
mind the admittedly greedy monetary
tactic it's not a path bad game holders
gate was one of the classic RPG
franchises of the late 90s and now it's
for Android it's a little pricey at 999
but I've seen a lot of people state that
they would fork out good money for a
console level game and this is a console
level game it's been reimagined for
mobile but all of the game mechanics
remain pretty much the same you can
relive the classic or get into the
franchise for the first time it does all
for in-app purchases but they're mostly
extras that do not affect gameplay
whatsoever if you're an RPG fan this is
definitely worth picking up chrome
remote desktop is an awesome application
if you like to interface with your PC
while you're on your Android device as
the name implies this app will let you
remotely control your desktop from your
Android device you'll of course need
Google Chrome on your computer and need
the companion chrome app in order to
make this work but as you can see from
the screenshots it does actually work
Domo icon pack hit the google play store
and people really seem to be enjoying it
so far it's a dollar ninety-nine and
rocks an impressive 4.8 rating in the
Google Play Store the demo icon pack
features 1700 icons a cloud-based
wallpaper gallery and the ability to
search icons based on category if you
have a custom launcher and you want to
try out some awesome icons these may be
for you farmville 2 country escape was
released worldwide on Android this last
month much like the Facebook game the
Android game has drawn either supreme
enjoyment or complete hatred and that's
cool games with this level of social
integration tend to make people angry
when they get unwanted invites from them
all day long that said the game is your
essential farmville experience you grow
things you craft things you expand your
farm and you can even transport goods
back and forth to the Facebook version
also it's free this month google added a
new member of their google apps to the
Play Store this month and it was
camera the simplistic camera hit the
Play Store to almost unanimous critical
acclaim the blur mode has been touted as
awesome and people who have devices
running 4.4 and up can enjoy the popular
photo styles like photosphere and
panorama it is a little simplistic and
some may not like it but is Google
fanatics will no doubt point out
simplicity is kind of the point it's
free in the google play store if you
want to check it out IFTTT or if this
then that is an application that allows
you to create connections using simple
if-then statements here's an example of
how this would work you can create a
function that states that if you
favorite something on Instagram then
that image would be saved on your Google
Drive this guy is practically the limit
with this application and it comes with
support for most of the most popular
applications this is a great app for
pretty much everybody and you should
definitely check it out impossible road
is a minimalist arcade game how
minimalist the background is white and I
actually didn't like that much but the
game itself is fairly fun you control a
ball that races down a road and you have
the option of jumping off the road at
any point to try to land further down
the road it's a dollar 99 and it has a
4.3 rating in the Google Play Store most
of the complaints mirror my own and that
the game's graphics are a tad too
simplistic but the game itself is still
fun and really that's all that matters
next up is Nitro nation a drag racing
game from the makers of the game drag
racing it features phenomenal graphics
in a fairly easy gameplay system people
have been complaining about the in-game
money mechanics as well as the
horsepower mechanics if you can get past
the bugs which developers are in the
middle of fixing the game itself can be
pretty fun and it is free earlier this
month the walking dead season one game
was released on android included are all
five episodes of the game along with the
dlc 400 days the first episode is free
but everything else must be acquired via
in-app purchases despite that the game
rocks a 4.5 rating in the Google Play
Store the graphics are phenomenal the
story is phenomenal and the gameplay is
guess what phenomenal if you're a
Walking Dead fan this is worth every
penny and it's a must-have game if you
were a fan of wind-up knight then
wind-up Knight to should be a familiar
face the game features a few of the same
ideas as the first one but also includes
enhanced graphics more gameplay elements
and a lot more the free version is a
demo and the paid version comes in the
form of an in-app purchase a few people
have reported some release day bugs and
issues here and there but updates are
slowly fixing these issue
is definitely worth a shot if you're
interested last on our list this month
is XCOM if the name sounds familiar it's
probably because you remember it as
being one of the best pc games of 2012
the price is a little steep at 999 but
there are no in-app purchases and the
game owns a 4.5 rating in the Google
Play Store I see comment stating that
they'd pay good money for a good game
and this would be good money spent on a
good game this is about as good as it
gets on the entire android platform so
you should definitely give it a look
