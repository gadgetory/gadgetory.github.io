at this point but we do have what could
be the dawn of the flexible display and
Samsung gets in trouble once again a
chart regard manager Authority what's
going on everybody and it's time for
another dose of the week's top Android
news it's android authority weekly we're
basically in the thick of it when it
comes to Nexus 5 rumors by now leaks
just keep getting onto the internet and
recently we got a picture of what looks
like the actual device itself a user in
the mac rumors forum claimed to have
held the new Nexus smartphone and
reported that it was smaller than the g2
and employs material very similar to the
nexus 7 he also said that in this pretty
build of the phone it starts up and
actually tells you to guard it like a
ninja so much for that after that we had
a leak of another kind when a build of
4.4 kitkat was discovered in the wild
naturally its information was scoured
and a log file included some more spec
information on the upcoming phone these
included the 5-inch 1080p display the
Snapdragon 800 and an 8 megapixel rear
facing camera the juicier findings in
the builds information came in the form
of references to image stabilization
although it may not be optical and some
new USB features that may support OTG
functionality as far as the actual
android 4.4 build was concerned many of
the apps included in it seemed to be
quite updated and some code suggests
that the core apps can and probably will
become part of the Play Store allowing
users with older phones to still be able
to update their core experience even if
they can't upgrade to the official
version of KitKat the final story
regarding the Nexus 5 deals with its
camera again more information was
scoured in a log file and it was
speculated that the nexus 5 might come
with a MEMS camera basically MEMS or a
micro electrical mechanical system is a
more sustainable physical build of a
smartphone camera that could add some
new functionality however our very own
Bogdan posits that we might be jumping
the gun here essentially the log file
reference is definitely for a sony made
sensor but it's not necessarily for the
actual MEMS build whose real production
doesn't actually start until
twenty fourteen and even then it's more
expensive to make and doesn't really fit
in line with the lower price point of
the Nexus line an image gallery focused
upon 4.4 kitkat has also made it online
showing not only what the new version of
Android will basically look like but it
even reveals a rather interesting Easter
Egg that shows it still identifying
itself as key lime pie the name was
likely kept internally actually
basically it retains a look very much
like jelly bean but brings a few design
changes and much smoother transitions
with performance tweaks one interesting
find however is that there is a new
official setting in there for printing
from your smartphone now none of these
findings are confirmed as per usual but
if you want to see any of these stories
and the gallery of android 4.4 kitkat
you can find links in the description
below of course one of the biggest
releases of the year happened this past
week and it is the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
check out my full review if you haven't
already and stay tuned for our
continuing coverage of it with
incredible specifications one of the
best screams we've ever seen and that s
pen it's for sure one hell of a beast
but it actually hasn't been the
smoothest release for samsung you may
have been hearing the words of region
lock being tossed around when talking
about the note 3 and unfortunately this
may be an issue that will be a thorn in
our size for quite a while originally it
was reported that the first sin used in
a brand new note 3 had to be from the
region it is associated with after that
however the sim lock is lifted however a
humongous threat over at XDA is flooded
with angry users reporting that this
isn't actually the case many users who
perform to this initial activation still
have trouble using foreign sim cards
calls into the Samsung customer service
area have been mixed at best with some
reps sticking with the initial
activation story and other stating
outright that the region lock stands no
matter what even if this is a measure to
prevent illegal importing it's clear how
much of a headache this is for many
people and it might continue to be if
Android 4.4 for Galaxy devices brings
this region locked to even more phones
it's a serious issue and we're going to
keep our eye on the developments as they
happen speaking of issues with Samsung
it seems that they have been caught once
again trying to
benchmarks much like what the galaxy s4
samsung was found to be making the note
3 fire on all cylinders when benchmark
apps are detected but this time around
it looks like improved GPU performance
and an altered display frame rate have
been added into the mix what is a little
interesting about all of this is that
one test ran the benchmark without these
boots and to be fair the note 3 still
performed pretty damn well does samsung
really need to game the system then well
the answer is apparently yes not only
because they want to get ahead in any
which way but because apparently
everyone wants to and integra veal to
that all but a small number of key
devices get this kind of optimization
for benchmarking now we know that gaming
benchmarks is a pretty common practice
especially in general computing but now
we know it's just as bad in the mobile
space as well speaking of messing with
the curve it looks like the next
smartphone craze is on the horizon
flexible displays are not a new idea but
they've yet to be implemented in an
actual device these screens would likely
be made of plastic and Samsung has
filled the beams that later this month
we will see a phone with a plastic based
display a Korean publication reported
that this device won't have the S Pen or
be a ruggedized phone perhaps it will be
a new line for samsung and this interval
from Samsung comes hot off the heels of
LG's own developments apparently LG is
also moving forward with their own
flexible display offering in a sixth
inch curved phone that is called the G
flex now don't get quite too excited the
phone itself isn't flexible but the
plastic screen bends to its curve aside
from this event the phone may not offer
much else that is revelatory but a
Japanese blog has reported that it will
be a top-tier device our final story
deals with security now we do hear the
words of malware or virus sometimes
tossed around along with Android but in
reality many of us don't really see
those problems so how safe is Android
really well Google wanted to answer
those questions itself their researchers
found that less than 0 point 0 0 1
percent of all app installations have
led to danger and any publicize
discoveries of malware have been grossly
exaggerated so to combat this trend
Google will share its own data and
findings whenever these reports appear
this information comes
a survey of 1.5 billion installations
made possible by the verify apps service
originally introduced in Android 4.2 yes
all this data may or may not be truly
accurate but now we know one thing if we
stick to the Play Store for abs keep
verify apps on and at least somewhat
read security warnings then we should
also be fine stay safe out there android
