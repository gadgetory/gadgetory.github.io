authority what's going on everybody and
this tent over on the right over here is
where we just came out of to watch the
first-ever Google Play Awards now in
2016 Google i/o 2016 they decided to
award ten applications that had
exemplary design for example or were the
best families app is another category
but we'll get into that in a little bit
now before I get into just sort of my
thoughts overall I was really curious
coming into this show that's the reason
why I really wanted to watch it because
I was just kind of curious but the first
thing I want to do is ask what your
thoughts were on the show yeah I wasn't
really sure what to expect with the show
cuz I didn't know if they're gonna if
this was something that they were taking
seriously or if it was just like for fun
but it definitely looked like it had a
seriousness to it they did crack a lot
of jokes as well but the awards seem
like a real serious thing where these
developers really wanted to win these
awards because they you know they spend
all these times creating all this time
creating these apps so it is nice
they're rewarding them with something
that actually means something so what's
pretty cool and again it was a lot of
fun very high-energy as well
it was high energy there are the whole
place was packed there was actually a
lot of people inside of this tent but
the reason why I thought it was gonna be
a little bit problematic is precisely
for what the reason that you just said
you're awarding specific apps when there
are so many out there so is that going
to create this sort of air of like oh I
want an award you know stuff like that
and then by the end of the show I was
like are they gonna do it are they gonna
do it sure enough there's a best app
award yeah I was waiting for the best
supporting app that didn't happen but
why don't we go ahead and go down the
list a lot of these applications I don't
know about you but I've never really
heard of them before yes same for me
like a lot of these apps even some of
the games I've never heard before but
like I said I'm I'm gonna definitely
download them and try them out for sure
for sure
the first category was standout indie
and that went to an app called alpha
bear which is a game and I've never
played that before I have I like alpha
they're basically you're on the grid and
there's a little bear there's a bunch of
them and there are different obstacles
you basically have to type out words
based upon the different letters that
are on the grid in order to make the
bear bigger like it what you wanna you
want to eliminate
the letters that are around the bear and
you make the biggest bear and you can
get a score with that secondly we have
best use of Google Play game services
and the winner for that was table tennis
touch I don't think I've ever played a
table tennis game on a phone actually be
that good I'm not entirely sure and I
don't really understand the category too
much to be honest but I don't know I
guess I'm willing to try it out using
all of the Google Play game services
like maybe the recording feature a bunch
of that again they did not really
explain this during the show so next up
we had best use of material design and
that went to an app called Robin Hood so
did you know what Robin Hood was I had
no idea what so apparently it's a stocks
app and one of our buddies who was at
the show watching it with us actually
said you know it's it is a stock gap and
it was pretty good it was nominated
twice actually which really makes me
want to try it yeah a few of the apps
were that's that's what makes me want to
tries on these apps as well because yeah
nominated a few times so all right what
else we got next up we have stand out
startup and that went to an app called
hopper I liked the idea of having a
startup be awarded for an app that
they've done really well because you
don't have a whole lot of workers in a
start-up it's a very small group and
that's what they showcased about it so
I'm sort of interested to see what
hopper might actually be like next app
is the best families app and this went
to think rolls too if I had a family
yeah I had a family you'd be a great app
I'd probably try it out if I kids rather
I should say kids yeah next the next
topic was or the next award rather is
most innovative and that went to New
York Times VR and I thought that pretty
much made sense because I've used it
I've never used it but the fact that
it's New York Times it's in virtual
reality it kind of makes sense okay yeah
name recognition yeah exactly
early adopter went to world around me
again another app that I've never heard
huh yeah same here and early adopter
that was another one that Kris Carlin
was saying why is it an early adopter
like what is it doing that it's supposed
to but you know what congratulations to
this and all the other nominees of
course but go for it the next award was
go global and that was Pokemon shuffle
mobile now the go global one they did
make a good point it's not just about
translating your apps
that other countries can't understand it
but from there it's just nice that you
know Pokemon guided Dragon Ball was in
that category which I played that game
that was really cool all right so the
next one is the best app and that went
to an app called house that's Hou Z Z
from what I can tell it's like a
Pinterest mainly for house for house
decorations interior design and stuff
like that we did hear that a couple of
people were like Oh house house does
seem like a good app that you should
have one now here's one that I think you
might have something to say about yeah
the final category the the final award
went was for best game and that went to
clash Royale now I have not played clash
Royale I play clash of clans a lot
I'm very addicted to clash of clans and
I've been very hesitant to try clash
Royale just because it looks like a very
silly game to me but at the same time
I've heard a few people say that it's
actually a really good game and now
that's not up now that it's won the best
game award here at the Google Play
Awards I feel like I'm obligated to try
it now so I guess I'm gonna download it
and see what all the hype is about I'll
see if I like it or not yeah see it's
really nice just to know that these
applications if you were happen to be at
the show or if you go on the Google Play
Store and chose the award the fact that
they want the award that's cool
that means that people won't think I've
maybe I should try this game out or this
app out so if any of these apps are ones
that you think were really great then
you can go in the comments below let us
know what you think of those apps let us
know what you think of the winners of
these apps and of course you probably
saw the clips of what we were seeing
inside of this tent right over to our
side but yeah overall kind of a good
show yeah it was a really good show and
the thing that I sort of took away from
it was I'm just gonna start exploring
more apps it's easy for us to think that
the apps that we use on the daily basis
are the best ones we could possibly use
yeah and I think a lot of people they
just sort of gravitate towards the most
popular apps but if you dig deep enough
you're gonna be able to find some really
great apps out there and that's sort of
what I've learned from going to the show
here today well you can let us know what
you think should have been nominated
some of these categories and you know
this is the first Google Play Awards
we're looking forward to the next one
probably we'll see what comes up in 2017
but until then you can keep it tuned to
Android thority for all of our coverage
