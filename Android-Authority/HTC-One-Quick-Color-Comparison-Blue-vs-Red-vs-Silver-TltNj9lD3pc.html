what's going on everybody and today we
wanted to visit the HTC booth here at
Aoife in Berlin and take another look at
the vivid blue version of the HTC one it
is the brand-new color of the aluminum
clad HTC one that many of us know and
love and I wanted to compare it to the
classic silver the Glacial silver rather
and see what differences there really
are now for the most part what we're
looking at here is just the aluminum
that's all around the phone has been
changed to this very very vivid blue
it's literally called vivid blue and it
has almost a neon color to it it's not
just aluminum with a paint job on it it
really does jump out at you when you see
it so looking at the backs here we have
very much largely the same elements we
also have the lining on the original one
which was a white hasn't been changed to
black so you can really see it pop out
the cameras are of course the same Beats
Audio logo on the bottom has been
changed so that it more fits with the
blue motif rather than the red and the
white that goes onto the silver if you
look over on the sides the white the
white spine has been or rather the white
casing around the phone has been changed
to a black as well so all of the linings
that were originally white on the silver
version have been turned black over on
the front you still have the boom sound
speakers and all the elements like I
keep saying are still there when you
look at the screens they are very much
the same experience having a black bezel
around the screen helps keep the screen
from clashing with the different colors
obviously so that obviously hosts
for the most part on the silver one you
get sort of a uniform look throughout
the entire phone even when you're using
it but on the blue one you still have
the great same the same gray display
quality only this time around you have
blue accents to your experience and also
we can't forget about the other version
that is available in the US only on
Sprint if I remember correctly and it is
this red
hot red really it's this red version of
the HTC One much like the vivid blue it
was given black accents as opposed to
the white that is on the silver version
of the HTC One but again it is the same
type of quality we're gonna just look at
the different elements it like I keep
saying these are still very attractive
phones and the black lining is really
just the main change here are the sides
or the white has been changed to black
on the spine
going through the elements here the same
great display quality this time with a
red accent so if red is your color this
might be the one for you so that's just
a quick look at the colors of the HTC
one and this one we're looking at the
vivid blue version as opposed to the
Glacial silver all in all these are
still very very attractive phones
personally I'm a big fan of the stealth
black but this vivid blue really does
call out to you when you see it it's
actually really really nice and very
very unique for all of you who want to
stand out from the crowd well as always
thank you very much for watching and
this has been Joshua Vergara from
