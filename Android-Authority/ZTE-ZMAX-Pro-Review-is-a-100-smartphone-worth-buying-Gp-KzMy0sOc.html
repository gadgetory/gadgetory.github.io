look around and you'll see several new
ones under $200 as for is sub $100
phones you might have a tougher time but
ZT believes that its new zmax pro is
going to be the benchmark to be the
first order of business with design is
its size something that's arguably going
to be the biggest deal breaker for
people this is a big phone
one that pushes it well into the phablet
category unless you have larger than
average hands you're going to be finding
yourself stretching your fingers a whole
lot besides that it has a pleasant
design that makes it look and feel that
it's priced higher you have a soft touch
matte finish with the rear combined with
a full metal vessel and this combo
pushes it beyond the context of being
cheaply made and that's a good thing
because normally you tend to find phones
in this price range to be poorly
constructed in just inferior with their
designs the phone slapped with a giant
six inch 1080p TFT LCD display with
Gorilla Glass 3 yeah it's nice that they
offered to go with 1080p resolution just
because we'd normally see 720p in other
phones it's official any detailed plus
there's a ton of real estate to work
with however it has an extremely cold
color temperature of eight thousand
Kelvin which makes whites appear bluish
in tone it's also not color accurate you
can see in the srgb color chart how it
misses the reference values for each
color like how magenta and teal are
heavily influenced by blue and despite
reaching a peak brightness output of 416
it's the display just seems to have a
washed-out tone now in my testing it's
obvious that the display here the ZTE
zmax pro isn't quite up to snuff to the
type of results we tend to see with some
of the higher priced smartphones out
there but then again are we surprised by
this it's no surprise that there's a
snapdragon 617 chip and to your bites a
ram in this this combo makes perfect
sense and it suffice with the basic
stuff but it's really not suited to do
things that are more intensive gaming in
particular where it exhibits too much
choppiness
to enjoy for hardcore
gamer's for $99 you get 32 gigabytes of
internal storage with expansion via its
microSD slot you also have the
fingerprint sensor in the back of the
phone it's an unexpected treat quite
honestly since its uncommon in
entry-level phones it works well and
adding that extra layer of security but
could also be programmed to open up an
app take a photo or even answer a phone
call there are three capacitive buttons
beneath the display unfortunately the
two dots flanking the home button can't
be programmed for anything else besides
acting as the back and recent apps
functions and finally we have the
speaker grille in the back
it emits a decent volume output but
there isn't much substance when
listening to music so for me the single
most underrated part about the handset
has to be the battery life there's a
3,500 milliamp hour battery cell in
there and I gotta say I'm impressed it
managed to get me at least two days of
normal juice from a full charge and got
to the beginning of a third day but by
then it was pretty much gone and the
recharge time is actually pretty good
for given its size now it's at 125
minutes with the new USB type-c
connection it's not the fastest but then
again it's not the slowest either for
its cameras the combo here with the ZTE
zmax Pro is a 13 megapixel rear camera
and a 5 megapixel front-facing one
there's nothing fanciful about them
seeing they're just as ordinary as any
other low-priced phone the camera app
has a decent mixture of modes and
options like its manual mode which
people will probably appreciate having
in a phone like this sadly there's
nothing spectacular about the
performances you tend to see a
noticeable level of over sharpening
which seems to try and compensate for
the rear camera software details capture
under low-light details become even more
speckle and the same can be said about
its video capture / sharpening is again
evident but this time videos tend to
appear underexposed and there's just too
much noise and muddy details to
recommend using Pyrrhus law that the
easy max Pro is mostly running a stock
experienced android 6.0.1 marshmallow to
be exact yes there's some bloggers from
MetroPCS but it's pretty straightforward
for the most part
users will probably feel that it won't
be up to snuff with their demands just
because you won't find any other
enhanced features here the biggest
question with the phone much like most
budget stuff is whether or not it will
get upgraded to next version of Android
in a timely manner phone calls are a
breeze with this one you have a loud
volume output with its earpiece and
speaker phone while voice is sound clear
and distinctive on the other end line to
our callers didn't have any problems
discerning our voices owning a cheap
phone no longer means you're getting a
cheap phone the $99 price tag of the ZTE
zmax pro is without a doubt an
aggressive move on its part especially
more given its phablet s stature and its
fingerprint sensor you tend to not
expect them in the phone in its price
range but that's the beauty about it
you do get them while pricing is quite
favorable here there are some other
factors that influence your decision to
buy first of all this is strictly a
metro pcs exclusive this is arguably a
factor that will be limiting its reach
to consumers and secondly there are
still some subpar qualities about it
like the inaccuracy is with display and
the offer of sharpening effects with its
cameras these are compromises that can
be overlooked due to its price point at
the end day it's a worthy recommendation
if you're on a tight budget so yeah it's
pretty crazy that we have phones now
with fingerprint sensors at under $100
