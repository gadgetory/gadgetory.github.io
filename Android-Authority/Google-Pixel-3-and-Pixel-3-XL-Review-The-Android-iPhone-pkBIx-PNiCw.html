authority and the pixel 3 and pixel 3 XL
are probably two of the most highly
anticipated smartphones of 2018 and a
lot of that probably had to do with the
heavy abundance of leaks which sort of
created a lot of hype for these two
phones and in this particular video I'm
going to primarily be focusing on the
pixel three XL because that's been my
daily driver for the past week but a lot
of the stuff that I say for the pixel 3
XL will still apply for the pixel 3
because they are both pretty similar and
whatever differences there are between
these two phones I will point those out
as we go along but I just want to start
off with just the raw numbers and raw
specs and get those out of the way so we
can get to the more interesting stuff
about the pixel 3 so inside there's a
snapdragon 845 processor and 4 gigabytes
of RAM
you also have either 64 or 828 gigabytes
of internal storage there is still no
headphone jack there wasn't one last
year and there wasn't one this year so
no real surprises there
and as far as general performance goes
these phones are very fast and fluid
nothing short of what I would have
expected from a pixel phone that's also
running stock Android and I feel like
the touch response on the pixel phones
are pretty much on par with the touch
response of an iPhone it definitely
feels way better to me than any other
flagship Android phone on the market
everything just feels instantaneous when
you're opening up an app or just simply
scrolling through a webpage it's just a
buttery smooth experience and it's great
the big question mark here is the four
gigabytes of RAM and with so many
smartphones out there nowadays shipping
with six and eight gigabytes of RAM Ford
just doesn't really sound like a whole
lot anymore but as of right now it holds
up just fine as the how it's gonna hold
up six months a year two years down the
road after multiple software updates
remains to be seen but I trust Google I
trust Google's software updates and the
pixel to excel has held up just fine
after a bunch of software updates so I
kind of assume the same thing is going
to
with the pixel 3xl but we'll just have
to wait and see as for the battery life
on the pixel 3xl it's been ok the most
amount of screen on time i've gotten so
far is around four and a half but it
typically hovers around the three to
three-and-a-half hour mark and if I'm
using this phone pretty normally I'm
just checking emails checking social
media texting maybe a couple YouTube
videos here and there I can get through
a full day perfectly fine but if I'm
really hammering down on this phone I'm
watching a lot of YouTube doing a lot of
gaming taking a lot of photos with the
camera I can barely eat out a full day
so I really wish the battery life was
better but unfortunately it's not on the
front of the pixel 3 and pixel 3 XL you
still have an OLED display just like
last year's model the pixel 3 has a 5.5
inch 1080p display and the pixel 3 XL
has a six point three inch 1440p display
and the OLED displays on this year's
pixel threes are leaps and bounds better
than last year's pixel twos you don't
get any sort of weird color shift and
these screens are vibrant and colorful
right out of the box they look fantastic
I do however wish that they were a
little bit brighter they seem a little
dim to me and they don't really get that
bright until you're around 75% or higher
but if you're hovering around the 50%
mark it seems really dim so that's my
only complaint with the screen but
overall it's a really good looking OLED
panel now obviously we can't talk about
the pixel 3 excels display without
talking about that knotch
yes it is a very big notch it's a notch
that only a mother could love if there
was a beauty contest for notches the
pixel 3 XL would not win but just like
any other smartphones that has a notch
you get used to it and I got used to it
pretty quickly it only took me basically
the first day to get used to this notch
and it doesn't really bother me anymore
but if you are completely anti not you
hate notches at all costs that's what
the pixel 3 is for the pixel 3 delivers
a close to bezel a screen experience
without having a knotch
but at least the knotch on the pixel 3xl
serves a purpose for how big it is it is
housing two front facing cameras and it
also houses one of the front facing
speakers the other one is on the bottom
chin and for having dual front-facing
speakers these speakers are not as
impressive as they seem on paper they
feel a little bit quiet to me especially
in comparison to other phones that i've
listened to that have front facing
speakers and they also lack a lot of
low-end punch the sound delivery is
really flat so it is pretty nice to have
that stereo sound but I wish the audio
was a little bit better one of my
favorite things about the pixel 3 XL is
the way that it looks and feels even
though it doesn't really look all that
different from last year's model
Google's made some pretty subtle changes
that makes this phone feel a little bit
nicer to hold so the sides are rounded
and tapered now so it feels thinner in
the hand even though it's actually not
it's exactly the same dimensions as
lasher's model and the other big change
here is the entire back panel is
completely made of glass but it still
has that familiar two-tone pixel look so
the bottom 3/4 is coated in this satin
like finish which accomplishes a couple
of things
one it gives the phone a lot more grip
and two it does a much better job of
hiding fingerprints and I'm honestly
amazed that nobody has thought of this
or done this before but it's definitely
something that more manufacturers should
do especially if they're going with a
glass back the other benefit to having
an all glass back is this enables
wireless charging so you can use any
wireless charger of your choice but if
you use Google's own wireless charger
the pixel stand this will actually turn
your phone into a Google home so you can
talk to Google assistant obviously and
you can also do other really cool things
like have it show you a slideshow of
photos that you've taken which i think
is pretty neat there's no real surprises
with the software on the pixel 3 and
pixel 3 XL it's running Android 9 Pi
which we're all pretty familiar with at
this point but if you want to learn more
about Android Pi we actually did a very
in-depth video on it so check that out
up here in a card or it'll be linked
down below in the description
but as Google likes to do they always
add in pixel specific features and one
of those features is the digital well
being which can show you different
statistics like how often you unlock
your phone how many notifications you
receive and also the amount of time that
you're spending within the apps that you
use you can also set app timers which is
in allotted amount of time that you're
allowed to spend within a specific app
so for example if you set an app timer
for 15 minutes for a snapchat you're
only allowed to spend 15 minutes on
snapchat per day and once you spend
those 15 minutes the app becomes paused
for the entirety of the day and this is
basically designed to give you better
control over the apps that you use in
your life the other big feature is the
screen call feature which you can use to
screen phone calls and it responds to
these calls using an AI voice and I've
used this feature a couple of times it
works really well as a deterrent for
random numbers or calls from scam likely
which I get calls from all the time
because scam likely likes to call me so
screen call is amazing for stuff like
that but I think it actually works a
little too well because every time that
I've used it the person that's on the
other end doesn't actually listen or
respond they just hang up immediately so
I guess that's kind of what you're
looking for but I think sometimes people
actually want to know who is on the
other end and so far nobody has actually
responded to the AI voice but hey it's a
cool feature it works and I think it's a
feature that a lot of people are really
gonna appreciate okay so it's the moment
you've all been waiting for the camera
one of the main reasons why I use the
pixel two so much as my daily driver
last year was because of how good the
camera was and the Google pixel threes
camera is just even better from top to
bottom this camera is amazing the camera
UI has been completely revamped it's now
a lot easier to navigate by just swiping
back and forth between the different moe
and some people might say it's a little
bit iOS like I say it's simple it's
intuitive and it works so I love it the
image quality is just as fantastic as
ever
Google's hdr+ image processing and their
color reproduction is just completely
unrivaled by anyone nobody's doing what
Google is doing right now
the dynamic range is amazing there's so
much detail in the highlights and the
shadows and this camera just performs
well in pretty much any lighting
situation whether it's daylight
nighttime low-light or really high
contrast situation with a lot of Sun
this camera can just perform really well
and pull out a really good image and
that just speaks volumes about Google's
image processing and their camera
software so I'm really impressed with
this camera and of course you also have
all the different new modes that they've
added I covered that in a separate video
so if you guys want to check that out
that'll again be linked up in a card or
down below in the description and
portrait mode is still just as good as
ever on both the front and the rear
cameras and on the front you now have
that wide of the lens which makes taking
group photos a lot easier and you also
just get more scenery into your shots so
your front-facing photos look a lot
better and the same way that the pixel 2
was basically the best camera for the
entire year I could see the pixel 3
doing the same thing again this year so
I want to wrap up this review a little
bit differently I want to lay out a list
of pros and cons and then also answer a
couple of questions I want to answer the
question of should you upgrade if you're
coming from a pixel 2 or pixel to excel
and should you buy this phone in general
if you're just looking for a phone to
upgrade to let's start with a list of
pros and cons and pros is the build
quality is really good the screen is
good as well
it has great performance a fantastic
camera its ip68 dust and water resistant
and it has wireless charging as for the
cons I don't think there's quite that
many cons the speakers definitely could
be better
especially for front-facing speakers at
least on the pixel 3xl the headphone
jack
doesn't have one so that could be a pro
or a con depending on if you care about
the headphone jack and battery life
could definitely be better as well now
should you upgrade to this phone if
you're coming from a pixel to or pixel
to excel I will have to say no because I
think a lot of the features on the pixel
3 and 3 XL are potentially going to be
ported to the pixel 2 through a software
update so I would sort of hang around
for that first and if that doesn't
happen then I would maybe consider
upgrading but otherwise I would just
wait for software updates and see if a
lot of the camera stuff and a lot of the
Android 9 stuff that is on the pixel
here come to the pixel 2 which I think
there's a pretty good chance of that
happening now what about if you're just
looking for a phone to upgrade to should
you buy this phone and I would say yes I
think it's totally worth the price some
people might consider the pixel 3 and
pixel 3 XL to be $8,000 smartphone I
personally don't consider it that
because this phone caps out at $1,000 it
doesn't start at $1000 and then goes
upwards from there this is not the
Galaxy Note 9 or the iPhone 10's the
pixel 3 starts at $7.99 and the pixel
3xl starts at 899 which i think is
pretty fair pricing and overall
generally pretty competitive to other
smart phones on the market but that's
just me and overall I think as a whole
package the camera the performance the
display the design everything this phone
is completely worth what it is that
you're paying but that's it for this
review I hope you guys enjoyed it if you
did give it a thumbs up subscribe down
below if you haven't already thanks for
watching and I will talk to you guys in
