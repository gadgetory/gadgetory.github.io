joe hindi from android authority comm
and welcome to our best paid apps of the
week for February 24th through March 2nd
our first step of the day is unity
launcher in case you haven't heard there
is new bun to OS and the works that can
be put on phones and tablets one of the
nifty features of Ubuntu OS is a side
bar that you can fling open at any time
to open apps quickly unity launcher
mimics this functionality you simply
swipe in from the left to open the
launcher once it's populated with your
favorite apps you can access them
anytime anywhere you can be in an app or
a phone call you just gotta slide it
open and select your apps it is very
helpful for people who switch apps often
and it's dead simple to use the only
real gripe is that it's a very simple
application and that sidebar is about
all the app can do so we gave it a 4 out
of 5 star rating next up is a game
called cars and guns this simplistic
racer is pretty straightforward you
start the game by buying a car then
racing that car through various levels
you get a higher place you make more
money and you buy new cars the controls
are equally simplistic as you can only
go forward and backward and you have to
turn buttons the controls are a little
hard to master as each car has their own
handling capabilities there are tight
turns to navigate an epic jumps to land
despite its simplicity it's deceptively
difficult as the name implies there will
also be shooting going on but it'll
mostly be at you
we gave cars and guns an overall value
of 3.5 out of 5 stars because it is a
very simple game and the graphics were a
little bland but if you're into racing
games and you could very well get your
money's worth
next up is second grade learning this is
a game that is meant for children so we
took that into consideration for this
part of the review although to be honest
the way people type on the Internet
these days some of them could use a
refresher in a few of these lessons the
game has a variety of easy to play
learning games that will test the
knowledge of children and dumb adults
everywhere you can learn grammar and
spelling some math skills punctuation
and a bunch of other things so if you've
got a kid around that age and they have
nothing else to do this is a good way to
reinforce some basic education concepts
overall we gave it 3 out of 5 stars
says it's geared for children adults
probably won't enjoy this game at all
also the minigames get boring after a
while since they are very repetitive
last on our list this week is slingshot
racer most racing games for Android are
pretty simple you hit the gas navigate
some turns try to keep to the inside
lane avoid gunfire where applicable and
take the prize now what if we added
something cool like slingshot mechanics
slingshot racer does just that instead
of the typical method for pressing a
button or tilting the phone to make
turns the game forces you to make turns
by tossing a line to a tower and then
you slingshot around corners it's
amazingly simple to play but pretty hard
to play well despite the simple
mechanics slingshot racer is very
addictive and people could lose hours of
their lives here in the end we gave it a
four out of five star rating
the graphics are passable but the game
mechanics make this a fun game to play
if you have a few minutes to kill once
