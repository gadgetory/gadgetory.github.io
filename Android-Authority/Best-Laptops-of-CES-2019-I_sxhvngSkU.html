covering the best laptops that we saw on
the show floor there's a ton of laptops
announced as he is every single year but
these are just the top few that we
wanted to highlight here first we're
kicking it off with the newly refreshed
Dell XPS 13 we see this every single
year but probably the best part about
this laptop this year is that they got
rid of bat nose hole camera that stares
up into your face every time now they've
made the camera module way smaller so
it's just in the top tiny little bezel
there and you won't even really notice
it it's still almost looks fullscreen
it's really awesome it's also got newly
refreshed Intel processors new gold and
rose gold exteriors and also a white
finish if you want that it's available
for eight hundred and ninety nine
dollars so go check it out next laptop
is the HP spectre x360 15 and this is
like a newer version of the spectre that
we saw last year the really cool thing
about this laptop it's got an AMOLED
display and it's also HDR capable there
aren't a lot of laptops that can really
tout that this year so this is gonna be
great for media it's got all the same
things to that the HP Spectre had last
year like the stylus and the fully
rotating display that basically turns it
into a tablet so that's really nice it's
also refreshed with the newest Intel
processors and you can get them with
GeForce GTX or Radeon processors
depending on what GPU company you want
to go to with so this lets up it will be
available in March for an unreleased
price they haven't really told us that
yet but we'll move on to the next one
alright next we've got the huawei mate
book 13 and we've saw the mate book 13
the last couple of years they've been
really nice every single years they're
very compact laptops that almost look
like mac books a little bit but this
laptop has refreshed Intel processors
it's got discreet graphics if you get
the i7 version and overall they're just
really nice lightweight chassis they're
gonna be available for 999 dollars on
January 29th through Amazon and Newegg
so grab it if you want it next we've got
the Acer predator Triton 900 in every
single year they make these predator
laptops that are just insane
starting off it's four thousand dollars
so you're probably not gonna buy it but
it's got a mechanical keyboard it's a
chunky beast and you can actually pull
the display forward over the keyboard so
it's a lot closer to your face it's more
like a traditional gaming experience
you've got this mechanical keyboard that
you set up your mouse there you've
basically got a desktop wherever you
want it but now you can actually flip it
so the screen is on the keyboard too so
it's more like a tablet I don't really
know why you'd want to use
when it's this giant beast but whatever
if you want this thing it's gonna be
available later again for $4,000 but
it's really exciting specs so move on to
the next laptop so next we've got the
Dell Alienware 51 M and this actually
won our best of show in laptops this
year at CES 2019 this is basically a
desktop that you place into a laptop
it's fully upgradable it's got the
newest core i9 processors from Intel
there's new discreet graphics from
Nvidia that is the 2000 series RT X
cards those are just insane and overall
it just looks really nice it feels
really nice it's got Tobi eye tracking
so it's really made for people that just
want the best overall experience and
that's gonna be available later this
year for two thousand five hundred and
forty nine dollars next up we've got the
msi gs70 5 stealth an msi is saying that
this is the thinnest and lightest 17
inch laptop with discreet RTX graphics
that you can get on the market right now
you get it with a twenty eighty a twenty
seventy or a twenty sixty GPU so you've
got a lot of options there it comes with
the latest Intel eighth generation
processors and it's got three SSDs and
it's actually got a little base you can
swap out the storage if you want to it's
very customizable it's gonna be
available later this year so that's just
a few of the laptops that are here at
CES 20 and there are always a ton of
laptops here every single year but if
