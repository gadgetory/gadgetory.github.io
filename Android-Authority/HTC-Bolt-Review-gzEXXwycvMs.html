with Android Authority and this is the
HTC bolt with a premium metal unibody
build large side champers and familiar
color options it's fair to say that the
HTC bolts is quite similar to its cousin
the HTC 10 at least on the outside this
is great though as we really like the
HTC x design and that opinion mostly
transfers over to the bolts design as
expected HTC has delivered yet another
solid well-built phone the large
champers provide a nice transition to
the flat sides and the tactile a
differentiated power button helps make
it more discoverable compared to the
volume keys the buttons are also
satisfyingly clicky just as they were on
the 10 there are some notable
differences though to the curved back
has been flattened removing a bit of the
ergonomic feel from the 10 that we've
come to love the phone doesn't seem as
slippery this time around though which
is important it has received a size
bumped to 5.5 inches from 5.2 inches on
the 10 the bolt also introduces what
many have been asking for a while now
water resistance with the IP 57
certification the phone can be submerged
and up to one meter of water for up to
30 minutes this should be enough to
protect the boat from minor accidents
although you won't want to intentionally
submerge the phone as HTC says that
liquid damage may not be covered under
warranty the navigation keys on the chin
of the phone are both illuminated and
placed in the standard layout the HOME
key will not a physical tactile button
it's sort of a large cutout in order to
double as a fast and accurate
fingerprint reader it's not the fastest
out there but it's faster than the
Galaxy a7 s reader which is to say it
does very well the HTC bolt features a
5.5 inch quad HD Super LCD 3 display
which is quite frankly wonderful it
seems to be slightly different than the
HTC 10 s display but it still offers
excellent contrast and nice colors while
not appearing oversaturated viewing
angles are good too although not
exceptional our biggest complaint is
with the maximum brightness well it's
good enough for into
youth it can seem dim when outside
especially in direct sunlight on a more
positive note the display is coated in
Corning Gorilla Glass 5 which offers
some of the best scratch protection
available today under the hood the HTC
bolt is being powered by three gigabytes
of RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 the
latter is definitely a head-scratcher as
this is a flagship smartphone and the
810 is now a two-year old processor with
the 810 you'll be missing out on better
performance or efficiency and fewer heat
issues that are offered by the
Snapdragon 820 and a 21 so why did HTC
go with the 10 well we've heard that HTC
was forced to compromise as the newer
processors were not certified to Sport
Sprint's LTE Plus Network during
development which is ultimately the core
purpose of this phone despite the older
processor day-to-day performance is
absolutely fine which can be partially
credited to the many disabled system
animations which make the experience
feel a tad snappier than stock Android
the problems with the 820 instead live
primarily with heat output as we found
the book to heat up easily especially
while charging as you may already know
the HTC bolt is exclusive to sprint so
you won't be able to use it with any
other carrier if you are in sprint
though the HTC bolt has a unique selling
point
support for Sprint's new LTE Plus
network which touts much faster data
speeds
unfortunately LTE plus just isn't that
accessible at the moment for example
sprint offers zero LTE Plus coverage
within a 75-mile radius of our testing
area what's worse is that even in a
small but considerable city of 15,000
people normal LTE is spotty and where it
does work it's limited to around 2 to 3
megabits per second this is comically
bad compared to the speeds of above 100
megabits per second we've seen from
Verizon's LTE Advanced Network which is
widely available in the same city
now obviously Sprint's network is an
HTC's problem but since this phone is
only available on Sprint these issues do
inevitably come with the phone moving on
to storage the HTC bolt includes 32
gigabytes out of the box but that can be
expanded via a microSD card using the
second tray on the left side of the
phone unfortunately HTC's boomsound has
gone by the wayside here and we're left
with an average sounding side firing
speaker it's definitely better than the
galaxy s7 speaker but it's a bit
disappointing compared to the HTC a tons
higher quality speaker setup for most
users though it's volume and low
distortion will be good enough when it
comes to external audio however the bolt
is riddled with compromise although it's
using the same excellent 24-bit deck as
the HTC 10 there's no 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack so the bolt instead
relies on the USB type-c charging port
for Wired audio to clarify this in
particular isn't inherently bad given
that it's the way of the future the
problems begin with how HTC has set this
up for people who are still making the
transition to USB type-c audio which is
virtually everyone check out our written
review linked below for the full details
but the main points are that there isn't
an adapter in the Box third-party
adapters won't work HTC is only offering
a free adapter for those who purchase
the phone before January 31st and HTC
isn't selling adapters now to be fair
the bolt does come with some pretty nice
earbuds in the box they even work with
the phone software boom sound adaptive
audio which
used to adjust audio levels based on
scans of your ears and the surrounding
environment this feature actually works
quite well and results in noticeably
better audio the bolts includes a 3,200
milliamp hour battery and although
that's 200 milliamp hours more than
HTC tens battery our real-world battery
tests delivered some disappointing
results getting through a full day was a
challenge even while averaging just 2
hours and 40 minutes of screen on time
however it's worth mentioning that our
tests were conducted with a port network
signal which may have negatively
impacted our results well you might be
able to get more usage in an area with
better coverage we wouldn't count on
more than a full day with three and a
half hours of screen on time
unfortunately the both quick charge 2.0
wasn't so quick in our testing in 30
minutes the phone went from zero to
about 25 percent which is well below
average especially at this price the HTC
bolts rear camera is a 16 megapixel F
2.0 shooter with optical image
stabilization and it delivers images
similar in quality to those produced by
the HTC 10 that is to say the camera is
very good despite not beating out the
galaxy s7 pictures are plenty sharp near
the center and a bit soft near the
corners but that's not very noticeable
the colours are pleasing and most of the
images showcase great dynamic range
there also isn't too much saturation
which can't be said for the Galaxy s7 s
photos in darker environments the bolt
still does reasonably well images are
expectedly more grainy less punchy and
softer but you can still get some really
nice shots even when you're working with
less than ideal lighting the bolts
front-facing camera performs even better
relative to competing options it's an 8
megapixel F 2.4 camera and it delivers
excellent results which will please
anyone wishing to capture high-quality
selfies for video the bull can do up to
4k at 30 P and as you can see video
looks pretty good and that's the case
for software - at least for HTC's
contributions we're looking at HTC's
familiar Sense UI with great features
like blink feed and themes as well as a
number of tasteful
tweeks HTC has had lots of time to hone
their software experience so it's no
surprise that their expertise is almost
palpable when using the bolts although
some will still cry for sake Android
this is certainly one of the lighter and
more polished Android skins that we've
had the pleasure of using oh and it's
running Android 7.0 new get out of the
box which is the latest version of
Android from Google we expect that HTC
will continue to deliver OS and security
updates to this phone for the
foreseeable future once again however
HTC's efforts are brought down heavily
by Sprint
our review unit arrived with more than
30 individual bloatware apps which
required two separate folders to
showcase more than half of these apps
cannot be uninstalled which can be very
frustrating to the end-user add on
random and intrusive sprint pop-ups
trying to upsell unnecessary services
like VPN and you have an experience yet
again compromised by Sprint
the HTC bolt is available in both
gunmetal and glacial solar and Sprint
for a base price of $600 with 24 month
financing available at $25 per month for
those with good credit we do expect that
this phone will go on sale frequently
though so if you're interested in
purchasing one you'll want to keep an
eye out for those sales
unfortunately the HTC bolt is perhaps
the most compromised smartphone that
we've recently reviewed we like its
design display and camera but it simply
has too many small issues for $600 price
tag for us to make even a conditional
recommendation this is the day and age
of phones like the ZTE axon 7 + 1 + 3 T
which cost almost half as much as the
bolt and offer much better experiences
if you're determined to stay with Sprint
however we recommend waiting for either
the HTC 11 or samsung galaxy s 8 which
should be released with LTE + support
within the next few months
if LTE Plus isn't important to you and
you need a phone now you can't go wrong
with the better overall and even
slightly cheaper HTC 10 thank you so
