smartphone cameras have become
increasingly more important especially
with social media apps like Instagram
snapchat and selfies becoming a thing
and ultimately picture quality is always
going to be the most important thing
when it comes to smartphone cameras but
what's really gonna differentiate one
smartphone camera from the next are the
features and the LGB 30 and the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 are arguably two of the
best smartphone cameras on Android right
now but what exactly do they provide in
terms of features let's put these two
side-by-side and see exactly how they
stack up so I figured the easiest way to
approach this video is to break things
down into three categories we'll start
off with the raw specs of each camera
which is pretty simple and
straightforward then we'll dive into the
camera features and then cap things off
with the video features which is where I
think things start to really get
interesting between these two cameras
now as far as picture quality we'll save
that for another video when we have a
final production unit of the LGV 30 so
make sure to subscribe if you aren't
already and hit that notification bell
so you don't miss out on that video when
it goes live starting off with the specs
of these two cameras you have dual
camera systems on both the LGV 30 and
the Galaxy Note 8 but on the B 30 you
have a 16 megapixel main sensor at F 1.6
with optical image stabilization and the
secondary sensor is a wide-angle lens at
13 megapixels and
F 1.9 with no optical image
stabilization but doesn't really need it
because it's such a wide angle and the
focus is set to infinity over on the
Galaxy Note 8 you have two 12 megapixel
sensors the main sensor is F 1.7 and the
secondary sensor is F 2.4 and it's also
a telephoto lens giving you 2 X optical
zoom and they both feature optical image
stabilization camera features can
sometimes be underrated and while
picture quality will always be the
number one most important aspect of a
camera
it's the features that differentiate
these cameras and make them a lot more
fun to use starting with the LG v 30
when you open the camera app all the
cameras shooting modes are under the
mode button which you can find at the
top of the viewfinder next to the
Settings button or on the left of your
whole
the phone in landscape there are quite a
lot of modes here which can look a
little overwhelming at first but it's
really not as bad as you might think
because many of these are fairly
self-explanatory or have been on android
for an extremely long time that you
probably already know what they are you
have your standard auto mode of course
which is the default and most commonly
used mode for a good majority of people
and then to the right of that you have
the manual mode for photos that gives
you control over everything like white
balance exposure ISO shutter speed and
has built-in focus speaking to make it
easier to tell when things are in focus
there's other typical modes as well
which we won't really go to in depth
with since they can be found on pretty
much every Android phone such as slow
motion time-lapse panorama and 360
degree panorama which is the same thing
as a normal panorama but it takes a
spherical image that will show you
everything in front of you behind you
and above and below you you'll also find
a food mode which is specifically
designed for taking images of food but
it doesn't really seem to do all that
much aside from giving you the ability
to adjust the white balance if you're
familiar with the LG g 6s camera there's
four modes baked into the V 30s camera
that you might recognize right off the
bat you have snapshot mat shot
grid shot and guide shot the only
difference here is that they're a lot
easier to get to on the V 30 whereas on
the LG g6 the process of finding these
modes were a little more convoluted but
otherwise the modes are exactly the same
and pretty simple to use snap shot lets
you take a photo and instantly see the
preview on the bottom half of the
viewfinder with mesh shot you can take
two photos simultaneously or one at a
time which the camera will then stitch
together and this can be done with a
combination of both rear cameras one
front facing and one rear camera or
front facing on both grid shot is
basically a super quick and easy way to
make a collage of four photos for short
three second clips or a mixture of the
two finally with guide shot that's let
you use an image as a guide to make it
easier to take another photo with the
exact same composition and framing the
nice thing about all of these modes is
that all the photos are taken as a
where so they are instantly ready for
apps like Instagram the last couple of
modes that LG offers here are snap movie
and pop out with snap movie tapping the
record button will record a three-second
clip and holding down the record button
will let you record up to a minute of
footage so this essentially is for those
situations where you just want to record
something quick and short and this mode
makes it really easy to do pop-out mode
on the other hand is a pretty cool mode
that lets you add a few different
effects like fisheye black and white
vignetting or lens blur to the outer
edge of the photo to make everything in
the center of the frame really stand out
you can also change the shape of the
frame to a circle or hexagon and mix and
match the effects giving you a decent
amount of flexibility with this mode
other features that you get with this
camera are a bunch of predefined filters
that let you change the look of your
photo before you take it but the feature
that I really like the most is the
camera roll toggle that allows you to
see a preview of all the photos that
you've taken without having to jump into
the gallery moving over to the Galaxy
Note 8 the note 8 offers a lot of the
same camera features as the V 30 but
there are some features that the note 8
has that you won't find on the V 30
swiping in from the left will get you to
all the cameras different shooting modes
like Auto Pro which is Samsung's version
of manual mode panorama slow-motion
hyperlapse which is the same thing as a
time-lapse and just like the V 30 the
note 8 also has a food mode there's also
virtual shot which isn't necessarily new
it's been on Samsung's camera for a
while now but unless you capture a 360
degree image of an object by circling
around it and then you can later view it
by tilting the phone left or right or
panning around it with your finger the
notates camera has its own set of camera
filters which you can get to by swiping
in from the right and you get a much
bigger variety of them whereas with a V
30 the options are pretty limited
the notates camera also lets you
customize the photos with different
stickers to add a little bit more
personalization and if you're big fan of
snapchat you'll love these snapchat s
filters that's built right into the
camera the newest feature to Samsung's
camera is the live focus mode that's
made possible by the no H dual cameras
with live focus you can take photos with
a background blur
or get the fact but the difference
between Samsung's take and other phones
that have a similar feature is that you
can adjust the background blur before
you take the photo and after the fact
the light focus mode also allows for
dual capture which means you can take a
photo from both the main lens and the
telephoto lens simultaneously every time
you take a live focus photo so as far as
camera features and shooting modes these
two cameras actually stack up pretty
well but what really separates them are
what they're able to do with video
especially in the case of the LGB 30 the
big highlight to the V 30 is its ability
to shoot log footage LG is dubbing it
sinha log and if you shot with a DSLR or
a mirrorless camera you may already know
what log is but in a nutshell that's
lets you shoot a completely flat image
for more flexibility in post and log
footage has better dynamic range giving
you more detail in the shadows and
highlights if you don't want to mess
with color grading and color correcting
or any sort of post-production LG offers
a more simple shooting mode called sinha
video that offers a variety of color
grading presets which makes it really
easy to give your footage a certain type
of appearance directly in camera another
feature that's really cool what's in a
video is the point zoom feature so with
most smartphone cameras if you want to
zoom in you can only do it along the
center of the frame but with point zoom
you can zoom in on any area that you
select making it really easy to put
emphasis or draw attention to a
particular subject on the galaxy note a
video recording isn't quite as
impressive but there isn't any phone
right now that can really stack up to
the V 30s video recording capabilities
there's no option for recording in log
or any built-in color grading presets
but the note 8 does offer manual
controls for recording video and the
ability to shoot in 4k so you do still
have a nice set of recording options
even if the note 8 doesn't put a direct
emphasis on video as the b30 does so
that wraps up this camera features
comparison between the LG v 30 and the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 would you rather
have the live focusing capabilities and
these snapchat s filters of the note 8
or would you rather have the video
recording capabilities of the LGV 30 and
which one do you think is the better
camera overall in terms of features let
