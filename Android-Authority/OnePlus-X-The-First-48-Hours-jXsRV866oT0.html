affordable but it might be their most
compelling it's Josh of regard from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and here are the first 48
hours that I've had with the oneplus X
now as the name implies of course we
have had the oneplus X for a couple of
days now and that of course started with
the unboxing now the unboxing was mostly
a conventional affair but you do get a
microUSB cable in the flat red design
that oneplus has sort of popularized
since the oneplus 2 and it does look
really great again this is a microUSB
charging cable so you're not getting USB
type-c here you also get the plug
adapter but one nice addition that was
in here was a lightweight plastic case
that adds a little bit of protection but
once we get into the actual design and
we actually held the phone we thought we
don't really need this case on there and
for a phone that's supposed to be so
affordable we actually think that the
oneplus X is feeling pretty premium it
definitely looks very premium with the
metal chassis that then puts together
the two glass panels now a number of
people have already said that this might
look like an iPhone 4 to them but we
tend to think it looks a little bit more
like a Sony Xperia but at least one plus
has really been trying to put some of
their own design cues into this device
and that starts off with the metal sides
that have a bunch of micro cuts in them
now this seems a little bit simple but
we do think that it helps with the
handling because you get a real tactile
feel on the sides there but the main
thing about this device is its size with
a 5-inch screen this is definitely one
of the easier to handle devices in one
hand
now we haven't really had any shortage
of small devices this year but we
definitely have had a lot of bigger ones
and it's nice to see that in their
second offering in 2015 the oneplus X it
sticks to the smaller size category now
you're going to notice that I don't have
any soft keys on right now even though
in the oxygen OS it does allow you to
turn them on but there are capacitive
keys way down on the bottom there and
they're actually kind of close to the
edge there you do have to reach down
pretty far at least it doesn't seem so
symmetrical at least when you're doing
it that you have to reach so far down
near the edge in order to trigger those
buttons but that being said the
responsiveness of them has not been an
issue at all it's just kind of
interesting that when you have to reach
all the way down and basically let your
finger slide off the phone that's how
you have to get to the capacitive keys
the display is full HD
amoled construction which is nice
because the oxygen OS starts off in the
dark mode is on by default which means
that the AMOLED display should be able
to provide some better battery life
because it doesn't have to have all the
pixels on at all times in the dark mode
what you get in the inside of the
oneplus X might seem really familiar if
you had a oneplus one from last year
then the performance aspect would be
very similar except you have a bumped up
ram capacity with one more gigabyte in
there
so really the Snapdragon 801 should be
able to perform still pretty well on
here and oneplus told us at their event
that the 801 in their testing still
performed better than the more recently
released Snapdragon 617 and thus far we
don't think there is any problem with
that statement as we've had a pretty
reliable time in the last couple of days
of thus far but of course we're going to
put more heavy usage on here and we'll
let you know how that goes hardware is a
bit of a mishmash from the previous two
oneplus devices and the reason why is
because a number of features that came
on the oneplus 2 are not really here on
the oneplus X which may be totally fine
but one of them that does come is this
alert slider on the side which is nice
that you don't have to actually turn on
the phone in order to mute it let's say
but you can always have it in the
typical sense you can do all none or the
prioritize notifications to come through
using that slider the features that
don't come from the oneplus two are the
fingerprint reader and to the USB type-c
port now the one thing about this
microUSB cable port right here which is
more conventional and it should be
better for everyone who still has a
bunch of cables is that in my testing it
doesn't seem there's any fast charging
on here which is a bit of a bummer but
the main feature that I know a lot of
people are going to love about the
oneplus X that wasn't even in the
original to oneplus devices is the fact
that you can expand the storage now this
particular phone that I have in my hand
has 16 gigabytes for usage but when you
pop out that dual SIM tray that feature
does return one of those trays can be
used for a microSD card instead so it's
great that you can add in extra storage
on here where a lot of other phones tend
to not have this feature and in camera
listed as 12 point 4 megapixels in the
settings at least we have taken a few
pictures from this camera and we are
going to show you them here but of
course we're going to have our opinions
for our full review that's said however
the camera app inside of the oneplus X
is very similar to the one in the 1+2
which allows you to change the modes by
swiping in the viewfinder but that
provides one little issue the thing is
when you are in landscape mode trying to
take a picture in you're swiping up and
down from the different modes when you
get to the panorama it reorient eighths
to portrait mode which is a little bit
disorienting I have to say it's not that
big of a deal and it's actually nice
that panorama is down at the bottom of
that list and finally in software we
have the oxygen OS which is very
familiar from the oneplus 2 all of the
same features do return here and there's
not really anything that new but we will
say that in the initial setup you do
have the option to not only turn on the
shelf but the dark mode is enabled by
default and like we mentioned already
before in the display section that's a
really good choice to have for an AMOLED
screen so battery life should be kind of
good but ultimately you still get a
really stock like Android experience on
here with all of the same elements that
you can pretty much expect and of course
because this is lollipop we still have
those elements from here and marshmallow
should be coming pretty soon but really
if you had the oneplus 2 and you have
oxygen OS even on a one plus one if you
updated it this is actually very
familiar for you but of course as you
probably know by now from our original
first look the best part about the
oneplus X is its price two hundred and
fifty dollars of course with an invite
at least for the first month and a
little bit after that will get you a
phone that so far seems pretty premium
in its look feel and it actually
provides some features that other
flagships haven't been able to like
expandable storage now of course we're
going to reserve our opinions for the
full review on things like the battery
and the camera quality but ultimately
right now we do already like what we see
in the oneplus X so you can stay tuned
for our full review coming very soon
