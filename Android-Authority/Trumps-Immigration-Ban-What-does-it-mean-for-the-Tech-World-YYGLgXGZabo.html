the past 72 hours someone trying to give
a truly non-partisan take on Trump
immigration band and how it affects the
tech sector because it's potentially big
so some rules for myself no Trump
bashing no left bashing no bashing at
all I can criticize some policy so with
that being said here we go last Friday
President Trump issued an executive
order indefinitely barring Syrian
refugees from entering the United States
suspended all refugee admissions for 120
days and block citizens of seven
muslim-majority countries namely Iran
Iraq Libya Somalia Sudan Syria and
gaiman now the White House has stated
that this was an attempt to protect
Americans from terrorists trying to
enter the country and harm American
people but this does raise the question
as to why there wasn't a similar ban
from countries like Saudi Arabia and
Egypt the countries where terrorists
have come from in the past almost all
the terrorists from 9-11 came from those
two countries there's been no
explanation on that now there was an
important development over the past 24
hours the White House chief have fasted
clarify is this immigration band does
not affect those who currently have
working green cards and have been vetted
through the security process thereby not
affecting directly as much as we once
thought tech companies like Google
Amazon and Apple that was a big stink a
lot of tech leaders spoke out very very
loudly CEO of Google sundar Pichai wrote
that quote it's painful to see the
personal cost of this executive order on
our colleagues an elite email to Google
employees Twitter said twitter is built
by immigrants of all religions we stand
for and with them always Airbnb uber
lyft Facebook Google
amazon and a host of others has said
that they opposed the ban and have
expressed concerns about the
implications of the order Tim Cook CEO
of Apple went so far as to say that
apple would not exist without
immigration okay so although this
executive order doesn't directly affect
those with working green cards right now
as it was previously thought it is
worrying tech recruiters I spoke with a
veteran recruiter today who tries to
place candidates in the US all day long
she said she has been told by her CEO
not to try and place any candidate who
aren't already in the US that is crazy
because she sourced many her candidates
from other countries and they're just
not going to risk it anymore even though
those candidates may not come from one
of those seven countries they're just
not going to risk using a whole bunch of
resource to define these people then
finding out another 90 days that Trump
band some other country they're just not
going to do it and that that's crazy
that's going to affect so many qualified
candidates who could have a positive
impact on the US economy so what is the
long-term implication of this if it
continues or god forbid gets worse now I
will grant you that some of the media
has been a bit melodramatic and
overreacted to this but I should say
that if this does continue or get worse
tech companies can only do one logical
thing begin to move operations overseas
if they can't emigrate the talent
they're going to have to go elsewhere to
get it because the u.s. does not have
enough tech talent to meet the demand I
know it I'm recruit her very well and
she warns me that the big war is the war
for talent and that's not good news for
the u.s. you see the number one problems
even talking about this is that things
have gotten so out of hand that when I
share my opinion someone's going to a
pigeonhole me as a stupid libtard or a
racist redneck one of the two no one's
listening anymore I'm just waiting for
you to finish so I can say what I want
to say if I don't really listen and try
and understand why you feel the way you
feel we can't come to a solution we're
just shouting over each other it's
pro-life versus pro-choice android vs
apple everyone's in a tribal camp and
they just want to shout at each other no
one's trying to solve a problem and you
just gotta listen so I spent the last 72
hours listening why would people want
such a broad sweeping band like this
because from the surface I just didn't
understand it so I listened and I
understand that people were saying look
we want our country back there's been aI
don't know exactly what that means but
I'm assuming when they say that they
mean that there's just been so many
rapid changes in America is changing so
fast and doesn't look like the America
they know and are proud of and are
comfortable with they want their country
back they also say that they want a safe
country and there's nothing wrong with
want to protect our country and protect
our own interests and you're right
there's nothing wrong with that so
they'll call people stupid rednecks for
just saying that they're not
automatically racist because they say
they want to keep out terrorists I
totally understand that and that's a
value I share here's the thing we can
still have a safe country and be
inclusive of all people and draw the
talent from around the world to make
this country great again right I mean
they don't have to be mutually exclusive
the problem is that we want solutions
now that are simple and so you can just
you know with one broad stroke just
solve the problem you can't through the
problem is complicated and solving a
complicated problem takes time and
thought and it's going to be sticky and
it's going to be hard and let's just
listen to each other so we can solve the
hard problems it's now contrary to what
we said in the comments yesterday i am
not a liberal i am not a Republican I'm
not even a libertarian what I am is like
Chris Rock I'm conservative on some
things and liberal on some others I try
and make my judgment based on the
information that I have and the
information that I've learned or the
past 72 hours tells me that this
immigration band is like not the tool to
solve the problem its way overkill it's
sort of like a man in his house trying
to dispatch a killer wasp with a
sledgehammer
and at the end of the day the men is
wondering why his house is almost
destroyed America don't be the man with
the sledgehammer trying to kill a wasp
now if I shared everything that I
learned over the past weekend the show
would have been way too long but I did
want to share a book that I read last
year and is very relevant to this called
the day of empire by Amy Chow and it's
about the rise and fall of hyper powers
hyper powers are defined as a country
that is the sole superpower in the known
world so most recently that's been the
US but in the past has been ancient
Egypt ancient Rome the long haul Empire
the Ottoman Empire these were countries
that were so dominant that they just did
not have an equal in the known world at
the time and one thing that they all had
in common fascinating do you know what
it is they all were inclusive know what
you think and you think a jace the
Mongol Empire was an inclusive they
steamrolled over all their opponents
that's true but one smart thing they all
did was they took the human resources
from those conquered domains and
integrated him them into their armies
into their administrations and into
their governments all of them that's the
one common characteristic of all those
hyper powers and when they fell they
sell because they then lost that
inclusivity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
