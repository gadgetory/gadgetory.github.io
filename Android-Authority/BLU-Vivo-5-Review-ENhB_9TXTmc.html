a great year for consumers who are
looking for premium built phones for a
low cost now blue just released two new
smartphones the blue vivo XL which we
have already reviewed here on Android
authority and the blue vivo 5 which is
what I have right here it is a more
premium version and it cost a little
more but only for $1.99 you do get a lot
here so let's see if the blue vivo 5 is
worth picking up
design is a main story here and by far
the most interesting aspect of the blue
vivo 5 due to its metal built unlike its
Big Brother the blue vivo XL the entire
backing and size of the phone are made
of metal with these nice chamfered edges
and when feeling the phone and
maneuvering it around in your hand
you'll feel that the metal used here is
actually pretty high-quality or at least
it feels like it it doesn't feel like
it's going to get scratched as easily as
other aluminum phones and it's really a
beautiful design especially in this
cheek gold color we have although you
can pick it up in liquid silver as well
like past blue vivo phones these devices
remain very thin however each year blue
plumps up their view lineup a little
making this year's vivo five six point
nine millimeters thin it's still very
thin and feels really great to hold
especially with it being very
lightweight at 141 grams it's ever so
slightly rounded on the back which helps
with your grip and overall when it comes
to feel in the hand the blue vivo 5 is
one of the best on the market right now
another big selling point blue is trying
to push is it's big 5.5 inch Super
AMOLED display colors are very saturated
here which I do think looks very nice
and with this being an AMOLED panel you
can expect the blacks to be as black as
they can get it's really great making
these icons pop over the vivo 5's
default black background White's do up
your pretty pink though which is normal
for a lot of AMOLED panels and overall
these color profiles and features of the
AMOLED screen would make for a fantastic
viewing experience but it's hampered by
the vivo 5 s low resolution we're only
talking 720p here and for a screen of
this size you will definitely notice
some pixelation going on even when
holding the phone a good distance away a
5.5 inch display at 720p comes to a
pixel density of only 267 PPI text can
be very fuzzy at times depending on its
size which will be annoying for some and
besides the low resolution though the
mix of this AMOLED screen with punched
up colors can still make for a great
video watching but when it comes to
reading text you may have some trouble
so with this being a 200-dollar device
you're not going to expect the blue vivo
5 to bring the fastest performance but
given its specs I had no problem doing
almost anything we have immediate X 60
7:53 octa-core processor with a Mallee T
720 GPU and three gigs of RAM which is
very nice to see in a phone at this
price range the phone runs very smoothly
actually with animation stuttering very
rarely jumping in and out of apps is
quite fast although with very slight
pauses when dealing with the recent apps
screen
I drew the phone to some benchmarks with
Geekbench giving it a pretty low score
of two thousand eight hundred and fifty
and antutu giving it a score of thirty
eight thousand and nine even gaming
holds up quite well with very few drop
frames here and there in more graphic
intensive games I was impressed with the
vivo files performance it runs very well
battery life is great as well with this
three thousand one hundred and fifty
milliamp non-removable battery no it's
not removable like the excel but with
this decent sized battery energy
efficient processor AMOLED display and
more importantly low resolution screen I
could easily make the phone last a full
day all night while sleeping and the
next morning part of this is due to its
intelligent standby power saving mode
which is on by default my screen on time
for the blue vivo 5 averaged about 6
hours of screen on time which for me is
excellent charging the phone is great
thanks to the USB type-c connector found
on the bottom yes you'll have to use
different cables but due to USB type-c
being reversible there'll be a lot less
fumbling around especially in the dark
as you charge up for the night besides
this charge times are pretty fast too
given the phone's battery capacity no
you won't find any fingerprint scanner
here or even NFC but you will find the
dual SIM card tray with 32 gigs of
internal storage which is very nice
given the price and if that's not enough
you have access to a micro SD card slot
that supports up to 64 gigs of storage
the speaker is found on the bottom right
and actually sounds really good it gets
pretty loud and even at max volume there
seems to be no problem with the sound
being muffled or even distorted it lacks
a lot of base but the mids and highs
seem to be mixed perfectly now blue has
been known for really tinkering with
their software on their phones for quite
some time which lit a lot of users but
their last release seemed to be moving
towards a better direction with a more
slim down skin the app drawer returning
and stock notification pull downs and
menus however with the blue vivo 5 it
appear
they have taken a step backward with a
very heavily skinned version of Android
lollipop 5.1 of course some people love
this and some people will not it really
all depends on which phone you're coming
from but this redesign is quite
different from a lot of phones on the
market first off the app drawer is gone
so you'll have to resort to placing
every single app on your home screen
folder making is a must here the
notification menu is very simple and
looks very clean although there is no
setting button here in fact there's no
quick settings for anything this is just
a notification panel if you want to
access your quick settings you'll have
to pull up from the bottom and if you
get used to this it can help keep things
a little more organized but I did find
myself accidentally pulling this up from
time to time or sometimes struggling to
make it appear but like I said
everything runs very smoothly although
there are no lockscreen notifications
and sometimes the phone would refuse to
chime when unifications arrived making
me miss a lot of my notifications and
even my text I'm not really sure why
this would happen but a simple restart
usually fix a problem the reach an app
screen is more familiar without much
skinning at all which is nice and while
we're here it's worth noting that the
recent apps button is capacitive along
with the home and back button although
the back button and recent apps button
have been flipped which can take some
time getting used to customizing your
home screen is very simple easily
allowing widgets and transition effects
to be chosen in the theme app you can
change how your wallpaper and apps look
with a lot of dark options which really
suits this AMOLED panel so yeah now all
the rescan is bad but here in the US it
will take lots of users some time to get
used to the pulldown redesigns and lack
of an app drawer but of course
installing the third-party launcher can
help solve some of these problems the 13
megapixel camera on the blue vivo 5 is
quite good for a phone of its price
range it doesn't have any optical image
stabilization and is just your average
budget phone camera spec sheet LED flash
along with a 5 megapixel wide-angle
selfie camera pictures aren't bad at all
in good lighting the colours aren't too
saturated and it can be prone to
overexposing
and can struggle with dynamic range in
the shadows HDR can help but oftentimes
won't actually create a more appealing
photo all of this being said photos
still look very good
indoors some grain will show and of
course in a tough shot like this the
camera slower shutter speed can cause
moving objects to blur but for the most
part images still come out very nice in
dark areas the camera can be very hit or
miss it all has to do with how steady
you can keep your hands as a camera's
shutter speed becomes very slow to
compensate for loss of light most of the
time your shot will become blurry but
every once in a while you'll capture
something perfectly video quality is
decent for what it is it's what you
would expect from a $200 smartphone
camera with lots of overexposing and
constant exposure changes and it can
also be pretty shaky the front-facing
camera actually has a good amount of
detail but when you're not in direct
sunlight you will start to notice some
grain overall for $200 phone to support
this camera and for it to perform as
well as it did in these crazy tests I
put it through there is nothing to
complain about here at the end of the
day this is a $200 smartphone that feels
like a flagship that cost triple its
price the build quality on this thing is
incredible with its metal build thin
body and light weight for a phone of
this price you'll be more than happy
with this camera it's USB type-c support
great battery life and 5.5 inch AMOLED
screen although you may get tired of the
low resolution very quickly as well as
the over skinned software is it worth
picking up well for the build quality
alone I would say yes it's great for the
price but even with this year just
beginning we're already starting to see
phones in the price range offer a little
more like fingerprint scanners and
higher resolution 5.5 inch screens that
being said you won't find a more premium
designed phone for $200 and for that
price you can't go wrong with the blue
vivo 5 and that's the end of the review
thanks for watching comment below and
let me know what you think of the blue
vivo 5 do you guys think is worth $1.99
