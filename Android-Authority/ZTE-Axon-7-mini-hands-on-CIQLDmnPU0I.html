showing to us that a flagship doesn't
require a typical flagship cost at $400
there's a whole lot of bang for the buck
here for Aoife the company's unveiling
its mini companion the ZTE axon seven
mini now as its name implies the phone
has a more compact in hand friendly
design while maintaining the same all
metal construction from before this
translates to a phone that's more
manageable to hold and operate with one
hand besides its size the only other
distinguishable change is the textured
print over the speakers the phone really
lives up to its name just because it
perfectly replicates the premium design
without much compromise looking around
the phone it's so features the same
fingerprint sensor on its back a USB
type-c connector and those phenomenal
sounding dual front firing speakers ZTE
tells us that they're able to crank up
the power by just a smidgen and believe
us this thing isn't messing around with
its audio quality it's incredible and if
not better than the axon 7 due to the
smaller size of the phone it's no shock
we get a smaller screen - it's a 5.2
inch AMOLED with this one the resolution
2 goes from quad HD down to 1080p here
now somebody complained about this but
in all fairness it's still quite
detailed when you look at it from a
normal distance another area where we
see a change is in the hardware that's
under the hood you have a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 617 chip with three gigabytes
of RAM and 32 gigabytes of internal
storage they're all a reduction of sorts
but at least it seems to produce nearly
the same responsiveness with superficial
operations but then again the true
tell'em will come down to how it handles
gaming moving on to the interface it's
identical to what's already available to
the axon 7 so there's not much to say
about it right now it's still at android
6.0.1 marshmallow which is expected in
all but we know you're curious about the
next iteration and with that however it
purely boils down to a matter of time
camera in the back is now a 16 megapixel
one its lightest imposing as the 21
megapixel camera and the
axon seven but it's still at a healthy
count it's accompanied with an F one
point nine aperture lens electronic
image stabilization phase detection
autofocus a sapphire lens and a dual LED
flash the only thing not here this time
around is optical image stabilization so
it might not be as steady we're still
curious to see how the new camera setup
panels though arguably the biggest draw
for the ZTE axon seven was its price
something that even continues to blow
the competition out of the water moving
on to the ZTE axon seven mini though
it's going to be sold at the retail
price of $299 when it launches in some
European markets at the end of September
that roughly converts to 333 dollars
which seems alright for a phone of this
caliber especially when other compatibly
spec phones are at four hundred dollars
but it would have been more lowering if
it comes out to be sub $300 when it
comes here to the US maybe it will if so
it's bound to be contender in that
mid-range market so which I'll see what
happens and that is it for the ZTE axon
7 mini so if you guys want to learn more

new goodies that are coming out and
