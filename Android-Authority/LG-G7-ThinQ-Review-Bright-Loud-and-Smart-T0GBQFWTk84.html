this is probably one of the few times
you'll hear me say it's full name
otherwise I'm just gonna call it the LG
G 7 which is what most people are
probably gonna do anyways so for the
past couple of years LG's been making
some really solid smart phones and the
LG G 7 is another really great smart
phone from LG but can this be the one
can this be the phone that gets LG out
of the shadows of Samsung and Apple and
give LG the attention it deserves or
will it still just fly quietly under the
radar first let's get all the basic
smartphone stuff out of the way this is
a high-end 20-18 flagship so it's got
all the specs that you would want out of
a high-end phone there's a snapdragon
845 inside with four or six gigabytes of
RAM depending on the storage model its
IP 68 dust and water resistant has a
micro SD card slot for extra storage and
it even supports both wireless charging
standards if you like wireless charging
performance on the g7 is exactly what
you might expect it's extremely fast
with fluid animations touch response is
excellent apps are quick to launch and
it plays all the latest and greatest
game titles that you'll find on Google
Play with smooth frame rates and
graphics it'll pretty much handle
anything you throw at it without ever
slowing down the fingerprint sensor is
still on the back which works equally as
fast but it no longer doubles as a power
button like it did on previous LG phones
instead the power button is now in a
more traditional spot on the right side
the power button being on the back was
definitely one of LG's defining features
but I personally don't mind the change
it's nice to have the power button as an
option for waking up the phone again
when it's laying flat on a table or desk
but you also have double tap to wake as
well if you prefer using that as far as
the rest of the design the easiest way
to describe it is it's basically an LG b
30 but in a smaller package it's got
glass on the front and back and a solid
metal frame on the sides and the rounded
corners and curved back makes it pretty
comfortable to hold the phone is pretty
much completely smooth to the touch but
it surprisingly doesn't feel slippery it
does attract a lot
fingerprints though but that's just to
be expected when you're dealing with a
mostly glass phone one of the biggest
pieces of hardware here on the g7 is the
dedicated AI key on the side this is
pretty similar to the bixby button on
samsung phones but the g7 uses Google
assistant instead which instantly makes
it that much more useful so pressing on
and of course launches Google assistant
even if the phone is asleep but you can
also press and hold to start voice
dictation and let go once you're done
talking and if you double tap the button
will launch you straight into google
lens the biggest gripe that I think a
lot of people are going to have with
this button is that it's not remappable
but the possibility of that changing
isn't entirely out of the window
LG said that they might change this in
the future but even if they don't it's
still a really convenient button to have
for Google Assistant the screen is also
going to have a lot of people talking
for multiple reasons for one it has a
notch and not everyone is gonna like
that after the first couple of days it
didn't really bother me all that much
anymore but if you really hate it
LG software lets you turn the areas of
the screen around the knotch to black to
make it look like a normal vessel again
you can also customize these areas with
different colored gradients but I
thought this was kind of a cheap parlor
trick and it makes a notch stand out
even more the good news is the knotch
doesn't interfere with apps or videos so
if you're watching a youtube video for
example it doesn't overlap the video
itself and instead again turns into a
regular black bezel not just side the
screen is gorgeous it's an IPS panel and
not OLED like the v30
but it still looks great it's vibrant
colorful sharp and LG calls this a super
bright display because it's able to go
up to a thousand nits of brightness
which makes it extremely easy to see in
direct sunlight LG was able to do this
by using an RGB W sub pixel arrangement
instead of the standard RGB and the
addition of the white sub pixel is what
allows the screen to be brighter and
it's pretty easy to enable the
brightness boost all you have to do is
tap on the brightness boost toggle and
it instantly jumps up to max brightness
and it'll stay that way for a maximum of
three minutes I also really like a lot
of the preloaded wallpapers which do a
pretty solid job of showing off how gray
this display looks the rest of the
software is a fairly standard LG
experience and if you use an LG phone
before you'll instantly feel right at
home it's running on top of Android 8.0
Oreo with all the typical LG features
that you might expect like the always-on
display smart bulletin gaming tools and
the floating bar that replaced the
second screen the LG used to use in
their V series there's a couple of
things that LG has become pretty
synonymous forward with their
smartphones over the last few years one
of those things is audio for starters it
still has a headphone jack which is
great news and secondly the g7 has the
same awesome quad DAC that delivers
fantastic sound especially if you own a
pair of high impedance headphones the
big improvement here this time though is
the addition of DTS X virtual surround
sound which is supposed to give you a
more immersive audio experience but this
is really just a future proofing feature
at this point because the content needs
to support DTS X in order for you to get
the full effect and there isn't much of
that available just yet
the other improvement that LG has made
is with the single bottom firing speaker
normally most bottom firing speakers
aren't worth talking about but what
makes this one special is that it uses
the space inside the phone as a
resonance chamber and you can literally
feel the sound move through the phone
putting the phone down in the hollow
container or even just an ordinary hard
surface like a table or desk will make
the speaker sound even louder and I was
actually pretty blown away by how much
louder it sound
surely places
the other thing that LG is really well
known for is their camera experience
let's start with the front-facing camera
first after sticking with five
megapixels for so long they finally
upgraded it to eight megapixels on the
g7 this not only gives you more
resolution but the selfies from this new
front-facing camera are much sharper
more detailed and it has pretty nice
color reproduction and skin tones LG has
also added a portrait mode if you want
that background blur and it works
decently well but it sometimes doesn't
always get the cut out quite right it
would sometimes blur out my hair or one
of my ears and even blurred out my
headphones so it definitely could use
some improvement on the rear you've got
LG's traditional dual camera setup both
cameras are 16 megapixels with the main
sensor featuring an aperture of f/16 and
optical image stabilization and the
secondary sensor is a wide-angle lens at
f 1.9 the wide-angle lens has been
reduced to a hundred and seven degree
field of view which is still plenty wide
for capturing landscapes or group photos
and this reduction in these sensors
field of view was done to help eliminate
the barrel distortion that a lot of
people didn't really like LG has also
brought over the AI cam that was first
introduced on the V 30s the AI cam is
capable of analyzing the scene and
subjects within the scene and from there
it'll automatically apply a filter and
give you a few other suggested filters
to hopefully give you a better looking
photo for the most part it's pretty
quick at recognizing what it's looking
at but I wasn't really a fan of any of
the filters that applied to my photos
and I thought some of them actually
looked worse than the photos taken
without AI
it's a neat feature if you like having
the camera do most of the work but if
you like having control of your photos
from start to finish you probably won't
find it all that useful
generally speaking photos from the g7 s
camera are pretty solid with pleasant
looking colors crisp and sharp details
and pretty good dynamic range for
low-light shots LG has added a super
bright camera mode which uses pixel
binning to flood in more light but I
didn't really like that the images are
lower resolution and the results were
really muddy in comparison to a normal
low-light shot you'll get the best
low-light performance with the main
sensor which produces sharper details
better colors and our
sniffing unless no Z when compared to
the wide angle that isn't all too
surprising those since the wide angle
has a narrower aperture and doesn't have
oh is as far as battery life is
concerned it isn't the best it's a three
thousand milliamp hour battery which is
smaller than a lot of competing
flagships and even smaller than last
year's g6 I get around four to four and
a half hours of screen on time at most
which is fine for light usage but if you
play a lot of games throughout the day
and watch a lot of YouTube on your phone
it's not going to get you through the
day without recharging at least once the
LG G 7 will be available on all major US
carriers starting June 1st with the
exception of 18 T and is supposedly
going to Ballpark at around six hundred
and fifty dollars which will be pretty
competitive to Samsung and Apple if that
is indeed true like many of LG's
previous flagships this phone definitely
has what it takes to compete well with
other major smartphones but the question
still remains
if the g7 will give LG the recognition
they deserve only time will really tell
but if you're considering getting an lg
phone for the first time the LG G 7th in
queue wouldn't be a bad place to start
so that about wraps up this review for
the LG G seven hopefully you guys
