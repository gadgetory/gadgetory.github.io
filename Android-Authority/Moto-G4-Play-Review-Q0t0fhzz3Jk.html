year so far from low to mid and even
high-end phones they pretty much cover
the gamut for its latest smartphone
they're refocusing on the entry level
side the market once again with the
low-priced moto G for play it's $150
outright so it means getting a phone on
the cheap but then it makes us wonder if
there are any significant compromises
now am I really surprised about the
build quality for this not really
because for the money and price at all
it's expected it's not premium it's not
trying to be premium but for an entry
level phone it's okay I guess it's not
really terribly cheap but same time it's
not stylish either so yeah it might have
a dull profile when you compare to some
other phones of the same caliber but it
surprisingly receives the same
water-repellent treatment that we pretty
much find in the Moto family line
meaning minor splashes and light rain
won't damage it which is basically the
extent of its water resistance
protection what are the reason why it's
more hand friendly than the g4 and g4
plus is because it comes with a smaller
5 inch 720p IPS LCD display now the
resolution is predictable but we've seen
other comparable phones that have 1080p
resolution it's not a deal-breaker
considering that it's still detailed
enough to make up from a normal viewing
distance now despite that there are more
unfavorable qualities with it like it's
cold color temperature of 80 600 Kelvin
the inaccuracies with its color
reproduction and visible distortion and
wide angles they all point to a subpar
display now the only highlight is its
peak luminance of 545 nits which makes
it visible and most sunny days the
processor here reflects its price what
we have is a quad-core 1.2 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor
coupled with 2 gigabytes of RAM and the
Adreno 306 GPU they all indicate an
entry-level phone here but when it comes
to basic stuff it elesif Isis with its
performance it just doesn't cut it with
games in fact it's just a chop you
phones of this caliber usually don't
have much in the way of storage however
we're glad to report that the Moto G
foreplay comes with 16 gigabytes of
internal capacity with expansion via
microSD support of late we've been
seeing more phones in this price range
with fingerprint sensors for the Moto G
foreplay though that's not something
that's included in its arsenal nor we're
expecting one either
especially when it's priced less than
the g4 to be fair the handsets intention
is to be just a basic phone
so yeah the future is always light as
they can be in a smartphone which makes
perfect sense it's usable for the most
part for watching videos despite the
poor qualities about the display that we
mentioned earlier interesting enough
though the earpiece also doubles as the
handset speaker volume isn't an issue
here but you'll want to drop the level a
few notches down so that the sharpness
isn't too irritating to the ear given
its overall size the removable 2800
milliamp hour battery seems like a
pretty good capacity and we combined
that with its smaller screen size the
720p resolution and the battery
optimized chipset it definitely delivers
good results with its battery life it's
more than adequate to get through a
solid day of normal usage and while I
really enjoy the battery life on the
smartphone the charging time is kind of
ridiculous kind of long too so you're
going to have to leave it on the charger
for a little bit of time so you might
want to make sure you only do that when
you're going to bed much as it's the
case with most entry-level things
there's really not a huge focus with the
camera here
it's a meagre 8 megapixel rear camera
with an F 2.2 aperture lens and an LED
flash well if I megapixel snapper rounds
out the front-facing camera it features
nearly the same exact camera interface
as other moto devices say for the fact
that you can't twist the phone a couple
times to launch the camera but pressing
the power button twice in succession
does the same thing as for the quality
well its predictable in the way that we
can't expect outstanding results with
low price phones when the conditions are
ideal its performance is good enough for
sharing on social media above all though
you'll want to keep a steady hand
because it's snapshot time isn't as
quick as we'd like so
photos are prone to blurring fine
details are lacking any significant
substance often making them appear
speckle and forget about low-light
situation seeing that it exhibits too
much noise likewise we can say the same
thing about its video recording
performance at 1080p most of the time
however it struggles to focus properly
which gets annoying after a while
and top it off there's also some
artifacting present when shooting under
sunny conditions on the surface the moto
G for play doesn't stray too far with
its android 6.0.1 marshmallow experience
but certainly doesn't have all the same
features we get in some other devices in
the line and that's the thing about the
experiences on these moto devices
whether it be the high-end low-end
mid-range er they pretty much go with
the same unified approach they're not
trying to inundate you with a lot of
software stuff it's pretty much
straightforward for the most part and of
course be an entry-level phone it does
the basic stuff voices through the
earpiece exhibit enough volume under
noisy conditions but the quality is
accompanied with some sharpness that
makes voices sound a little bit distort
on the other end line our callers don't
have any major objections about the
performance with the exception of some
light white noise in the background the
Moto G 4 plays undeniably on one end of
the spectrum offering consumers a phone
that won't break the bank at first
glance the $150 full price of the phone
is an attractive thing but the more we
think about what we've seen in the last
few months it definitely makes us
believe that it has some stiff
competition yes it does nicely for those
who aren't looking for anything more
than doing the most bare bone things
with their phone but when you have other
phones that have a smidgen better specs
and even fingerprint sensors it makes it
seem like it's undervalued for the price
we're not saying that it's a terrible
phone but rather the competition has
raised the bar from what's expected in
phones of this caliber and that is the
Moto G for play so if you guys want to
