first word that comes to mind when I
think of Android oh but you know what if
it is that it's been a long time coming
oil oil Android onion Android cookies in
now that's smooth no no Android a
regular oregano it's a great space I
mean Android Oh Android oh oh dear
Android oh dear already go Android jello
orange it has to be orange and the best
way to fan the fanboy flames apples
versus ordering but I tell you it won't
be it won't be Android Oppenheimer
doesnäôt be a good idea
Android Octavius that's evil sounding
Andrew you are you are you - bang bang
oxygen is a treat of sorts I mean after
all we should appreciate it because
without it we'd all die if Google wasn't
shutting down Google spaces they could
have done with the space theme orbit
normally Android ozone and think Android
orangutan would really work Android OPM
wait that's probably pretty bad injuries
oculus that's Facebook but if we think
of the food stuff then maybe we can have
Android Ovaltine Sochi for the Filipinos
out there Android oxtail now that sounds
tasty okay Google next let's start with
Oh Android oatmeal that would be dope
okay okay what about life savers and
their the letter O Android omelette
Android olive oil onion if Google went
this route it could be vanilla Android I
think a lot of these predictions for
Android over just people googling what
desserts start with the letter O I
definitely don't think it'll be
something like on Tibet's cook because
Google reps will spend months trying to
tell us how to pronounce the damn thing
also I'm sorry if I mispronounced the
damn thing which you know what I'm
really worried about I'm really worried
actually going to be cold Android
oatmeal cookie and I don't really find
that very inspiring I think it'll be
simple like Android orange or oatmeal
cookie however I could see Google being
a little fun with it and going with
something like Android orange zest or
orange creamsicle I can see them doing
something that people can just barely
pronounce like Olie Bowl you know kind
of like nuga or nougats or whatever and
draw an organic I mean it's it's Silicon
Valley it's Bay Area right everything's
got to be organic all the people like
Google drink bone broth I mean I do too
but Killah being organic jelly bean
Android orange you glad this is an
Android banana I think actually that
should jump straight over o and go
straight to pee like Windows jumped over
nine went from eight to ten I think we
have Android fever pecan pie I suppose
we're stuck with Android Oh now frankly
it doesn't really matter to me anyway
ever since Google denied us the Android
drop release I've kind of lost my steam
when it comes to names
it'll be fun in deserty I'm sure but
unless they find a way to call it
Android Oreo I think people are going to
be disappointed
Android okay we get it you like snack
but yeah let us know what you think
Android Oh might be in the comments
below and don't forget to subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already and
hit that Bell on the side so you can see
whenever we put up a video especially
ones like this one where we're just
trying to have some fun and bring you
guys in on the conversation from there
drop us some likes on these videos and
then stick around because we are your
source for all things Android something
onion and red orange Android Obama for
sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
