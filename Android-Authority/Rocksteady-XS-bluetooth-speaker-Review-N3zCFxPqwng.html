Youngberg from Android Authority calm
today we're checking out the Rocksteady
excess bluetooth speaker system from
killer concepts in Irvine California
this is a really well built a solid
manufactured Bluetooth speaker system
that I've enjoyed using for the past few
days it's very loud has great sound
dynamics and I've been really pleased
with its performance anyways let's just
go ahead and check out what's on the
body on the front right here we've got
our mode button which is also our
bluetooth pairing button I'm gonna play
pause and stop volume up and down and
then track next and back on top we have
a speaker grille we've also got two on
the sides we have on the back our USB in
full USB we also have micro USB in and
then we have line in which is 3.5
millimeter auxiliary port then we have
our power switch so we'll go ahead and
turn it on we do turn it on we have our
confirmation on the bottom this is a
removable lithium ion battery and it is
replaceable
we simply pop it open right here and our
blue light is going to help us with all
of our pairing and stuff like that and
in order to pair we would actually just
press and hold the mode button but we're
going to go ahead and use our 3.5
millimeter auxiliary line in for sound
quality so we'll go ahead and pop that
in and play a song here of course I'm
using my Android device
so as you guys can see I've sort of
manipulated some of the controls here so
down anyways um as you guys might have
been able to tell through your home
stereo or your computer speakers this
does have great sound dynamics it sounds
like we've got some of our highs coming
on to this top here and then our mint
and bass is reserved for these side
speakers because these are a little bit
bigger could be a little a little bit
less than one inch in diameter so I
don't think either of these are actual
subwoofers but they are some nice
speakers that can reproduce bass pretty
well the frequencies are pretty low so
we're picking up these very nicely
anyways it's just got a great sound for
the size it's very small and extremely
lightweight it feels like it couldn't
even have an aluminum housing it kind of
retains the coal a little bit so that
leads me to believe that this is in fact
metal anyways this just sounds great and
it sits nicely when the bass gets
bumping it doesn't really move across
your table or anything these little
rubberized Stoppers right here kind of
keep it where it is but mind you it can
get bump in and move around just a
little bit um but anyways guys this is a
great speaker system I've had a lot of
fun with it
check out killer concepts from
California USA this is the Rocksteady XS
last for a very very long time it's just
a great device to use and it comes with
a few accessories including an AC
charger the micro USB cable and then a
3.5 millimeter auxiliary cable which is
not this one
but it does come with one
but anyways guys thanks for watching the
review this is around two hundred
dollars so it's a little bit of steep
price point but if you've got the money
go ahead and check one out the
Rocksteady XS one more time guys from
Irvine California Killer concepts thanks
a lot guys this is Clayton young bird
with an authority calm stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
