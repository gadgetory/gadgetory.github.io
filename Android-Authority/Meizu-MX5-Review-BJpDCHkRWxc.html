on their sleeve more so than ever with
this year successor to the mx4 and in
the past couple of days the affordably
priced smartphone market has begun to
grow there's a lot of competition out
there from big companies trying to
construct a perfect smartphone that not
only performs well but is reasonably
priced well what about a lesser-known
company like meizu where does their
latest smartphone rank in this field
hello everybody this is amazing mx-5 I'm
crystal it's nice to meet you guys I've
been doing tech reviews for a little
over two months now so I'm still getting
a hang of things but if you want to know
more about me they'll be an about me
video coming out soon on this channel so
stay tuned for that and let's get on
with the review this is the meizu mx4
and i know we're probably all thinking
of the same thing hmm
this design looks very familiar and yeah
it's no secret we're meizu has taken
their inspirations from over the years
but this phone is definitely beautifully
designed with this metal body that
curves around to me it's big 5.5 inch
display it feels nice to hold to only
being seven point six millimeters thick
and weighing 149 grams it's actually not
that slippery either it always felt
safely secure in my hand the meizu mx4
san octa-core 2.2 gigahertz processor
with drinking's of ram along with a
power VR GPU the phone comes in 16 32
and 64 gig storage variants with no
micro SD card slot it also comes in
black gold and silver inside we have a
3150 milliamp non-removable battery and
it has something called M charge which
is supposedly supposed to charge from 0
to 60 in 40 minutes
on the back we can find the mx-5 s 20.7
megapixel camera with an F 2.2 aperture
lens alongside that is this laser
autofocus and dual tone flash on the
right side we have both the volume
buttons and the power button and they
feel pretty tactile and responsive the
left side is where the SIM card tray
lives and this phone actually allows for
2 SIM cards to be activated within the
phone on the top we have our headphone
jack and on the bottom we have our
microUSB port and the speed
the speaker isn't the best sounding
speaker but it's definitely not horrible
by any means it's just a bit tinny but
the volume certainly makes up for this
the speaker can be very loud almost as
loud as the LG g4 speaker on the front
of the phone if you look very closely
you can see we have an LED notification
light
I tried figuring out if I could do any
other colors other than white but I'm
pretty sure white is our only option
here the home button has been redesigned
from the mx4 small round button to a
bigger more rectangular button it can
feel a little cheap sometimes kind of
like a toy but it gets the job done even
though the awesome notification light is
no longer located here and it's sad to
see it go it makes a lot of sense
because meizu was able to add a
fingerprint scanner that they call em
touch and it works really well it's
super fast and I've never had any issues
with it recognising my fingerprint it's
much faster than touch ID and maybe even
faster than Samsung's at 6:00 the mx-5
has a 5.5 inch HD AMOLED screen made of
Gorilla Glass 3
mazie decided to ditch the strange 16 to
10 aspect ratio for the more
conventional 16 to 9 ratio which I
happily welcome now even though this is
only a 1080 by 1920 resolution the
display is actually quite beautiful
colors really pop and are nice and
saturated with this being an AMOLED
screen you can expect deep blacks and I
guess my only complaint would be the
whites are a little warmer with a
pinkish hue to them and obviously text
is not going to be as sharp as other
flagships with a quad HD screen but
overall I'm pretty impressed with the
mx-5s display now hold on to your hats
my friends it's time to talk about the
OS of the mx-5 and it's a it's a little
different than what most of us are used
to makes you put their own take of
Android onto the mx-5 called fly me
OS and it's not bad it's actually
designed quite well but it couldn't look
farther from stock Android the mx-5 is
running Android 5.0 point 1 but you can
never tell by looking at it the settings
screen resembles something close to iOS
and like I said it's not bad just
different and take some time getting
used to one thing that can be annoying
is that there is no app drawer so you're
going to be forced to put all your apps
on your homescreen and make folders to
organize them
also trying to get to the settings menu
can be a pain because unlike most
smartphones the Settings app cannot be
found in the pulldown menu so you'll
have to put the Settings app somewhere
on your home screen
fly me OS was designed to be very simple
and it certainly is sometimes almost too
much for an Android device but it does
come with some cool features like the
ability to lock apps so they require a
pass code to get into also you might
have noticed that yes since the phone
has a physical home button well where is
the back button and the multitasking
button well the back button is the
physical home button instead of pressing
it just tap it you'll get the vibration
feedback and the phone will take you
back it's different but it's actually
pretty cool and very easy to use
as for the multitasking button well it's
a little bit harder you have to slowly
pull up from the bottom and you get
something that looks like the iOS 6 used
app dock remember slowly you can't see
previews of the apps unfortunately but
you can close them by swiping up on them
the most important thing about fly me OS
is how it performs and it performs great
it's super fast and responsive I've
never experienced any lag or stuttering
from the phone so far absolute quickly
and overall just navigating to the phone
is just a very pleasant experience and
that is just using the phone's balance
mode you can choose different power
modes for the phone to run in to save
battery including power saving mode
balance and performance mode I would
recommend never changing from balance
mode however just because I never really
found a reason to change it everything
runs smooth maybe for some high graphics
gaming performance mode would be ideal
but for most games the mx-5 and bounce
mode plays beautifully now let's move on
to the 20 point seven megapixel camera
the camera interface is very simple
clean and easy to use you have easy
access to a bunch of different modes
including full manual mode which I'll
get to soon so in auto mode pictures on
this phone are actually pretty good I
was surprised at how nice they look
colors pop and are nice and saturated
dynamic range is pretty good but it's
pretty much up to you to get it right so
even though auto mode should
automatically adjust to take the best
picture it does need quite a bit of help
sometimes
tapping the preview obviously does the
usual focus and adjustment of light the
problem I found is that it's very
sensitive so you have to make sure you
click exactly where you want the camera
to focus and adjust the light to that
certain area if you're off just a little
bit the picture could go totally dark or
way too bright it took some time getting
used to I don't think it should take
this much trial and error to get a good
photo in auto mode but in the end this
camera can take some pretty nice
pictures HDR does a great job of
bringing out the shadows even though it
takes a second or two to take the
picture and here's a pretty tough shot
for any camera with moving balloons and
pointing into the sunset but the mx-5
handle it pretty well since HDR takes a
little longer to take the picture you
will sometimes see ghosting even on
slowly moving things like hot-air
balloons
video is great on the mx-5 to recording
at a max of 30 frames per second 4k is
also available low-light shots are
little noisy and not the most clear but
definitely not bad they are pretty dark
still with the 2.2 aperture lens it's
what I would usually expect from a sub
$400 phone the front facing five
megapixel camera is pretty good and
pictures have a great amount of detail
it seems to really prioritize the main
subject of the photo and make anything
slightly in the background a little
blurry than most selfie cameras but
overall it takes pretty good pictures
like I was saying before there are a lot
of different shooting modes some are
silly and some are kind of cool you can
have a lot of fun with this camera
there's manual mode with shutter speed
ISO exposure and focus panorama does a
full 360 and stiches things together
very well light field mode takes a bunch
of photos very fast at different focus
points allowing you to adjust the focus
after the shot was taken the mx-5 can
record slow-mo at 100 frames per second
and even though that's not as slow as
some flagships out there the quality is
definitely a lot better at 720p beauty
mode is where it can get a little weird
you can choose to make your eyes as big
as you would like or even make your face
a bit slimmer smoothness is there and
whitening which I thought would just
make your teeth whiter but it makes your
whole face whiter it's silly it's stupid
but it can be fun so if it's non quad HD
AMOLED
mean and decently sized 3150 milliamp
battery you should be able to rely on
this phone to get you through the day
right well in my case yes I haven't been
able to kill the battery in a day no
matter what I do
whether I'm slightly browsing the
internet responding to texts going
through Instagram or taking photos all
day and watching HD YouTube videos
battery life tends to be the same I was
able to get four hours to four and a
half hours of screen on time pretty much
every day there seems to be something
weird going on with the phone idling
taking up a lot of the battery
consumption it's usually number one on
the list it's not much to moan and groan
over since battery life is already
pretty great but I just can't help to
imagine how amazing it would be without
this bug in the end I was pleasantly
surprised by the meizu mx4 to keep this
phone from emptying your wallets there
are some compromises sure the display
isn't the best but it definitely looks
nice and will help save some power and
yes the home button is a little bit
cheap but it's a home button back button
fingerprint scanner and power button
all-in-one in the end the features that
matter and that should work do work and
they work beautifully once you get past
some of the cosmetic differences the
meizu mx4 is a fantastic phone it
performs well has a reliable battery and
a nice camera even though this area of
phones is starting to become crowded
with some other great options for less
than $400 I'd say the mx-5 is a great
