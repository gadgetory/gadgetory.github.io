here at show stoppers at CES 2013 with
android authority i'm here with Steven
Miller who's a ambassador with Lenovo
and we're taking a look at their latest
device so I'm just going to pass out the
mic he knows a lot more better than I do
here we go this is the k900 I say I'm
very very excited but we're after with
this phone is a coupla first it's an
intel chipset so this is the clover
trail atom processor the two gigahertz
if he carries two 2580 a couple of other
specs 5.5 mm 5.5 inch screen and look at
this this is six point nine millimeters
also this is just really light I wish I
could I don't have the specs on the
weight I wish you can fill it on the
camera it is very very like we're really
after low light conditions on this phone
so have a double flash and I have a 13
megapixel camera on the back it's a
really really super high resolution and
I have 400 pixels per inch on the screen
1080p but four hundred mega pixels per
inch so I really do want to have good
photographs a good user experience it's
a high-end phone oh yeah so you see that
I have the same and a memory slot here
on the side so this is going to be a
high-end fun for us in the k-series so
the k900 honestly guys is super thin six
point eight millimeters thin we have a
1080p 5.5 inches display two gigs of ram
it is a dual core two gears Intel so
obviously going to be pretty powerful
we're seeing some really good things
they're not going to reveal any release
dates or price points another thing that
we should mention is that it does
include expandable memory which is
really really great obviously for those
that aren't fans with the cloud so I
just want to say thank you very much for
your time so welcome appreciated really
appreciate sir thank you welcome hey
guys android authority here we're taking
a closer look at Lenovo's brand spanking
new k900 packing at 1080p 5.5 inch
display with 440 pixels per inch it
features a six point eight millimeter
thin profile a 13 megapixel camera and I
guess a lot of you probably going to be
excited about this
expandable memory to sew up to 64
gigabytes of SDXC micro SDXC memory
campus capable in there on the front
we're looking at a two megapixel camera
and now it features a very rectangular
design very keen to what Sony is except
it has no sort of curved rear or design
featuring totally it complicated in the
heart to understand a metallic type rare
with a really really interesting pattern
that sort of was almost 3d in its nature
dual LED flash no word on the battery
but it's a two gigahertz into a
Cloverfield dual-core processor so it's
going to be probably extremely powerful
other than that includes Lenovo's custom
UI overlay it's coming right now with
Android 4.1 but we are looking at
they're saying that we're going to be
having a 4.2 upgrade in the near future
alright guys so just a closer quick look
at the k900 thanks for tuning in guys
