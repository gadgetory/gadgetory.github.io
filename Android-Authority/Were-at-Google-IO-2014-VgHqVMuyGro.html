hey it's Josh regard from android
authority what's going on everybody and
as you can see behind me here i am at
Google i/o in the beautiful Moscone
Center in sunny San Francisco it might
be a little bit windy outside but we're
gonna be indoors for the next couple
days seeing the best that Google has to
offer for the upcoming year now we might
not know too much about what we're going
to be seen coming into the keynote
that's going to happen at nine a.m.
tomorrow morning bright and early but we
do know this that basically we're
expecting a lot of wearable technology
to be the focus of this year's google
i/o but we always know that there are
some surprises along the way there are a
lot of great things that Google does for
the patrons and the press that are here
and you can end you might not be able to
see it right now but i'll show you some
footage of everybody trying out just
over there Google glass and you can
actually pick a google glass here right
now but it will come at fifteen hundred
dollar price probably something I'm not
going to end up doing but everyone's
getting checked in it is the the
afternoon before the actual convention
starts the actual developers convention
starts and everyone is just getting
their press badges it's going to be a
madhouse tomorrow so luckily I'm going
to be here as bright and early as I
possibly can in order to bring you the
keynote with a rundown and showing you
exactly what Google has in store for us
we do know that wearable technology like
I said already is going to be a part of
this google i/o 2014 we're probably
going to see the LG G watch the Moto 360
and we're going to see a lot of
information as to what wearable
technology means in Google's eyes with
Android wear and I took a look at some
of the sessions that are available and I
will attend a few and i'll tell you what
i find from them or what i learned from
them rather but i did see a lot of full
section just on wearables and there's
actually a term that i noticed inside
one of the sessions descriptions and
that was ubiquitous technology yes
wearable technology is where you'll be
able to easily have something on your
wrist or on your eyes or anywhere like
even around my neck with my headphones
and you'll be able to easily access your
technology wherever you go no matter
where you are in an easy fashion
ubiquitous really is a term that might
best describe what wearable technology
can do for us and if technology becomes
ubiquitous well maybe Google will be the
one to lead the charge there's a lot of
great stuff that happens here at Google
i/o and last year I had a lot of fun and
I'm sure to have more even this year
especially with the after-hours party
them definitely going to give you
footage of tomorrow which it happens the
night after the first day so keep it
tuned here to android authority for all
of the best coverage drop us some likes
and subscribe to make sure you get all
of the coverage of this year's google
i/o because we are android authority and
we are your source for all things google
i/o</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
