by Oppo was definitely a sleek device
but it seemed to lose a couple of key
functions for the sake of slimming down
the newest Oppo does what it needs to
regain those capabilities but still
doesn't lose its slender profile so
let's see how it goes because it's Josh
of agar from Android Authority what's
going on everybody and this is the Oppo
r7 it's obvious at first glance what the
main story of the r7 is its thinness and
though it isn't as slender as the r5
from before it does get just enough to
regain the headphone jack that before
had to be adapted to the microUSB port a
metallic frame from the back houses the
rest of the device providing a bit of a
lip on the sides where the solid but
very thin power button and volume
rockers adorn the sides with the power
button being on the left though
capacitive keys lined the front though a
menu button is in place of a recent apps
button the metallic body has a subtle
golden hue in this particular unit and
the optic package is neatly placed on
the top left at just six point three
millimeters it's clear that the phone
needed to be just thick enough to fit
the headphone jack which just barely
makes the cut of the body but where some
discomfort might be expected with this
razor thin phone the lip provides a nice
grip and an overall heft in the weight
coils these concerns getting from side
to side is easy due to the lack of
thickness and gripping is thankfully not
that difficult as a result plenty of
phones these days are trying to get
slimmer and more beautiful but that can
be at the expense of some peace of mind
plenty of phone slip about and the fear
of even a small drop cracking glass or
causing scuffs and dents is common while
the r7 doesn't strike me as an
indestructible phone it also doesn't
feel particularly delicate either so I
won't be dropping this one anytime soon
of course but at least in my hand it's
it's solidly and doesn't slip around
very easily the over r7 is another great
looking phone in the line that doesn't
sacrifice much to achieve its size and
for this phone thin is definitely in a
5-inch display rounds out the size of
the Oppo r7 and it brings the standard
but high quality features expected 1080p
resolution at 445 pixels per inch were
pushed out of this AMOLED display
covered in Gorilla Glass 3 AMOLED works
to bring a higher level of saturation
than other types of panels and the
colours do show quite well in all tasks
viewing angles are all real
great though one thing noticed is a
prominent black bezel around the lid
panel nonetheless we found no problems
with sharpness in areas of text and
contrast kept blacks at a good level
neither over or under achieving gaming
remained a treat for the eyes as I spend
quite a bit of time with the wolf among
us and found associated noir game quite
lovely to watch and play and adventures
and video weren't a problem either this
might not be a particularly
overachieving display but going AMOLED
certainly helped elevate this otherwise
standard experience high standard but
standard nonetheless as has been the
case with many devices this year already
there is a focus on software
optimization rather than just a move
towards sheer power a generally
considered mid-range Snapdragon 615 runs
the Oppo r7 backed by the adrenal 405
and three gigabytes of RAM what's of
note however is that the 615 is an
octa-core processor a circumstance that
provides its own benefits despite the
mid-range designation and with color OS
2 at the helm there was a definite need
to keep the software as tidy as possible
for everyday usage happily this has felt
like the case transitions move about
without any incident and gating among
the different applications is easy and
for even a better example my gaming
experience with the wolf among us has
been a breeze with only the occasional
framerate issue between scenes my only
real problem with speed deals with the
recent apps screen though it's already a
nuisance to have to hold the Menu button
to get there scrolling in it and moving
from app to app can have a slight
stutter when each one has to be reloaded
completely hardly any typical experience
in day-to-day usage brought any trouble
and with how smooth color OS seems to be
now it's not hard to put the r7 among
the many phones who have made the proper
step forward in performance for the
daily perhaps the most important piece
of news in the hardware front is the
return of the headphone jack which was
omitted for size in the r5 the phone is
now just thick enough to accommodate it
and the audio coming from the jack is
standard ly good without any extra
enhancements baked in and while on the
subject of audio phone calls did seem to
come in loud and clear though I must say
that we did notice a few cut offs in the
signal from time to time and the
rear-facing speaker is also pretty loud
with a bit more attention given to the
lower ends which isn't usually typical
of units like this and a nice little
touch is a small dimple on the bottom of
the backing
lifts the phone up just enough to emit
it sound better off the surface this
Chinese Network version of the r7 posed
an all-too-familiar problem for me
though a lack of LTE connectivity but
thankfully connections to the HSPA+
network on t-mobile have been more than
adequate for daily usage in the states
and the r7 does come with a dual SIM
tray though one can be repurposed into a
microSD card slot for storage above the
built-in 16 gigabytes other connections
include the usual Bluetooth and sensors
but there is the omission of NFC which
is a bit of a bummer for anyone hoping
to tap tap their lives one nice thing
about the sensors on the r7 is that when
the phone knows it's covered up like say
in a pocket any screen on gestures or
button presses will be glossed over to
keep from this operation happening and
finally in battery a smaller body means
that the battery unit needs to fall in
line and 23 20 milliamp hours is the
capacity that up will put in here while
hardware and software optimizations can
definitely help they can only go so far
and thus it should be expected that
battery life is about as average as it
gets in heavy usage I was able to get
just over three hours of screen on time
which can stretch to a full day's worth
of life at lower levels of usage and yes
plenty of power modes are available to
aid in the longevity allowing from
everything from lower screen brightness
to even an under clocking of the
processor but the phone pretty much
never stretches to the predicted numbers
of hours in the battery app of course
Oppo is true to form in including a
vogue fast charger one of the first and
best performing around getting the phone
to about 70% in just half an hour oboes
typical camera application returns with
a number of modes that were all
introduced in their last few smartphones
hit that icon in the corner and plenty
of modes like HDR give creation and
Ultra HD return swiping the viewfinder
switches to video capture which is done
at 1080p resolution moving to the front
facing camera brings a typical beautify
mode but the more important detail is
the 8 megapixels self-portraits are thus
quite good as a result though it does
lose a bit of sharpness due to some
noise reduction in post ultimately
that's the story with the rear-facing 13
megapixel shooter - while photos
typically look quite good as they are
there are some nuances noticed in
typical shots including a fuzzy noise
reduction observed when zooming in
pictures are quite bright perhaps overly
so and plenty of them but the HDR
unfortunately doesn't help the dynamic
range get much better as the blown out
areas of a photo are only slightly
dialed back now this is a bummer because
HDR used to be quite effective in the
Oppo find 7 specifically but in the
right kind of situation colours do get a
small boost in saturation which might be
the only real takeaway from this mode
Ultra HD takes a number of the same
photo and creates a blown-up version of
it though we don't really see a big
improvement in the details it's still
about the same quality just a lot bigger
which might be useful for some people
otherwise colors are rendered pretty
well without an overt level of
saturation though it is important to use
the spot metering to find just the right
amount of exposure and white balance
which is a pet peeve of mine because
without some extra care you get the
overexposed shots that I mentioned
earlier and lower light shots suffer
more from the post-processing but
honestly they aren't the worst that
we've seen just above average which
ultimately is the story with this entire
device it's clear that the r7 is a solid
day to day phone and the camera falls in
line with that even with the 8 megapixel
front-facing shooter the experience
yields good but not exceptional results
as Oppo even said during our visit with
them at the phone's launch it's no
secret
color OS isn't the most loved version of
Android so with the 2.1 edition of the
OS some changes had to be made well it
might not look or perform too
differently from before it's definitely
much smoother which helps a little
I called color OS ethereal in the past
with its more muted color scheme and
slightly more spread out text but with
the nice AMOLED screen it only seems
right to change the look a bit which is
easy to do in the theme engine that now
has a robust network of themes
customization is one focus of colour
though with options to add media pages
for some extra fun and even different
transitions for the home screens which
is useful because you may be scrolling
through them a lot without an Abbe
drawer installed the notification
drop-down houses a drag down Quick
Settings panel though this also means
that notifications need to be pinched
out for expansion which isn't my
favorite thing and another pet peeve
some extras are baked in like the
typical gestures on a turned off screen
circle for camera double tapped awake
and any other gestures that are user
programmable for launching applications
easily
and if you're a fan of the app Twilight
for an easier time on the eyes that's
actually built in here with what's
called eye protection display that puts
a warm hue over everything when
triggered honestly I don't think color
OS is really all that bad
despite some issues in translation from
time to time and the lack of an app
drawer I kind of like how it handles
itself though it could use a bit of
polish as usual any user that lets color
oh I stick around should find a smooth
flowing and operational version of
Android in the Oppo r7 the Oppo r7 is
available for pre-order now on the Oppo
style website for 399 dollars with
shipment starting in early July for that
price the r7 is actually quite the deal
especially when you consider its sleek
and attractive build so Oppo has proven
time and again that they are not only
capable of thinking outside of the box
but also excelling within the confines
of it to users high standards well might
be the best part about the r7 is that
Oppo is trying to keep the middle path
with a phone that prioritizes great
aesthetic and feel with the best
possible capabilities fit for its price
point
no the Snapdragon 615 is an exactly
future proof but you want to really feel
that along the way and though the camera
isn't the best one we've used it's more
than enough for typical let's say social
media users and finally color OS get
some of the updates it's needed even if
they weren't necessarily in the looks
department the price point won't break
the bank but once you get this one in
your hand it does feel like it might and
that's why we give the Oppo r7 a seal of
approval large and abilities and pretty
much nowhere else as always thank you
guys very much for watching and I hope
you enjoyed this review of the Oppo r7
it's definitely a competitively priced
device though there are some phones out
there that are priced a little bit less
that provide a very similar experience
so it's up to you whether or not the
build and the quality of the build are
really enough for you to shell out $400
for us we do think that it is quite the
deal so the r7 just might be the phone
you're looking for for a great daily
driver nonetheless keep it tuned here
