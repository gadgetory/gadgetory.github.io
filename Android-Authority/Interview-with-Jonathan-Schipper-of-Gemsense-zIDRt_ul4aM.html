here from CS 2017 it's been a marathon
I'm just here with Jonathan shipper he
is I believe the founder of a company
called gem sense I am a co-founder ok I
want to say a huge thank you to my
partner availabe Novick and our guys
Mick Ireland Tomer you guys Rock we
couldn't do that without you
yeah well this isn't the Oscar so let's
talk about the technology ok so
basically this is stuff for nerds and
for smart people and like nerd dads and
stuff makers enthusiasts hobbyists right
people who want to I'll tell ya okay our
big business is working with companies
who really just want to put some smarts
into their devices yeah this is one of
our development boards and this is
another one that comes with a battery
and the idea is you get easy access to
extensions so you can build any smart
object but this is the heart of the
system
it's basically a tiny system on a model
with Bluetooth motion sensors and the
processor and transmit all the data to
your smart device be the phone tablet
smart glasses whatever and so we embed
these sensors these sensor kits in
accessories such as controllers we made
this almost two years ago all kinds of
small objects VR guns swords driving
wheels pedals whatever guys made a spill
the spindle in one of our hackathons
smart rings oti is a big payments
company they just took out a smart ring
platform based on our jamming the
highlight that we're showing here in
Sirius is the chair it's it's by Nova
style group what they do is they they
actually masters of economy tree they
make smart they make office chairs great
office chairs yeah but they wanted to up
their game with some sensors so to get
the ergonomic tree reading all the time
and improve the smart office you can
improve comfort and the efficiency both
by controlling the lights heating in the
office by knowing where people are
sitting and how hard they are hmm and of
course people over time you can give
them feedback and how they sit in fact
oh you forgot oh man we're the way there
so pitching y'all yeah so what we what
about the first word to virtual reality
game you had built into the Hat there
yeah okay so that one yeah I'll tell we
have like 14 sensors in the chair yeah
we measure temperature humidity angles
height and so and pressure also so we
know how you're sitting and also on the
backrest okay and so we use that sensors
to give all that economic data but we
said okay we can show a bit more yeah we
already have a little sensors and we
deal a lot with VR and we said we'll
give a relaxation game based on VR so
you can actually apply a flame with a
yeah fly a plane fly plane and when you
lean back it goes okay faster so the
chairs part you know you you create all
these wicked sensors but let's just talk
about the things for hobbyists like
yesterday in the demo you showed us so
you put the sensors in the gun right and
then connected it obviously to the gear
VR and it was basically it so we so as a
as a developer as a maker how do I find
you how do I find your kits
okay you go to jeomsun cool jumps and
stalk cool or didn't GM sense wait we
have a charge when it is not cool or you
can go to dev GS that was great so
people can buy this hardware these
sensors and then they can access your
SDKs on github it's all available online
we have Windows Android iOS Linux 3d
environments unity okay unreal and you
can connect basically right connect get
data or you drag a plug-in and it starts
moving unity was we show a lot of VR and
unity AR is it pretty easy for somebody
with not so much experience in coding to
build something you have to be like a
coder like a game developer or a coder
you have to know your a whatever but you
don't have to understand anything about
the hardware
yeah we give hardware as a service to
the tapirs the complexity of the
hardware I came from the developers side
okay I'm not that big of a hardware guy
my partner Harvey is more of the
hardware guy okay and are you guys of
course and so I wanted a platform I was
one of those Google glass explorers yeah
and I wanted to create a smart ring
because the interface was yeah yes
okay we're being real yeah
I still love glass I love Google I'm a
fan but no but there's no interfaces so
you have all you need these peripherals
right even something like this like an
emotion tracking with a camera basically
I'm camera on it no this one doesn't
have motion sensors yeah it was for a
previous model that's why this being
someone was a ring on and augmented
reality of it reality could someone took
the other ring but we had a smaller ring
that we just made and this is actually
the board it powers that up so how many
IQ points do you need to actually be
able to do this because I'm totally
confused right now just all you need I'm
sure yeah all you need is raising the
right code yeah you build your app what
we saw is we have a big maker community
in Israel around wearables and IOT it's
called next icon meetup and then when we
saw that a lot of people are trying to
grade the smart devices yeah but they
get stuck in creating their own boards
yeah very long process you need experts
and but very expensive yeah takes at
least a year and a half millions of
dollars it could cost and that's if you
do it right that's not gonna attract any
makers yeah so what we did is we
developed a development kit like this
yeah just click the board on it it gets
power and then it's that's transmitting
right away and then you can easily
connect more sensors to it and just
write code for it that's it you just
create your application connect get data
it's with the three lines of code you
can get started on Android I love it all
right well listen I want to say big
thanks you know for what you're doing
for the Android community really I know
no thanks to you guys I'm part of my
inspiration always trying to find the
cool stuff for the Nerds right and for
all all kinds of people you know Android
it I mean she's kind of amazing and Neal
I don't have children but if I ever do I
would want them to learn how to code I
want them to learn to speak Chinese
I want them to be a nerd because nerds
are cool and yeah this is all a little
bit beyond my britches but I know that
there are a lot of people like on our
team like Robert Riggs and Gary Sims who
would would love to play this stuff and
it's pretty much it's almost unlimited
I'll leave you one kit oh really yes
yeah yeah absolutely we can do follow-up
attack anyway so Jonathan shipper here
with gem sense darts document reporting
live from CES 2017 just wrapping up for
our coverage thank you very much for
watching check out gemstone star cool
for more information on all this
interesting stuff and thank you very
much for your time sir
yes I don't know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
