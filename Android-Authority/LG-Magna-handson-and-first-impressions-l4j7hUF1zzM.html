Android authority and we are live here
at Mobile World Congress 2015 hanging
out with LG taking a look at their
mid-range devices here today and this is
the LG Magna and this is one of their
more top tiered mid-range devices but
starting with the design of this phone
you will notice that it features some
very similar design aesthetics to other
LG devices like the G flex 2 you'll
notice that it has a slight curvature to
the body here but the curvature is
really more for aesthetics it doesn't
actually flex like the G flex to the
screen is not P OLED is just regular
Gorilla Glass and but it is made of
plastic so very similar styling cues
from other LG devices and this is the 4G
version but it does come in a 3G only
version as well and the 4G version will
have this foe brushed metal looking back
whereas the 3G model will just have more
of a plain plastic back to it but it has
a lot of the same design cues like the
rear facing buttons that you see here
but just to go over some of these specs
really fast you're looking at a 5-inch
display on the front here 294 ppi and on
the back is an 8 megapixel camera a 5
megapixel camera on the front it's being
powered by a quad-core 1.2 gigahertz
processor it does have LTE 8 gigabytes
of internal storage 1 gigabyte of RAM
and it is running on the latest version
of Android Android lollipop 5.0.2
and I can go go ahead and show you that
really quick here under the software
information and you can see that right
there so a mid-range phone but you're
getting the latest version of Android
and a lot of the same design aesthetics
and build quality that you would expect
from LG which is great and you have all
lot of the same features of the GUI like
knock on and knock code built into here
and all in all it's a pretty solid
device it's going to be priced very
affordably and with LTE it's definitely
a pretty pretty great device all around
and so far it seems to be pretty snappy
and we
Pontiff from just a few minutes that
we've been playing with it so seems to
be a pretty solid device for LG but this
has been a quick look of the LG Magna
we're still here at Mobile World
Congress 2015 it is just getting started
so stay tuned for the rest of our
coverage because we are your source for
all things Android and Mobile World
Congress 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
