with Android Authority today we'll be
checking out ZTE slate Astapor double
smartphone available on Cricket Wireless
this is our full video review of the ZTE
grand X max - max - reminds us a bit of
the recently announced tax on 7 with its
subtle curve to help with handling and
similar port and button locations
unlike the Exxon 7 however the max 2 is
constructed entirely of plastic you
could even say that the rear covers
gloss is similar to what Samsung used on
the galaxy s4 nice in the hand but
definitely a fingerprint magnet it's
also not the best at resisting scratches
unfortunately sadly my unit did suffer a
1 meter drop onto concrete and while the
plastic fared well the right side of the
band chipped considerably so you may
want to pick up a case if you're clumsy
like me the ZTE color scheme and
patterned rear are both remarkably
subtle but nice nonetheless
and although the Max 2 is pretty big
it's fairly manageable in the hand
thanks to it being a bit narrower than
similarly sized smartphones like the
Nexus 6 the three illuminated capacitive
keys are customizable meaning that you
can choose where you like the back
button to go which is a great setting to
have the max - beautiful large 6 inch
1080p display offers a great immersive
media consumption experience if you
watch a lot of videos TV shows or movies
you'll really enjoy this phone and for
the price the display is one of the best
we've seen has great color reproduction
very good contrast just the right amount
of saturation and it's reasonably
readable outdoors the two and a half d
curved glass is also a very nice touch
the Snapdragon 615 successor that is the
Snapdragon 617 is powering the max 2 and
is complemented by 2 gigabytes of RAM
overall the max 2 is a solid performer
is not going to do particularly well in
benchmark tests but it's still pretty
good day to day with only a few UI
hiccups the adrenal 405 GPU may hinder
the phone's gaming performance with
our load times and some minor frame
drops during gameplay but even high-end
games like asphalt 8 are still very
playable call quality with a ZTE seem to
be excellent on the Cricut network there
is 16 gigabytes of internal storage that
can be expanded up to 64 gigabytes with
a microSD card although we were happy to
see ZTE include a quick charge 2.0
enabled USB type-c port which is the
newer now reversible standard we were
disappointed with the lack of a
fingerprint reader the vast majority of
smartphones this year have shipped with
readers so it seems a bit odd not to
include one even though this is an
affordable offering the single side
firing speaker on the Mac's - sounds
great
only minor distortion at higher volumes
there is also a hi-fi audio chipset
onboard which will appeal to those
wanting to use headphones with normal
usage the grand x max 2 has no trouble
reaching about 5 hours of screen on time
thanks to its 3400 milliamp hour battery
during one of our tests however I use
Google Maps for about an hour and a half
and then had a 40 minute Google Hangouts
video call which resulted in just under
3 hours of screen on time despite this I
was never able to kill the grand X next
- before the end of my day
lighter users may even be able to
achieve two full days of use ZTE has
included a secondary rear camera which
appears to help the software bokeh mode
unfortunately this mode did not perform
very well in our testing there doesn't
appear to be any other use for the dual
camera setup sadly the images produced
by the grand x max twos 13 megapixel
rear camera are disappointing and below
average even for the price many of the
images that I took are noisy despite
good lighting the images are also very
soft especially near the corners to be
fair some of these images are just
simply out of focus but that can be
blamed on the phone slow and accurate
autofocus in addition color reproduction
can be horrendously bad especially when
capturing warmer colors like red and
orange low-light performance was also
below average for the price the phone
couldn't focus correctly for virtually
every shot and when it did images came
out extra noisy
the shame that the camera doesn't hold
up well to ZTE s camera app is actually
quite good offering an easy-to-use
automatic shooting experience there is
also a built-in time-lapse &amp;amp; panorama
modes as well as a surprisingly
comprehensive manual mode the max2 runs
a lightly skinned version of android
6.0.1 marshmallow outside of a few
notable UI and functional changes the
software here is pretty much stock
Android the most major change is likely
the lock screen since the unlocking
mechanism is to press and hold rather
than to swipe off although we generally
like this idea we found that the phone
would unlock itself while in a pants
pocket opening apps and placing calls on
more than a few occasions one thing to
note regarding our Cricket Wireless
model is the bloatware that comes
pre-loaded it's not terrible there's
only about 10 apps that are
pre-installed most of which are games
plus you can uninstall all but three
which appear to be helpful for cricket
subscribers anyway you can purchase the
grand xmax 2 in blue exclusively from
Cricket Wireless for $200 unfortunately
there's currently only one 16 gigabyte
model available and those wishing to
store large files will have to rely on
the expandable storage up to 64
gigabytes the ZTE grand X max 2 is an
excellent choice for those on cricket
looking for a large affordable
smartphone although we would have liked
to see a much better camera stronger
build quality and the fingerprint reader
it's hard to fault the grand x max 2 for
its price max to exceeds where it needs
to with a beautiful display great
battery life and an excellent software
experience if you don't take many images
you will likely be very happy with this
phone thank you for watching our video
