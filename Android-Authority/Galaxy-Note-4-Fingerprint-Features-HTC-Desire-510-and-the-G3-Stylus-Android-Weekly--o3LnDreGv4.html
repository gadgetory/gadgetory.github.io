is Jace and with the plethora of
smartwatches that have been released as
of late it's hard not to get excited but
they do all have one thing in common or
most of them and that's that they are
designed to augment and accompany your
smartphone but when do we get to the
point where their SmartWatch can begin
to replace your smartphone all together
that's what Samsung has tried to do or
at least begin to do with the DRS
SmartWatch so let's look at the pros and
cons among the pros are that there's no
need to carry two mobile devices and
second you'll stand out from the crowd
with the gear s and finally a phone or
phone replacement that reportedly has
two days of battery life now the cons
low resolution 360 x 480 the two inch
display isn't ideal for media
consumption in gaming Tizen has
considerably fewer apps than Android and
modest specs and modest storage space
now I could imagine some uncomfortable
moments in public with this SmartWatch /
phone
well just love to say I love you come
shoot the word I love your burger dead
the love your burger did I give you
kisses I love your burger dead but I
have fun with your friends shut up now
to be fair those are the rumored specs
surrounding the gear s and its attempt
to replace your smartphone but a guy can
hope right now moving on a news
surrounding the Galaxy Note 4 and its
fingerprint scanning features the note 4
will reportedly include screen lock
private mode samsung account
verification and paypal payments all
features present on the s5 and the elsa
and made possible by the same synaptics
natural ID swipe based fingerprint
sensor found in both devices among the
new features is the fingerprint
shortcuts which lets you assign a
shortcut to a specific app or piece of
functionality for instance swiping your
index finger could take you straight to
the camera while using your thumb could
unlock the phone now to be fair this
feature is said to be linked to certain
services and apps and not necessarily
meant to be a total replacement for your
password protection like many of you
might be hoping for now one of the most
common questions we get here in android
authority is what is the best mid-range
android phone while HTC is hoping that
you will consider the HTC Desire 510 so
what can we expect from the device in
addition to the Snapdragon 410 CPU the
desire offers a one gigabyte of ram 8
gigabytes of storage a microSD card slot
5 megapixel rear facing camera and a
2100 milliamp hour battery LTE Android
KitKat out of the box and a 4.7 inch
display with a resolution of 854 x 480
now besides that painfully bad
resolution
the desire 510 could if price correctly
compete with the Moto G we can help now
for those be who lusted after the LG g3
but didn't like the flagship price tag
you might want to consider the LG
stylist it's all about the ten people LG
has made the g3 stylist fairly priced by
taking the LG g3 and performing a few
downgrades to get it into the budget mid
range of devices the equipped 5.5 inch
IPS display is 960 x 540 resolution
instead of the 2560 x 1440 of the full
g3 you'll also find one gigabytes of ram
8 gigabytes of internal storage and a 13
megapixel camera on top of a whopping
three thousand milliamp hour battery all
powered by android 4.4 point2 thanks for
watching edward army my name is Jace and
I thought I would end off by responding
to the whole ALS ice bucket challenge
nominations I got a number of them thank
you for thinking of me and it is
certainly a worthwhile cause needs lots
of donations for the research it's a
nasty condition and I hope that it gets
the research that it needs however I
have worked with three charities in the
past and most of them not all and in
many cases but not all the money that is
donated is not spent the way that I
might like and that's one and number two
I mean the ice bucket challenge has like
just taken over and I suspect I don't
wanna make a judgment but I suspect that
some people are doing it because it's
the thing to do not because they
genuinely care about donating to ALS I
mean a lot of people don't even know
that that was the point so I have chosen
charities that I donate to one in
particular but I work with that charity
and on a first-hand basis so I know
where that money goes and that's just
how I want to be effective so you want
to forget it my my brother's here Jost
Joe in the tech ninja Kevin lon and
Chris I'll working hard to deliver the
best android content on the web
and we got to finish off that you only
have a few more hours before I shoot the
last Android QA that will deal with the
Great Leap Forward I gave a huge hint in
last week's Android QA so you might have
a few more hours deliver the best answer
someone already has got it they gave a
good answer it was a length Lancer it
was well thought out but you may be able
to give a better answer so don't give up
there's only a few hours left to win
that fifty dollar google play gift card
see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
