s4 and even if you are did you still
wish it had a let's say stronger form
and feel well the new s4 variant is here
and we're here to tell you what's what
between these two versions age Joshua
regard from Android I thought of what's
going on everybody and this is the
Samsung Galaxy s4 versus the galaxy s4
active to be honest you wouldn't be far
off saying that the galaxy s4 active is
highly similar to its original
counterpart the best way of putting it
is that the original plastic body of the
s4 has been beefed up let's look at the
s4 real quick it is the plastic clad
tried-and-true design with a removable
back cover that is pretty flimsy a
silver spine connects the front and back
there is the home button on the front
flanked by soft keys for back and menu
the buttons on the sides are classic
Samsung and overall it is a safe design
that plenty of people either love or
hate by now the main feat of the s4 was
taking a five inch screen and making it
as easy to handle as possible after all
the general size is the same as this
previous Galaxy s3
okay so now we have the s4 active at a
glance back to back you can see that
this phone is just a little bit longer a
little bit thicker and it's actually
heavier in the hand it's available in a
few different colors and instead of
having a silver spine this color comes
from the back to the front and is
visible in the very rim or on the phone
all of the buttons are in the same place
but now have harder shells for a
definitely better feel perhaps they
aren't as elegant especially the new
tactile back and menu buttons but they
feel great and bring no question to
their quality the port on the bottom has
a small cover now so over time it could
break off the real action is on the back
four screws on each rubberized corner
surround a smaller plastic cover that is
slightly textured for feel but
definitely seems sturdier than the one
found in the original you can tell it is
meant to really seal the phone shut
because of all the loud snaps you hear
putting it back in plenty of people are
sick of Samsung's plastic choices now
and while it can be argued that the
active didn't really rewrite the script
it definitely improved on it
it's meteor in the hand gives a more
reassuring feel as opposed to the
nimbleness of the original that's what
it comes down to as far as feel goes for
looks it depends on your hate or love
for the tried-and-true Samsung plastic
design
personally the only thing I didn't like
about the s4 active I got was the color
but with a gray variant out there that
probably doesn't matter as much
I do believe however that the active can
better attract the eyes than the
all-too-familiar
original s4 the display story actually
does differ as the s4 active point with
a different route rather than the usual
Samsung fare the original s4 sports the
Super AMOLED screen popularized by
Samsung and is capable of 1080p
resolution at 441 PPI it is well known
for having a high saturation that does
help contrast but otherwise makes colors
pop out and punch you in the face it's a
great performer that makes a great
example of how good 5-inch screens can
be but in the s4 active the LCD display
was on the menu but it does perform very
well it has the same capabilities of
1080p resolution and 441 PPI so
sharpness and high resolution media are
easy the LCD screen has its advantages
like being somewhat brighter
however the active screen is covered in
Gorilla Glass 2 making it arguably not
as protective as the version found on
the s4 but its main disadvantage is the
lack of saturation
more specifically the lowered saturation
does also lower overall contrast dark
hues have a lighter profile to them and
you can just tell that the colors on the
s4 seem to have just a little bit more
dimension the LCD on the active is still
great and sits among the best LCDs out
there if you really want your colors as
vibrant and accented as possible the
galaxy s4 Super AMOLED does get the job
done really these points feel somewhat
like nitpicking though as general users
will still have a great time with the
similarly performing LCD on the s4
active what's really great about the s4
active is that it comes with the same
processing package as the original both
of these phones support the Snapdragon
600 clocked in at 1.9 gigahertz and they
are backed by the audrina 320 and two
gigabytes of ram performance and
practice yields no real differences the
score is an n2 to tell a slightly
different story but perhaps a lack of
optimization or even the LCD screen
aren't to blame for the lower score in
the active but don't worry performance
is comparable and you should have no
issues either way the active also took
from the s4 pretty much every bit of
hardware that the original had with the
exception of the meters for measuring
temperature and humidity and s-health
otherwise every sensor for hand-eye and
air gestures makes a return along with
the IR blaster and the usual bevy of
bits like Bluetooth and NFC for sbeam
the active only comes in a 16 gigabyte
version but you can still expand the
memory with microSD cards either way so
the obvious difference here is the water
and dust resistance indeed the s4 active
is made for the klutz and all of us who
spills drinks or god forbid is prone to
dropping phones in the toilet it is not
idiot-proof though as the instructions
clearly state that the active can handle
half an hour in one meter depths any
more than that and it might sustain
damage what I did notice about the water
resistance was that the uncovered
headphone jack at the top did work a
little weird with a little bit of water
slowly drying in it the headphone sensor
kept firing off as the phone told me I
had headphones in it when I didn't it
eventually stopped so water probably
eventually either dried up or filtered
out obviously if you really want that
extra layer of safety the s4 active is
the phone for you don't think it's a
super rugged phone as the screen could
still crack and enough water can still
make a break it's got you covered on
accidents and maybe just a little bit
more than that
both phones port 2600 milliamp power
units and provide similar performance
power saving features are the same
across the board and standby times
remain very long perhaps because of the
LCD screen though the active loses some
time in full endurance tests but it
still rivals the general day's life of
the original s4 the last part that the
active cut back on was the camera but it
wasn't all that big a change the
original s4 has the 13 megapixel shooter
that yields great results with high
vibrancy and good detail there are a ton
of modes that you should all know about
already by now but if you don't you can
check out my full s4 review 8 megapixels
were given to the s4 active and the only
other cut was the dual recording
function as far as quality goes the
smaller resolution does knock back the
quality a tad but it's not very
noticeable the performance is still on
par with the s4 with great detail in
well-lit environments low-light
performance either way is only decent
but that was not surprising of course
the main attraction of the actives
camera is the aqua mode with the light
water resistance you won't really go
diving with it
but you can capture pool party memories
just fine the mode kills touch screen
functions when
water making the volume rock or your
shutter button if underwater shooting is
a big part of your summer plans the s4
active can get all that done for you
otherwise the speck hungry would
probably end up going for the higher
performing original there really isn't
much comparison to be had in the
software department what the very same
version of TouchWiz as the s4 the active
brings you the same general experience
that you might already be familiar with
if you do need a rundown of all the
software features you can check out my
original s4 review and finally we have
price the s4 active is only currently
available on AT&amp;amp;T for the price of 199
on a contract the same still goes for
the s4 though discounts are starting the
surface unlocked they remain around the
same price at seven hundred dollars give
or take and so there you have it the
first s4 variant is a version of the
original that can withstand some
punishment otherwise both are so similar
that general users will probably find
the same experience either way if you
wanted a better feeling s4 the active is
what you've been waiting for and if for
whatever reason your lifestyle requires
a phone that can take some bumps and
splashes same story the s4 is the
bleeding edge in this comparison so that
would be your trade off in the end it's
nice that if you felt like you were
settling for the s4 there's a new
version out there to pique your interest
if you want to see the full reviews for
both of these devices I'll have some
