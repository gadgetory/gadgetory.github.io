Hindy the android authority app guy
January 2016 is coming to a close and
that means it's time to take a look at
the best android games that were
released this month call of Champions is
a new MOBA that pits you and two others
against three opponents to see who can
take control of the map first each match
lasts about five minutes and you can
play an unlimited number of matches
without paying a dime there are 15 total
champions that you can unlock and each
one can be customized with a variety of
talents that can be learned it's a solid
experience with decent graphics and one
of the better MOBAs on android cave or
not is a minimal puzzle adventure game
where you must lead a ship through
various tunnels in order to collect
various treasures the game features
randomly generated maps that makes each
play different from the last one and the
control scheme is easy enough for anyone
to understand there are a total of five
areas each one with increasing
difficulty and the graphics aren't bad
for the retro style that was implemented
best of all there are no in-app
purchases crash-lands is an adventure
game where you play as an intergalactic
trucker who gets stranded on an alien
planet you'll venture forth to deliver
packages but you'll also fight monsters
build a base and level up your character
to make them more powerful there is also
a crafting system where you can make
approximately 500 different items using
stuff you find lying around and you can
even build yourself a home base there is
a storyline as well that does a pretty
good job of pushing the game forward
it's four dollars and ninety-nine cents
with no in-app purchases the latest
entry into the cut the rope series has
already made quite a large splash on
Android in a month's time it's
accumulated over 1 million downloads and
carries a fantastic 4.7 rating which is
surprisingly high for a freemium game in
this version you'll return with most of
the basic mechanics from the prior
titles except in this one you can
transform into things fight bosses and a
whole lot more if you're in the market
for a puzzle game or a time waster you
should definitely consider this one I
have no mouth is a horror puzzle game
that is a port from the classic 1995 pc
game of the same name in this title you
are essentially tortured by a computer
AI that took over humanity long ago
you'll play through the torture of five
survivors with the premise being that
one day you may be free this game is
really
and also features various control
options soundtracks and even variable
graphics it also comes with challenging
puzzles alternate endings and a whole
lot more it also has no in-app purchases
Lego Nexo Knights is a free hack and
slash adventure game where you must save
the kingdom from the evil jestro and his
army of lava monsters the game itself
has decent graphics and mechanics which
should be easy enough for everyone to
learn you'll be battling bad guys
collecting nexo powers to increase your
strength and a whole lot more it is
entirely free to play with no in-app
purchases although you can buy actual
real life accessories that can be
scanned into the game if you want to
loot and legends is a card collecting
and board game hybrid game that is based
on card hunter for PC which was
developed by magic the gathering creator
Richard Garfield it is a fun little game
it doesn't take itself too seriously and
you'll find smatterings of pop culture
pizza and other fun little things to
play you'll build a card deck for
various characters and then challenge
opponents in order to win loot the
in-app purchases are pretty expensive
but the game is pretty decent overall
pocket Morty's is the latest game from
adult swim and it's based on the cult
hit show Rick and Morty this is
essentially a pokemon spoof you play as
Rick and you must collect various
Morty's that have various abilities and
then fight other Rick's that have their
own set of Morty's there is a storyline
and it's just as ridiculous as the show
itself so fans will feel right at home
it's free to play with in-app purchases
so it won't cost you anything to try it
out the room 3 is going to be without a
doubt one of the must-have android games
of 2016 it's a beautifully done
point-and-click puzzle game with clever
mechanics fantastic graphics and a dark
arcane storyline each object is a puzzle
within a puzzle which keeps players
guessing and there are even alternate
endings to help reduce the problem of
the game being too short it's four
dollars and ninety-nine cents which some
have lamented as expensive but this is
about as good as it gets in a puzzle
game worms 4 is the latest in the worms
franchise and it looks to be a pretty
decent game it follows the core
mechanics of the worms series which is a
mixture of puzzle and shooter where you
must defeat the enemy by strategically
shooting in various places this one also
includes online multiplayer shorter
missions for faster play 80
single-player missions and a ton of new
weapons and upgrades available it's an
overall solid experience with a ton of
content to enjoy
