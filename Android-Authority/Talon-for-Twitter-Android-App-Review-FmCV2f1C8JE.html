Hindi the Android a thority app guy
talent for Twitter is a hot new Twitter
app with a good design and some awesome
features but is it worth all the hype in
this video we're gonna find out
talent falls in the middle when it comes
to functionality it isn't the most
feature heavy Twitter app out there but
its world's better than the stock
Twitter app and for a lot of reasons to
start you can do all the twittering
things that Twitter users can do like
browse trends send tweets respond
retweet favorite things use lists browse
your timeline and all of the other basic
features where this app really shines
though is the under the hood tweaks you
can have it stream tweets live instead
of having a time to refresh if you
prefer you can customize your
notifications add your themes add emoji
support in the settings access a built
in browser and YouTube player and you
can even choose between the standard
tile and layout and the hangouts layout
it also supports two twitter accounts
for you multi account users out there
one of the more unique features is
talent pool which is an ongoing process
that shows up in your notifications that
opens a pop-out window so you can check
twitter more quickly this is awesome for
two reasons one it allows you faster
access to twitter and two it shows up in
the notifications but not in the status
bar bbm could learn a thing or two from
this app there is also a themer engine
so eventually there will be a lot more
options as to what theme you want to run
for now the standard three are available
including black dark and white there is
also a dash clock widget Google style
pull-to-refresh
and the standard slide-out menus on the
left side in terms of design talent is
all aces in our book it follows many of
the Android standard design elements
like the pull-to-refresh the slide-out
left side menus the sliding tabs and
more the timeline is easy to read the
pop-up menu looks good and the theme
engine is sure to bring a lot of custom
themes that people can use to augment
their experience further simply put it
looks as nice as it works the tablet
interface is pretty much the regular
interface with the menus extended this
allows for easier navigation and uses
the extra screen real estate more
efficiently otherwise it's pretty much
the same as the phone layout and all of
its design goodness so here's what stood
out to us as the best parts of the
application talent pool allows quick
access to Twitter without opening the
app or interrupting what you're doing we
especially like that it shows up in the
notification bar without adding an icon
to the status bar the design is gorgeous
and it only helps to augment the
experience things are proportionate and
you're never more than a swipe
and a click away from accessing any part
of the app the theme engine is fairly
powerful and it's going to be sweet when
themers can get in there and start
making custom themes just like any other
app talent isn't perfect here are a few
things we didn't like so much it's still
a little rough around the edges we
managed to get it to force closed on us
once while sending a tweet and it took
us a couple of attempts to tweet out a
picture also refreshing takes a little
bit longer than average sometimes the
only other issue that we could find is a
lack of some hashtag specific features
there is no hashtag autocomplete which
is essential for Twitter these days the
developer has stated that he's working
on this but that there are bigger fish
to fry first so it will be there
eventually the bottom line here is that
this is one very beautifully done
Twitter app we've no doubt that the
issues mentioned earlier are simply
early jitters and that the bugs and
kinks will be worked out eventually
aside from those small problems we
really couldn't find anything negative
to say about Talent it's a dollar
ninety-nine in the Google Play Store and
frankly there are a lot of things that
you can spend $2 on that aren't as
awesome as this the only potential
problem down the road is of Twitter's
dastardly token limit will cut this
app's life short like it did with carbon
if you like it we recommend picking it
up right now before anything can go
wrong we put a link in the written
companion in the video description
