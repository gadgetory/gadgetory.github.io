Google i/o is around the corner that
also means that we're going to be
hearing a lot more about Android wear I
mean just look at how much the gee watch
was played up at the recent LG event and
with all that in mind I decided to get
back to the SmartWatch game and on my
trusty pebble once again and while this
operating system may not necessarily be
based on Android it certainly does
enhance the Android experience so some
of you out there have been wanting to
know so this is Joshua our firm Android
authority and this is how I Android with
my pebble smartwatch now before I
actually get into it you did hear me say
that I just got back into the SmartWatch
game well the reason for that is because
I actually haven't worn my pebble in
quite a while I actually had really
anything on my wrist for a little while
but when I wanted to wear my pebble once
again I decided to change it up to look
a little bit you might remember that
grunge cuff that I used all the time
well I change that up by finding a wide
body band by Richard Tracy brand and you
can see it right here now what I got is
the silicone version of Amazon which
means it can get wet and it is actually
pretty soft and really comfortable so if
you've noticed in the last couple of
videos that's the strap that I've been
rocking on my pebble and it now pretty
much never leaves my wrist so let's
start off with the simplest of the
simple watch faces for the longest time
I never really installed any watch faces
on my pebble because the built-in text
watch was already good enough for me
already
but recently I've changed my tune in one
case because the design of the watch
face was really good and in the other
case because I needed some extra
functionality and utility out of it I'll
start with digit time which is a symbol
but stylistic way of displaying the time
the 24 hour format is shown with the
hour in the middle and the numbers
appearing accordingly in the circle
around it it's to the point simple and
looks pretty damn cool hitting down to
simply move to the next watch face
brings up battery lifetime now the
pebble can go for days before needing a
charge but it doesn't show you the
battery level unless it's under
something like 15% I'd rather know ahead
of time if I need my pebble charger with
me when let's say traveling for a few
days
so having battery lifetime allows me to
see the total percentage left as well as
the supposed number of days that it will
last on a charge
that number of days is actually pretty
arbitrary but I found it pretty accurate
for my own usage the first actual app
I'm going to show you I feel addresses
an issue that a lot of people tend to
try and fix the moment they get their
pebbles and that's the notifications the
Notification Center has been given an
update with the 2.0 and 2.1 firmware
that allows you to look back at the
history of the notifications that have
come to your watch which is great but
you might need a little bit more control
and that's the reason why we have a lot
of notification replacement applications
the one that I use is the Notification
Center which allows you to completely
pick which applications will send their
notices to the pebble and which one
should not for example I don't need my
wrist to blow up for every person who
likes my photo and Instagram so I
usually leave it off for even further
control you can set keywords in the
regex filters area that the app will
look for any notification with those
keywords will not be routed and all of
this is done in the companion app that
has to be installed on your actual phone
further options allow you to change the
look of the notifications themselves as
well as set quiet hours and if you ever
get a pebble make sure you set quiet
hours for when you say asleep because it
actually does help with your battery
life this next app can easily be
considered another essential especially
for all your media people it's called
music boss basically it's a robust media
remote control that can customize the
built-in music controller in your pebble
or you can use its version instead I
keep it set to just use the original
built-in controller because already
adding things like double pressing
buttons for volume control or to change
which media player it's controlling
provide the extras that I require
already music boss also requires that an
app be installed and set up on your
phone basically so it knows what
applications it should be controlling
and also so you can have a hub for
customizing the experience now this next
type might not be essential for
everybody but it certainly has become so
for me the last time that I used my
pebble as extensively as I am right now
there wasn't really an application quite
like this that allowed you to look at
navigation on your watch now the app is
called nav me and it does require you to
install an application on your phone as
well primarily so that it can detect
when navigation is being run and it
costs $2.99 after you do a 7-day trial
but $2.99 is a small price to pay when
you have
your next moves in navigation being
shown on your watch so you don't have to
fidget with your phone a vibration when
you are certain distances away from the
next move give you ample warning to
check so that you don't miss your turn
and if anything this is a lot better
than listening to the navigation voice
when it interrupts your music as we get
into perhaps slightly less essential
applications I wanted to give you the
multi timer now for some people out
there timers are very important for our
daily lives especially if you need to
have a bunch of them running at once and
that's exactly what the multi timer does
the primary uses I have for it or for
the Pomodoro Technique for example if
you don't know already the Pomodoro
Technique is a time management method
where you set a timer for 25 minutes and
only focus on the one thing you need to
focus on for that whole amount of time
when done you can take a five-minute
break and catch up with your
distractions after doing a certain
number of Pomodoro is you can take a
longer break of maybe 15 minutes so as
you can see here I have two timers for
the 25-minute work period and the
5-minute rest period and then I have
another timer set for three minutes when
I'm brewing cups of tea the best part
about this multi tamara is that it tries
to store the timer data in the memory of
the watch so you can leave the app for a
bit and when you come back it hasn't
reset this is a problem that tends to
plagued plenty of timer apps out there
as data storage isn't all that easy on
the fly on the pebble now if there's one
thing I have a lot of trouble with these
days it's getting up early one thing
that I really wish I could do is just
get up at 6 a.m. in the morning be able
to go to the gym right away and then get
started with my entire day but it
doesn't always happen but at the very
least I do have apps to try and help me
now while the sleep as Android
application doesn't necessarily succeed
every single time the watch app
certainly enhances what could be the
thing that gets me up in the morning
install the watch app and when you
select it in your pebble the phone apps
sleep tracking will use the watch data
with the gyroscope built in to track
your sleep when your alarm goes off the
watch will vibrate when your phone goes
nuts at the very least not needing to
have the phone by your side when you're
sleeping is a big plus but the powerful
vibration of the watch will bother you
enough to at least open your eyes but
what if you're in incessant snoozer
well you can set a limit to the number
of times you can snooze inside of the
phone app but sometimes you need more of
a boost sleep as Android on the phone
allows
to set CAPTCHA tests like shaking the
phone a number of times or answering a
few math questions before you can
actually turn off the alarm I go for a
slightly more unorthodox method QR codes
normally you'd get out of bed and walk
to somewhere that you've printed and
stamped a QR code on the wall like your
bathroom and scan that to turn off the
alarm but instead I installed the QR
generator on my pebble and made it so
that I have to scan for different codes
before the alarm will shut the hell up
and an added bonus to the QR generator
of the pebble is a business card section
where you can have people scan that
particular code to get whatever
information you need to give them it
helps when you run out of business cards
to hand out and so there you have it how
I Android with the pebble smartwatch
essentially we're going to be seeing a
lot of smartwatches in the coming months
in the coming weeks
especially with Google i/o coming up in
Android we're really blowing up probably
from that particular conference and what
I wanted to illustrate here is even if
it's not Android wear the pebble is an
example of how when you take the time to
cater and experience on a wearable to
what you really need it to be it could
become just as invaluable as a regular
watch that you would wear on your wrist
anyway even with the G watch and the
Moto 360 on the horizon I will say that
the pebble has once again and claimed
the real estate on my wrist but will
those smartwatches replace the pebble as
my go-to everyday wearable well we're
not too sure about that yet but you can
stay tuned to Android authority and I'll
give you my answer whatever it is either
way and the reasons why so keep it tuned
to Android authority for all of the best
coverage including all of the coverage
from my brothers in Android Joe J's
Kevin the tech ninja in lawn
after that drop us some likes drop us a
subscribe if you haven't already
hence keep it tuned to Android Authority
