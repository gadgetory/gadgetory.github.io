looks like they're coming at some point
we're here at Lenovo tech world in San
Francisco and a lot of cool stuff were
announced here like the tango ready fab
2 Pro and the modular Moto Z and z-force
but the ones we really thought were cool
are concepts
yes concepts as in they're not something
we'll be buying anytime soon either way
it really opens up the idea of what will
potentially see down the road now during
this Q&amp;amp;A session with some of the
engineers we got a sneak peek at two
foldable devices the first one being a
foldable smartphone the one that showing
off during the keynote by Meghan
McCarthy when it's one it looks very
much like an elongated phone from the
front but you know something's up when
you look at it from the back obviously
there's more to it than just the display
being folded since the chassis itself
bends the novus concept seems practical
because as it's being bended the
interface slowly begins to shift so that
its operation while on your wrist is a
little bit more appropriate what's
really interesting is that lenovo says
that folding a display in isn't a
problem but it is when you're bending it
out which is the case here with the
smartphone that's because of how the
glass or whatever is covering the panel
itself is being stretched but from what
we can see here it's using the stretchy
plastic looking cover you can visibly
see the layer just because it kind of
distorts a bit as for the foldable
tablet it's pretty neat because it can
go from a sizable tablet to a phablet
sized thing by betting it right in the
middle so you can use it like a phone
whereas the phone bends in multiple
places throughout the chassis the tablet
simply has its bending points around the
middle area and the same plastic eclair
covers the display too these are some
pretty cool concepts especially when
they've been optimized to make them
practical when they're bent like how
that UI shifts and all being concepts
you know that we're thinking a lot about
price even though we won't be seeing
them any time soon we could only imagine
them to be pricey but hey it's pretty
cool that they fold
they're coming at some point and those
are the concepts they seem promising but
we're going to wait longer to actually
see them in consumer ready form the
meantime if you guys want to check out
