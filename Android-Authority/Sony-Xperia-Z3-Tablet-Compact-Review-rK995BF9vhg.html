be taking a look at the Sony Xperia said
three tablet compact so here we have it
guys the biannual evolution of the
Xperia line of tablets Sony find
themselves in a precarious place within
the market and even though their devices
are often of stunning design and great
build quality they don't seem to
penetrate the market in the way that
sony hope to the compact line compact
they blend together higher-end hardware
in a smaller package which is rarely
seen in the market these days and now
sony hope to bring this to their tablets
right off the bat we find ourselves with
an 8 inch device which is somewhat
surprising as past generations have been
larger we can see that they are trying
to bring over the same success they have
had with the compact line of smartphones
to their tablet but this reduction in
size also comes a much lighter tablet
weighing in at only 210 grams and it's
only six point four millimeters thick
this provides a remarkable feeling in
the hand and to be honest I'm more
inclined to have a tablet that is this
thin rather than the phone as a larger
footprint give a tangible existence of
solidity it's really nice however we
have to consider whether Sonia are only
reacting to a changing market where
smaller more portable tablets are
becoming more popular what are they
looking for with this tablet does the
use of compact mean we'll see a larger
brother soon we have the standby button
followed by the volume rocker underneath
we have the headphone port on the top of
the right which is the only exposed port
on the device on the opposite we have a
singular item and that is the magnetic
connector for an aftermarket charger and
accessories this is followed by the
expansion slot finally we have the
microUSB charger on the bottom it's a
glossy and highly reflective panel on
the front with a nice matte soft touch
plastic on the back the tablet presents
a dark sleek almost monolithic slab of
technology it looks good almost anywhere
the sharp distinct square cuts anyone's
eye line and is complemented by an
almost invisible surrounding frame this
is where Sony have achieved a nice
balance between functionality and design
any ports that you normally find are
hidden with flaps covers call it what
you will but
compliments one of the tablets mein
unique selling points that is the IP 65
68 certification which we shall delve
into more later
other notable inclusions in the hardware
spec are Bluetooth 4.0 with support for
low-energy MHL 3 / microUSB along with
support for USB host and OTG it has an
plus support which is potentially great
news for other products that use that
protocol
the display is a TFT LCD panel with a
1920 by 1200 resolution this means
283 PPI and yes it's a 10-point
multi-touch panel personally I think the
screen is pretty awesome yes is
essentially a resolution which is common
to a lot of devices nowadays and you may
question it for premium device in 2014
but regardless the screen looks great
the viewing angle is good with no color
shift however we do see a contrast shift
of varied angles so NIMH included a few
display technologies which presents a
good choice for those who are looking
for one there's your triluminos display
which enhances the color gamut allowing
you to see subtle nuances and shades of
colors there's the X Reality engine
which is meant to enhance sharpness and
contrast I have yet to make our mind up
on whether the X reality engine is
actually making a substantial difference
as playing native resolution footage
it's going to look great either way it
doesn't ruin it either by adding more
sharpness or contrast than is needed the
best thing is choice it doesn't stop
there either
and that is because you get further
options to suit your tinkering needs for
instance we have the pleasure of
adjusting a three-point white balance
there's an ambient light sensor which
can adjust brightness depending on light
levels and is also a smart backlight
control which can prevent the screen
from sleeping if you're still looking at
it further along to this we have glove
mode which seems to raise the
sensitivity of the panel with this mode
turned on I could at times almost hover
above the screen and it will register my
presses with a big circle finally the
display features are complemented with a
double tap to wake which is slowly
making its way around to more and more
devices powering the whole thing we have
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 which again is
very common it has a quad-core Krait 400
processor clocked in at 2.5 gigahertz I
can't say this is going to be an issue
whatsoever slowly
we are getting to a point where
technologically we are content
differentiation will be the software and
the ecosystem the package offers what
will be interesting to note is the
indirect benefits that the CPU chip will
bring these would be things like
efficiency quick charging and more this
is complemented with the Adreno 330 GPU
which if you're into mobile gaming you
won't have a problem I found every game
that I tested work the tree and breezed
through without a stutter games are
looking better these days and with each
GPU iteration we see more optimizations
and additions this is an exciting space
to watch the tablet comes with three
gigs of RAM again fairly common in 2014
but for a tablet it's pretty nice as you
can see with the majority of apps
running we still have plenty of RAM left
all of this performance needs a stable
supply of power and the battery we find
in a Zed 3 is a 4500 milliamp battery
compared to devices in a similar
physical footprint the Nexus 7 has a
3950 meal out battery and a new Nexus 9
has a larger 6,000 milliamp battery but
for the Zed 3 it's pretty impressive
considering just how thin the device
actually is and these days battery life
can be greatly enhanced with
optimization which is where the choice
of this hardware now might make sense
Sony has implemented a few tricks to
help eke out a little more battery low
here we see reserve and stamina mode
reserve mode lets you turn off any
functionalities you don't need in your
stamina mode this mode gets rid of any
functionality not needed such as radios
and I'm pretty sure for my testing that
applies some sort of CPU on the clock
with this sony claimed a 2-day battery
life overall I have to say that it was
pretty great with the amount of usage I
was able to fit into a single charge
cycle the z3 tablet compact is equipped
with two front-facing speakers which is
a great move it still surprises me that
manufacturers still place a single
speaker on the back and as a tablet this
makes even more sense considering it's
primarily a media consumption device the
speakers sound good and it can be pumped
up to a fairly loud volume
it's
Sonne you've included a number of
options to tailor the sound to your
needs I think this is a great move it's
a personal gripe of mine as I feel Audio
sometimes not given the attention it
deserves this becomes even more
important as many of our devices are
often used as a primary music players
for the front-facing speakers we have
the option for s force front surround
which is meant to virtually reproduce
realistic surround sound it's okay and
works well given the nature of the small
speakers you find on tablets I feel that
it reduces the mids and does give the
impression of a wider soundstage for the
headphones we have the surround sound
VPT these are additional profiles for
our listening experience it doesn't do
anything special and if you're into your
audio at all you probably want to leave
this off otherwise we have an EQ and
clear Audio plus this is meant to
optimize the sound settings this doesn't
make any discernible difference on your
onboard speakers but makes a big
difference or some headphones by kicking
up the high frequencies some of you may
like it depending on your headphones but
it wasn't for me finally and funnily
enough we have the ability to adjust
microphone sensitivity coming from using
vanilla Android for many years something
like this can go a long way many times
I've gone to gigs and cursed at the fact
that my audio was distorted
the camera and his every tablet compact
quite frankly is a downgrade from his
phone counterpart there's an 8 megapixel
shooter on the rear with an exome or RS
sensor and a 2 point 2 megapixel
front-facing camera from my testing I
have to say that the camera is perfectly
OK for general shooting and video
it was a really loud environment as zany
as that performance was the tablet
cooked well the audio was not distorted
at all so we have no distortion but at
the same time I can say that the auto
adjustment of the mic was probably a bit
heavy-handed I could hear it going up
and down you do have the option for
manual adjustment though I did have the
steady shot function enabled and I
couldn't notice the effect on tablet
when filming it but looking back at it
after it actually surprised me it wasn't
bad at all a slight negative though is
that at times you will notice a bit of
warping going on we have many novel
modes some were quite fun and entertain
friends but with most I question their
longevity if you're the kind of person
that does use the camera on your mobile
device on a regular basis this could be
a nice option to enhance the normal
static shot
there are even downloadable camera modes
which can only be a good thing right at
100% crop the images are short weren't
particularly great especially in
low-light which often resulted in a
blurry picture the sensor is
unremarkable for what it is but works
great for a quick point-and-shoot type
of a device my only negative about the
camera is placement where it is on a
device makes you inclined to use it in a
portrait orientation and this isn't how
I normally take images every time I went
to take a picture holding in landscape
in my hand I had my finger get in the
way quite regularly the Sony UI offers a
clean almost stock like experience with
a handful of additions there are nice
animations to give the UI a sense of
polish and the notable software
additions are the various Sony services
and apps such as music limited walkman
movies and more they're designed a well
and work well to the design language is
consistent and doesn't change anything
too drastically which is a-okay in my
book being a gamer I was most looking
forward to the PlayStation suite of apps
the PlayStation app lists your console
if it's on the same network displaying
its name and status you can either
launch remote play or second screen
functionality second screen allows you
to use your tablet as a controller to
navigate menus and where applicable to
use your tablet as a second screen
remote play on the other hand allows you
to stream your ps4 straight to your
tablet there are on-screen controls with
haptic feedback which would suit
navigation and perhaps slower-paced in
your game this is all well and exciting
but it gets better you can also pair
your duel shop forward to the tablet via
bluetooth from my testing it was awesome
I tested a few games and it all worked
well as you expect it to I enjoy a
remote play for my Vita but having a
bigger screen with the great controller
is something else entirely
it did experience stutter at points
where Awards getting slightly far away
from my room to put overall the response
is quick and I couldn't notice much lag
twitch shooters aren't recommended
though the Dual Shock 4 when paired via
bluetooth could also control your tablet
I was able to navigate my way through
the interface and for games that support
a gamepad the DualShock 4 worked a treat
playing mobile games with the gamepad
has completely recontextualize game to
me this is a great alternative to
playing should you already have a dual
shock for the Zed 3 is an enthralling
prospect for those who are into gaming
the Sony UI is actually not bad to use I
have discovered one slightly jarring
aspect and that's the keyboard it
provides good personalization options
such as having a number role but what I
do find slightly off-putting is that the
visual feedback of the predictive text
for some reason is slightly delayed to
the actual text that you're typing the
responsive typing is fine however so no
problems there but this does make it
feel slightly slower than it is it's not
a massive issue and will be completely
non-existent if you're a user that uses
another keyboard so here we are the big
moment this is Sony's biggest USP over
its Xperia line of devices and over the
years we have seen other companies
follow suit the IP 65 68 certification
allows it to be submerged in water for
30 minutes at 1.5 meters of depth this
is specifically with fresh water so make
sure you don't show off in front of your
friends around salt water having the
freedom and not being restricted by
waters completely striking technology
inherently has made a shun away from any
form of liquid so having this available
on a such precious piece of equipment
it's quite relieving I can't say that I
would intentionally keep it out during
the rainstorm though they have produced
a stunning looking tablet that feels
great in the hand and hardly weighs
anything I mean it weighs less than some
phone
the past generations have featured
larger displays which makes sense when
you consider the software feature set
it's presented the access to various
Sony services are all about media
consumption and I know a few people who
are initially disappointed when I showed
them the tablet but this will be your
call undoubtedly so whether you're a fan
or not or smaller displays the Sony
Xperia z3 tablet compact brings the best
of both worlds into a package that is
sufficiently able to work in both
scenarios the software features it
brings offers great entertainment value
with the integration with the numerous
Sony services if you're into mobile
gaming I know you'll love this tablet I
know our newfound love for mobile gaming
now I have a crate gamepad to play it
with but it's more than that it's the
PlayStation integration that plays
heavily into my love for gaming it's not
only software though the hardware
feature set offers great practicalities
with an uncompromised design both
functionalities complemented one another
and as a result we have a tablet that
looks great and that will stand up to
more than most other tablets overall the
tablet has been a surprising sleeper hit
for me I wasn't expecting much when I
heard of the device let alone opening
the box but after spending some time
with the device and utilizing it in a
normal manner I'm going to like it quite
a lot I spend most of my time with
vanilla Android and I have to say that
the additions that Sony about it aren't
garish by any means it's not even a
software app star-like it's the small
touches such as being able to change the
white balance having those audio options
and even be able to flash themes it's
that and lows more that sits well with
me the only thing I question is the form
factor of this device I want a bigger
screen sure it's compact and brings
Portability with a great suite of apps
but for me I just want a larger device I
mean your Marg may vary but despite that
I think it's an incredibly beautiful
looking device and it's just yeah I was
impressed with the battery life it gave
me lasting quite a few days on standby
and even when it wasn't the screen on
time it gave me what is 4500 milliamp
battery I would have no problem in wreck
men in this tablet overall this is a
great addition to the plethora of
Android tablets we find ourselves with
it's hardware and software choices make
it one of the best around and so I have
no hesitation in giving this tablet our
editors choice award so there you have
it guys that was the sony xperia z3
tablet compact stay tuned to android
authority for more great videos from all
the team take it easy
