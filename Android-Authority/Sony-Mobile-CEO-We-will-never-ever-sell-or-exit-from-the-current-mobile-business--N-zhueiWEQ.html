to you by domain.com so Sony Mobile CEO
claims and I quote we will never ever
sell or exit from the current mobile
business be curious what do you think
true or not true now there was a time
when Sony was the consumer electronics
company on the planet they had the most
power the most influence but when it
comes to smartphones in 2015 not so much
Sony does not even make the top 500 am
listing for smartphone market share but
an examining HTC's market share at just
3.8 in February 2015
even if Sony were to be number 6 on this
list the percentage would arguably be
trivial at best
still Sony's main market is not in the
US as evident by the lack of
availability of the new Xperia z3 plus
the company has decided to release it
only on Verizon and a modified enhanced
version of it no less other devices such
as the experience M experience T
experience II are nowhere to be seen
leaving more price conscious consumers
to gobble up other offerings by Huawei
Motorola or LG Sony is arguably missing
some huge potential here as its
brand-name recognition would do wonders
against mid to low end devices of
similar offerings by quote lesser
manufacturers but you may be thinking
chase Sony probably does great
smartphone sales in Japan no as a
Japanese company you would think Sony
will be doing well in its home country
yet sales data from December of 2014
indicated that this wasn't the case
either India now considered to be the
new China as far as market potential
goes has an absolutely stunning number
of OEMs competing for a piece of the pie
and as can be seen here Sony is clearly
not one of the major ones now Sony
Mobile CEO
Hiroki to Toki spoke with Arabian
business and he spoke with confidence
about Sony's future does he know
something we don't
he said this will Sony bow out of the
mobile industry the answer is
essentially no more specifically to Toki
explained that and I
quote smartphones are completely
connected to other devices also
connected to people's lives deeply and
the opportunity for diversification is
huge we're heading into the
internet-of-things era and have to
produce a number of new categories in
this world otherwise we could lose out
on a very important business domain in
that sense we will never sell or exit
from the current mobile business he also
did give us some clues about Sony's
future when it comes to wearables and
when it comes to smartwatches mr. to
Toki explained that quote those types of
devices and that side of the industry
have become huge now we're trying to
develop smart devices that are connected
to the smartphone in the future there
will be categories of products that will
connect to the network connect machine
to machine
connect machine to humans and connect
humans to humans that sort of
connectivity will expand and we will try
to develop even more categories in the
future that's one major focus of Sony
it's a big future strategy clearly I'm
not the only one who's been reading the
22 immutable laws of marketing where it
states that the best product does not
win the product that is first in the
users mind wins
hence Sony should not try and compete
with Samsung they should create their
own category and be the first brand in
that category
yeah acknowledging the growing
insurrection among rival OEMs the CEO
explained that quote the smartphone
device consists of a battery and a
screen and chips these are the main
parts of a smartphone and people can
easily make them now but it is the user
experience that is not the same even if
the device is the same the user
experience is different and this is a
very important point people are not
buying a smartphone because of the
device and the way it looks they are
buying it because of the experience you
know what the whole user experience
thing has been so overused it's hard to
know what anyone means by it
and he doesn't give us any other details
about what that would mean for the end
user so it sounds like a little bit of
corporate jargon No
so what begs the question what are these
new categories that Sony could be
creating personally I'm gunning for
he Robles these tiny little things that
go into your ears that are really
discreet that you can make calls with
listen to podcasts and audiobooks and
all that kind of stuff and music of
course that's kind of interesting what
do you guys think what new categories
would you like to see from Sony let me
know in the comments below I'll be
reading them all right so I'm gonna give
two more days for our more recent
t-shirt contest where I'm asking people
to come up with a previously unknown or
available dot-com domain name that
somehow creatively inspires Joe Hindi to
eat durian fruit that's all you got to
do come up with that and prove the power
of a.com why because no domain name
extension tells your story with the same
level of trust as a.com or.net domain
name dot-com and dotnet domain name
extensions and Jack credibility into
your online presence and who doesn't
want more credibility you can save 15%
