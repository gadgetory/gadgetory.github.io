Jason this is where we try and answer
your most pressing Android questions
like here's the HTC m8 really worth the
upgrade what's the best camera the
galaxy s5 or the Sony Xperia z1 and
when's Android coming to my phone so
many questions so little time but we've
found a way to answer almost everyone's
question yes that's right there's gonna
be some major changes to Android QA all
good news though you see the challenge
is that I have to choose questions that
I feature here in the show that affect
the broadest number of people so that
means that the questions are generally a
little bit easier and the answers can be
relatively short so that the show
doesn't drag on right so that means that
a lot of you who ask your questions
never get the question answered so we
have a solution to that it's in the
Android authority forums we're gonna ask
you please to post your questions there
I'm much more likely to select that
question and featured in the show if
it's in the Android Authority forums in
the Android Q&amp;amp;A section I monitor all of
those forums and there's more to it if
you post your question there you have a
chance to win a t-shirt we'll give it a
t-shirt every week ship it or anywhere
in the world you just have to post it in
the intro thority forums and if you are
one of those people who are very
knowledgeable Android yourself I know
there's a lot of you out there please
answer those questions if you can and
when people thank you for it it will up
that answer in the answer ranking
similar to Reddit sort of and then I'm
much more likely to choose that answer
and actually include it in the show and
give you credit for it but even better
you will be eligible to win a $50 Google
Play gift card we're gonna give those
out once a month so we're looking for
the power of the crowd to help answer
these questions there's lots of people
like crazy number of people who have
Android questions and some of them are
simple some are more complicated so if
you want to exercise your Android chops
please go over to Android Authority
forums and help out and answer those
the first question deals with default
apps this is really frustrating process
in Android 4.1 and 4.2 that is common
where you are asked to choose your
default app you select always and it
keeps asking you over and over again
we're gonna help you solve that to fix
this annoying problem that sometimes
occurs with Android 4.1 and 4.2 go to
settings then to apps or application
manager then to all apps select the app
in question or the app you want to
remove as a default and scroll down to
where it says clear defaults click that
and Android should ask you to select
your default the next time you wish to
complete that particular task now should
that fail you want to uninstall and
reinstall that particular app but even
failing that you may want to consider
the default app manager lite
now this allows you to automate some of
this process and although there are some
mixed reviews on the Google Play Store
there were enough people saying that it
was very helpful to solve this
particular problem that I thought it was
a good recommendation next question
deals with carriers charging for data
can carriers really block specific
mobile app usage the phone carrier in
Singapore is planning to charge watch
app users extra unless they pay so
Kelvin thanks for the question and I
actually called Singapore tel just to
get some clarification on this and yes
they are charging six dollars and 42
cents per month if you use the whatsapp
and then they will allow you unlimited
data within whatsapp now here in North
America most of the carrier's will claim
that they do not throttle you or they
will only throttle you if your general
data goes over your plan they're not
monitoring or they claim they don't
monitor individual app usage so here's
the thing I know there's lots of concert
controversy about Singapore tel charging
extra for whatsapp but I gotta say it
sort of makes sense if they're just
going to charge 642 and it's truly
unlimited or it's a very very high data
cap maybe it's worth it you might want
to consider that
thanks for watching Android army my name
is Jace love to connect with you here on
Google+ or Twitter but especially in the
Andhra thority forums please check that
out if you have a question please post
them there I'm much more likely to
respond to it there or use that question
in an Android Q&amp;amp;A show don't I forget
about my brother's Android Josh Jo and
the tech ninja Kevin Chris and lon
throwing working hard for a great
Android content I should see you next
week on Android to name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
