new Galaxy s7 so much so that if you
jump through a few of their hoops
they're gonna give you a free gear VR
headset for real vietnamese website
reviewed out purports to show the actual
galaxy s7 in the wild the image here
confirms a couple of details we've been
hearing about the galaxy s7 first it's
camera it's a 12 megapixel unit that is
said to be better than the s6 is and
doesn't protrude as much as samsung's
2015 flagship we can see from the
picture that the camera is very close to
being flush with the body of the alleged
s7 while it shaped seems to be a little
bit rounder this is something we first
reported in our exclusive galaxy s7
diagrammed leak and korean and media
later confirmed it the rumors already
pointed to a 3000 milliamp hour battery
and a 5.1 inch display for the galaxy s7
with a 3600 million power battery and a
5.5 inch display for the galaxy s7 edge
now an FCC label document confirms the
three thousand six hundred million power
sized though no similar documentation
exists for the s7 so far as we can tell
netherlands-based
Android world publications suggest that
the s7 and s7 edge will both go up for
pre-order on launch day with an actual
ship date being March 11th Samsung is
also sweeten the deal for those who want
a preorder between the 21st of February
and the 10th of March by throwing in a
free gear VR in order to protect the
deal you apparently just have to sign up
with proof of purchase through Samsung's
official website good luck
but hey Samsung isn't the only one
trying to make a splash in the next
month let's talk about the LG g5 and its
so-called always on display this Jif
here has been obtained exclusively by
Android Authority and it shows that LG
has included the same thinking in its
radically redesigned g4 successor but
the LG g5 has a twist the chip shows a
variety of smartphones gradually growing
dark until the silhouette of the LG g5
appears with the time and date of the LG
press conference at Mobile World
Congress displayed above a series of
notification icons very similar to what
you find on LG's
ten-second screen the text quote always
on and then appears alongside the LG g5
logo from what we're being told the LG
g5 always-on display is actually a
full-screen version of the v10 second
screen rather than an AMOLED display
that potentially means colors and
customization just like the LG v10 but
on a full screen scale battery
consumption is always a concern we're
backlit LCD s are concerned so we'll be
interested to see how LG will handle
that now let's talk about the HTC One m9
m10 was initially expected to make its
debut at Mobile World Congress 2016 in
just a few days time before the current
plans for an announcement in London on
April 11th leaked into the wild
this week's rumour comes from perennial
tipster Evie leeks who has a long track
record of accurate leaks and suggests
we'll see the m10 hit retail stores
across the u.s. around May the ninth the
HTC One am 10 is rumored to look similar
to the one a9 and is expected to support
a 5.1 inch qHD AMOLED display and a 12
megapixel ultra pixel camera with
optical image stabilization and laser
autofocus
it will run Android 6.0 point 1
marshmallow with sense8 on top and will
be powered by a Snapdragon 820 in Europe
and an unspecified media tech chipset if
you're in Asia also according to
well-known leaker lab Toofer
the HTC perfume aka the HTC one and 10
will offer a Samsung 5 megapixel ultra
pixel camera on the front and a Sony AMX
377 12 megapixel with laser autofocus on
the rear it's the main cam that really
piques our interest though as it happens
to be the same sensor found on the Nexus
5x and the Nexus 6p both of which are
regarded as two of the best Android
camera phones available of course just
because the HTC One mmx3 77 it doesn't
mean it will end up having an amazing
camera so what do you think let me know
in the comments below it certainly
appears that most manufacturers are
giving us a bump spec with very similar
designs from last year's flagships
except for LG we're expecting big things
from LG
don't disappoint us and don't disappoint
me by not checking out my brothers and
sister and Android who are working super
hard to be your source for all things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
