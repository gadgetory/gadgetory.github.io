handy the Android authority app guide in
this quick video we're going to take a
look at the best RPGs for Android first
on our list are emulators popular games
like Pokemon and some obscure stuff
aren't available in Android but a bunch
of emulators are and they can help you
play the classic RPGs at a nominal price
aerilon sword and shadows is a popular
albeit slightly older RPG it features 30
hours of gameplay first and third person
game modes three races for classes and
eight mounts it's a solid RPG option
baldur's gate 1 and 2 are classic PC
RPGs from back in the old days these
games are very long and involved which
is great for hardcore RPG fans the
controls do take some getting used to
though
Bard's Tale was among the first truly
good RPGs on Android it features quirky
humor a decently long story line and
support for all the latest Android tech
like Android TV and most controllers it
is a huge game so do beware of that
Blood Brothers is an RPG that utilizes a
board game style layout and it's one of
the more unique RPG options on android
not everyone likes cart style games but
if you do this is worth a shot covenant
of Solitude is an ode to the old days it
uses a JRPG style of gameplay with a
decent storyline and a cheap price tag
it may be a tattoo old-school for some
people but it is a solid experience
Dragon Quest is a classic JRPG series
that Square Enix has been slowly
releasing on Android currently you can
get one two three four and eight with a
whole lot more coming they're also
played in portrait mode which is a
little bit different Dumba destiny is
another old-school JRPG style game with
a cheap price tag and some good fun it
boasts about 40 hours of gameplay total
which is quite a bit for a mobile game
Eve of Genesis is from the same
developers as covenant of Solitude and
both games are on this list for the same
reason and that's because they're good
people who don't like JRPGs probably
won't like this one but those that do
probably will not having Final Fantasy
on a list like this is essentially
blasphemy Square Enix has pre released
Final Fantasy one two three four five
and six along with a few others everyone
already knows that they like or dislike
Final Fantasy Icewind Dale is another
huge long PC RPG from days past similar
to Boulder's gates also like Baldur's
get the controls take some time to get
used to but it's a great game for the
hardcore RPG fan the EnOcean series are
hack and slash RPGs that are highly
guarded by mobile gamers the most recent
iteration has over 400 maps various
character types and it's also free to
play order and chaos online is one of
the premier online RPG's available on
android it's an MMORPG that you can play
with friends or compete against them in
PvP battles the graphics are also pretty
decent pocket RPG is an old-school
dungeon crawler similar to the old
Gullit legends games the graphics are
colorful and the game is addicting but a
bit simple at times raven sword shadow
land is another big name RPG with
above-average graphics first and third
person game modes and plenty of gameplay
there are some device compatibility
issues though so do beware Secret of
Mana was a popular JRPG from the Super
Nintendo when Square Enix has rereleased
it with better graphics and touchscreen
controls unless you dislike JRPGs
there's really nothing wrong with this
game soul craft is another hack and
slash RPG where you can walk around
level up and slash down bad guys it gets
a bit repetitive after a while but it's
a good looking game and appeals to more
casual gamers Star Wars Knights of the
Old Republic is a legendary RPG that
helped pave the way for today's huge
player driven RPGs it's a bit old-school
and slow but it has a long player driven
storyline and it is Star Wars that's a
win win last up for now is an Oni of
five it's a quest driven game where you
must accept missions and then go
complete them for gold and experience it
does get repetitive after a while but it
is fun and that about wraps it up for
this video folks this video probably
won't be updated but the article most
certainly will so be sure to check in on
that from time to time to see what's new
