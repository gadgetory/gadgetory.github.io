but here's some features you may not
know about whether its ambient display
active notifications whatever you want
to call it the 1+3 has this much
sought-after feature simply wave your
hand across the proximity sensor at the
top of the 1+3 screen and your
notifications will appear in ghostly
black and white this energy saving
feature has become the staple of devices
equipped with AMOLED screens and the 1+3
isn't the one to be left out now let's
talk the camera shortcut no phone and I
repeat no phone should be without a
shortcut to the camera via a hardware
button shooting photos from the hip is
how many of us capture the majority of
those fleeting moments these days and
they really end up often being the very
best shots
fortunately the 1+3 camera features a
rapid-fire shortcut just double tap on
the home button and you're off to the
races
now what exactly is contactless payments
well I'm sure you already know that the
oneplus three has NFC but it's not just
about being able to pair Bluetooth
devices with NFC more easily you see the
oneplus 3 has an NFC chip inside and
this means you can use it with Android
pay
perhaps one plus was right to leave the
feature out of the oneplus 2 claiming
that not enough people were using
contactless payment systems to make it
worthwhile their time but that is no
longer a problem with the oneplus 3 now
let's talk night mode while Google has
had numerous issues bringing dark mode
to stock Android oneplus has had it for
ages even if you're already familiar
with the oxygen OS you may not know that
oneplus interface now allows you not
only a dark mode with customizable
accent colors which is super cool but
oneplus also gives you a night mode
night mode throws an orange cast over
your display to be easier on the eyes at
night and allows you to dictate its
intensity now let's talk - charge if you
remember the issues oneplus had last
year with its USB type-c cables you
might not be too excited at the prospect
of pumping vast amounts of energy into
your shining new phone with a turbo
charging tech that you've never heard of
well rest easy the 1 plus 3s - charge is
actually just a rebranded version of
opals excellent luke fast charging
standard it uses a for a current with a
regular 5v voltage and should stay a lot
cooler longer than other fast charging
phones and keeps working to full
capacity even when the screen is on just
make sure you use the adapter and the
cable in the box today nearly anything
is possible if you can dream it your
team can build it
makers of collaboration software that
helps your team work better together
create and share content organize
results with the flexibility of
confluence they even have instant
messaging and video chat with HipChat
you can also manage code in real time
with the power of bitbucket visit
Atlassian comm and see how JIRA
confluence HipChat and bitbucket can
give your team everything they need to
succeed
