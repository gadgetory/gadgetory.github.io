out to the mobile world congress in
barcelona spain to bring some big
announcements making this show probably
the biggest announcement heavy one of
the year so if they're going to bring
their a-game so are we like we always do
for our trade tech shows so it's josh
regard from android authority what's
going on everybody and we're going to
recap the rumors leading into mwc but
also for the first time we're going to
show you what we're rocking for the
Mobile World Congress so as you can see
here I have my Timbuktu power commute
bag this is my bread and butter right
here the bag I take literally everywhere
with me and trade shows are no exception
but this is not a traditional what's in
my bag type of video primarily because I
can't fit everything in this bag you can
see over here i have a bit over here and
also my monopod over on the right side
here just to illustrate for you that i
can't necessarily fit everything in this
bag and thus when i go to trade shows
things tend to be carried outside of
just the bag that's around my shoulder
so with that in mind let's go ahead and
get into the first rumor that is really
not actually a rumor but is definitely
what we can expect heading into the
mobile world congress and it has to do
with LG out of LG's camp we see that
they have already announced two
different devices leading into mwc and
that is the LG g2 mini which is a
somewhat a lower spec end than the
original g2 phone but then they
oversized the g2 into the LG g2 pro
which is a lot like Mobile World
Congress last year where we had the
optimus g pro which is one of our
favorite devices of the show and this
year we're going to see how the LG g2
Pro stacks up to the competition and
also we're going to find out just how
well LG has evolved ever since the
original optimus g pro starting off with
the back end of my bag right here we
have my laptop which is again another
piece of my bread and butter right here
basically because this is where all of
the magic gets put together this is my
ms i ge 4t which is one of the first
ultra blades to come out sporting very
high specifications in a 14-inch body i
was looking for a ultraportable laptop
because my previous one was this 15-inch
sager behemoth that was just a pain to
carry everywhere during trek on during
tech shows now another follow-up to last
year's Mobile World Congress is coming
from Sony is the Sony Xperia tablet Z 2
now that's quite a bit of a mouthful but
we are very excited to see what sony has
in store for this upcoming tablet now
last year the sleek look of the tablet
definitely won our hearts and it was one
of the best in my case black slate
devices as you know that phrase i love
so much that came out last year and to
me is one of the best tablets on the
market we're also hoping that sony is
going to put out a massively needed
update to its Xperia or timescape you I
to Android 4.4 KitKat and we'll see what
Sony does with the enhancements that are
found in the newest android operating
system alright so we open up the bag
here and we're going to take a look at
the contents that are inside mainly the
smaller bits and I'll get to the stuff
on my sides in a little bit as well the
first thing I want to talk about because
I'm super excited about it is our
upgraded audio setup now I can't show
you right away the lapel system that's
being used because i'm using it right
now to record this video but i can tell
you it is the tried-and-true sennheiser
system that you probably see a lot of
trade show people end up using speaking
of super excited updates to let's say
software and even hardware we're going
to take a look at all of the
announcements that might come out of the
Samsung camp now around this time of
year maybe a little bit later we are
seeing the emergence of rumors about the
new galaxy s phone but not only are we
seeing that we're also getting hints
that perhaps the operating system that
we love to hate or hate to love TouchWiz
is really going to get the type of
update that we've been really wanting it
to have all right so I'll go ahead and
get into the bits that are on my side
right here i'll start off with my trusty
monopod which is right here this is a
mon Frodo monopod that i typically put
that camera on here when I'm just
recording let's say b roll or i'm
recording Darcy when he's doing an
interview essentially what this monopod
allows you to do is to run and gun but
still have some stable images when
you're doing your videos so this is the
monopod right here and extends out quite
a long ways and if you see some of my
panning shots coming from way above this
is what I use because it just gets that
tall i also have a mon photo tripod that
my camera is on right now
I can show you but here is the monopod
that I use for our trade shows and also
from Samsung we are expecting a sleeker
Galaxy gear now the SmartWatch out of
Samsung's camp was one that actually did
raise a few eyebrows primarily because
of its functionality and also from
Samsung's backing its integration with
the TouchWiz in the Galaxy Note 3 and
the Galaxy s4 before it aside from a
slimmer sleeker design we are also
looking for a slimmer price point and
we're going to see what that exactly is
once it is announced at mwc now the bits
over here these are two LED lights these
are the Z 96 LEDs that you'll probably
see if you search on google or even on
youtube just for a little bit you'll see
these are some of the most popular ones
i have a couple here just to make sure
that we get a good spread on our
lighting but these aren't necessarily
used for actual interviews and for most
of the videos you see on the trade show
floor primarily because the tradeshow
floor happens to be pretty well lit to
begin with but in order to alleviate
some of the situations we got into at
previous shows where sometimes when you
get exclusive access to some stuff it's
in a very dimly lit area this is
definitely what we're going to use to
make that less of a problem and as you
can see here i hope i'm not going to
blind you too much here they do get
really bright and it should really help
with our lighting in particular
situations and when it comes to Samsung
we finally look at the galaxy s5 yes
everything is pointing to the galaxy s5
being an announcement at mwc what with
the unpacked invites going out and also
pretty much every room we're pointing to
the fact that that phone is coming out
in the next month or so so as far as the
galaxy s5 goes one thing we're really
excited about as we alluded to in the
TouchWiz section is that a samsung is
looking to go back to basics when it
comes to their design they're going back
to the drawing board it looks like to
really revamp and really make a new
identity for the Galaxy S line because
we might have been too used to the last
few iterations going back to the cameras
I do want to tell you what camera I use
primarily for my videos the one you're
seeing that is filming this video right
now is the Panasonic Lumix G H that's
what i call my production camera it is
used for all of my videos it is really
good for pictures but it has great video
capturing quality to it now it's really
exciting to say that we're talking
Android and yet I get to utter Nokia's
name nokia apparently is coming out with
more of a mid-tier phone maybe
entry-level if you want to look at it
that way but it is Nokia's first foray
into the Android space and originally it
was called Normandy but now we're taking
on the x name again as the nokia X is
what we are going to look forward to as
far as hardware and specs go the specs
aren't going to be anything to really
write home about it doesn't look like it
at least but as far as Nokia's hardware
prowess goes we can pretty much expect a
very sturdy phone and one that might
really make a splash in the Android
space and make us really excited for
what they have in store for the future
and so there you have it for this
roundup of the rumors leading into the
mobile world congress at barcelona spain
and also a roundup of what we rock when
it comes to going to various text shows
around the world so keep it tuned to
android authority for all of the best
