excel can be a great phone for the right
person but before you go spend your cash
let's talk about the issues we know
about it
thus far and at the top of the list was
the somewhat dull display many reviewers
including her own Joshua vegara noted
that the colors in the pixel to excels
display don't pop out as much as we had
expected from an OLED display in our
review we remark that the saturation was
dialed down which gave colors a somewhat
dull appearance Google said that this
was intentional since the pixel to
excels display was tuned for accuracy
not for vibrancy now to Google's credit
the November security patch includes a
new saturated color mode in the display
settings which you can toggle to make
the displays colors more vibrant keep in
mind that the mode might deliver less
than true life color representation
which some people like now is this a
really big deal mm I don't think so
unless you're comparing it side by side
to another flagship that really does
have a fantastic display I don't think
you're gonna notice that big of a
difference now the second issue is also
with regards to the display the display
exhibits a blue shift even at slight
angles people have noticed that viewing
the display even slightly off-center
results in the display exhibiting a
cooling effect almost akin to a blue
tint now issue number three is the more
significant and more talked about issues
surrounding the pixel two excels display
it's the possibility of burn in screen
burnin is an issue that typically
affects OLED screens as they age even
though screen burnin depends on factors
like screen brightness what is being
shown on the display and the type of
hardware it could take years for the
effect to be noticeable
however Android Central's Alex Dobie
noticed the effect just after a week of
normal usage Dobie also mentioned that
his pixel too did not exhibit any amount
of screen burnin during the same time
period google says it is investigating
reports of burnin and has since released
the November security patch which
includes measures that fade out the
navigation buttons and reduce the
maximum screen brightness Google noted
that these measures will not detract
from the user experience but it appears
that the company is at least paying
attention to users concerns
this is obviously a more serious issue
so I was hoping that our audience could
help out possible future pixel to excel
owners if you have this phone and you've
had this problem or not have the problem
let us know in the comments below to see
just how common this burn-in issue is
and the fourth issue is black smearing
black smearing happens when the screen
transitions from black pixels to colored
pixels such as when you're on a page
with black objects now to be fair this
problem is not unique to the pixel OLED
displays have had this problem
previously but google has said that it's
engineers were investigating reports now
the fifth issue is that the phone can
make high-pitched noises and clicking
sounds the issue seems more prevalent on
the smaller pixel too than the pixel to
excel but folks with the latter have
still reported issues of high pitched
noises and clicking sounds at the time
that these issues initially came up
turning off the NFC was the solution to
the clicking noise the high-pitched
sounds remained even if you turned off
NFC though google has since released an
update that looks to have eliminated
both problems and the six issue I wanted
to bring up is that the phone can
randomly reboot itself after some clever
testing one user deduced that the
reboots only occurred when entering a
low signal area where LTE is patchy the
same user later found that the problem
was stopped entirely by switching the
pixel to excels preferred network type
to 3G only that's hardly an ideal
solution of course but Google said it
was looking into the matter now I wanted
to make really clear to everyone that
these issues are not common to all pixel
2xl owners some have them some don't I
for example have the pixel 2 and I don't
have any of those issues no problem at
all except for maybe some dull
saturation but that's just comparing it
to the note 8 which had an absolutely
stunning screen so if you have some of
those issues let us know in the comments
below and then future potential buyers
can know which issue is sort of common
but there is the article linked below in
the show description that goes into a
lot more issues into a little bit more
detail we didn't want to drag this on to
a 15 20 minute show you know how it goes
let me know what you think in the
comments below and on Twitter
