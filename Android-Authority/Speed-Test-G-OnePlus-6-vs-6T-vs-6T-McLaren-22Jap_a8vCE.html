edition of the oneplus 60
the oneplus 60 McLaren edition of course
McLaren being the Formula One racing
team from Woking in Surrey in the UK now
this new edition has things like
SuperDuper fast charging and ten
gigabytes of RAM but how does it perform
in terms of daily usage well to find out
we're going to use speed test G and
we're going to compare the 1 + 6 with
the 1 + 60 and the 1 + 16 McLaren
edition so without any further delay let
the testing begin Green all three
devices are away it's neck-and-neck at
the moment we've got the 1 plus 16
McLaren dition on the left we've got the
1 + 60 in the middle and 1 + 6 on the
right hand side the McLaren edition of
the 60 and the 60 have turned on gaming
mode the 1 plus 6 has not done that will
that affect the final outcome we're
gonna see this is a long race there's
many turns to come there's many
straights to go down let's see where we
go from here all three devices are now
into the bloom test and coming up next
of course is cops
it's a right-hand turn that's going to
take us into a very difficult section of
the testing all three devices are now
are handing it very well they go through
the SPL test and here we are into the
cube testing what comes up next after
this of course we're waiting for the
hangar straight which is really that
test with the 3d unity which will really
see which of these devices comes in
first in the meantime we're going round
the eight tree turn and it's taken us
into the 2d gaming event and now all
three devices are into the 16 thread
test and it's Nick and Nick at this
point you can hear those engines roaring
you can hear as all three devices are
purring as they run on down this circuit
race and here we are the hangar straight
this is where one can pull ahead of the
other all three device are now into the
unity test this is a long long straight
where you can really get the wind
underneath those spiders inside those
aerodynamics and really push that car
forward but at the moment it seems to be
neck and neck all the way through no one
is pulling ahead all three devices are
staying exactly where they are what its
gonna mean in the
and they're all coming now up to that
final castle scene none of them are
slowing down although are pushing ahead
what will happen when they go into the
next turn into the next turn and now all
three devices into the compression test
this really is amazing I've never seen a
race like this before all three
containers for gold silver and bronze
are all together and there they have it
all have finished in one minute and 49
seconds at dead heat and so they go
quite an interesting result all three
devices are exactly the same so while
the macaron dition does have that extra
SuperDuper fast charging and it does
have a ten gigabytes of RAM which we're
very useful for ultra mega power users
who like to keep all their apps in
memory all of the time basically in
terms of daily usage all three devices
are exactly the same my name is Gary
Sims and this is Andrew authority now if
you did enjoy the speed test G do go
over to my Gary explains YouTube channel
it's a separate YouTube channel where I
do publish more of those speed tests
over there also don't forget to
subscribe here don't forget to like this
video and well that's it I've seen the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
