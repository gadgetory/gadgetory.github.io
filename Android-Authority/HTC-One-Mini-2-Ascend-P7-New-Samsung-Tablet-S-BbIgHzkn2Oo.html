brought to you by your mama because none
of us would have our favorite android
phones without our mothers go hug your
mama happy Mother's Day welcome back to
Android weekly my name is Jason this
past week saw some interesting news
about a new samsung tablet line a new
huawei phone and even news about the HTC
One mini 2 that's right there allegedly
going to go and call it the HTC one mini
to proving that the person responsible
for titling such phones has a master's
degree in chinglish please carefully
bang your head yes that's right the
ever-reliable evleaks has provided us
the first credible image of the new HTC
One mini 2 there are three color options
available gunmetal silver and gold while
the plastic rim around the device is
still present it's much less than on the
previous HTC One we also don't have any
detailed specifications on the mini 2
but the image above suggests that the
screen may be larger than 4.3 inches
there is also no depth sensor on the
device so it's very likely that HTC
opted for a conventional 13 megapixel
sensor for the camera move it on the
news about a leak from Sam mobile which
suggests that Samsung is about to launch
a new tablet line titled galaxy tab s
the first two devices in the series will
be the galaxy tab s 8.4 and the galaxy
tab asked 10.5 both of which will
feature a 2560 by 1600 AMOLED display so
why are these AMOLED displays a big deal
it's because AMOLED is exemplified in
the galaxy s5 is emerging as the best
technology for displays thus far
hopefully we will see this type of
AMOLED display going mainstream moving
on to good news about Google Maps and
those of us who need help with lane
changes Google Maps is getting a pretty
big update today adding a significant
number of new features including uber
integration if you need transit or
walking directions and have the uber app
installed on your device in select
cities of course then the uber option
will appear at
offer you the estimated trip times for a
car service google maps on mobile will
now show you upcoming lane information
when you're using turn-by-turn and the
updates include lane guidance and an
easier access to alternative routes now
what this means and what I'm most
excited about is the fact that Google
Maps will now tell you when you need to
change lanes to prepare for the next
cutoff so currently you know Google will
announce you know an 800 meters turn
left or an 800 meters take this cut off
but if you're on a you know highway 401
in in Ontario is huge it's like four
lanes in many cases and you're on the
far left lane and you have to get to the
right and 800 meters that may not be
enough so it gives you a warning when to
change lanes and it's a much safer way
to use the navigation tool moving on to
news about a new phone from huawei and
it's looking pretty impressive this past
week at a press event in Paris huawei
introduced its latest and greatest
flagship Android device the Ascend p7
the brand-new Ascend p7 is largely an
evolutionary update from last year's
ascend p6 but that's not a bad deal at
all especially since Huawei brought
enough improvements to the table to make
it worth upgrading the Ascend p7
features a 5-inch display with a
quad-core processor running at 1.8 giga
hertz two gigabytes of ram 16 gigabytes
of storage it does have a micro SD card
slot the battery is 2500 milliamp hours
with a 13 megapixel rear-facing camera
and an 8 megapixel front-facing camera
it of course will come out of the box
running Android 4.4 now the big question
is price and I was hopeful that it would
be a much more affordable phone but it
turns out it's going to be launching at
625 in US dollars or 450 in Euros so
we'll see how it goes at the heavily
modded phone but I did get my hands on
the p6 last year and it's very elegant
it was very thin and it felt fantastic
in the phone we'll see how it works out
if any of you have this phone or get it
I want to hear but in the comments
thanks a lot thanks for watching edward
army my name is Jace and you see this

especially if your comment or question
has not been shared before don't want to
forget about my brothers in android Josh
Joe and the tech ninja Kevin lon and
Chris pumping out some great content for

who won the t-shirt contest from last
year it was Hugo Hugo's from Portugal
and we've already sent out the teacher
t-shirt to him Hugo got that little tiny
little hint of texts that I hid in one
frame of the video to explain what the
the bug fix clue is what is what it was
and wow he got it in like eight minutes
after the video is published I'm gonna
make it even harder crazy hard for next
