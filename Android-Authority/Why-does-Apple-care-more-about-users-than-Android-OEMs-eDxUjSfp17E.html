authority now you might find the title
of this video a bit shocking but
actually a recent report has shown that
lots of Android OMS are not providing
the kind of updates that we need so that
we stays secure when we're using our
Android smartphones so why does it
appear that lots of the Android OMS are
treating their customers in a very
different way to maybe like companies
like Apple and how they treat iPhone
users what if you want to find out more
please let me explain
ok so what the new report has shown is
that some Android OEMs are not shipping
security updates for their devices in a
timely manner well that's not really
news because we've known that for a long
time but what the report was also
highlight is that some OEMs actually say
this ship patches and they change the
patch date in the patch level but
actually they don't apply the patches at
all to the devices now how can that be
why are they lying to their consumers so
much and what would happen if a company
like Paul did something like that so
let's first of all look at the
fundamental problem with patches and the
Android ecosystem here is a quote from
the FTC from a report it published this
year the Android mobile ecosystems
diversity provides extensive consumer
choice but also contributes to security
update complexity and inconsistency and
as a result of this great choice that
we've got for Android phones you can
pick up phones that are kind of like you
know $100 or even at under $100 right up
to phones that cost $800 and there's a
whole bunch of features and differences
between those that great diversity that
great choice that we've got means there
isn't just one version of Android that
Google release and it gets applied to
all phones in fact every OAM has to
provide their own device independent
version of Android that gets shipped to
the owners of those particular devices
and the FTC goes on because of the
complexity of the mobile ecosystem the
security update protests can be complex
and time-consuming so what happens is
when Google releases a new version of
Android with some security patches in it
those changes get pushed out to just
every single OAM manufacturer
and they have to then apply those
patches to their version of the firmware
then that firmware has to get shipped
out to each of the individual handsets I
thought oh throw into that mix the whole
idea of the carriers and the fact that
they have control over the software that
goes on their handset and sometimes
they've included bundled software on the
handset and of course they have to all
be tested and the labs that the the
carriers have have a limited number of
resources the result is that it actually
take months or even years before
software updates finally arrive at an
end device
I really hope you're enjoying this video
if you are if I remind you there is now
a separate gary explained youtube
channel and there i cover lots of
technology outside of mobile so if
you're interested go over to youtube.com
slash gary explains and i'll see you
there now the situation with Apple is
different for two reasons
first of all of course Apple have a
limited number offer phones and when we
talk about the iPhone we're actually
talking about maybe three or four of the
current models that are available so
we're not dealing with you know
thousands of different molds that exist
from LG and Sony and Samsung and HTC and
LG we're just dealing with one company
who have you know three or four models
that are currently being supported and
the second thing we have to know is that
Apple way back when it launched the
iPhone basically said to the carriers we
provide the software we're not going
through you we then you can use your
network but actually the software
updates come from us and so as a result
Apple have been able to push these
updates directly to the iPhone without
having to first verify on every single
carrier in every single country in all
the major markets around the world Apple
just release it and it goes out to the
phone but if you think about Android
globally as a big thing and you've
course you've got all these thousands of
different handsets you've got all these
different OEMs but if you think about an
OEM a single manufacturer well actually
you know LG have got a limited number of
phones and Sony have a limited number of
phones and Google itself has a limited
number of phones so they in themselves
can behave very much the same way as
Apple do because LG aren't responsible
for the patches that apply to Samsung
phones and Samsung are responsible for
the patches that apply to
you know Nokia phones so each of these
companies can take responsibility for
shipping out these security patches and
also really the telecom providers the
carriers really should just renounce any
ton of control over the software that's
being updated because it really is a
bottleneck that stops the software
getting quickly and in a timely manner
to our handsets so from this point of
view I have squarely blamed the OEMs and
the carriers for this long delay that it
takes for patches to arrive on each of
our individual handsets
now of course group will also have a
part to play in this they had ship out
the software it's open source software
or they ship out the software to their
partners and once they've done that they
really have done their part and of
course they've been trying to minimize
the changes that the OEMs have to make
to speed up this process as much as they
can over the last few years they've been
several changes that Google of
introduced to try to speed up this whole
process for example many of the
components like Google Play services and
the built-in web browser and fundamental
apps are now part of the normal app
store so they get updated so when a bug
is found in the web browser that could
actually cause some nasty things to
happen Google can update it directly and
it gets pushed down to your phone
without any of the carrier's having any
kind of control or any of the OEMs
having any kind of influence over this
at all and of course there are now
things like project treble which came
out with android 8.0 Oreo that should
speed up the time it takes for an OEM to
actually ship the update to their
customers and of course when you look at
the companies that are guilty of these
delays and guilty of not shipping the
patches you'll find that Google isn't
one of them Google provides updates for
its pixel devices up provide updates for
Android one devices quickly and timely
just in the same way that Apple does for
the iPhone and in fact there are other
major manufacturers like Samsung and
Sony that also act and behave
responsibly and get out the security
updates on a fairly quick and timely
basis however once you go outside the
major Tier one OAM
you start to go down to the smaller OEMs
and we're talking HTC knock here we're
talking LG we're talking TCL we're
talking oneplus we're talking ZTE once
you get down to these companies we start
to find that many of them have actually
been skipped patches or they've been
long delays in getting the patches out
and in some cases they haven't even
provided the patches at all now one of
the big culprit seems to be media taking
all of this because often the software
that's being shipped on these Android
devices comes through the SOC
manufacturer because of course they have
been able to create the software and
tune it for their particular chip so
often an OEM will be relying on media
tech or Qualcomm to send the latest
software to them and they will then pass
that further down the chain to the
handset owner and the problem is
mediatek seem to be very bad at not
applying critical patches when they
should do so why is it that there are
some companies like Apple and some
Android companies like Google itself and
Samsung and Sony that are able to treat
their consumers their buyers of their
devices in a responsible manner but
there are seems to be a whole bunch of
other OEMs that are being irresponsible
when it comes to security updates well I
would like to suggest there are three
reasons the first reason is money if
you're buying a device for $100 well
you're getting $100 worth of device and
that includes after sales service your
hundred dollars has to include all of
the manufacturing costs and the shipping
costs and the advertising costs on the
R&amp;amp;D cost and it has to include the after
sale servicing costs so if you only paid
$100 for the phone that you're going to
get $100 worth of updates afterwards if
you're paying six seven eight hundred
dollars for your device then you can
expect a greater level of after sale
service the second point is an OEM
attitude towards security and when I
mean OEM I also include the chip maker
like mediatek in that they don't see
security as a big deal and that's partly
because it's an extra cost it's a
headache
it's a pain that they have to deal with
so they just push it away and say oh
it's not that
much of a problem but also of course
Android has multi levels of protection
so for example because there is a Play
Store and Google kind of keep an eye on
that Play Store and they have various
kind of security measures in place the
chances of you getting hold of an app
that deliberately kind of infects your
device or tries to hack your device so
that can then do things like steal your
credit card information or still other
parts of your personal information is
quite low not impossible but quite low
and so therefore the OEMs kind of say
well Google are doing their bit and you
know it's all it's all going to be ok
and the third problem is partly to do
with the attitude of Chinese
manufacturers now Chinese manufacturers
are very much into the idea of develop
it quick ship it cheaply and then move
on to the next thing and so this culture
of well you bought that phone last year
that's not our problem anymore
and of course that extends also to how
they treat copyright laws also extends
to how they treat intellectual property
in general this kind of blase approach
to consumer services is actually
reflected in what we get in our nrn
devices and many of the companies that
are listed on the report as being bad
companies when it comes to security
updates and even lying about the
security update have strong connections
with or are based in China whereas many
of the other companies like Google for
example and likewise Apple are actually
American company Samsung of course is a
Korean company and so on so part of the
problem is the mentality of the Chinese
electronics consumer market well my name
