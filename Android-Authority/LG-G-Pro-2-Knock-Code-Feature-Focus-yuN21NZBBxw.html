to their lg g2 flagship phone it did beg
a bit of a question when the phone is
lying on its back on a table for example
well what do you do in order to turn on
the phone and turn it off subsequently
well they did come up with a pretty
elegant solution for that and it was
called the knock-on essentially what
happens is at any point with the phone
screen turned off you can just double
tap on the screen and it would turn on
the screen easy for you to unlock it and
get right into what you needed to do and
for a lot of users out there it became a
very important feature for their LG g2 S
and so forth well in the LG G pro 2 they
have won ahead and updated the knock-on
into what is called the knock code and
we're going to show you what it's all
about
so it's Josh regard from Andhra I
thought hey what's going on everybody
and this is a feature focus on the knock
code for the LG G pro 2 all right and
here is the LG G pro 2 just sitting on
my desk right now and the knock-on works
both ways by the way if I'm at the home
screen and there's a blank area that I
could just double tap on it would turn
off the screen as well so of course with
the button layout on the back and I'm
not even able to press it because it's
lying on its back obviously having the
knock on is a very nice feature that
allows me to just turn on the phone very
easily and there it is so we'll go to
the lock screen and I'll select the NOC
code right here and it explains here you
can create your own NOC code using the
four corners of the screen now the four
corners of the screen yes that would
mean one two three four but it's also
scalable so you can have a small area
that allows you to just tap in what you
would envision is the grid in that small
area on the screen but you'll see that
in a little bit basically we're going to
tap quarters maybe up to eight times so
at least two to eight times that's the
that's the length of the code that they
really want you to have so for me I'm
going to do maybe something just a
little bit nimble and quick something
like that so six tabs right there wait
continue do it one more time hit confirm
and then you as you can see there
there's an area just right there that
you'll be able to tap on but there's
also another way to get into the phone
for whatever reason you forget what your
pattern is so with that in mind we're
just going to create a very quick backup
pin in order to make it easy to get back
in in case I forget the tap code or the
NOC code rather so with the screen off
we're going to take a look at the NOC
code and see how it works I'm just going
to envision a small area right here of a
2x2 four square grid and basically put
in my pattern and there you go it jumped
right into the OS it's just really quick
allows you to get into the phone right
away yeah maybe the NOC code that I
created is a little bit lengthy but to
me it's nice and quick if I just want to
take a look at the phone real quick I'm
just going to go over and look at the
side and just go like that and I jump
right into the phone it's really nice
and easy to use and you can put as many
patterns as you want in there I mean
there are many combinations that you can
think of so everyone will have a unique
NOC code in order to get into their
phone and it sort of provides a bit of a
unique experience in terms of using your
phone from a prone state right into the
operating system and so there you have
it for this look at the NOC code which
is found in the LG G pro 2 it's one of
the features that LG put into the new
larger version of the g2 and it works
very well it really works a treat you
can always turn on the screen if you
want to and then you can tap the
sequence in order to get into the
operating system but even then if you
were to just have the phone in a prone
state and just put in your code very
easily it goes right into the operating
system like no trouble at all so keep it
tuned to Android Authority for all the
best coverage we have more coverage of
the LG G pro 2 including my full review
coming very soon so make sure you stay
