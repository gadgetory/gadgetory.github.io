come back to the tablet game with a
release that is sure to make some waves
hey Josh of a gar from android authority
what's going on everybody and it's time
to unbox the LG G pad despite what felt
like a pretty hefty package it turns out
the bulk is due to the device itself
open up the flap and there it is the
eight point three inch screen of the g
pad lifting the tablet out of its
section the weight is definitely felt
338 grams is really no joke with the
tablet out of the way the Box got
incredibly light and this is because the
only extras were the micro USB cord and
the plug adapter made for Europe there
is a manual included but it's quite thin
and only gives a small look into the
main functions of the g pad any other
tutorials on other features are pretty
much built into the tablet already now i
already mentioned the weight of the
tablet and it is definitely something to
look out for of note are the deliberate
choices that LG made for their comeback
tablet for one thing the dimensions were
chosen in such a way to create a screen
experience as large as possible while
still maintaining adequate handling in
one hand I definitely don't have large
hands but I'm still able to grip the
tablet pretty easily with only minimal
strain LG also followed the trends and
found that aluminum material is usually
well received so the front white panel
does somewhat wrap around the top and
bottom of the device but once you make
it to the back most of it is made up of
aluminum it's a really nice feel and
it's somewhat refreshing for a tablet
definitely a plus in this first
impression the only physical buttons are
on the side for power and volume rockers
while on top there is a small covered up
slot for micro SD cards you will be able
to expand the storage in this LG G pad
getting through the initial setup is
pretty easy and soon enough I got to the
now tablet-sized Optimus UI that will
probably be the main part of the
software to look out for how LG's
operating system fares on a much larger
screen with a Snapdragon 600 powering
this device however we're pretty sure
it'll still be a snappy experience to
bridge the gap between the phone and the
tablet LG did add in the queue pair
function which tries to consolidate both
experiences the classic qslide apps make
it onto here as well along with the
slide aside all of which are functions
that we'll get to in the full review
we're really excited to see LG get back
into the
abla game especially after continuing to
put out great releases like the LG g2
stay tuned for our full review of the G
pad coming soon along with a couple
future focus videos definitely one on
the Q pair at the very least stay tuned
to android authority for all of the best
coverage because we're your source for
all things android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
