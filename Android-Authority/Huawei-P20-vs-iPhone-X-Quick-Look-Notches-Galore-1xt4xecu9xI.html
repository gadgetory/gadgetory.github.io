everybody and here comes a top-notch
comparison I'm sorry I had to make that
joke
it's the Huawei P 20 versus the iPhone
10 now obviously I had to make that pun
or joke or whatever you want to call it
because of the iPhone 10 which saw the
continuation of a new trend the knotch
so the notch is something that you may
or may not like already if you've used
the iPhone 10 before or if you've just
even seen it after all on the iPhone 10
the notch actually cuts the display a
little bit and can cut into the content
that you're looking at but Apple also
tries to make the notch usable in the
sense that if you swipe down from the
top on the left or the right you'll get
different elements so I've done from the
right and you get the control center
swipe down from the left and you end up
getting your notifications now the p20
does come with its own notch and it only
takes up a small portion at the top
thankfully not as much as the iPhone 10
however there is another feature on here
where you can turn off the knotch
kind of all of the elements at the top
that line up with the notch just become
a black bar so you get more of a
conventional experience where you get a
little bit more bezel on top effectively
now if you go down below those screens
you'll see that a lot has actually
changed the iPhone 10 no longer has its
iconic home button and it also just does
away with the fingerprint reader the
finger per reader does return in the p20
but it can also be used as the
navigation key to tap hold or swipe in
order to do everything that the soft
keys do when you turn them off always
always been about unique colors and now
we have something called a Twilight
Edition it has a gradient from blue to
purple and it just looks incredible
compared to the white or gray versions
of the iPhone 10 the p20 is just
incredibly eye-catching and what's great
is that all of the elements of the p20
kind of go over to the side so the color
takes center stage why don't we go ahead
and talk about those things in the
corner right now the iPhone 10 might
have Apple's most advanced camera ever
but Huawei is putting all of his
resources into the camera experience by
putting pretty much everything together
and trying to make them work in concert
now first the iPhone 10 features to 12
megapixel cameras one is a regular
sensor and the other is a telephoto zoom
now combined they are able to get a 2 X
optical zoom as well as portrait modes
that you can also see in the front
facing camera with different lighting
effects this is a little bit similar to
the p20 the smaller one even though it's
front facing camera is a whopping 24
megapixels and the
cameras have a RGB and monochrome
combination that allow it to get some
pretty high detail like from the p10
from last year but the Pete's when you
Pro is the world's first triple camera
that adds in that telephoto lens on top
of the two things we just mentioned but
the RGB sensor has been bumped up to 40
megapixels that sensor also is one of
the largest found in any smartphone I've
larger than the iPhone 10 and even the
galaxy s 9 for that matter so while we
of course will claim that the p20 pro
can capture so much more light in
low-light situations by using four
pixels into one larger one this means
that the pixel size is essentially 2
microns which is the largest in any
smartphone as well now ai is already
helping to make the scenes easy to
figure out as you just point the camera
at whatever scene you're looking at and
if it detects a face it will turn on
portrait mode turn on the bouquet
effects for example or if he's looking
at a play of food it's just going to up
the colors and turn on the food mode but
in low-light situations the AI is also
constantly cropping and warping anything
that comes into its sensor so that it
can make sure everything is lined up
perfectly so that means that for long
exposures in low-light situations let's
say a 4 second long exposure which is
what the night mode is on the Huawei P
20 and P 20 Pro the fact that you don't
even need a tripod is a big deal here
because long exposures are hard to get
in those situations or they're needed
and this is all on top of the 4d
predictive focus which uses four
different versions of focus laser phase
detection contrast and depth and puts
them all together so that the camera is
able to use anything possible to get the
focus it needs again putting all of its
resources together might actually be the
way that Huawei is able to step forward
in the camera photography game and we're
excited to put these two up against each
other in a camera comparison drop me
back to the front-facing camera for a
bit the p20 does have a very powerful 24
megapixel front camera the highest on
any wave phone to date but the iPhone
does its best to use its front-facing
camera features including face tracking
and face ID to provide an even more fun
experience and of course we're talking a
little bit about an emoji there's no
real equivalent of this to the p20 and
it's something that we do have to
mention because it kind of
differentiates the iPhone 10th from
pretty much any other Android device
because it just doesn't have this kind
of one-to-one track
for something that might be a little bit
silly but is effective for a lot of
users so all of these capabilities kind
of explain why the notch is a little bit
bigger on the iPhone 10 and again if you
don't really believe in the notch well
then this is a comparison that might not
really do anything for you but again on
the wall way it does allow you to kind
of turn it off but there's more going on
with the iPhone 10 simply and ultimately
what ties it all together are really
high powered specifications it's kind of
hard to quantify the two as the iPhone
10 obviously has different requirements
for what it needs for its operating
system and Huawei keeps things similarly
in-house with deke here in 970 the
software experiences are also very
different in the sense that Android
versus iOS is an age-old debate and as
we've already seen in this video the
iPhone 10 just employs very different
methods of navigation as opposed to
Android which kind of gives you every
option available the day to day in these
two devices should be fairly similar you
will be able to get a lot of the same
work and play tasks and done between
these two and really it's just a matter
of which which ecosystem you really want
to use and what you want to look at all
the time and the same can go for the
design some people have been able to
embrace the knotch and the iPhone 10 is
still a very popular device but the
Huawei P 20 tries to marry all of the
different aspects that people love about
smartphones until one cohesive package
you have a great coloration different
colorways you have a notch even at the
top if you want to have a more full
screen experience but you still get the
fingerprint reader and the home button
on the front and then of course you get
this great camera experience that tries
to put everything together so it really
matters what you want out of your
smartphone and if you want quite
literally everything well Huawei is
really pushing forward to create a
flagship device that might be able to
just do anything for everyone and so
there you have it a quick comparison
between the Huawei p20 and the iPhone 10
there's a lot to talk about between
these two phones because they do signify
pretty radical changes in their lines
the iPhone 10 is a huge departure but
the Huawei P 20 is also really trying to
differentiate itself from other Android
devices even so keep it tuned to Android
thority for more about the p20 and we'll
do future comparisons like we said
already so make sure you stay tuned for
