with Android Authority and today we'll
be checking out the Asus Zen watch 3 a
$230 Android wear Smart Watch felony
further ado let's get started alright so
the Sun watch 3 is available in three
colors rose gold silver and gunmetal
which is the model I have the first
thing that jumps out at you is the
circular watch face it's surrounded by
an accented diamond-cut bezel which
meets up with the rest of the watches
housing unlike the Moto 360 there's no
flat tire and get this ASIS somehow
managed to include an ambient light
sensor for auto brightness so you're
kind of getting the best of both worlds
here the watch itself is encased in a
stainless steel body and it definitely
gives off a premium vibe the Lud's might
look a bit odd at first but I think they
complement the rest of the design nicely
you can swap out the Sun watch's wrist
straps using the quick release pin
although you won't be able to use
third-party bands as the connection is
proprietary that's kind of a bummer but
the good news is is that the leather
wrist strap is actually pretty good
offering a good deal of both comfort and
style it might be a tad too small for
those with larger wrists though so you
might want to try it on in a retail
store before purchasing it if you're
worried about this on the side of the
watch there's three really nice really
tactile buttons so with the physical
keys you can quickly launch an app of
your choice go back or turn on airplane
mode I rarely use these buttons though
and to be frank three individual buttons
feels excessive so I think a single
customizable side button might have been
better overall design is certainly a
strong point I first thought that the
gold accent around the display looked a
bit tacky but it Kuran me over time for
the display we're looking at a 1.3 9
inch circular AMOLED panel with a
resolution of 400 by 400 this is
probably the best display on a
SmartWatch to date and having auto
brightness is an absolute godsend it
does tend to lower brightness values
though making the display hard to read
in summand
fireman's hopefully a future software
update can tweak this for the extremes
there's no proper low brightness mode so
the watches theater mode just turns off
the display completely sunlight
readability is great though probably
some of the best you'll obtain from this
form factor under the hood dozen watch 3
is a bit different from devices like the
Huawei watch and the Moto 360
second-generation instead of using a
Snapdragon 400 uses Qualcomm Snapdragon
wear 2100 that's important because the
wear 2100 ship was designed specifically
for smartwatches theoretically
translating to faster performance and
better battery life well the Sun watch 3
does not disappoint with performance
swiping between cards and panels is very
smooth and I didn't notice much like
there's also 512 megabytes of RAM which
is pretty much standard for Android wear
does n watch 3 has ip67 certification
meaning that it's dust proof and water
resistant for up to 1 meter of water for
30 minutes now we want to recommend
taking a shower with the Zen watch but
you won't have to worry about it when
say watching your hands so for
connectivity it primarily uses bluetooth
4.1 to connect with your Android phone
or iPhone but also supports Wi-Fi as
sort of a fallback what it does not have
however is GPS and NFC so you'll be
missing out on a few standalone wear
apps as well as any potential for using
the watch for Android pay there also
isn't a heartrate monitor which is a bit
disappointing since many competing
options include one there is a
microphone and speaker though so yes you
can use your watch to place and receive
calls if you wish
asus says the 340 million power battery
should last one to two days depending on
your usage and I was able to get around
24 hours per charge that's about average
for an Android wear device what's not
average though is the Zen watch 3 is
fast charging which can go from 0 to 60
percent in just 15 minutes it's a really
great feature to have is it means I can
just plop it on the charger while
getting ready in the morning and come
back to it 40 minutes later fully
charged speaking of the charger it
connects to flush underside pins
magnetically guides itself into place
it's not perfect by any means but it's
one of the better implementations we've
seen just one gripe though the charging
cable is only about a meter long that
would it be a big issue if Asus were
selling longer cables but that's just
not the case and it seems that you
currently can't even get an extra or
replacement charger so you'll have to be
gentle with the one you receive in the
box
for software there's not much to say
other than that it's running Android
where it looks like this watch will be
updated to the upcoming Android wear 2.0
update though so that's certainly
something to look forward to just to
give a basic overview of the user
interface you're basically starting out
with a watch face of your choice which
acts as your home screen from there you
can swipe up to see and act on different
cards which are sent by apps on your
phone so for example if I get a hangouts
message a card pops up with the message
details from there I can either leave it
dismiss it or reply with my voice it's
all very neat and you can think of it as
a sort of a notification manager on your
wrist a Seuss's own software is
relatively little which is good the Zen
watch manager app includes over 50
exclusive watch faces but unfortunately
there's only a few good ones you can
always download third-party watch faces
from the Google Play Store though so all
is not lost
there's also a Seuss's Zen fit which is
a built-in app on the watch that tracks
steps workouts and sleep I found it
worked pretty well overall and it's
wonderful that it syncs with Google that
you can purchase the Sun watch 3 now
from various retailers for $229 that's a
great bargain considering what asus has
brought to the table it's quite
difficult not to fall in love with the
Zen watch 3 with this beautiful design
great display excellent performance and
nice hardware if you're looking for what
is likely the most well-rounded
SmartWatch to date look no further with
that said as much as I love the Zen
watch 3 is Hardware the overall
experience isn't enough for me to keep
using it here's the thing smartwatches
at least in their current form aren't
for everyone and that's ok
the point is asus has developed an
excellent SmartWatch that won't
disappoint so if you think the
SmartWatch concept is for you definitely
go for it thank you so much for watching
