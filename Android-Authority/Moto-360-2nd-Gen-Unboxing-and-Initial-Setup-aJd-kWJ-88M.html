made it to my doorstep hey it's Josh a
fag are from Android authority what's
going on everybody and it's time to
unbox and give my first impressions on
the Moto 360 2nd gen and here we are
with the Moto 360 the second-generation
brand new and made in Moto maker they
really waste no time showing you exactly
the version that you got of the Moto 360
and in my case I got the brown leather
band with the silver trim and bezel I
wanted to keep it pretty classic and
really the premium options in Moto maker
just didn't really do it for me but
without any further ado we are going to
get into the unboxing itself a nice ring
around here is where the adhesive is and
then with the tape off we can go ahead
and open this thing up
and there it is already feeling the
metallic body and the bezel it feels
like a very premium device even more so
than the original 360 was socially when
you have these nubs on the bottom and
the top and as it says on the side of
the box they are going to be easily
removable the straps that is so that you
can change it if you so choose but I
like the brown leather so probably end
up keeping that there it looks like we
actually have a sticker on the front
there so we'll actually be able to peel
that off very ceremoniously and also on
the back there now this really does look
like a watch it has the visage of one
let's put it with the nubs on the top
and bottom making this a little bit
easier to customize with different watch
straps compared to the original moto 360
and here is the charging dock which has
already been a great addition with the
original moto 360 definitely a little
bit more intuitive where you can
actually put the watch down onto it well
and allow it to be used as like a docked
clock that way you'll still be able to
get the time from it even while it's
charging on let's say your nightstand
now one peculiar thing about this
charging cable is that it doesn't have
the ability to remove the actual cord
it's built into the plug adapter it's a
little bit odd but at least the charging
dock still takes micro USB so you should
still be able to use any other chargers
that you so wish
getting the watch set up with my Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 in particular really was a
pretty standard affair I do like the new
splash logos and all of the splashes
that are available in Android wear not
only on the watch but also on the app on
the phone but really what took a while
was syncing the applications from the
phones to watch itself so that might be
kind of normal but it did take a little
while then I took a look around the
watch while it was sinking what we have
here is a really nice Horine leather
strap right here that feels already
pretty comfortable and of course on the
back we have the heart rate sensor as
far as the screen goes the display is
360 by 360 and I have the 46 millimeter
version of it there is a smaller 42
millimeter version of this that I was
unfortunately not able to get and it is
better suited for those with smaller
wrists there's even a quote-unquote
women's edition but really the smaller
one can be used by women but the women
designation is mostly for the different
straps that are available for the
smaller version of the watch underneath
the surface is a Snapdragon 400 with
half a gigabyte of RAM and 4 gigabytes
of storage available underneath now
bluetooth and Wi-Fi are both available
on this particular watch and we go ahead
and have the watch put on right here the
leather feels really nice it's still a
very comfortable feel here and with 46
millimeters it does take up pretty much
all of the space on my wrist but it
really isn't uncomfortable at all the
other change on here aside from a pretty
shiny and pretty glossy finish here is
the button which is now at an angle up
here on the top now pressing that will
activate everything you can press it
again I do have the ambient display on
and this AMOLED display will be able to
conserve battery while still showing the
time and of course if I move my wrist it
will turn on as well going through the
setup here it's the pretty standard
setup with all of the different cards
and you will be doing a lot of the
inputs on here using cards and also by
using low button presses like this as
you swipe among the various parts of the
app absent actions press and hold the
side button
so if you hold that it goes to the menu
where you can find all of the different
applications including modal body
integration with maps so you can see
where you're going
and of course OneNote play music I also
have pocket casts there's even pulmo to
do right here which is a personal
productivity app that I love to use that
already is integrated on here I think
that's really cool fetching data from
the phone and there is the Android wear
application so automatically any apps
that are installed on your phone are
going to be installed onto the watch
I'll go and swipe away from here of
course you can do that with your palm
let's go ahead and turn that on that
button feels really nice and media as
well it's got a really satisfying click
to it as well
changing the watch face is as simple as
going into the app itself as you can see
here or touching and holding on the
watch face of course a lot of these
things are pretty standard things that
you would expect from Android wear
already and I already have notifications
coming in from mostly Facebook as you
can see here and other applications that
I've already installed onto the watch
and so there you have it for this
unboxing and first impressions and
initial setup for the Moto 360 second
generation now this year's crop of
smartwatches seems to be really
enjoyable actually because not only are
they looking even better they're
probably going to function even better
with updates to Android wear and the
Moto 360 is no exception
even though I may not be the biggest fan
of having to look at the watch all the
time to swipe up and down and see what
I'm looking for it is actually more
enjoyable on what looks like a very
sleek and very almost executive looking
watch but of course that is because of
my doing on the Moto maker getting this
brown leather with the silver body and
bezel I think this watch looks fantastic
honestly and those nugs on the bottom
and on the top will allow for even
better customization because it's easier
to get into the body with your own
personal wrist straps
well we're going to go through the next
week or so just using the Moto 360 on
the daily I will see how this 400
milliamp hour battery holds up in daily
usage but of course you have that great
charging dock where you can put the
watch on its side and it will change
into a different orientation so you can
still use it as a nightstand clock of
sorts so keep it tuned to Android
for even more and thank you very much
for watching this initial setup of the
Moto 360 second gen I'll tell you right
now because of the way this thing looks
I'm really happy to have it on my wrist
at least for the time being and we'll
see if it will be in the future because
I will be comparing it to even more
smartwatches
that are coming out in the next few
weeks maybe a couple of months and you
can keep it tuned to you for that and
even more from my colleagues here at
Android authority head on over to Andrew
authority comm when you're done with all
of that to listen to the podcast talk
about Android in our forums and then
stick around for even more written
content because we are your source for
