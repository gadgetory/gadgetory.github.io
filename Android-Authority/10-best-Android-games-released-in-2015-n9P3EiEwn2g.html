handy the Android a30 app guy we had a
ton of awesome games that were released
here in 2015 and it's time to round up
the best ones this engages a puzzle
adventure game with a fun twist you play
as two teenagers who are dealing with
all kinds of ridiculous shenanigans the
game comes with unique hand-drawn
graphics along with an all-star cast of
voice actors that include Elijah Wood
Wil Wheaton Jennifer Hale Jack Black and
others the music is pretty good as well
it's a pay once game with no in-app
purchases and it's one of the most
complete games released this year Chaos
Rings 3 is an RPG published by Square
Enix and this game is huge it features a
full-fledged storyline complete with a
ton of side missions that will keep you
going for at least a couple of dozen
hours there is also an arena mode where
you can earn new items and upgrade your
characters even further it comes
complete with fantastic graphics and
above-average soundtrack and even
cutscenes it's one of the few games I've
ever played on mobile that doesn't
really feel like a mobile game fallout
shelter is one of only two freemium
games that made it on this year's list
the height for this game was absolutely
bananas and it quickly became one of the
most popular games of the year the game
itself is a survival simulator where you
must recruit a group of dwellers as you
build maintain and protect your shelter
there are a variety of jobs and tasks to
perform and Bethesda has done a good job
so far preserving the quirky feeling of
the Fallout franchise Wynne Square Enix
released Final Fantasy Tactics War of
the Lions it almost jumped to the top of
the strategy RPG list on principle alone
this is a port of the PSP version of the
game and comes complete with extra
content jobs and even movies from the
PSP remake of course it's been optimized
for touch screens as well about the only
bad thing about it is the lack of Google
Play game services but it wouldn't be
the first time a Square Enix eventually
added that in later Lara Croft go is
another Square Enix title that almost no
one had a problem with it's a tap and
swipe puzzle adventure game where you
must guide Lara through a bunch of
obstacles in order to collect various
relics and complete levels it's
surprisingly fun especially considering
that it isn't a full-fledged Tomb Raider
game and the developers have already
begun adding new content it has Google
Play game services and a 4.7 rating in
the Google Play Store limbo is a 2d
puzzle game that's unlike anything else
released this year you play as a boy as
you delve into the depths of
limbo in order to rescue your sister
along the way are a variety of puzzles
that will likely kill you repeatedly
it's been hailed by pundits and gamers
alike as one of the best mobile games
released this year thanks to its subtle
but good looking graphics challenging
puzzles and fun concept there are also
no in-app purchases minecraft story mode
is the marquee released from telltale
games this year a game studio that
dominated our lists last year in this
title you play as a girl named Jesse as
you venture forth through all the
various worlds for Minecraft including
the nether and the end it features an
all-star cast of voice actors including
Patton Oswalt Ashley Johnson Corey
Feldman and Brian Posehn if you're a fan
of Minecraft this is a game you
definitely don't want to miss prune is
an atmospheric puzzle game that was
released earlier this year but it has
already amassed them pretty serious
critical acclaim with this title your
job is to cut and cultivate trees to
help them reach sunlight in order to
grow blossom and become really pretty
the graphics are fairly bare-bones and
the mechanics are pretty simple but it's
a strangely fun and relaxing game and
you only have to pay for it once
unkilled is the second of two freemium
titles that made our best list this year
this one was done up by madfinger games
a studio you may recognize for their
work doing dead trigger and shadow gun
in this thrilling zombie shooter you
well shoot a whole ton of zombies there
are 300 missions to complete tons of
weapons to collect and it's all wrapped
up in some of the best graphics we've
seen all year it's definitely worth
checking out especially if you like
shooters it didn't take long before this
war of mine became one of the must-have
games of 2015 it's a survival game where
you must lead a bunch of people around
to avoid soldiers in a besieged city you
must avoid snipers make life-or-death
decisions and operate on a night-and-day
basis in order to simply survive the
game is an unrepentant gruesome and
merciless rollercoaster ride that
manages to succeed in almost every
conceivable way this game is among the
precious few that properly showcase what
a mobile game can really be like and
that's why it's our pick for the best
Android game of 2015
