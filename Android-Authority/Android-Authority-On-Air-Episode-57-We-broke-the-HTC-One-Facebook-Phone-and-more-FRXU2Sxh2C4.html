original android hangout show on google+
I'm dare cross and I'm Scott Anderson
this week we are joined with Johnathan
Franklin Joshua Vergara and Christopher
wook thank you guys for joining us glad
to have you here as always great to be
here all right so this week we are going
to talk about some device news or
surrounding some rumors such as
something Facebook might be doing now
we're going to talk about nexus 4 stuff
and talk about the HTC one in what what
we did to that gorgeous phone here at
Android authority we have some carrier
news and mainly t-mobile as well as some
app updates so let's get started with
some device rumors and some device news
so no one here first some rumors and
speculation are some actual news you
know let's start out with actual news so
the nexus 4 got a slight new design this
week people actually might even been the
last week I saw people actually starting
to talk about it so nexus 4 started
shipping refurbed as well as new ones
started showing up to people that had a
slight very slight redesign and the
redesign was a few nubs or nipples or
bumps whatever you wanna call it on the
back and that that does actually that
does a lot because right now the
original Nexus 4 I guess we'll call the
og nexus 4 is a completely flat back of
smooth glass and if you own a nexus 4
you know that you can't set it on top of
something with the slightest degree of
an angle where it will slide off or no
angle I mean it it's a slippery bastard
I'll tell you that right now it it likes
the slide um I've set it on top of well
when I own the nexus 4 i I've set it on
top of things that it should not have
slid off of and because it's smooth
completely flat it wound up on the floor
multiple times thankfully nothing ever
happened but it was interesting I used
to set it on my laptop and I used to
wash it slowly slowly slowly creep off
my left up it anyways so those nubs help
that with nubs it's not going to slide
but also when the nexus 4 is laying
completely flat the speakers on the back
so if you're trying to you know listen
for a text message beep or or some type
of notification or even a ring it makes
it quieter because you're muffling the
speaker so we always you know you can
always put it on its face but your eye
can see the notification light so it was
it yeah exactly so so yeah you're kind
of like huh should I fuya which way
should I put it you know you flip-flop
so now like having an iphone don't don't
compare the nexus for tonight okay just
say alright so if you if you don't want
to do that whole flip-flop what about
which way am I supposed to blame my
phone well now it's being raised like a
millimeter off the off the surface and
that you know millimeter two millimeters
whatever it is a tiny little bump might
be enough to to help you be able to hear
the speaker a little bit better and hear
your notifications a little bit better
so some people are thinking yes these
that's an awesome design change than
other people were like no you know the
original design was beautiful what are
you doing you're putting a blemish on
the back so what do you guys think about
that is it awesome you Nexus 4 owners
you know or is it a blemish you wish you
had gotten to the people to the people
who are complaining I ok how often is
someone gonna pick up your phone look at
the back like this and just be like this
oh this phone looks terrible something
like that is that a piece of dirt on
their you don't try to the battery
laughs like I will say one thing though
when I heard that there was a new design
for it I thought just how much are they
going to change it and then when you
think about it there's really not much
of a change at all I'm actually
interested in how they came to that
decision did Ally people complained and
you know anything like that or was it
just forward thinking on their part that
being said the slide is a very this very
nice fix I once saw my nexus for sliding
various
we off the hood of my car once I am too
am slow motion and jumped and caught it
but yeah that slide is it is a problem
every now and then but to the people who
are complaining about that tiny little
change of the back I mean I think you're
nitpicking at that point you know I gets
a great design thing that's very useful
and you know my phone slides everywhere
even if I think it's a flat service and
you know I gotta take out my leveler
before in order to make sure that it's
safe to put it down but it moves a lot
and hopefully this fixes it it is
definitely off seeing a lot of people
that did complain about the slipperiness
of the device you know that love it
otherwise it's good to see that they
make a decision like that even mid
device cycle to fix something like that
for customers because you don't see that
a lot now these little knobs it's still
my slide with these little knobs it's
not going to be it's not going to be a
one you know stop fixing these things
are very tiny if it's on an angled
surface it's still a slippery device
it's still going to slide but this is
definitely gonna help now something else
they changed it and I don't even know
why they changed it besides the fact
that they could the backing around the
camera lens is now smaller so there's
less of a back less glass plastic or
whatever surrounding the actual lens the
lens itself isn't any smaller it's just
a smaller hole that the lens fits in so
it's a tighter design I don't know if
that has any effect on any type of
camera quality or if it's just hey we
can change this and it's not going to
affect anything for the worst so let's
do it you camera guys out there Josh and
wookie what do you think of any uh any
thoughts on why that was possibly done
and more and more cosmetic nitpicking to
be honest the glass covering around what
is actually just a tiny lens right there
it really shouldn't change the look of
the pictures or anything like that it
really should like you want you're not
going to get up and getting around the
image just I shouldn't happen so really
it's probably just another cosmetic
nitpick to be honest
you look at small the Lumias of glasses
I mean mostly the glass on there is just
for aesthetic reasons anyway to make
people think that they're getting out of
a huge camera the one act like the one
acts and then had the exposed glass and
stuff like that they're doing it for you
know kind of like consumer appeal more
than functionality my son's all right so
let's let's talk about some rumors and
some speculation because who doesn't
love love some rumors and speculation
from unannounced devices I know I do it
makes me wake up in the morning just to
see what I can gab about such as things
that were posted on Google+ as a
complete joke earlier today and someone
took that complete joke seriously and
tweeted me about it on Twitter and then
the person the joke was made about
cyanogen told me that that was the
furthest thing from the truth apparently
what uh Erin Erin and I were doing
people people took its ear if it's in a
meme chances are the meme is not serious
anyways anyways I was getting off on a
tangent I've seen some spurious memes
all right so if kids if conspiracy keanu
reeves is in a meme chances are it's not
serious that is true that's true yeah so
so earlier today when Erika katzen and I
were doing things like all know cyanogen
Steve Kondik quit samsung and he uses
facebook ah he must be going to work on
the facebook phone because that's what
Forbes thinks in a Forbes says it it
must be true it always says anyway so
yeah that that's that's probably the
furthest thing from the truth and if
you're if you believe the the jokes that
Aaron and I put out there yeah all right
so so let's make up let's make up some
more stuff let's talk about the the
Nexus ernum so are the Facebook rumors
that are coming out so Facebook has been
rumored for a very long time to be
making a phone leaves children what's
that it's been rumored for like a year
or two yeah
yeah exactly it's been removed for a
very long time and it was rumored to be
you know the HTC missed the leaked specs
from forever ago or a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core Snapdragon s4 gig of ram a 4.3
inch 720p display yeah and a 5 megapixel
camera sensor so it's I mean these specs
for me like a year ago that they could
change it's a low-end medium rain it's a
medium range phone and it's a very
affordable phone from the from the looks
of these specs cannot be true so we
haven't really heard anything from a
long time about this and then Facebook
puts out a flyer today saying her
yesterday saying hey on April fourth
come check us out and come see our new
home on Android quotes come see our new
home on Android so initially people said
well Facebook we know they're planning a
new app roll out to match their new news
feed a new design everything so that's
that's what we're looking at and then
the wall street journal reports that
Facebook was going to do something a
little bit more than that they were
going to do something where they were
going to put Facebook first where the
first thing you see on your phone is
facebook so readers that's healthy whoa
we're reading into that yeah in what the
Wall Street Journal says it sounds like
it's going to be more than a widget
because they already have a widget now
it and because they're talking about to
come see our new home on Android a lot
of people are speculating that it's
going to be an Android launcher or
something to that effect almost like
HTC's blinkfeed because the wall street
journal reported that in an HTC device
would be the first device to demonstrate
this capability so why would Facebook be
doing this well this move is designed to
increase the amount of time somebody
spends on their service on facebook you
know they have shareholders oh please
they need to make money they need a
boost
revenue so right now they're not making
any money on mobile on mobile ads so
they need to do that so I guess my
question for you guys in the audience
right now as well as everybody else
participating in this hangout is do you
think that Facebook is going to come out
with an Android launcher and Facebook if
I you know the the Android experience
that way or are they going to go even
further and actually fork Android and
come out with their own you know fully
facebook branded Facebook ified device
similar to like what Amazon did with
fire line where it's Android but it's
completely different than Android you
know so do you think of a forked version
of Android here guys or we think in a
lawn chair not in either one is a huge
step for a social network to to say hey
we're gonna put a launcher on there and
what would be the benefits of having a
facebook launcher you know what why
would you want to do this well think of
hooks in general hooks meaning data
hooks you know how much information can
they get from you just like you know
google has its hooks in Android and you
know a lot of stuff that are is in the
cloud is on our phones and accessible
ideally I think Facebook would want to
do a forked version and they could have
a lot more hooks that way with the home
screen replacement they could definitely
drive more traffic and it would be more
in your face but I think it might be a
baby step home screen launcher uh at
first that's my thought I don't know
what was what do you think John well I
mean it's feasible that they do this um
it's kind of interesting at this point
in time comes to our new home on Android
because their application is still
terrible that if they think that they
can get into the home screen launcher
business or that they can get into the
hardware and providing software for a
piece of hardware business is poorly
they write code for Android already I
mean they're the company that had to
patch up dalvik because they were
calling so many methods that nobody else
had even ran into this problem but
accept them and you know what let's say
zactly issues they were running into
because this is something they were
working on you know well this is just
for their application this is for
gingerbread house for gingerbread me and
you're talking about you know they just
do such a poor job on Android
development they this is effort they
could have invested in fixing their
application but this also makes you
wonder if they had you know a different
project going on the side the whole time
so yeah it'll be interesting i don't
think i don't think facebook realizes
that his users don't care about them as
much as they think they do you know most
people i know that use facebook don't
really love facebook they just you know
they use it the ones that do use it
heavily or usually playing games that
aren't really accessible on a mobile
device anyway so it'll be interesting to
see how it pans out so so let's let's uh
let's explore the option that facebook
keeps a standalone app where it's the
app and that's all that it is maybe it's
a new version of what they have now and
then they come out with the facebook
launcher so it that you have a choice or
they could just make the facebook it is
the launcher if you want facebook this
is what you're getting they could
literally force this change on you so
that's going to draw people away except
for teenage girls i mean we're all
sitting here thinking of our own kind of
way of looking at it but if you think
about a completely different portion of
the market who doesn't really care what
android is at all facebook launchers
might actually make sense for them it
makes me kind of shiver but that could
be something that you know people would
be interested in anybody ever think
about it could be an app store well
let's play on that scott so let's say
they do come up with their own
their own launcher or even their own
Fork of Angela either one would be okay
too for this explanation here so you
want to see your newsfeed well your new
you know you want to see your your news
well your news is your news feed you
don't need to open up a third party app
because people will share news headlines
for that you need to read people will
like stories that you want to read as
well your friends you know shower
updates and bathroom updates you know
those type of things will come in um you
know in pictures and everything so you
have that right in your home screen now
facebook already allows for an instant
upload but let's say it's a special
camera app you know it's Instagram or
their own camera app like they had
pushed out you know before so we need
specifically for taking pictures of
yourself and crops privately for car
photos food so it has filters built into
it you know or maybe it is just it maybe
it's Instagram maybe that's the new
facebook camera but you know whatever
they're going to do it's a some type of
specific facebook camera that
automatically has the instant upload
which you can already do but with this
new launcher its integrated in you can't
escape it if you use this new launcher
or this new fork of android you know
it's it's turned on by default you
probably turn it off but so they have
the camera functionality the instant
upload functionality newsfeed
functionality i would say wait well we
need an app store well facebook has kind
of a mobile app store now lets me i hate
to call it that because it's not really
an app store but let's expand upon that
lets say that let's say that if they if
they were to push out a launcher it
could be like chameleons it could be an
html5 launcher which means there are
apps that they have on their app store
more apps would work right okay so okay
so so now we have our own apps wave run
an app store we have camera upload well
email Facebook has email there's your
email apps and there's your own
ecosystem right now now we're getting
somewhere facebook also allows you to do
document sharing now it's it's a new
feature well it new relatively when the
past so many months i don't know what
exactly came out because i don't use
facebook but i do know you can do
document sharing there's your drive type
app and they're not really but you know
these things could really go somewhere
and turn into almost like what Amazon is
doing you know I I'm saying things that
could happen these are all speculations
who knows I could be completely wrong
but I could see these things turning
into something you guys think I'm
completely off my rocker here no not
really i mean the the idea of a facebook
phone like like like what key said it
did it's a very jarring i really don't
think that'd be a very good device to
have in any stretch of the imagination
but to have a launcher of some show of
some sort or to have some sort of take
something on the software front i think
would work out even much better for them
it's something that i thought who booed
to should have done instead of making a
whole new phone just release a launcher
because it's very elegant it looks very
nice but to have a whole device built
around just that one thing might be a
little weird I feel the same way about
Facebook let me think about it from a
business perspective they're trying to
get more relevant data for users and
serve them more relevant things so
they're trying to do what Google does
but kind of push them out of the way if
they use Facebook I mean I right now
their shareholders they need money they
need to make a lot of money in order for
their stock to go up so right now
they're just trying to get hooks and
then serve you stuff that's an
interesting thing just something real
quick as the Amazon got into it you know
as a little kind of a loss leader to
lead their services there's nothing
saying that I mean really Facebook's
only chance at getting a lot of people
to adopt it is to get you know tie into
the advertising side there's nothing
saying they couldn't subsidize the OEM
kind of like Google does with the Nexus
program has sell the device dirty in
exchange for the fact that they're going
to basically force users to generate
traffic to their website for a drip and
you so you know if they force it on
people rather than people that just
aren't clicking on their ads now they
could generate revenue to the point to
drive you know a phone to be much
cheaper than the same you know level of
hardware for you know
one device without Facebook's software
yeah well the part that is interesting
to me is it it's pretty obvious from the
tagline that was put out that they're
putting their eggs and androids basket
I'm very if whatever this is it's
obvious that it's going to be based upon
Android how polarizing is that going to
be for users of other platforms and I'm
really interested to see what the
blowback would be on that for say iphone
users Windows Phone users who say you
know oh you're you have this whole new
thing for Android wear where's our love
stuff like that I can see that yeah now
while we have a we have a question
related to the subject Zach young wants
to know about the rumor that Andy Rubin
going to facebook um I I'm gonna say no
and I'm gonna leave it a dad that
Android is his baby yes he's no longer
you know heading Android yes he is an
entrepreneur to start up and could go to
Facebook and help them launch a new
device heat but that doesn't make sense
because Larry Page in his address said
Andy Rubin was going to start his next
chapter at Google he didn't say start
his next chapter doc doc daughter next
chapter in his life he said next chapter
at Google so I'm pretty sure Andy Rubens
going to project x.x labs whatever you
want to call it where they do have a
product coming out that needs to be
fostered from the ground up you know I I
I can't see this happening in a million
years now this silicon valley yes
anything can happen but it's not gonna
happen I will eat this Android beanie if
Andy Rubin goes to work for facebook
this Android beanie I will cook whatever
ever or in like the next week ever okay
okay fair i will eat this android BTW i
will dip it oh well what's good with
cotton like ketchup and solder where's
blowing his Twitter's blowing up right
now
he's right yo Andy if you go roll work
for facebook just random guy and that's
gonna eat is packed but you need to do
it um could he go there for consoling I
nobody will know I i I'm saying if it
happens I'm gonna eat this thing I'm
eating it if it happens I do not read
here first yeah you heard it here first
um okay so let's uh let's move on and
talk about some app updates here break
up the devices before we get into team
Wookiee in vergara alright so on google+
got up updated the mobile app you can
one big thing that is nice is when you
upload a picture from mobile it doesn't
like have the gray thing so it's like
immediately uploaded it's not that lag g
has ever experienced yeah did we
experience the lagger do we experience
the new way no like you're hotter your
leg let's say i uploaded a picture and
then it'd be great and nobody would know
what it is I'd ask a question it would
be funny hours and then they finally pop
all these that bug is fixed thank
goodness um it's basically got a kind of
a new overlay the comments constantly
change and you get to see different
comments how do you guys like that
feature is it I mean it's more than your
face there's more going around i guess
like the comment was cool but it's not
really useful if you have a thread as
like a 130 comments and it really it's
cool in the beginning when there's only
a few a few comments you know i like
that yeah it wanders when you're getting
100 comments or so it's making me who
cares but it's still nice feature my
biggest complaint about the new version
if i had to complain was the plus one in
comments his reversed that hate that
hates my thumb or my thumb hates that I
you know now I have to move my thumb an
extra inch just to be +1 everything I
hate it you gotta you gotta work for
like I do I gotta you gotta work for
that plus one now uh then the gmail app
got the pulldown notification with the
archive or reply
that's nice yeah oh joy yes that's very
handy I don't know why that wasn't there
before but you know it's google sound
surge got updated I don't know what got
updated in this I'll tell you what
definitely got updated people in the UK
can actually do a sound search now
because the the changelog is where
what's new is first place for a release
so it haven't changed that well my buddy
Lee Jarrett from google plus daily
actually took some screenshots he's over
there across the pond in the UK and he
took some screenshots whereas before you
weren't able to do a sound search in the
UK and now he can so maybe that was the
the biggest update just adding support
for different regions different
countries I play movies got updated this
is a pretty interesting update but when
you're watching a movie you can pause it
and check the actor that's in there so
they're using facial recognition I think
to check the actor and give specs about
it that's pretty neat have you guys used
that specs on the actor yeah like while
you're watching a movie and then just
pause it on an actor it's pretty cool
haven't gotten to try yeah but it looks
really nice it works well I want to zoom
in on an extra and see if I can get
views on the next trip oh yeah um also
chrome beta like it does every week got
updated again chrome beta is getting to
be a viable option for a browser
replacement I deleted chrome the day
that Chrome Beta came out I don't have
yeah I don't have chrome on my device I
just use chrome beta it's getting a lot
better a lot faster well normally I push
people to get stable channels but in
this case the stable was so bad that
it's just worse worth getting debated to
stay up to date yeah I like their the
rollout timing you know it's constant
which is really nice um Tasker got a
holo makeover which is nice and it's
also on sale for 199 which is good cuz
that's normally a six dollar fifty said
Apple I believe it's a 649 or maybe
maybe even 699 but it either way it's
it's a heck of a discount I guess
seventy percent off so yeah so so task
you're a lot
to automate a lot of things on your
phone but um if you if you're constantly
turning off Wi-Fi GPS Bluetooth it can
do a lot more than that but that people
use it a lot for those type of things be
you can have it set up to do something
silly like whenever you connect to your
home Wi-Fi network if it to
automatically turn on your google TV and
put it on your news channel or something
like that you can do a lot of neat
automation with it yeah real quick I
heard uh I just remembered and I thought
about there's a story that i saw on
reddit of somebody using Tasker on his
android phone to send a text to his wife
when he was at work like I showed the
location-based inside of the phone if he
was still at work after a certain time
he texts his wife that he was going to
be late yeah I actually I actually do
something similar with NFC task launcher
well I do it once every maybe two weeks
because I forget to do it every day but
I have an NFC tag of work set to it set
up all my preferences at work I tap the
tag when I get there and it you know
turns off things and turns on things one
of the actions is to send my wife a text
message saying hey honey I made it to
work and then when I tap it at the end
of the day it turns everything on or off
depending on what it needs and then it
sends an additional text message saying
hey honey I'll even work but yeah I only
do that once every two weeks yeah I
don't remember to do it too often and
then action lock launcher I believe
Jonathan you use this action launcher
basically got updated with a new feature
called shudders shudders is awesome
basically you can ass wipe an icon
in a folder or out of a folder and bring
up the widget of that icon well pretty
cool stuff it's very accessible it makes
it a lot easier to use Jonathan have you
use this yet yeah it's it's pretty
awesome because you can have your home
screen set up like normal like if you
have your browser icon and you'll have
to have a ever gigantic widget taking up
real estate where if you like with
chrome you just swipe up on the icon it
brings up your big bookmarks widget and
you can find yourself a book more real
quick without having to take up an extra
screen for that's all I haven't tried it
sounds neat tell me
should give it is it free or you gonna
pay for data but I so I can't ride for a
few minutes before I can request a
refund Oh Connie very cool another app
that got updated if you're a google TV
fan I'm going to say that the drawing a
blank here Oh prime time primetime got
updated this week so if your google TV
user you know what prime time is it's
the app guide tells you what shows are
playing I and based on different genres
and so forth it got updated to now
include amazon prime content before it
didn't list so if I'm let's say watching
uh I don't know i'm watching law and
order and I hit the guide and psycho hey
look you can buy law and order season
five on Amazon or something like that so
it allows you to see Amazon content as
well as you could you know other content
that you could previously see such as
your Netflix um which is nice it ties
into then the version 3 of Google TV
which will allow you to launch the
Amazon crime app the official app as
well as another google TV update is a
flex pass plucks pass actually gets an
update almost every week though so it's
really not that big a news it it's a new
version of plex a really awesome redone
version of plex and if it got updated
this week
so we have a spin I'm not gonna kick him
out of the room this this is this is the

bug fixes in a few additional features

definitely check that out so Scott Meah
Meah other app updates that are worth
mentioning my no soundcloud got an
update apparently it does uh tablet UI

the on the upper it's actually we should
talk about soundcloud since we are all
in soundcloud you know soundcloud.com /
android authority you might be listening
to us right now on soundcloud we had a
couple of thousand the downloads it i
think a week on there anyways so beyond
app updates and my son interrupting the
show sorry about that everybody but a
good dad not gonna kick him out of the
room without giving the telling him
goodnight give him a kiss um let's talk
about the HTC one hour our buddy chris
wook wookie a few weeks ago was at the
HTC one event you covered the event
there and got to play around with HTC
One and do a bunch of reviews his
official review when op as we received a
unit to do review with recently and then
and he sent it to Josh for Josh to do
some interesting stuff with so let's
talk about talk about the HTC one here
walkie oh you know to tell us you know
what you liked about anything he didn't
like anybody out there that's you know
looking to purchase the HTC One this guy
here he's played with it he's you know
put it through the the tests he's will
collide it if you will so let us know uh
let's know your take on it um the very
first thing actually that really
impressed me was boomsound surprisingly
enough um it's I'm gonna say this right
away it's not for audiophiles beats
audio isn't for audio files but what
they did with those speakers sounds huge
I was really really impressed they made
a big deal out of it at the event in New
York but you know and something that
crowded with all the music and parkour
going on you can't really you can't
really tell what these little speakers
sound like but when I first started
playing stuff on there i was amazed at
the sound coming out of this little fun
it's seriously the the biggest sounding
phone I've ever heard I mean this maker
bizarre-looking let me pause you for a
second you remember when we're at sea as
we play with the the pantech discover
discovery yes hey do but I call it the
right name right now so remember that
was a loud sounding phone do you
remember no I do want you that too is it
is the one louder than the Pantex film
yeah it's both louder and bigger sander
I don't know what they did but it really
sounds huge sorry I remember that the
discover sounded loud I mean we could
hear it in the noisy CES hall it was so
that's impressive that they're they're
blowing that away I think they actually
made the Chamber's bigger for the
speaker's themselves yeah you can
actually go lower without straining yeah
the low end is surprisingly Bumi you're
not going to listen to music with it and
here you know great highs and great lows
you're never going to do that with
speaker that low I mean speaker that
small but for watching movies and things
like that it's really pretty cool I will
tell you that if they have
do if any manufacturer makes a speaker
that good that's the fact i'm gonna get
that phone on the first day what so what
are they whoa wiki what do you think of
the actual you know camera and build
quality of the phone okay the build
quality is great um well we'll get to
Josh on that little bit but uh I mean
just the way the phone feels and
everything it was really probably the
best feeling HTC phone i've ever used as
you guys know i'm a DNA honor and they
just it seems like HTC keeps tweaking
the sizes on these devices until it gets
just about perfect and that's what the
HTC one is and i know it sounds like i'm
gushing here but it really was except
for the power button really nice to hold
news everything felt in the right place
except for that power button not only is
it still on top it's over on the left so
and if you're left-handed it might be
cool but for a right-handed person it's
really hard to get to that at all yeah
on that tub just just showing you a
quick alright so you mentioned your DNA
owner I'm a DNA owner there is a a rumor
and there's FCC documents yada yada yada
that this thing might be coming to
verizon so let's just say that it does
come to verizon for this argument sake
would you switch if contracts weren't an
option you know you know didn't matter
and spending money didn't matter would
you switch from the DNA to the one
absolutely absolutely what would what
was your what main reason for for saying
that the main reason is why well first
it's faster um second i like to feel and
I like the aluminum better I like the
display I can't say is really any better
but just being that it's a little bit
smaller it's a little bit sharper and
now that the DNA is display isn't sharp
already it's going to have to have
higher ppi because it's crazy it's like
468 PPI I think so that's pretty
impressive uh the camera gets a lot of
height and I thought it was good it was
especially good in low light but besides
that I really didn't think it was that
better than the DNA's camera I mean I
can I took photo and I wasn't I thought
later on I might end up being doing of
verses which I don't think is going to
happen but I did take photos and prepare
between the DNA and the HTC One and
really in a lot of the photos there
wasn't that much of a noticeable
difference unless you moved into low
light in low light the ones camera was
much better okay the only problem is the
megapixel camera if you're watching
right now live on your youtube or on
Google+ and you have any questions for
wookie on the HTC One and what he
thought what his thoughts were on any of
the features feel free to drop a comment
in he'll be glad to to answer that for
you so we we liked the HTC want an
android authority we liked it so much
that we decided to to destroy it and we
did we did drop test on it well more so
josh did so i'm gonna pass the floor
over to him and he's going to tell us
all about how he destroyed this
beautiful device but at the same time he
also destroyed another device and which
one held up better if there was a winner
and he'll tell you all about it I
already talked to will keep the other
night the other day and I just profusely
apologized for the treatment that I gave
is new favorite phone but yeah we
decided to do a drop test on the HTC One
primarily because of that aluminum
backing the new type of body that it has
which is quite similar to the iphone 5
in that it has an aluminum backing with
the glass on the front went out to the
heart of LA went to the Mulholland Drive
Hollywood sign stop so I can get a
little bit of a nice a nice scenery in
the background for the most part the ok
I'm going to respond to some people
right now who have been commenting on
the YouTube page nothing about the drop
test
was deliberate in one way or the other
in terms of if I have favoritism in one
side or not on the other because it
really was just incredible bad luck that
when I dropped literally from my pocket
the iphone in the first test it went
like this I dropped it and it just
started to drift like that I mean you
know them and drop tesar that's this is
what happens they're subjective not
unless you're a machine and you're
sitting there dropping in the exact same
way mm-hmm I mean these are real world
drops you know you new pool phone out of
your pocket and you accidentally drop it
you don't drop it the same way every
time exactly it could go any which way
but these are real world scenarios you
did make the effort to actually drop the
one on its face to show what it does do
if it does drop on its face something
yeah extremely bias you could have said
well it doesn't happen in regular well
HTC oneone huh and then walk away but
hit the yeah by the end of it we did
notice that the HTC One didn't have any
problems on the screen whatsoever that
we knew it was because it never fell on
its face so he decided okay let's just
drop it on space I went even higher up
to make sure that the impact was good
and sure enough the end result was this
it's almost like art right there you
have that lattice Hitler Hitler in the
middle of all those cracks um but it was
it held up really well and to me I would
definitely say that the HTC One gets a
lot of points for its new design because
it held up very well but at the same
time could say the same for the iphone 5
um of course I wouldn't I personally
want to pick a winner between the two
because they're just that darn similar
and in the test that I did aside from
this poor little speaker grill that
popped off of the HTC One it held up
just as well as the iphone did and you
could say the other way around the
iphone held up just as well as HTC one
day I got to tell you that my favorite
part of the entire day when we were
doing that was it's a highly tourist
heavy spot so people kept coming in
waves from tour buses and stuff like
that I had an audience for like half the
test yeah I was actually there my wife
and I were when we were out in LA back
in December we went that exact spot on
the 21 and tour bus so I when I saw you
doing that
well how's our nobody there like there
is tons of people there we were there
and then as the video and on you saw
more people around did you have you have
to tell people yes I'm destroying sep 15
hundred dollars worth of equipment for
the fun of it like where people will
believe it was really funny because we
had we had that we have that one little
area where you could see the sign and
whenever we saw people coming up those
stairs luckily I had my parents there to
sort of giving a hand we just like
picked up all the equipment moved away
but I left the phones on that little
platform in the middle just in plain
sight just to see what people would say
there's like a circular thing in the mid
I met isn't metal or something I got ya
I left the phones on there completely
destroyed and I should have I probably
should have recorded some of the
reactions but people came up and I asked
out a big good be footed drink there
yeah love but the cameras were like all
facing the other way because we were
just worried about doing the test yeah
they came up and they said um are you
comparing the iphone to enjoy it and
peep you know the whole thing of people
don't know it's an android phone get
another HTC one what about the galaxy is
like did you drop the galaxy like yeah
we did that already stuff like that did
hey check back in a month or so we might
be dropping the new galaxy exactly what
people did tell me though yes HTC I was
we were slightly corrected in the video
by a comments or that HTC has used
aluminum in the past in their phones
that being said though in the mainstream
market for people who wouldn't know that
already like general users this is going
to be a big deal because it's to them
the first aluminum android phone and
there are a lot of really good reactions
for it it deserved all that Briana all
those reactions everyone came up to and
said I would buy this one in a heartbeat
so they are very from what I saw a very
small sample size people were very
excited about the HTC One that's what I
think people need this you know they
need this sarjana they need this type of
publicity because not a lot of people
know about the one they just they don't
have the marketing budget that Samsung
does yeah if there was one bullet point
that I would push from HTC's perspective
cuz I see a lot of their ads pushing
things like you know blinkfeed and boom
sound
those are nice but the really the device
is beautiful enough and striking enough
that that needs to be the thing that
they really push on marketing with their
limited resources is it looks much
better than the s4 don's it I can't
think of too many people that would deny
that mm-hmm absolutely and based based
upon the reactions that people had their
it's true and the fact that they're not
advertising that more I mean they make
sure do you know the features that they
come out with a cool but I mean they're
not that compelling other than the
amended device is just beautiful yeah if
Samsung is going to push so much
software in their release or their
announcement whatever you want to call
it of the s4 HTC should go with their
strong suit and ever since I could
remember HTC has always had some of the
best build quality yeah okay let's talk
about one more thing to device news here
before we move on if you have any
questions about the dropped a store the
HTC One anything you know that Wookiee
might more information a question about
a feature so forth or anything about you
know the mechanics of the drop test you
know what what Josh had to do or
anything just so feel free to you know
say something the comments uh you know
you even flame home you know II don't
care oh so anyways why you leaving a
comment or two here I just wanna dance
Alton a staple of the show wasn't able
to make it tonight he's he's watching
the some I think he's watching about
what basketball right now um anyways I
wanted to have a little bit of Dan whiny
time for him he was a last night we had
to postpone the show due to myself and
Scott actually not being able to make it
but Dan was going to bring this up there
was people now that LTE is rolling out
on t-mobile there are people talking
about getting LTE to work on tmobile and
ranting and raving about how easy it is
to do and then they do it and then
they're saying all it's not as fast as
other people you know well gotta
remember that this thing doesn't it the
nexus 4 doesn't have a power amplifier
in it so it's going to use
more battery power and it's going to be
a little bit slower than what somebody
else is getting you're gonna get great
out LTE speeds if you do this yes your
is it awesome that you're doing
something you shouldn't be doing sure
but you know it's it's uh complaining
that the speeds aren't the same as what
somebody else is getting well you know
on a like a note to that is you know
made for that network and actually has
all the components to have a fully
working LTE then yeah I mean yeah you
really shouldn't complain no you're
complaining about something you got
working on a network that the Vice
shouldn't be working on so I think
people thought it was normal speed
ranges until they thought saw that note
to wear when you launch a new LTE market
the speeds are always like 50 mega pics
so is is 25 megabit down fast yes it's
fast but that but the note 2 is getting
50 you're still getting 25 that's still
fast your battery's getting sucked like
no other you know go back to hspa+
because it's not really that much faster
than what you were getting right maybe a
little bit but anyways so yeah that
brings us onto tmobile with some carrier
news Scott is going to talk about how
they are no longer a carrier right there
the uncarrier yeah so t-mobile kind of
you know we kind of knew it was coming
there's a lot of leaked stuff about it
but basically they're doing away with
the carrier relationship type thing you
know how you have to have a relationship
of the carrier for a long time because
of contracts and t-mobile basically
wants to eliminate that and they want
you to have non contract and
non-contractual amounts of timely that
you're with them so they're gonna go
month the month I think you guys think
about doing the month to month as
opposed to the relationship as like a
two year well I think their CEO put it
best when he said contracts are
customers love smartphones customers
hate contracts he's right i mean III
don't really know how to say it any
other way I I fully agree with that I
don't think there's anything that you
could say about a contract that is a
consumer move is an anti consumer move
that's designed to lock you in it's
nothing average user the contracts
benefit I think it was it is an old
business model that worked perfectly
with dumb phones because dumb phones
were not changing at the rate of
smartphones and therefore people didn't
care as much on what phone they had
because they the phones they couldn't
there was no tears to him you know they
could you could do the same stuff with
every phone so right now with the
changing you know technology and how
fast it's changing people want to get a
new device when something new comes out
and you can't do that on to your
contract yes you can get a highly
subsidized phone and we'll talk about
that but it's just different remember
Scott this is new to America um we
aren't the rest of the world this is
basically a standard practice in many
parts of the world especially in Europe
that when we talk about contracts and
getting into a binding agreement
basically every European country laughs
at us and say so that this this is now
Europe and price of markets in Asia as
well basically saying oh you mean you
didn't have this option before so I
think it's great now t-mobile's
footprint isn't as big as let's say
verizon so it'll be much better received
when they're everywhere the rain I mean
they're looking to cover 200 million
Americans by the end of this year with
LTE and that's because most Americans
you know live in an urban area unless
you're Derek Ross and you live in the
middle nowhere and you'll never get the
or Johnathan Franklin you know one that
on that or aur woh kiya cable TV right
now only two of you live in urban areas
three of us still
anyways so yeah is it awesome yeah so
anyways Scott let's talk about some of
these plans and changes here okay so we
had verizon AT&amp;amp;T sprint t-mobile so if
an individual were to get the get a plan
I will just be aware that sprint is
unlimited and t-mobile's eluded AT&amp;amp;T is
limited and verizon's limited so
t-mobile for an individual will be two
2259 dollars over the course of one year
right yeah and for sprint two thousand
eight hundred dollars eighteen thousand
eight hundred dollars verizon two
thousand six hundred dollars so for an
individual it makes sense for somebody
to go to tmobile for two people yeah
four thousand at verizon 4018 t five and
a half thousand for sprint and four
thousand for tmobile five and a half wow
that's right how is sprint that far off
just wakers but just way there's more to
come so wait there's more the way so a
family of four verizon is 6118 t is 6300
t-mobile is 6600 and sprint is ten
thousand six hundred so what you're
saying is if you're married and have two
kids do not go to sprint do not Jesus
that is insane it is ridiculous how much
that is now a lot of people go to sprint
because you know they were truly
unlimited well t-mobile is now truly
unlimited or you can get to a you know
full 4g there either hspa+ or LTE 74 70
bucks yeah for unlimited everything yeah
I'm Thomas I'm kind of surprised after
you know cuz so many people like
verizon's just so expensive soaked and
Verizon came in pretty good compared to
its print granted that's a 2 gigabyte
tier plan but really most people are
going for that bottom plan on any of
them anyways yeah I was really surprised
by the verizon prices
her to the other carriers and as well as
sprint I didn't know sprint was that
expensive which so crazy now now you
know comparing prices what about that
boot loader do we have any stats on boot
loaders being locked and unlocked on
carriers don't think that was my attempt
to the bad joke innocence verizon locks
every boot loader that was a bad joke
pretended and see what would that out
you're not that funny you know horizon
cuz a couple of months ago out you know
when they interviewed their CEO and he
said that he actually called t-mobile's
planned in subsidies a great thing
before he actually saw what these plans
were going to be I wonder what their
response to it is gonna be because i'll
see you guys gonna be higher i bet yeah
I don't think of verizon CEO is gonna
say this is a great idea without seeing
dollar signs in it so I think verizon's
thing would be more like oh well we're
gonna keep the crappy plans we're just
not going to subsidize phones anymore
well I think that there okay so
t-mobile's not really one of the big
guys so we in order for verizon AT&amp;amp;T or
sprint to change more so verizon AT&amp;amp;T i
think another big guy has to join the
fun and see that another carrier is
doing it so then they can go oh crap you
know they're doing it why not we're
doing it but t-mobile not so much i mean
if they learn over the course of time
how much they bleed then they'll start
to get smarter but as of right now i
think it's going to stay the same for a
while yeah you guys think if t-mobile
and Sprint both adopted these play yeah
it might be enough to come up with a
little bit of pressure on the pricing
structure but yeah at least they change
their private plans a little bit maybe
offer more data Bob yeah sprint screen
is at least showing themselves willing
to work a little bit more for consumers
but they kind of sold their soul to get
LTE network right now too so yeah so if
you're single t-mobile if you have a
family don't go sprint actually go
verizon yes and you know
it also ball boils down to where you
live that in the country and what
coverage you have in your country if we
could all go to customer or if customers
could go to whichever network they
wanted to based on price alone that
would be something but that's not the
case we we have to go by who has
coverage in your area because your
device is only as good as the network
that it's on if you're going on if
you're found out his phone probably
mixes on 2g I have a perfect advocate
for this I wanted to go to a different
network I wanted to go to a different
carrier I bought a nexus for the day it
came out and used it for two weeks on
another carrier I used it on edge 2g
because that is all that is here but
right now my DNA rocks LTE so that's the
kind of thing that I have to deal with
here it's beyond the carrier I want and
not have service or beyond the carrier I
don't want and have LTE everywhere and
that's really what I deal with a lot of
people are that way to you your device
is only as good as your network so
hopefully hopefully t-mobile continues
to shake things up in the mobile market
and hopefully they continue to expand
their footprint metropcs you know will
help grow their network they're planning
on you know always planning on growing
their network there I think of them as a
you know an urban carrier I don't know I
think of them as a rural carrier but you
know that that may change in the future
who knows okay so uh awesome let's do a
little bit of wrap up yeah let's wrap
