is Andrew authority now yesterday we
found out the name of the new coal corn
processor the Snapdragon 855 and today
we have details of its internals so if
you want to find out more please let me
explain
so yesterday when Qualcomm revealed the
Snapdragon 805 5 they told us a little
bit about what the chip will be able to
do they talk about the performance
increases in AI they talked about the
computer vision that's built into the
image signal processor and they talked a
bit about 5g now today we have all the
details about the inside including the
CPU the GPU the DSP the image signal
processor that they mentioned the
built-in LTE modem and much more so
let's start with the CPU so call comic
want for quite anything set up in this
new Snapdragon processor normally we
have an octa-core processor you might
get for high-performance cores and for
energy-efficient calls but this time
Qualcomm have gone with a 1 plus 3 plus
4 set up some what does that mean
so first of all this one core on its own
is known as a prime core and it has a
higher clock speed than the other three
high-performance cause in fact this one
reaches two point eight four gigahertz
and it's also got a larger amount of
cache and then believe that you've got
three high-performance calls which are
clocked up to 2.4 gigahertz and then
after that you've got the for
energy-efficient calls which are clocked
at 1.8 gigahertz what this basically
means is that when there is some
single-threaded tasks going on than this
one prime call can kick in run quite
quickly and with a lot of cash and get
that job done as fast as possible when
there's more multi-threading going on
then join the other three calls to kind
of give it that boost and then you've
also got the for energy-efficient calls
which can be used in a multi tasking set
up and of course are also there for when
your phone is not doing very much it's
just you know streaming music or
something like that then you don't even
need to use those high efficiency calls
so this is one plus three plus four
setup and that should mean that it comes
up with good single threaded score
performance numbers and
so it should have good multitasking
performance numbers now next up is the
GPU in fact Qualcomm like to round this
off calling it the Adreno visual
subsystem because actually more than
just a GPU now that the GPU we've got
the new Adreno 640 now the 640 is
promising a 20% increase compared to the
GPU that we found in the snapdragon 845
but it also adds a whole bunch of really
interesting things including support for
Vulcan 1.1 we've got HDR gaming so that
gives you ten bit color in rec 2020
there's physically based rendering
there's harder accelerations for h.265
and for vp9 and there's Hardware
playback for HDR 10 HDR 10 plus Dolby
vision and much more
and also because Qualcomm are keen to
promote this idea of XR that's kind of
you know the VR or all the other
experiences you can get with it virtual
reality then it can actually handle 8k
360 degree VR video playback so one of
the strengths of Qualcomm has always
been the power of its GPU and the power
of its visual cell system and that seems
to be very much to strengthen their
playing to here in the snapdragon 855
one of things that Qualcomm were keen to
underline yesterday was the fact that
the image signal processor the isp will
have computer vision built into the
hardware and then includes things like
object tracking and now actually they've
given as more details but what we'll
find in the spectra is P so we have the
spectra 380 ISP and it supports dual 14
bit computer vision assisted image
signal processing which means it can
handle 22 megapixels at 30 frames a
second in two cameras simultaneously or
48 megapixels F 30 frames a second from
a single camera then the hardware
computer vision functions include things
like object detection tracking and of
course depth processing and on top of
that we've also here got talk about what
it can capture in terms of video capture
and
we have 4k 60 frames a second in HDR 10
and HDR 10 plus along with bokeh in a
portrait mode and along with a greater
color gamut so the 4k 60 frames a second
HDR 10 HDR 10 plus video capture is
quite exciting because previously when
you wanted to see HDR content on an HDR
display you would rely on services like
Netflix or YouTube to send over videos
that have been recorded in that way now
videos that you record with a snapdragon
855 powered smartphone can record things
in 10-bit color and then you can see
that 10-bit color back when you play it
back on your smart phone so this really
is a bump up in what will be able to do
in terms of recording memories and
activities with our friends and families
we can now record it in HDR 10 + 10 +
but there's more to the spectra 380 ISP
as well because it also includes
electronic image stabilization it also
includes Heath photo capture and h.265
video capture and also it can do 480
frames a second slo-mo at 720p I'm sure
some people would have wanted it higher
than 720p but nonetheless this is still
a good slow-mo capturing facility on the
snapdragon 855 now as you know many
mainstream processors now include a
neural engine or a neural processing
unit of some kind and that's what you
find in the ki-rin that's what you find
in processor from Apple and of course
Qualcomm will not be left behind in this
area and they have bumped up their
ability to process neural networks on
the new hexagon DSP so the Snapdragon
855 includes the hexagon 690 processor
we found out yesterday that has a
significant performance increase
compared to the Snapdragon 845 but
what's important here to see is that
they've added some more hexagons vector
extensions and the first one of those
allows it to do more neural networking
associated stuff that's the hexagon
tensor accelerator and then we've also
got the heck is a good voice assistant
and of course that's to do with AI and
machine learning we have today speaking
to our devices hearing back the voices
and then there's the always aware
technology
which it calls good for listening for
things like keywords like you know hey
Google as it would be in Google's thing
or in a lexer for Hamazon
so that you don't use that much battery
life when you're listening out for those
keywords and while we're talking about
the AI engine it is worth noting that
Qualcomm do point out that it has a
heterogeneous approach to the AI engine
which means it will farm out tasks to
the DSP or to the GPU or to the CPU
according to what it thinks is the best
piece of hardware to handle that task
and which piece of hardware can handle
it in the most power efficient way so as
we found out yesterday the 855 will not
have a built-in 5g modem it will use an
external mode and when I say external I
mean external to the 855 processor not
something you hold in your hand but
something that will be on the circuit
board next to the eight five five
processor however it will have built in
a 4G LTE modem in this case the new x24
modem cool car also keen to point out
that this is not just about LTE and 5g
the 855 is Wi-Fi six ready and there's a
whole bunch of lists of things here that
he's able to support in that whole Wi-Fi
arena and of course there's Bluetooth 5
and of course location services and they
have it the Snapdragon 805 5 so you've
got the new cryo CPU in that 1 + 3 + 4
set up on Qualcomm are saying that can
give you up to 45% performance increase
and it we interesting to see when we get
device in our hands whether it actually
lives up to that promise
you've got the new Adreno GPU with a 20%
performance increase but in the real
exciting stuff is in the AI engine and
the computer vision enabled is P now
both of those play really well into the
whole area of virtual reality and of
course augmented reality and it will be
interesting to see the applications that
will be developed for the Snapdragon 805
5 over the next few years now the whole
processor is built on a 7 nanometer
technology which of course is the same
as the processors from Apple and from
Huawei okay so that's just about it I
just like to say that I will be doing a
performance and
this to see how this new processor fits
in compared to the new Samsung compared
to the Apple a 12 compared to the
quirian 980 cause it only were based on
theoretical numbers at the moment cuz we
don't have the devices but if you're
interested in that video please make
sure you are subscribed to the Garry
explains channel and then you'll know
when I drop that video
Aven that my name is Gary Sims this is
Andrew authority I hope you enjoyed the
video if you did please a little thumbs
up don't forget to subscribe and don't
forget to share this video on social
media okay that's it
I've seen the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
