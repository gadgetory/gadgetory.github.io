enhancements to the s-pen so that's what
we're going to take a look at here a
trot regard from Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is a
feature focus on the s-pen of the
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 in technical terms
the s-pen has been enhanced in the
galaxy note 4 to have higher levels of
sensitivity from 1024 to 2048 and that's
some technical jargon but basically what
it means is that you have better control
in the writing speed pressure and angle
against the screen allowing for the
thickness and concentration levels to be
better customized now even further down
the road you'll be able to see in the S
Pen and the S note application that
there are different pins that are
available now what I'm writing with
right now is a fountain pen but there is
also a calligraphy pen available and as
you press harder down on the screen
you'll see that the stroke gets even
thicker to really emulate the type of
writing that you would have with a real
pen perhaps one of the best enhances
when it comes to the S Pen has to do
with its button what you'll be able to
do now is hold down the button and then
use the s-pen like a mouse in terms of
selections and I think this is a feature
that a lot of people really wanted and
it comes in the galaxy note 4 basically
hold down the button and drag from the
starting point of your selection over to
the end point of it this works not only
in text in a lot of different
applications but it also works in places
like the gallery so you can do multiple
selections and be able to do things to
those multiple selections easily right
from the menu this is probably my
favorite enhancement to the s1 because
it really streamlines the process of
copying and pasting and to be honest
it's what makes me take out the s-pen on
the Galaxy Note 4 more than anything
else as you can see in the widget
therefore the S note application there
are voice and text notes but what i'm
doing here is doing the photo notes now
the cool thing about the photo now as
you can see here is that it's already
trying to find the borders to cut out
just the text that it feels I really
want what the photo note will be able to
do is take that photo of a particular
area and detect where all of the lines
are in order to take those designs and
make them editable if you really want
them to in this case what it's doing is
it's analyzing the image in order for it
to create the small area now in this
particular area down here on the bottom
I'm going to convert it to edit and once
I do that I'll be able to remove what is
already existing and be able to write in
using the pen my own additions now this
might be really useful for students that
might want to get the notes off of a
whiteboard or a blackboard and it might
actually help for a lot of people who
just want to get the information down
and be able to change it on the fly when
they want to using the s-pen with their
own creativity one really cool feature
of the photo notes camera is that when
you take a picture of an area that has a
Dan angle it will be able to actually
detect the angle and then morph it in a
way so that you'll be able to single out
the content that you want to use from
there you'll be able to create sections
that will be converted into the photo
note area that will then be converted to
text that you can then edit to your
liking the photo note detection when it
comes to the S Pen application is
actually very robust being able to
detect a lot of lines in a design
especially when you really want to find
all the text on the wall this is an
example that I had where the lines not
just of the text but of the actual
designs of the wallpaper were found and
they were detected so that I would be
able to edit them at my choosing but now
we can take a look at the air command
menu which does return from the galaxy
note 3 and we'll start with the action
memo which is the first option on the
list basically it's the same as the
galaxy note 3 action memo in which it
gives you a small memo pad to do
whatever in and the text that you write
in there can be detected and plugged
into a number of different applications
for constant for contextual purposes for
example you can plug the text into an
internet browser in order to do a search
but as you can see here I'm pointing to
the new s note shortcut down on the
bottom right that will allow the action
memo to just go straight to s note so it
provides an even easier way of creating
notes that you'll be able to save for
later the biggest addition to the Air
Command menu has to be the smart select
and what this allows you to do is use
the pen like scissors as they say
basically what I'm doing here is just
cutting out portions of what I'm seeing
here and in this case I'm just cutting
out a bunch of different applications
that I happen to like and saving them in
a small floating area that can be used
for a bunch of different purposes later
basically what you can do is just hit
that blue plus sign over on the top left
of the small floating head and be able
to add even more snippets inside
the little blue arrow underneath the
floating head will allow you to take a
quick look at what you've put inside of
the area and then drag and drop single
items into various places like here I'm
going to send a text to somebody saying
that this is one of my favorite
applications now it is a nice feature to
be able to drag and drop from one place
to another but it seems to only really
work for Samsung specific applications
luckily what you'll be able to do is
open up the entire thing as you can see
here I'm going to do so and when you
take a look at all of those items inside
of this particular menu you can hit the
share button and be able to send all of
these items to let's say an email in
Gmail or to any other applications I
might be able to take them as pictures I
actually find the smart select to be a
very powerful tool and especially if you
only want to get the gist of the
information you want to send it let's
say your friends or your colleagues it
does help that you're able to save it in
an area and go in and out of a bunch of
different applications in order to find
the other pieces of info you can also
put all of those pieces inside of the
scrapbooking application in the galaxy
note 4 which makes it even easier to
save just the little snippets that you
need for later and then finally the last
two options in the Air Command menu are
ones that return from the galaxy note 3
once again the image clip as you're
seeing here allows me to have a
free-form area that I can cut out from
the screen that I'm seeing but there are
also a couple of buttons in order for it
to detect a better way of cutting the
area like for example cutting out the
block of text like this again you'll be
able to save these to your scrapbook or
share them out to any applications that
will take it as an image and be able to
share it out like an emails or messaging
and finally the screen right this might
be familiar to a lot of us Penn veterans
out there but basically what we're doing
here is taking a screen shot that you
can then write all over to your heart's
content what's cool about this version
of the screen right is that the new pens
that you have in the S no application
can be used here as well so you have
some real creativity to just go nuts on
the picture honestly with the image clip
and be smart select available I'm not
sure if this is a particular version of
saving that I would be using more often
but when you really just need something
quick and dirty the screen writes is
about as good as anything in order for
you to really save content too
notes and so there you have it for this
future focus video on the s-pen for the
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 a lot of the
features that were originally introduced
in the Galaxy Note 3 return here but in
this video I want to show you all of the
new enhancements and sort of give you my
opinion on them the pen as a mouse
feature being able to do selections
using the button on the s-pen is
probably the one that I use the most and
it's probably the one that I enjoy the
most but from there keep it tuned to
Android authority for all of the best
coverage including our future coverage
of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 including
my full review which is coming very soon
