new Nexus devices popular smartphone
leaker evleaks just recently sent out a
tweet claiming that HTC has two new
Nexus devices in the works for google
the phones are supposedly being referred
to internally as m1 and s1 and both are
running Android end soon after the tweet
was sent out the folks at Android Police
chimed in with a continuation on Ed
leases claim apparently these two new
Nexus devices are not only being
referred to as m1 and s1 they're also
codenamed marlin and sailfish ec google
has a long history referring to its
Nexus devices by aquatic names so marlin
and sailfish would fit into the internal
naming scheme perfectly as a refresher
the Nexus 6p was codenamed angler the
Nexus 5x was codenamed bullhead the
Nexus 6 was codenamed Shamu and the
Nexus 5 was named hammerhead also in the
news is that all smartphone
manufacturers will soon have to have a
panic button on their phones in india
starting next year phone makers will
legally be required to include a panic
button feature on any device they sell
in india violence against women in india
is a serious problem a country where
four rapes occur every hour according to
bloomberg now violence against women can
be a challenge in any country not just
india but india is trying to improve
women's safety by mandating that phone
manufacturers have to include a way for
users to quickly call emergency services
this goes for both feature phones and
smartphones with the former pressing and
holding a dedicated key will call
emergency services smartphones will need
to integrate the feature into their
software this requirement will go into
effect from January first to 2017 in
addition from 2018 onward all phones
sold in India will need to feature a
gps-based means of localization this
could prove more difficult to implement
in feature phones of course but
smartphones are they account for ninety
percent of phone sales in India home of
the four dollar smartphone and key
battleground for the world's biggest
smartphone makers and the Xiaomi me ban
to has been leaked not by Ed leaks but
by shamis
oh no less the Xiaomi boss man struck a
pose with the new wearable on his arm
showing off its LCD display and physical
button at the same conference the Xiaomi
max was also pictured on the table so
we're guessing that when you're at the
top of the food chain you don't have to
worry too much about being pictured with
unannounced devices anyone else down the
ladder however will likely be looking
for a new job now the me van 2 is the
successor to the infinitely popular me
band a fifteen dollar fitness tracker
that relied on a smartphone app to track
info due to its lack of display the me
been to looks to rectify this omission
making it a standalone tracker capable
of showing off the basics on its LCD
screen with further details available in
the app the me band 2 looks to have the
same rubberized strap found in the
original me band but adds a physical
button for navigating through on screen
content we still don't have details on
launch date or price but with the shell
me max launching on May tenth we
wouldn't be surprised if to me band 2 is
unveiled at the same time now I do read
the comments and I know that some of you
are saying you got your club guru dot
info domain name extensions and those
are great and they have their place but
a.com domain name extension will always
be premium real estate why because no
domain name extension tells your story
with the same level of trust as a
dot-com or net domain name dot com
and.net domain name extensions and Jack
