brought to you by domain.com so what do
you think is next for old Sammy
traditionally Samsung has had all the
features possible in their smartphones
plus the kitchen sink a strategy that is
not going to augur well for them when
they continue to compete with Chinese
manufacturers who can do what they're
doing just cheaper so what to do what to
do think high-end premium or just go all
Victoria Beckham posh one possibility
for the future of Samsung is to focus
exclusively on high-end products in a
sense there's just little point in
pursuing the low-end market smartphones
have begun to exist as a commodity and
indeed any generic company is now
capable of putting on a random product
with some decent specs add this to the
fact that various Chinese OEMs are now
dominating several key Asian markets
with their cutthroat price points
Samsung would be wise to just stop
playing this destructive game entirely
it will never be able to compete unless
it severely reduces prices thus
negatively affecting the bottom line
with diminished profits even if Samsung
does cut prices just how long can it
resist the onslaught of smaller more
nimble competitors with little to lose
to offer up some support for the
suggestion look no further than this
graphic showing the Chinese market share
revolution over the past year and it
doesn't look good for Sami also consider
that Apple has done quite well by
focusing exclusively on the high-end
market and even with its Apple watch
despite reports of diminished sales
predictions can't stymie the huge number
of pre-orders received for a SmartWatch
of all things there are definitely
people with money to burn and if Samsung
can be seen as a company with products
on par with Apple suddenly even the
fruit might have something to fear so
now is the right time to talk about a
book on reading called bold by Peter
Diamandis and Steven Colter and it's all
about inspiring entrepreneurs in the
tech sector especially and they talk
about something called exponential
technologies and what they're referring
to is not just a technology but a time
and space where the industry
is ripe for massive rapid growth hence
the term exponential technologies so for
example Facebook wouldn't have been
possible to launch in 1995 even though
the internet was up there was the
infrastructure available to really scale
Facebook the way they did in 2004-2005
they had to wait 10 years to really do
that Instagram is another example
Instagram is basically a photo app with
filters at least that's what it was when
it first came out and in 18 months it
was sold for a billion dollars with no
revenue model crazy that's an example of
exponential technologies and what we're
looking at is a point in time where it's
perfectly ripe for a technology to just
explode but first there has to be the
infrastructure that's available so how
does this relate to uncle Sammy well I
think Samsung has got a look at what
their advantages is if you look in my
house here we have multiple Samsung
products and i'm not talking about
phones talking two washers dishwashers
refrigerators monitors televisions you
name it even cameras and there's a
wonderful opportunity for samsung to
exploit the Internet of Things which is
really really ripe imagine if you had a
really powerful incentive to buy
multiple Samsung products your
refrigerator your dishwasher your TV and
monitor because they all communicate
with each other in ways that only can be
done in Samsung's ecosystem it's a
powerful motivator to purchase this is
why I bought an ipad because my iPad
connects and communicates with my
macbook pro a lot better than you know a
samsung tab s would have done that's a
pretty powerful thing come on samsung
what do you think now I know what some
of you might be thinking what about
Tizen and Tizen is Samsung's own mobile
operating system if Tizen can be
established as a major platform Samsung
can gradually shift its focus and slowly
redirect its loyal customers to its
in-house operating system in theory
there's no real reason Samsung couldn't
make the galaxy s6 Tizen edition similar
to how HTC made the
you see One m8 for Windows Phone if it
costs less than the Google variant yet
still feature the same specs and
hardware it would be of immense interest
to those who want the product but aren't
willing to spend for it likewise the
prevalence of a diverse range of Tizen
devices would mean that its scope could
be expanded beyond India and Bangladesh
the two countries where the Samsung is
that one is currently on sale and the
gear SmartWatch series one potential
area of Hope could be in truly budget
friendly products like the Tizen running
Samsung's at one which interestingly
enough became the top-selling phone in
Bangladesh for q1 and 2015 still as far
as Android goes we feel it might be time
for the Korean conglomerate to finally
accept the changing times and devote
itself to making a top-notch Android
product with the best hardware software
and support or else truly slim down the
pickings now Samsung has been around for
a long time making gobs of money so I
don't think they're going anywhere
anytime soon but maybe their days of
being the very dominant Android
smartphone manufacturer are going to be
short-lived what do you think let me
know in the comments below now do you
guys know shoe money otherwise known as
Jeremy shoemaker he's famous for making
wads of money in Google Adsense in the
early days now he's gone on to found
many different companies and businesses
and he told me that he does not go into
a new business unless he can get the
name of the business in a calm yeah
won't go into the business at all unless
egan gether calm he is very successful
and thought that that was absolutely
crucial why because no domain name
extension tells your story with the same
level of trust as a.com or.net domain
name dot com and.net domain name
extensions and Jack credibility in to
your online presence and who doesn't
want more credibility you can say
fifteen percent on domain name and web
postings when you use our coupon code
android at domain.com check out don't
forget fifteen percent off when you use

domain names think domain.com thanks for
watching android army my name is Jace
love to connect with you right here on
google+ or twitter or in the comments
below i'll be following you you don't
wanna forget about my brother
