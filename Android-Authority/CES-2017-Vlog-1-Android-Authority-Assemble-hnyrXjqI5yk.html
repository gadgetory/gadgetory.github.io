to get this show on the road my flight
is at 9pm it's currently 730 and my uber
I just ordered it it'll be here in a
couple of minutes so ya ready get to
Vegas and ready to get CES 2017 started
so let's go flight was delayed a little
bit but through the magic of editing i'm
here in vegas now that's all it really
matters it wasn't a very long delay so
now i'm just waiting on my baggage and
i'm going to head to the house and meet
all the guys so
yes all right here you got later now for
those of you who may not know in and out
is a tradition going to Las Vegas and
you make a stop in Barstow I couldn't
help myself by the way anybody who
hasn't been to in and out or doesn't
know this fact far as well done it's
like you're eating the kale chips ma'am
so good
one flight down from Berlin to Amsterdam
I'm hanging out here for like four hours
then flying to Atlanta and then to Vegas
all right I know you can't see me but
you can hear me this is what it looks
like leaving for the airport for CES
Oh
airport so is the way of things when you
get to the Airbnb with the android
authority team we have to get supplies
so someone who people leave and then it
just leaves some of us in the house
we're just chatting make it family like
it's the best thing well no it's not
even three miss my we've been talking
for like the last like ours so it's just
kind of funny because you expect 16
people are supposed to be in two
different houses and then you'll be all
the house is empty yeah nobody only
handed so I'm probably end up sleeping
in the other house my brother is coming
so he and I will probably just bunk up
like the old days um and it was one of
the ring says bunks it's a really long
day I don't remember cuz because the
other house in the same one we used last
year so we're familiar with it doesn't
want to really call Alone's here so I'm
not allowed to sleep years apart only
man is not cooperative space for closet
if you look at it it's huge gosh she
said it tell me a little bit smaller
than his bedroom when I was an end up in
a problem on the airbed and head gir it
can come on record with every morning
just a quick look at the house here you
see there's a pool table down there
which is awesome you can't see anything
outside but there's a ping-pong table a
basketball court with two hoops and a
pool that I almost stepped in because it
looked like a lawn
and this is it we're in Vegas this man
right here had his first in an ounce
experience last night delicious I have a
belfry how much is good how much like
crap do you feel this morning all right
my recommendation for you okay wouldn't
he I see number one number one but you
want animal self right Jase crap Angie
yeah because it's amazing stuff but it's
like the hydrogen ya ibadi Hickson you
yeah I feel it's tough yeah what's all
was it's all completely where did you
get it
