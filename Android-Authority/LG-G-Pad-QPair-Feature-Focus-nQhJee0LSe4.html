MacArthur enjoyed 30 what's going on
everybody
I really hope you can hear me in the
background because we're not doing a
presentation here at the LG booth at
Aoife in Berlin I wanted to revisit the
G pad and show you the cue pair
functionality as our future focus and I
saw in this video
so the cute pair allows you to connect
your LG g2 to your G pad and have a
seamless experience between the two
because when something happens on one of
them it will show up on the other
typically its to the phone and it will
show up on the tablet now I was trying
to do the the colleague feature here but
fortunately we have noticed at work we
won't be able to take a look at the text
message either but there were a couple
functions I can show you right off the
bat right now so looking at these two
particular calls over here this one is
supposed to call this one but for some
reason it's not working so for now we'll
just take a look at the G pad and show
you the actual keyboard functionality
all right so here is the cue pair and
essentially what it does is impairs your
phone via just a little switch over on
the top for both devices and it'll find
each other and they will find each other
rather and become paired together inside
of the cue paired via bluetooth so what
we have here are a number of different
notifications to start off with in
particular the call notification and as
you can see here when you get a call on
one of three devices when you get a call
phone rather it will show up in a
notification on the tablet in which you
can either decline the call if you're
not able to
you don't want to or you can decline it
with a message so that they know exactly
what's going on there are a couple of
settings down here for what the ringtone
should be and what the different
messages would be for the decline with
message after that they also have the
message notification in which you get a
text message or an SMS message on the
phone and it will show up on the tablet
it'll pop up over on the top there again
same thing goes for what they'll call
SMS notifications these are for things
like Google hangout and Kakao Talk if
you use that whatsapp that's a popular
one as well
and for other notifications from places
like Foursquare or Facebook so the one
that I that I am able to show you right
now there is actually another one that
that is here and wonder if I'll be able
to show you in a bit but let's focus on
the cue memo transfer first okay so if
I'm on my lg g2 once again a great phone
here and I just want to be sure the the
queue pair is definetly synced up to the
tablet as it says right yeah I'm gonna
go ahead and create a memo so quick memo
is right over here on the top and I just
have made it I just took a screenshot of
the screen and I'm going to just put in
my name
actually let's put was here as I would
be fine
there you go I don't have rooms about
what's going on anybody's and everybody
here all right so we're gonna save it to
gallery and when we saved it to the
gallery after a little bit of time the
transfer wall happened automatically the
key memo will switch from here copy it
from here onto the tablet and if we go
to the gallery on the keypad right here
you could see right there on the quick
memo folder we have the joshua's here so
that is a seamless transfer between the
two it also happens the other way around
as well so let's say you wanted to take
some notes on your tablet and then you
have to go somewhere while you leave
your tablet at home and you end up going
out with your lg g2 and then when you go
out you have to note with you wherever
you go and of course when it comes to
the G pad you have a lot of great
features available ones that have been
around for a while like that key music
you slide applications and then a couple
of new ones like the slide aside which
allows you to take full apps and go
slide them to the side in order to use
them later so they're all available for
that kind of for that kind of
functionality for multitasking
especially because this is definitely
something that they wanted to drive home
but in all reality the cue pair is
definitely the one that helps you to
seamlessly put together the experience
between your G pad and LG g2 smartphone
so that was our future focus for the cue
pair that is available on the new LG
products keep watching Android authority
we're here at Aoife in Berlin I'm here
throughout the entire conference I'll
I'll make sure to have a lot of great
content coming for you over the next few
