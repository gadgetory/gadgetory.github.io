mark Android is all about freedom and
control it's about having the freedom to
control and operate your device any way
you please Tasker is one Android app
that lets you do just that in this video
learn the basics of using this task
control and automation app since it has
so many features then I can adequately
discuss in just a few minutes I'll just
stick to the basics and I hope that it
will help you get started with Tasker
Tasker is often described as an
automation app but it won't
automatically automate things for you
right out of the box you will need to
start behaving like you're the master of
your device and lay down the rules that
define how your Android ought to behave
this is a very powerful app most people
think that Tasker is only about
scheduling tasks it can do more than
just that for example you can use Tasker
to play random songs from your music
library when you wake up you can apply
random wallpapers every couple of hours
or so you can use it to alert you by SMS
when certain events occur on your phone
days plus many more tasker's user
interface looks deceptively clean tidy
and simple but it can easily overwhelm
you especially if you're an Android
rookie as you shall see in a little bit
Tasker is a flexible yet complex app but
it is not necessarily complicated
freshly installed Tasker runs in
beginner mode this is how the simple
interface looks like these tabs here are
for the various Tasker objects
profiles tasks and scenes we'll talk
more about them later to switch tabs
just swipe or tap on the tab name when
you tap a tab name you also get an
options menu for that tab down here is
the search button the Add button and of
course the Help button which a newbie
like me can easily consider as the panic
button if you're up for some geeky
adventure you can disable beginner mode
tap on menu preferences go to the UI tab
and uncheck beginner mode when not in
beginner mode tasker's UI changes a bit
for instance you get a new tab
called VARs right here and at the bottom
row you'll find project tabs the default
project called base is this one here
represented by the home icon new
projects that you create will be shown
as tabs on this row tap on an open
projects name to bring up the project
menu this button of course is the Add
button for these top tabs here don't
confuse this button with the Add button
for projects Tasker would not be Tasker
if it were not for tasks a task can
consist of one or several actions
actions are things that your Android
device does tasks and actions are the
building blocks of Tasker let's try
creating a task for instance let's
create one that will call bedtime which
I want to run when I go to bed at 9:00
every night
first open a tasks tab tap the plus sign
and enter the task name bedtime in this
case this is the task edit screen here
I'll be adding actions to this task what
actions do I want my phone to perform
when they go to bed hmm I surely don't
want to be disturbed by calls or SMS so
I will want to put my phone on silent
mode tap this plus sign here tab audio
then tap silent mode I want silent mode
to be activated so on this screen change
this to on tap the back button to save
the action here's the action we just
created I might also want to disconnect
from my wireless network before I go to
bed let's add the action like this tap
the add' button tap net tap Wi-Fi
then specify off as the value for set
tap the back button and presto we now
have two actions in this task our task
called bed time is also now listed on
the tasks tab it's a very simple task of
course but surely you can create more
elaborate and more complex tasks the
more familiar you become with Tasker our
bedtime task however won't run at all
unless you execute it manually it can
manually execute a task by tapping the
play button on the task edit screen you
can also run it through a task shortcut
or task widget just place a Tasker
widget on the home screen as you
normally would then select the task
store
associated with a shortcut or widget the
task will be performed when you tap on
the shortcut or widget the second way to
run a task is by linking it to a trigger
resulting in automated task execution
when you link a task to a trigger you
are in fact programming your Android
device to run tasks according to certain
rules or conditions that you specify in
Tasker such conditions or triggers are
called contacts
let's try linking our bedtime tasks with
the contacts I want a bedtime tasks to
run at 9:00 in the evening and stop at
6:00 in the morning clearly this calls
for a time-based context or trigger to
set it up first open the profiles tab
profiles are containers for context and
the tasks associated with them tap the
Add button type a name for the profile
if asked select time from the list on
the screen set the start time and the
end time in this case start time is 9:00
and evening and end time is 6:00 in the
morning
tap the back button to return to the
preview screen from the pop-up list
select the name of the task that you
want to link to this context in this
case bedtime awesome I just told my
phone to switched to silent mode and
turn off Wi-Fi from 9:00 in the evening
until 6:00 in the morning of the next
day things become more fun because of
custom gooeys or graphical user
interfaces known in Tasker as scenes I'm
sure you're familiar with pop-up boxes
dialog windows menus and forms these are
all examples of gooeys and you can
create them and Tasker even if you have
no programming experience I won't talk
exhaustively about scenes here but I'll
show you how scenes work just to give
you an idea of the power of Tasker
here's a very crude and simple example
of the scene that I made I call this pop
SMS because it pops up a text box
displaying an incoming SMS message and
its sender you can create scenes like
this with the help of tasker's graphical
editor this area is the canvas or
display area in which I've laid out
three elements two text boxes and a
button this text box displays the SMS
message body it's configured to display
the most recent SMS message via this
built
variable this other textbox is
configured to display the SMS sender via
this built-in variable finally this
button is configured to respond to tap
gestures I've set this button to destroy
the pop SMS scene when the button is
tapped scenes don't run er execute on
their own they need to be called from
actions or tasks my pop SMS scene for
example is invoked by the show scene
action in a task that I created for it I
configure the show scene action to
display the pop asommus scene as a
dialogue with its background dimmed
heavily finally I also needed to link
the task to a context in this case I
linked it to an event specifically the
received text event this instructs the
phone to execute the task when the phone
receives an SMS text message therefore
displaying the pop SMS scene and as
expected when I tap this button the
scene is instantly closed Tasker has
many other advanced goodies that you'll
enjoy or otherwise find extremely useful
among them are variables which further
extend tasker's capabilities as well as
other advanced usage such as scripts
plugins pattern matching advanced Tasker
preferences and many more you can even
package you projects or individual tasks
as standalone apps that your friends can
install on their Android devices as I've
said earlier tasks ters power can be
overwhelming but with a bit of patience
and some eagerness learn you'll be able
to weave in and out of its complex
corridors easily in this video I've
shared to use some of the basic ways to
use Tasker I hope you find this video
