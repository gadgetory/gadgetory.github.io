thority what's going on everybody and
every photo and video that you're seeing
in this camera feature focus was taken
on the cameras of the HTC ten now
throughout this video you are going to
be seeing some selfie video shots just
to demonstrate the optical image
stabilization that's built into the
front-facing camera now that's a first
for the HTC line in a first for pretty
much any front-facing camera so you can
judge for yourself if the optical image
stabilization is actually doing the
trick but the other thing that you'll
notice is that I am recording on the
front-facing camera at Full HD
resolution but it is also recording high
res audio so you can also see what that
would sound like for little vlog type
videos like this and while we're on the
subject of having 24-bit audio which
also works on the rear-facing camera
here you can listen to some sounds of
nature
we'll take a look at the extra features
of the camera app first first add
panorama as you can see here which is
stitched together pretty well without
too much fuss and then there is also a
hyper lapse mode that allows for a very
long video to be sped up and stabilized
within the app itself
there are also Zoe captures so if you do
have the Zoe camera on as your mode it
will take quick three second videos on
top of the photo that you're already
taking just for some nice effects HDR on
the HTC 10 camera does seem to do a
pretty good job especially in the right
situations but in most bright situations
the main thing it will do is bring down
the highlights it will bring up the
shadows a little bit but where it really
does fall short is adding in that color
where we do think that there is some
missing in the HTC tenth overall
processing of these photos the speed of
the camera has also been quite nice so
it's not too hard to get a quick shot
off when you really need to you just
have to swipe twice down on the turned
off screen it will go straight into the
camera and you should be able to get
your picture pretty quickly but now we
can get into our general testing and
this is where you will find a lot of 100
crops so we can take a look at the
detail inside of all of these photos now
the HTC ten comes with a 12 ultra pixel
camera as HTC still calls them which are
used for larger pixels for better
low-light shots but the smaller amount
of pixels also counts for what could be
a lowered amount of detail and that is
what we saw in the samsung galaxy s7
which took a similar approach but as you
can see in these bright daylight shots
there is a pretty good amount of detail
until you do crop in which again is not
going to be an ideal thing to do for
photos that have less than let's say 16
megapixels like we saw last year but
overall you do have a lot of detail in
these photos until you crop in and in
certain areas of these photos like in
the Ferrari garage you can see right
here it does seem just that little bit
smudged out and has a little bit more
noise than we would like
Oh
but if a decrease in sharpness was to be
expected somewhat well we wanted to
highlight in this section was an
inconsistency when it came to the color
now with the HTC 10 you can get some
pretty great shots like this one where
there's a high amount of contrast and
also a pretty good saturation in these
flowers but in plenty of other
situations the HTC 10 can get
overwhelmed by the highlights of a scene
making them really blown out and kind of
skewing the look of a picture and even
then it will go for a warmer color
temperature while also lowering the
saturation of the overall photo now
that's not to say that any of these
photos look really dull it's just that
they don't seem to have the kind of
saturation that we've seen in other
flagship phones that's awesome as is
customary in a video like this I will
bring you guys a lot of foodie pictures
and that is what you're getting in this
section so those of you who are
Instagram foodies can see what the HTC
10 will be like if you want to take a
picture of the dish that's right in
front of you now we did already mention
the decrease in sharpness across the
number of photos but it's really not all
that bad what we think is worse is the
inconsistent color processing so when it
comes to some of these dishes you might
not get the vibrancy that you would
really like that said however the
decrease in the saturation does tend to
happen more in low-light shots which
will be coming up just after this
section
and to round out this video we will take
a look at the low-light shots and the
main issue in the number of these photos
as you can see in this one is that the
highlights are getting really blown out
they almost look like flares in the
background making for a very
inconsistent scene the other thing
you'll probably notice here is that in
low-light situations much like a number
of other smartphone cameras it tends to
go for a much warmer temperature in the
color temperature and coupled with the
lower saturation that the HTC 10 is
already kind of guilty of that makes for
a photo that kind of lacks that bit of
punch that we would really like it to
have overall the HTC 10 camera is one of
the best that they put out in quite a
while
and it suffers from pretty much the same
pitfalls that any other smartphone
suffers from however HTC still has a
problem with processing and in a number
of photos there's still a lack of
saturation and overall it's just a
little softer when compared to other
flagships in the same segment we will
give credit where credit is due the HTC
10 does an above-average job in
recording audio no matter which camera
you're using which makes it an ideal
candidate for vlogging type videos or
even just selfie videos especially with
that oh is that is in the front-facing
camera even if the OAS can't necessarily
compensate for too much because of how
small the unit is it does add just that
little bit to make front-facing camera
shooting that much more enjoyable and so
there you have it for this camera
feature focus on the HTC 10 I wanted to
make sure I got a lot of photos videos
and I wanted to make sure that you guys
heard the high res audio that you can
get no matter which camera you're using
on this phone the HTC 10 might not be
the best camera that's out there in the
flagship market but we do think you can
do a lot worse so taking the philosophy
of the best camera you have is the one
that's on you you can certainly do a lot
worse than the HTC 10 and we do think
it's a pretty good candidate for a daily
shooter keep it tuned to Android
