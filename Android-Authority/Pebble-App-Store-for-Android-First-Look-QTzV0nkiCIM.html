users out there now a few days ago one
of the most anticipated developments in
the pebble ecosystem actually finally
happened it was the pebble App Store
unfortunately much to the ire of all
Android users out there the Android
pebble app store was not quite ready yet
and if you looked on the subreddit there
was a lot of anger over this luckily a
few hours after the iOS pebble app store
was put out a beta for the updated
version on the Android ecosystem was
released and I've been using it for the
last few days I wanted to show you what
it was all about hey it's Josh regard
from Andhra Authority what's going on
everybody and this is a first look at
the pebble app store now before we get
started I did want to just let everybody
know that this pebble right here that
I'm wearing on my signature grunge cuff
is an acquisition that I had over
Christmas I've had this since the end of
December and I've really just been
loving this pebble a full review of the
pebble will be coming very soon I'm
mostly waiting for the software via the
firmware 2.0 to be fully released
because there will be a lot of
enhancements that further create a
better experience on the pebble
smartwatch and it is in that lens that
I'm going to be doing a full review of
what has become one of my favorite
peripherals in the mobile space all
right and here is my pebble smartwatch
right here on the right and then my
Nexus 5 which is what I use it the most
on so quick history lesson when you used
to get apps for your pebble smartwatch
you would have to go to various websites
online that had developers consolidated
with their software that they've created
and it wasn't that hard to get apps but
by consolidating everything into one
place pebble is pretty much trying to
make the process even easier and one of
the other reasons why that is important
is because if you look at the apps that
you could download for your pebble they
have to be downloaded onto your phone as
well the vast majority of them had to be
apps on your phone on top of the apps
that went to the SmartWatch and what
that meant is when you download these
apps right here onto your phone they
would take up all of the space in your
app drawer for example you can see the
new pebble app right there I would have
lines of different pebble apps just
taking up space in the app drawer so by
whittling down the number that you need
and by consolidating everything that's
just a one pebble app itself it really
freed up a lot of space inside of the
app drawer so thank God for that so with
that in mind we'll just go ahead and
jump into the app itself now remember
this is a beta app so obviously it's not
going to be completely polished mostly
the speed is something that users are
going to find is a little bit lacking so
as you can see here we're looking at the
actual pebble itself my pebble and if
for anyone who already knows how because
they have a pebble you can only have up
to eight watch faces or apps installed
at one time onto your SmartWatch
so those are they ate up here I have
things from timers too I even have a
sleep tracker right here because there's
a companion app for sleep as Android and
I also have Yelp and Foursquare to help
me look for places to eat from time to
time and of course music boss to help me
control the music on my phone without
having to take it out but one of the
great things about the App Store again
is the fact that it has this Locker here
on the bottom half you used to have to
download an app that would consolidate
your SmartWatch apps into one place that
way if you wanted to uninstall one in
order to install yet another one then
you can go back and forth well now
that's part of the pebble app itself and
that's really awesome but of course what
we're looking for here are the new
installation apps and watch faces so as
you can see here it's not necessarily
the fastest happen it takes a little
while to load everything up but once you
get to the actual ecosystem itself
you'll find that there's all a lot there
are thousands and thousands of different
watch faces and apps that you can
install on to yours pebble smartwatch
and they're all consolidated right here
and they all look really cool I
generally don't put watch faces on my
SmartWatch because I actually really
like the the wordid one right here of
course there are the pre built-in ones
that you have aside from that but I
generally dump the watch faces I'm here
because I focus on the apps but if you
want to change the look of your
smartphone when it is your SmartWatch
rather when it is just a watch this is
the place to do it and you'll be able to
find all of them here you have
categories for most loved and the pics
that pebble likes and then a nice splash
screen at the top just showing you a few
of them in particular like the chrono
so let's look at the apps and the apps
are categorized in very particular ways
there is actually a category for fitness
that you're going to see right there you
have the same splash up here that will
show just sort of the featured ones like
a pebble camera to be able to control
the camera on your smartphone Yelp which
is when I talked about earlier for
finding places to eat or places you have
to find places nearby and then you have
the categories here for daily usage
tools and utilities notifications as
well I use the Notification Center
rather than the built-in notification
functionality that's on the pebble well
primarily because I like the way it's
displayed a little bit better and then
you also have the categories down here
for weekly top picks the most loved and
the essentials so you'll be able to
widdle through all of the different apps
there's a bunch of them you might even
have to search for them if you need to
like for example I was looking for a
Pomodoro timer if you don't know
Pomodoro it's a way of keeping yourself
focused on your task by allotting a
certain amount of time to the task
itself and then allowing a little bit of
time for rest afterwards it's just a
nice way of keeping yourself focused in
order for me to find the one that I have
used since I first had my pebble I had
to search for Pomodoro and it's going to
try and search through the entire
ecosystem to find it and finally there
you go and there are a couple of them
and the one that I use the most is PBL
pom pebble pom and that one I wasn't
able to find easily inside of the tools
and utilities category but by searching
for Pomodoro it was easy to find right
there so aside from all of that it
really is just a matter of the fact that
the pebble app store is is making the
life a lot easier for pebble users by
putting everything into one place it's
not even trying to necessarily control
what types of apps come out it really is
just creating a place for all of them to
be under one roof and it really helps a
lot other functionality like that Locker
which I showed you earlier is another
great reason why the app store is is
highly anticipated for all of us users
and so there you have it for the first
look at the pebble app store for Android
which is still in its beta phase
hopefully the full release will come out
very soon along with 2.0 which is what
I'm waiting for it to really show you
what the pebble can do for all of you
pebble users out there you can find the
beta version at and rathore decom we
have a link available for you there and
for all of you users who are still
debating on whether or not you should
get a pebble don't worry I've got your
back and I'll tell you exactly why I
think this is one of the best wearable
tech that you can get today so as always
thank you guys very much for watching

pebble App Store remember we have great
