quick look at our sponsor tiddalick this
game has you feeding a hungry frog with
quick reflexes it's fast-paced and
addicting and the premise is great for
both kids and adults it's also free with
no in-app purchases so there's literally
no harm in trying it out plus there's
Google Play game support the link is in
the video description below if you're
interested okay folks let's talk about
the apps that made a big splash this
week as usual if you want to check any
of these applications out you can find
the links in the video description below
this Skype received a big update this
last week that allows you to send photos
to offline contacts that will be
received upon getting online again along
with the photo sharing there were also
some bug fixes and performance
improvements but otherwise it's the same
old video and chat platform we all know
dealer nokia alternative to google maps
received an update this last week for
both Android and Windows Phone the
update includes significant improvements
to a whole bunch of places around the
world including support for new
countries but our graphics for rivers
and lakes and updates to other countries
the dish turned some heads this last
week when they released sling TV this
gives you 20 television stations for
twenty dollars a month including ESPN
TBS TNT Cartoon Network and a bunch of
others you can also get some additional
sports and kids channels and five dollar
per month packages sadly no major hockey
channels but the service looks good
anyway limbo is a new 2d horror game
where you must solve puzzles dodge
obstacles and search for your lost
sister the graphics are minimal black
and white but the design plays a huge
part in the atmosphere of the game it's
four dollars and ninety-nine cents but
currently rocks an astounding 4.9 rating
in the Google Play Store screen pop lock
screen messenger as an application does
pretty much what the name says it does
it's a photo based messaging service
where the messages are delivered
directly to your lock screen it's an
interesting concept that looks really
fun but do keep in mind that there's
almost no security so don't answer your
phone with a bunch of people around
however messages disappear as soon as
you unlock the device or reply once
