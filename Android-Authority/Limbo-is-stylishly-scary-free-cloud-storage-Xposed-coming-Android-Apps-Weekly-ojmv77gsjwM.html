show is brought to you by tiddalick
hello again ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe
Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to another episode of
android apps weekly let's jump right
into some headlines first up this week
Microsoft has officially purchased
sunrise calendar for 100 million dollars
we're not sure what they'll do with it
yet but don't be surprised to see some
sunrise calendar features arrive and
outlook eventually Jack Underwood
developer of today calendar has had
enough of pirates now when you powered
his application it'll automatically
schedule special events just for you
pirates out there and it's hilarious to
celebrate safer internet day Google
Drive is giving away 2 gigabytes of free
storage just for checking your security
settings in Google Microsoft is also
giving away a hundred gigabytes of free
storage on onedrive for two years if you
sign up for bing rewards Joe Danger the
challenging side scroller daredevil game
on iOS is finally making its way to
Android sometime in 2015 it'll feature
80 levels 29 characters and daily
challenges xposed framework is
apparently coming to lollipop devices
soon the developer was seen stating that
it's coming along well and even mostly
works no release date has been given yet
but it is getting close root users
rejoice for even more headlines and
up-to-date news don't forget to
subscribe to our newsletter I put it
together myself and I promise I will
only send you the latest and greatest in
android apps and games news we'll have a
link to it in the video description
below and all you need is an email to
sign up before we get into the Android
applications this week let's take a
quick look at our sponsor tiddalick this
game has you feeding a hungry frog with
quick reflexes it's fast-paced and
addicting and the premise is great for
both kids and adults it's also free with
no in-app purchases so there's literally
no harm in trying it out plus there's
Google Play game support the link is in
the video description below if you're
interested okay folks let's talk about
the apps that made a big splash this
week as usual if you want to check any
of these applications out you can find
the links in the video description below
this Skype received a big update this
last week that allows you to send photos
to offline contacts that will be
received upon getting online again along
with the photo sharing there were also
some bug fixes and performance
improvements but otherwise it's the same
old video and chat platform we all know
dealer nokia alternative to google maps
received an update this last week for
both Android and Windows Phone the
update includes significant improvements
to a whole bunch of places around the
world including support for new
countries but our graphics for rivers
and lakes and updates to other countries
the dish turned some heads this last
week when they released sling TV this
gives you 20 television stations for
twenty dollars a month including ESPN
TBS TNT Cartoon Network and a bunch of
others you can also get some additional
sports and kids channels and five dollar
per month packages sadly no major hockey
channels but the service looks good
anyway limbo is a new 2d horror game
where you must solve puzzles dodge
obstacles and search for your lost
sister the graphics are minimal black
and white but the design plays a huge
part in the atmosphere of the game it's
four dollars and ninety-nine cents but
currently rocks an astounding 4.9 rating
in the Google Play Store screen pop lock
screen messenger as an application does
pretty much what the name says it does
it's a photo based messaging service
where the messages are delivered
directly to your lock screen it's an
interesting concept that looks really
fun but do keep in mind that there's
almost no security so don't answer your
phone with a bunch of people around
however messages disappear as soon as
you unlock the device or reply once
