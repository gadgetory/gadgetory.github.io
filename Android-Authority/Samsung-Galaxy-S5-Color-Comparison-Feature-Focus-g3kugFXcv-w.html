by bitdefender mobile security hey it's
Josh freghar from Android Authority
what's going on everybody and I'm here
again at the Samsung booth taking a look
at the various colors for the Samsung
Galaxy s5 and we're going to take a look
at them a little bit more up close but
here's just a quick overview of the
different colors that we have what we
have here on the left is the shimmer
white the white that you probably are
very familiar with with previous Samsung
Galaxy S iterations and then of course
the charcoal black which is what we used
for our hands-on video right here in the
third position and we also have the
electric blue which is one that might be
a little bit more recognizable from the
galaxy s4 active it's a it's the color
that the x4 active was and then finally
a new addition in the copper gold now
the gold is a very empowering especially
out in Asia we're going to see this one
probably sell a lot in the Asian
countries but let's go ahead and take a
look at a couple of these a couple of
aspects of each color right now all
right and here is the shimmer white just
like all of the other devices we're
going to see the same perforated back on
here that is not glossy plastic so you
don't need to worry about the finger
printing on the back that was plaguing
the last two iterations of the samsung
galaxy s line and as you can see there's
a pretty nice and simplistic color white
is obviously very common when it comes
to samsung galaxy s phones and here's
what this one looks like
everything else just takes on that
silver look on the sides and then you
have the white on the fronts very
recognizable look and the shimmer white
definitely exudes that and then the
charcoal black which is a little bit
more of like a grey blackest maybe a
little bit too strong to describe the
color of this phone but as you can see
there on the front it is quite dark and
it does pretty much exude that black
idea but it's the back cover with the
perforations in it that actually looks a
little more great to me but still looks
quite nice the black is also another
iteration and the colors that has been
around for many of the Samsung Galaxy S
phones and it's pretty familiar except
the back material is obviously a little
bit different now if you were a fan of
the Samsung Galaxy s4 active you know
exactly what to expect with the
electric-blue right here the entire
backing right here it has the same
perforated material but it has that nice
neon or rather kind of a hot blue here
that was all over the s4 active and it
comes to the IP certified phone here so
as for active def comes into the galaxy
s5 giving it the water and dust
resistance and also the color as well
and then finally the one that we're
pretty excited about because we know is
going to be very popular especially in
the Asian countries is the gold version
right here we saw with plenty of other
devices in the market that had a gold
color that those were the ones that sold
out first and we want to be surprised if
this is the same one the official name
for this is copper gold and it has this
nice shimmering look on the back the
shiny look on the back that definitely
makes the gold color really pop and as
you can see from the elements right here
everything is pretty much the same on
the rims especially with the silver
spine and silver Scouts and I keeps it
all together
but the gold is what's on the back and
the rim around the screen so those are
the colors of the Samsung Galaxy s5 you
have a bunch of choices to choose from
all four have been showcased in this
video so you can really see which one
would probably suit your style the best
once again this is Josh of Agartha and
Road authority we're here with Samsung
at the Mobile World Congress here in
Barcelona Spain
taking a look at their new flagship
