going on everybody and here we go again
with reasons to buy or pass this time
talking about the LG g2 now we do have
to give the LG g2 a lot of props for
having 0.2 more inches on what is
otherwise considered a 5 inch screen it
does fall under the 5 inch screen
category pretty much but it is better
than a lot of the ones out there by a
stretch quite literally after all around
the screen there is basically no bezel
which makes it look really attractive in
is just all screen on the front now why
is there no bezel almost around the
screen well that is because the sides of
the phone don't have a button layout
allowing for a little bit more space to
be freed up and that button layout has
been brought to the back of the phone to
be controlled by basically your index
finger this is a bit of innovation in
uniqueness that the g2 can boast and
after a day or two it actually works
really well and becomes as natural as
any other button layout in terms of
power the Snapdragon 800 is what powers
the LG g2 and it definitely does it
justice the g2 was one of the first
phones to sport what is now considered
the best processing package available
and then further underneath the surface
you do have a pretty full-featured
software suite as the optimist UI comes
with a pretty incredible amount of
extras allowing for a very diverse
experience the battery life is also very
good on here as the Snapdragon 800
provides some power consumption
optimization and thus in a lot of cases
I found that the g2 can go for about
almost two days and finally in the
camera the g2 comes with the first of
what is likely going to be many cameras
with optical image stabilization and
when we come to the reasons to pass on
the g2 we start off with the button
layout now while the number of people
who got used to the index finger layout
greatly outweighs the number of people
who didn't some did say they just don't
like the placement in the end probably
some people just don't enjoy change as
for the material choice it's a glossy
plastic that you get here and while it
does work really well for the g2 it also
makes it a bit of a fingerprint magnet
and we also wouldn't blame anyone just
flat-out sick of glossy plastic the
optimist UI does come with many features
but it is also pretty in your face about
it it also isn't the best-looking UI out
there mostly because of that fact
after all look at the notification shade
for example you bring that down and
there's so much space already taken up
by a power widget in the hardware
department you do have a lack of
expandable storage here because the body
is already so thin they couldn't they
probably couldn't fit it in there
but having expandable storage is a plus
and that's not something you get here
and finally when it comes to the camera
this is mostly a personal gripe but
while the camera does provide a lot of
great pictures and has optical image
stabilization I did find the app to be
rather slow I took this particular phone
out to a concert and I had a pretty hard
time trying to get this thing to focus
in time or even at all in some cases so
while the camera app is pretty
full-featured and it does provide a
decent experience it can be quite slow
and if you need fast pictures this might
not be the best one out there for you
and so there you have it for the reasons
to buy or pass on the LG g2 as always
thank you guys very much for watching
and remember if you want more
information on the g2 than just a
quick-fire reasons that we've given you
