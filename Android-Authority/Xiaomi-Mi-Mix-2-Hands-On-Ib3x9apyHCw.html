everybody and we're taking a look at the
SHA Mimi mix - now this is the update to
one of last year's more anticipated and
pretty well regarded devices that
brought a bit of a different philosophy
to the display and design of a large
smartphone now one thing that was an
issue last year with the me mix was that
it was just a little bit too big but
that has changed this year while still
retaining a lot of what made the design
of last year's me mix pretty well
received the update to the overall
design brings rounded sides and the
frame is actually made of aluminum alloy
while the backing is still made of that
lovely ceramic that Johnny loves to use
in their devices
it makes for a phone that is still
really nice to look at and it feels a
lot better in the hand due to its
smaller overall size than compared to
last year that screen comes in at five
point nine nine inches with an 18 by 9
Full HD plus display that still looks
pretty great and has the most minimal
bezels that they can possibly put on
this device now the forehead is actually
as minimal as possible just like last
year's me mix so the front-facing camera
has been moved to the bottom right
corner yes this is still a thing when it
comes to the me mix and it might be a
little bit odd at first but they really
tried to make this a black slab all
around and as you can see closely they
actually coated it with a black material
so that it will pretty much blend in
with the rest of the turned off screen
speaking of that front facing camera it
is a 5 megapixel shooter and when you
open up the camera for the first time
and try to use the front facing camera
it actually tells you to flip the phone
around in order for you to take a more
conventional selfie now one of the
issues from last year's me mix was the
fact that the replacement for the phone
speaker just wasn't really the most
effective alternative now they have gone
back to actually having a speaker at the
top or you have a tube unit that points
upward and provides just that tiny
little slit at the top however the
ultrasonic proximity sensor is still
found in this top area right underneath
the screen so the phone still knows when
it is next to your face or inside of
your pocket taking a look at the
specifications underneath we have the
snapdragon 835 with six ego bytes of RAM
and 64 128 or 256 gigabytes of on-board
storage there is a me mix 2 special
edition that uses
a unibody ceramic design without that
aluminum alloy which is pretty
interesting and that one comes with a
gigabytes of RAM in 128 gigabytes of
on-board storage the battery is a
non-removable 3400 milliamp hour battery
and it can be charged with qc3 now
you're gonna be looking around the
device and realized there's no headphone
jack and the little adapter was actually
kind of hiding it took me a while to
find it behind this flap inside of the
box now one of the more interesting
parts about the me macstew is that it
will have global bands it will actually
have more bands than the me note 2 had
when it was released which means that
you'll be able to use this device even
in the u.s. even if it's not really
officially going on sale in the US but
it will be available in Jamie's main
markets including India and also in
higher quantities than the original me
mix was made available so now we can
talk about the camera and unfortunately
it is not the dual camera setup that we
enjoyed on the me6 instead you get an IM
x3 86 image sensor with four axis
optical image stabilization
it comes with an f 2.0 aperture and
overall it uses the same software that
you might be used to another xiaomi
devices HDR is still a toggle there's no
HDR auto mode and as far as video modes
go you'll be able to record up to 4k
resolution will give you more about the
camera including camera samples as I use
this phone as my daily driver over the
next week or two overall what we like
about the me mix 2 is that it takes a
lot of the same cues from the original
me mix and just makes it more accessible
with a 6 inch screen it is actually a
lot easier to handle which was a big
issue from last year and with that four
sided curved ceramic body it still looks
incredible but at the same time is
pretty economically accessible because
of the curves on the back of the front
the me UI is pretty easy on the eyes
even though it doesn't have an app
drawer but I can always be changed a
little bit later and it was nice that
Google services were already installed
on this phone ready to go and so there
you have it your first look and hands on
what the Joey me makes - Jean me
continues to use ceramic material to
great effect and they've brought out yet
another phone that looks awesome and
this time feels awesome while providing
what is supposed to be pretty much all
screen all the time this 18 by 9 minimal
bezel screen is something that we're
getting really used to in today's
smartphone landscape and it's good to
see that Johnny is sticking to the
guns when it comes to the original me
mix design and updating it for everybody
