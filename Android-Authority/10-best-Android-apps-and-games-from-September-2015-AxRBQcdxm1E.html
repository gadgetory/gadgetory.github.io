Hindy the android authority app guy its
nearing the end of September people are
going back to school and the weather is
changing and that means it's time to
round up the best apps and games from
September of 2015 the head block has
become a commonplace occurrence in it
was only a matter of time before a
browser was released it had this
functionality built in the at BOK
browser is overall a simple browser that
does most of the basic browser stuff
like bookmarks and of course browsing
the web it does have ad blocking built
right in which will remove most ads from
most websites there are some bugs here
and there but overall it does seem to be
pretty solid eternity warriors 4 is the
newest in the famous franchise of hack
and slash RPGs from Glu Mobile this one
features enhanced graphics and gameplay
from eternity warriors 3 along with a
slew of new missions new storylines and
more stuff to do there is also an online
component that lets you battle people as
well as join guilds there are also
leaderboards weekly events and a whole
lot more to help keep the game fresh
another big-name game that came out this
last month was fifa 16 ultimate team
this is the successor to fifa 15 and
will likely rank among the best sports
games released this year it brought a
whole new gaming engine which looks
phenomenal but it has been a problem to
run on many devices also in the typical
EA style there are some rather
aggressive in-app purchases still this
is a solid sports game if you can get
past all that other stuff earlier this
month google officially evolved the
original google wallet application into
android pay and filled that void with
this new Google Wallet app it doesn't
handle NFC payments anymore but it does
show you things like your account
history account balance transactions and
you can manage your google wallet card
it's wrapped up in a beautiful material
design interface and if you use android
pay you should really have this also
Khan Academy has actually been around
for a while but previously the
application was in beta now it's out for
public consumption and with it comes
better stability and a whole ton of
features for those who may not know Khan
Academy is an online learning site that
helps you learn all kinds of skills and
brush up on all kinds of knowledge it
syncs with the website so you can pick
up where you left off effortlessly and
it's totally free to use Mirotic is a
unique application that allows you to
capture whatever it is you're doing on
your android device and then stream that
to other people think of it like
periscope makes with twitch except for
its not limited to using just Twitter or
playing games it requires android 5.0 to
use it and
works reasonably well in most cases
however do beware of those bugs because
they do exist otherwise this is pretty
fun hilariously to applications came out
this last month that do exactly what
they say they're going to do the first
was moved to iOS which actually does
work despite the perceived slap to the
face following in his footsteps was
stick with Android an application that
also does exactly what it says it's
going to do between these two goofy
applications you can move to iOS or stay
on Android the choice is totally yours
not to be left in the dust by eternity
warriors for game off released their
next iteration of order and chaos dubbed
order and chaos to redemption this
MMORPG delivers hack and slash gameplay
online co-op mode online PvP and even
online trading there is a ton of
storyline content and quest to go on
although it can get a bit overwhelming
from time to time it's a fun game but do
beware of those release day bugs for
years now Pokemon fans have been pining
for a real legitimate Pokemon game on
mobile well we now officially have a
Pokemon game although it's not quite
what we were expecting Pokemon shuffle
is a match-three style of game where you
do battle with other pokemon by matching
icons similar to be jeweled there's a
lot of content and plenty of official
Pokemon fun it's not the game we really
wanted but it's a start and we do
appreciate it last and certainly not
least this month is unkilled this is a
total out of madfinger games the same
studio that brought us the dead trigger
series frankly this could have been
called dead trigger 3 and no one would
have batted an eye you get all kinds of
awesome weapons and then you use them to
mow down all kinds of awesome zombies
it's all wrapped up in some really
impressive graphics for a mobile game
and it's also free to play it's a great
little first-person shooter once again
