what's going on everybody and i'm here
with mr. signage and mod himself mr.
Steve Kondik now first of all I would
love to just shake your hand
congratulations on a successful launch
today everything was great it's been
pretty it's been pretty crazy to put it
mildly for the last few months and it's
really awesome to finally be able to
talk about what we've been working on oh
yeah absolutely and I understand of
everyone's probably pretty tired and
whatnot so I'm not going to try to take
up too much of your time but obviously
the coverage of the one plus one plus
one is it's going to be absolutely crazy
you're going to hear a lot about the
phone already I'm sure watching the
videos on the channel already and
whatnot so I wanted to start off by
talking about cyanogenmod itself so 11s
being built specifically for the oneplus
one but what what made you want to
create a specific version for this
particular device well it's not
necessarily it is it's a specific
version for this device but it is the
launch of a new direction for kind of
you know what we've been thinking about
you know we're geeks you know we like
things to be very very functional and
very very simple and very clean and you
know now that we've kind of made this
bleep informed a new company you know we
have the ability to really put some
effort into into making really high-end
design you know as part of this really
solid technical base that we already
have we released we released a the
initial version of like our team and our
new theme engine which is super powerful
you know we've had the capability for a
long time but this new version is it
it's incredibly powerful and on this
device you'll see you'll see a whole
bunch of stuff to go with that you had a
version on the oppo n1 what's the
journey to the oneplus one very
different from the journey that you took
to make it to this antigen version of
the oppo n1 so the work we did for the
n1 was it was in an enormous amount of
bug fixing
an enormous amount of polish to take
this you know sort of thing that we had
never really know put through the paces
of you know certification with Google or
anything like that and pull it all
together and since we did that we really
improve the quality of the software and
we we gained a lot of new abilities to
to start to take it in a new direction
with this device you know we had you
know we had a little bit of say about
you know you know what's going into the
device and we we we had a very specific
plan of what we were going to do and you
know I think it turned out pretty well
still a lot of work to do before we're
pretty much gonna the good thing about
softwares you can pretty much take it up
to the wire you know but I'm pretty
happy so far one so you were talking
about choice when it comes to sandwich
and mod as an operating system as a unit
interface user interface and whatnot
with that philosophy in mind what what
made you guys gravitate to one plus one
which as recent reports have been saying
or a recent commentary have been saying
has a bit of an attitude of its own
especially when it comes to a choice and
whatnot never settling so speak yep well
we like them because they're they're
very much a start-up just like we are on
same sort of attitude and you know they
see that there's a need for some change
in the industry and I think we can
provide it together okay so talking
about 1 plus specifically now did
sandwich and mod did you guys have a say
in because we understand that the
software side of things obviously it's
what we see on the surface did you guys
have a hand in any of the hardware side
of things as well was what the
collaboration look like between the two
of you we didn't do the hardware design
we gave some recommendations on onion a
few things and
we wanted the stereo speakers on the
bottom and you know if you have two
things and you know some we got some we
didn't but I think the device itself is
it's pretty amazing coming from the man
himself i will ask if you had to pitch
the key software features that's out
jomon brings to the 1+1 what would be
the key ones i think people should
really look out for the new features
that you're going to see or obviously
the new theme engine and the new theme
store we also built a new new gallery
app that can install your social network
stands on and a brand new camera app did
we tried to we try to look at the
different camera apps and make it really
simple to you know to kind of switch
between the different modes you might
want to use and you know be fast access
to all the controls without it no kind
of feeling clunky or feeling like you
know the things that you want to get to
were buried behind too much stuff so
those are some of the really the really
big features you know there's a lot of
there's a lot of things in there that
are kind of staples of CM that you know
you should that you should try out like
privacy guard and you know we have some
cool stuff on there like like
hardware-assisted disk encryption and
some really cool audio processing that
that actually doesn't eat your battery
yeah that camera app I was taking a look
at the camera app myself when I was
doing my hands on ya I thought that it
was very intuitive there were there was
there was a long long list of features
that you are able to use on there and it
was almost just a little bit daunting
but I love that there was so much you
could play with there yeah we we played
around with a lot of different designs
we really like the you know the scroll
between the different views but it got
to be too much so we sort of added like
the favorites where you can like you
know pick your favorite the favorite
views that you want to use and then
they're just right there at your
fingertips well you named off a lot of
great features that are in the software
release of the oneplus one but software
hardware whatever it might be what is
one
thing you're super excited about with
this phone um just the performance of it
in general it's awesome it's just it's
just a great device to use me personally
I'm a bit of an audio geek and we all
worked really hard on the audio features
on the device and it sounds really
awesome alright the final question that
I would have to ask is what does the
what does the future look like for
sanjib mod with or without one plus one
was it what's it looking at well we're
gonna keep working on our platform we're
going to keep we're going to keep
working on building an awesome user
experience that that you know really
lets you use your phone the way you
wanted to work I say that was the last
question because normally you want to do
interviews like this I asked the last
very last question that asks is what
phone are you rocking but it's pretty
obvious what is being rocked right now
and that is the one plus one well Steve
thank you so much for your time i'm in
all right android rd here and stay tuned
for all of the coverage of the oneplus
one including the great version of
cyanogenmod we have in their 11s it is
just one aspect of this great phone
coming in at 299 that probably is going
to get a lot of you guys excited so stay

that coverage because we're your source
