worthwhile buy or just another step in
Samsung's plan to make all the phones
find out in our review hey everybody I'm
Chris look and I've got some serious
deja vu going on here because I could
have sworn we reviewed this phone before
but it must have just been one of those
very very similar phones anyway let's
find out what makes this one different
starting with the specs the galaxy s3
has a four inch TFT WVGA display and
runs a Broadcom chipset with a one
gigahertz dual-core CPU and video core
for GPU memory wise we're looking at one
gig of ram and four gigs of internal
storage in the 3g version we're
reviewing the LTE version has eight gigs
of internal storage the rear facing
camera is 5 megapixels and captures 720p
video while the front facing camera is
VGA supplying the power we're looking at
a 1500 milliamp hour battery here while
the LTE version has a 1800 milliamp hour
battery like other low to mid-range
offerings from Samsung the galaxy ace 3
has a shape that suggests other more
high-end galaxy phones while being
smaller and a little chunkier button
layout is the usual for Samsung power
button on the right volume rocker on the
left headphone jack is on the top while
the USB port is on the bottom
both the sim and microSD slots are
accessed by removing the back of the
phone one thing this relatively modest
entry in the galaxy line has going for
it is that it's very comfortable phone
to hold and it should fit comfortably
for most grips the entire phone is a
fingerprint magnet but that could be
said about most phones these days with
an 800 by 480 resolution stretched
across the 4-inch screen this is not the
highest pixel density screen we've ever
seen at 233 PPI but it's far from the
worst to that said resolution isn't
everything when it comes to a display
brightness is decent but when you
combine it with how reflective the
screen is this is not an easy phone
look at and bright sunlight even when
you max out the brightness on the
plus-side
black levels are fairly deep callers are
generally well represented and viewing
angles are good by the time you're at an
angle where colors start to change you
can barely see the screen anyway looking
at the decidedly low mid-range specs we
weren't expecting crazy performance out
of the Galaxy Ace 3 and because of that
we weren't disappointed first we turn to
antutu benchmark we ran the benchmark
ten times and saw scores staying very
close running from about eight thousand
two hundred to eight thousand six
hundred when all was said and done we
had a final average score of almost
exactly eight thousand four hundred
eight thousand four hundred point eight
to be exact
next we turn to Epic Citadel but despite
trying our best all it did was crash in
real-world situations the galaxy s3
never really seemed a lag or stutter
whether we were scrolling through
various screens or launching apps gaming
performance isn't going to be great but
it handled lighter 3d games like subway
surfers without any problems the Galaxy
Ace 3 runs Android 4.2.2 and as you
probably expected its skinned with
Samsung's TouchWiz interface like a lot
of Samsung's other recent phones the ACE
3 shares its general look with the
version of TouchWiz introduced with the
galaxy s4 though without so many of the
special features that phone has the
version we're reviewing didn't come
through a carrier so it's relatively
bloatware free the usual Samsung Apps
like s planner s voice and s translator
are included as is the my files file
browser but besides these and a few
other apps not much else is installed
which is nice given the small amount of
internal storage we're dealing with here
the 5 megapixel camera isn't bad the UI
is right in line with other newer
Samsung phones though it doesn't offer
as many options as the s4 or even other
mid-range Samsung's you've still got
sound in Shaa and panorama among other
options the photos themselves aren't bad
especially for a lower mid-range phone
though it can be hard to get a nicely
focused shot this is nothing a few tries
won't fix and once you get a nice shot
colors are vivid and the images
generally sharp though there is a bit of
visual noise in all but the brightest
lighting video capture is limited to
720p and is nothing to write home about
it looks alright but with the phone
small size and no stabilization features
shaky video is nearly a given
depending on which version of the phone
you're using you'll either have a 1500
or 1800 milliamp hour battery either way
battery life isn't all that great during
my testing battery life was down from a
full charge to 50% in just a few hours
of testing and benchmarking granted this
was fairly heavy use but most of the
time IC batteries lasting much longer
especially in fairly low spec devices
the good news is that like other Samsung
Galaxy phones the battery is replaceable
here with the LTE version available this
means that you can already grab an 1800
milliamp hour battery if you're using 3G
version and get a bit of a boost I'll
admit it it's tough to figure out who
all these different Samsung phones are
for is this a good fit for someone yeah
I'm sure it's just hard to tell who this
isn't a bad deal for 250 bucks contract
freak just make sure you take a look at
all your options and make sure you're
getting the features you want if you
