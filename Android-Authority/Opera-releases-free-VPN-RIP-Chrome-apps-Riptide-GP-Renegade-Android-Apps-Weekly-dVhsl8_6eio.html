handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 155 so let's roll that
intro Google toooo has been out for a
week and it has already surpassed 5
million installs that's pretty
impressive for a video calling service
looking to usurp all of the other
options out there the launch hasn't been
perfect and duo has experienced release
bugs but it should be a fairly strong
competitor in this space as the platform
matures you can pick it up right now for
free if you want to reportedly Pandora
is close to launching a new music
service to compete with the likes of
Spotify and others according to The Wall
Street Journal the company has been
silently negotiating rights with record
labels over the last few months
pandora seems to be about finished with
this process this has been rumored for a
long time so it's not a huge surprise
however it will definitely be
interesting Lenovo and Microsoft
announced a new partnership this week
the resulting partnership will have
future Lenovo devices shipping with
Microsoft applications including Skype
onedrive and Microsoft's Office suite
also this deal covers all of the smart
phones under lenovo's umbrella and that
includes Motorola devices we don't know
which phones will be the first to ship
out with these apps installed but we
can't imagine that it will be too far
off Samsung announced this week that
they have processed over 100 million
transactions on Samsung pay which has
resulted in one point seven eight
trillion dollars this info comes a short
time before the apps first year
anniversary even if you don't like
Samsung pay you have to admit that those
numbers are pretty impressive if nothing
else it serves as proof that mobile
payments are taking off in a big way and
here's hoping ubiquity comes sooner
rather than later
Samsung also announced that they were
shutting down milk music next month it
was announced late last week that Google
is retiring from apps for Windows Mac
and Linux versions of Google Chrome
Google's reasoning for this is twofold
the first is that no one's really using
these applications outside of Chrome OS
and Google Play is likely going to take
over in the app department there anyway
the second is that the chrome team wants
to lighten up Chrome a little bit which
is great news the process will start
later this year and will complete itself
by early 2018 for even more Android apps
and games news releases and updates
don't forget to check out this week's
newsletter which is linked in the
description below there you'll find all
of the latest news including the latest
Pokemon Go news you can use the forum in
the written companion which is also
linked in the video description below to
sign up for the newsletter which we send
out every single Sunday and don't forget
to check out the android authority app
for even faster updates alright folks to
take a look at the apps and games that
made a big splash over the last week if
you want to check out any of these apps
or games for yourself you can find those
links in the video description below
Thrones kingdom at war is a new kingdom
building game similar to the likes of
clash of clans
it features above-average graphics for
that genre although many of the feature
mirror those of existing games for
instance guilds are called orders in
this game and the bulk of your
experience will be finding and attacking
other players you'll also get to choose
a hero and find gear for them to equip
there is also an including quest system
to help keep things a little interesting
you should check it out if you're a fan
of the genre wall ray is a wallpaper
application that boasts a variety of
high quality images nature scenes and
people photos round out it's fairly
large selection and the service boasts
about 10,000 photos right now the images
are large enough to work on 1440p
displays which is great news because not
many wallpaper applications focus on
providing content at that high of a
resolution you won't find any super
unique or abstract images which is a
little bit of a bummer however if you
like nature and need a crispy wallpaper
this one is free with no ads and a cheap
pro version
Agricola is a well-known board game and
now it's been ported over to mobile
players of this game will be facing off
against one another to see who can build
the largest most productive farms within
the time limit of the game each game
lasts 8 rounds and you'll only have 3
workers to play with like most board
games the gameplay is mostly centered
around strategy but it's not every day
you get to create farms on a competitive
level it's $4.99 with the only in-app
purchase being for DLC opera released a
free VPN service this last week and
that's kind of a big deal it's fairly
difficult finding a VPN service let
alone a free one that works as well as
this one does creating a VPN is as easy
as pressing a button and opera includes
a guardian feature that blocks add
trackers from following you around the
web the whole thing is done through an
opera subsidiary called surf easy and it
really doesn't take long to learn users
have expressed a concern about operas
logging practices but you can find their
policies online if you're worried
see if this will work for you Riptide GP
renegade is the latest racer out of one
of the best racing franchises out there
like his predecessors you'll be racing
waverunners against AI opponents in a
variety of offense in career mode and
there is a PvP mode Bri can race other
players if you like if you have a device
and multiple controllers you can even
play split-screen multiplayer witches
awesome the graphics are great and this
one has an actual story line which is
appreciated it's also relatively
inexpensive it's going to be one of the
best racing games that's here and it's
definitely worth picking up and that
about does it for this one folks if you
want to keep watching I've linked our
Android nougat complete overview up
