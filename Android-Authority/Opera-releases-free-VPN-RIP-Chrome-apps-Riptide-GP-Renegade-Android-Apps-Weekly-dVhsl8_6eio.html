Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 155 so let's roll that
intro Google 20 has been out for a week
and it has already surpassed 5 million
installs that's pretty impressive for a
video calling service looking to usurp
all of the other options out there the
launch hasn't been perfect and duo has
experienced release bugs but it should
be a fairly strong competitor in this
space as the platform matures you can
pick it up right now for free if you
want to reportedly pandora is close to
launching a new music service to compete
with the likes of Spotify and others
according to The Wall Street Journal the
company has been silently negotiating
rights with record labels over the last
few months pandora seems to be about
finished with this process this has been
rumored for a long time so it's not a
huge surprise however it will definitely
be interesting Lenovo and microsoft
announced a new partnership this week
the resulting partnership will have
future Lenovo devices shipping with
Microsoft applications including skype
onedrive and Microsoft's Office suite
also this deal covers all of the
smartphones under lenovo sunbrella and
that includes motorola devices we don't
know which phones will be the first to
ship out with these apps installed but
we can't imagine that it will be too far
off samsung announced this week that
they have processed over 100 million
transactions on samsung pay which has
resulted in one point seven eight
trillion dollars this info comes a short
time before the apps first year
anniversary even if you don't like
samsung pay you have to admit that those
numbers are pretty impressive if nothing
else it serves as proof that mobile
payments are taking off in a big way and
here's hoping ubiquity comes sooner
rather than later samsung also announced
that they were shutting down milk music
next month it was announced late last
week that Google is retiring from-- apps
for Windows Mac and Linux versions of
Google Chrome Google's reasoning for
this is twofold the first is that no
one's really using these applications
outside of Chrome OS and Google Play is
likely going to take over in the app
Department there anyway the second is
that the chrome team wants to lighten up
Chrome a little bit which is great news
the process will start later this year
and will complete itself by early 2018
for even more Android apps and games
news releases and updates don't forget
to check out this week's newsletter
which is linked in the
no description below there you'll find
all of the latest news including the
latest Pokemon go news you can use the
form in the written companion which is

below to sign up for the newsletter
which we send out every single Sunday
and don't forget to check out the
android authority app for even faster
updates alright folks to take a look at
the apps and games that made a big
splash over the last week if you want to
check out any of these apps or games for
yourself you can find those links in the
video description below Thrones Kingdom
at war is a new kingdom building game
similar to the likes of clash of clans
it features above-average graphics for
that genre although many of the feature
mirror those of existing games for
instance guilds are called orders in
this game and the bulk of your
experience will be finding and attacking
other players you'll also get to choose
a hero and find gear for them to equip
there is also an included quest system
to help keep things a little interesting
you should check it out if you're a fan
of the genre wall ray is a wallpaper
application that boasts a variety of
high quality images nature scenes and
people photos round out it's fairly
large selection and the service boasts
about 10,000 photos right now the images
are large enough to work on 1440p
displays which is great news because not
many wallpaper applications focus on
providing content at that high of a
resolution you won't find any super
unique or abstract images which is a
little bit of a bummer however if you
like nature and need a crispy wallpaper
this one is free with no ads and a cheap
pro version agricola is a well-known
board game and now it's been ported over
to mobile players of this game will be
facing off against one another to see
who can build the largest most
productive farms within the time limit
of the game each game lasts eight rounds
and you'll only have three workers to
play with like most board games the
gameplay is mostly centered around
strategy but it's not every day you get
to create farms on a competitive level
it's four dollars and ninety-nine cents
with the only in-app purchase being for
dlc opera released a free VPN service
this last week and that's kind of a big
deal it's fairly difficult finding a VPN
service let alone a free one that works
as well as this one does creating a VPN
is as easy as pressing a button and
opera includes a guardian feature that
blocks ad trackers from following you
around the web the whole thing is done
through an opera subsidiary called surf
easy and it really doesn't take long to
learn users have expressed a concern
about operas logging practices but you
can find their policies online if you're
worried and see if this will work for
you rip
GP renegade is the latest racer out of
one of the best racing franchises out
there like its predecessors you'll be
racing wave runners against AI opponents
in a variety of offense in career mode
and there is a PvP mode where you can
race other players if you like if you
have a device and multiple controllers
you can even play split screen
multiplayer witches awesome the graphics
are great and this one has an actual
storyline which is appreciated it's also
relatively inexpensive it's going to be
one of the best racing games is here and
it's definitely worth picking up and
that about does it for this one folks if
