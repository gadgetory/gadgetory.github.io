trying to think about where your phone
went but even then there's no pause for
you until you're reunited with it a lot
of people this point are already
thinking about the worst-case scenario
so what can you do if you find yourself
in this predicament with your Android
device well we recently checked out a
couple of solutions so maybe there's
still hope so as the thief one of the
tests we did was that I took John's
phone and walked a few blocks away
without telling him where I was going
and he had to find out where I went
using just the apps he was able to get
to my same block which is good but once
he was there he had no idea where I was
even with him pinging the phone and
making it remotely rang our first course
of action was to use Android device
manager and lucky for us we had a second
phone to help track it down
so all you need to do is install the app
and from there you can do with all the
usual things you could locate it on the
map lock the phone if you don't have a
password on there already and even
remotely wipe it as a worst case
scenario
another solutions to use a third-party
anti-theft app which in our case we use
Cerberus the nice thing about this one
is that it's far more comprehensive in
addition to what Android device manager
offers we can use it to spy on our thief
that means we can snap photos and videos
using either the phone's cameras there's
actually a one neat option with Cerberus
you could actually send a message to
your lost phone they'll display it on
there and the neat thing about it too is
that they'll actually read it out loud
while it's wonderful to use the downside
to Cerberus is that you'll need to
install on the first day of using their
phone and this brings us to its major
flaw which is that unless you've done
your research and had prior experience
with losing your phone then this
solution won't do a darn thing when it
happens to you unexpectedly going back
to Android device manager we soon
realize that tracking down the phone in
New York City wasn't going to be easy
the app just couldn't trace the phone's
last known GPS location however it
seemed as though it finally pick it up
once a thief started to move away from
us and we notice that they went a block
away from our position once we got close
to the general vicinity of where the app
was telling us the problem came across
was that the location could have been in
some building 50 floors up from the
ground even ensure we can activate the
phone to ring but when you're in a noisy
spot like we were it's nearly impossible
to hear at best both apps can only get
you to the general location of your
phone like an address and then you have
to rely on making the phone ring
remotely which if you're in the middle
of a crowded city street in Manhattan or
even if you're in a different building
could be pretty useless
I watched them look around for a full
minute before just walking up to him and
giving him back his phone which I doubt
any thief is actually gonna do so even
though both apps can be useful if you
set it up correctly before you lose your
phone you're still gonna need a good
amount of luck to get it back so yeah we
came to the realization that if you lose
or have your Android phone stolen the
transits are we tracking it down and
subsequently finding it in a big city is
pretty slim we know it sucks but we've
already explained some of the logistical
issues chances are - most people are
carrying only a single phone so they
don't have the luxury of tracking it
down with another phone right away so
where does that lead most people it
means they'll need to access Android
device manager or Cerberus through a PC
again timing is crucial when it comes to
successfully getting your phone but if
you can't get to a computer in time
your phone will be long gone that's a
repair Android device manager is a great
tool to use if you accidentally leave it
at home or at a friend's house or even a
place in general you can recall that's
because you're not thinking worst case
scenario just yet you can access Android
device manager to reaffirm your
speculate
when your hunch is strongly telling you
that you left it by accident at a place
you can recall the confirmation you get
from logging on to your account helps to
eliminate further worry the best advice
that we can give you about all of this
is to go ahead and set up a password of
some kind when you first set up your
smartphone fingerprint verification is
ideal but regardless any lock is better
than none a thief can't attempt enter
your password but after so many failed
attempts usually 10 Android by default
can be set to the phone and when they go
through the initial setup process it
asks for the password of the previous
account on there so if you don't want to
lose your phone for good you should
probably take pre-emptive action now
that means downloading all the right
apps and going through all the settings
because trying to find a phone with no
previous set up is pretty much
impossible the two app super testing
where Android device manager and
cerebrese which both worked but we're
pretty glitchy and they both only show
your phone as a blue dot on a map which
John and I realized was gonna be an
issue when we saw that we were standing
in the middle of Manhattan and like we
said it's best to have some sort of
password protection on your phone
because that folks is the first line of
defense it can save you from intruders
trying to do more than just steal your
phone so there you go guys that was our
experience trying to track down a lost
phone in New York City if you guys want
to learn more about any of the stuff we
talked about in this video you can check
