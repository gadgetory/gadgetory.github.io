that we saw at this year's Aoife 2015 in
Berlin we take a look at one of the
first devices that we got our hands on
at the show the huawei mate s now the
main s might be a bit of a refinement on
the mate 7 but it is not as large as the
made seven and brings all of the same
power comes in with a 5.5 inch AMOLED
display with 1080p resolution is powered
by a high silicon Karen 935 and has 3
gigabytes of RAM however the mate s
brings all of the great features that
the mate 7 had which made it one of our
favorite phones of the past year and
puts it in an even thinner and sleeker
package this is a pretty thin device
considering just how large it is and how
much it is able to do and it sits really
nicely in the hand with the metal
construction that we have come to love
from plenty of the mate line the 128
gigabyte flash memory model comes with a
new feature and that is force touch yes
Huawei is sort of beating Apple to the
punch here with a force touch iteration
that uses the pressure sensors
underneath the screen in order to
perform a number of tasks not the least
of which is actually weighing very small
items but functionality kind of has a
lot of possibilities with something like
force touch in which you can just press
down a little bit harder to make things
happen on the phone now coupled the
force touch one of the new features of
this phone with all of the other great
ones such as the fingerprint reader on
the back that can actually be used to
navigate the device somewhat and you
have in the mate s one of the best
devices that we probably weren't really
expecting to see or love as much as we
did here at Aoife 2015 and now we move
into a tablet now considering that
lenovo has created a lot of many
different tablets some of which having
some quirky or somewhat gimmicky
features it's nice to see that in the
yoga tablet 3 pro we now have the
conglomeration of all of the best that
the original yoga line was able to bring
and that is of course the projector that
can be made up to 70 inches large and is
now placed in the area on the bottom
that is housing the kickstand on which
you can stand the tablet in two
different variations so you can make it
easier to use for media consumption this
just might be the kind of tab
you want especially when you consider
its sound quality for speakers made by
dolby 360 sound provide some of the
loudest sound we've ever heard from a
tablet not to mention being able to hear
the left and right channel so well that
sometimes depending on the audio you
might hear the audio from behind you
with a great sound experience a more
than enough display experience
especially considering the projector and
the power to be able to go for a while
we give one of our awards to the yoga
tablet 3 by Lenovo though they did not
have a flash of smartphone to show us
here at IVA 2015 LG did have a few
products that they wanted us to see one
of them was the LG G pad to 10.1
bringing a larger screen to the LG G pad
family and then there was the LG watch
urbane lux a 23-karat gold cartier clasp
designed version of the LG watch urbane
that brought some real luxury in a
lacquer case that really put luxury into
the new SmartWatch but the device that
we brought our award to for LG's line of
products was for no roly keyboard that's
right we gave LG an award for an
accessory which is a fold-out keyboard
that kind of packs together into what
you can pretty much call a Bluetooth
stack really this very sleek and very
easy to maneuver device is a Bluetooth
keyboard that also has some kick stands
in the back for you to put up the LG G
pad 2 or any other tablets or even
smartphones on to and between those is a
triple a battery slot of which LG claims
the Rolly will be able to use for up to
three months now slide out that keyboard
and everything looks even better from
there these actually have a actual drop
to them of 17 millimeters that gives the
Rolly keyboard the true feel of a
keyboard without having to have one of
those cases for all-in-one tablets this
one can be used with basically any
device with Bluetooth fold it up and
roll it back out the Rolly keyboards
just really fun to sort of toss around
from time to time and it feels like one
of the better accessories that we can
have for plenty of our android-powered
devices out there but flagship
smartphones were a story at Aoife 2015
and they mostly came from Sony
who after a few different naming
conventions gone awry in the last year
finally came back with a true new
flagship and that is the Xperia z5 now
while the z5 itself is one that we
already liked and are happy to see
because Sony puts out some pretty great
devices they also had the z5 compact but
the one that we gave our award to is the
beginning of what could be a revolution
in display technology the z5 premium now
despite the snapdragon 810 underneath a
new fingerprint sensor and a
reconstructed camera module on the back
at 23 megapixels what we're giving the
award to is all of that coupled with a
4k display yes this 4k display on the z5
premium brings a new level of display
technology with 806 PPI in this
particular screen now we do believe that
4k quad HD 1080p all of these display
technologies might prove a little bit
lost on the general consumer and we
wholly understand that but 4k on a
smartphone is something that Sony can
boast about starting and if anything it
has started the conversation that plenty
of other manufacturers in the next year
are probably going to be speaking anyway
so we give the z5 premium with its
already great spec sheet an award for
starting the conversation in what could
be the future of our display technology
without the galaxy note 5 we did not
think that Samsung was going to take our
hearts away here at E 4 2015 but we were
wrong because they unveiled the gear s2
the update to last year's bangle
constructed gear s this is now a round
watch that takes on the visage of a real
luxury watch in the case of the s2
classic and then a more futuristic
looking wearable in the original s2 a
1.2 inch Super AMOLED display with 360 x
360 resolution stands out still despite
being a little bit smaller than some of
the much larger smartwatches out there
Super AMOLED technology will be
leveraged quite well here so you can get
some pretty good battery life from it
but of course we will save that for our
testing but what we really love about
this device is its new form of input
this rotating and we label bezel on here
is actually an input for you to go in
and out of elements the same way that
you would by swiping on the touch screen
smartwatches have been
eating something like this a new form of
input and even with two buttons on the
side it is that a rotating bezel that
really changes the game in most cases
you may not even need to use the
touchscreen just to tap in the middle
that's it in order to select where you
are in order to navigate around and with
Tizen at the operating system helm you
can be sure that Samsung will try to put
any and all functionality and features
inside of this watch that they possibly
can perhaps making it surpass that of
even Android where the gear s2 is
certainly one of the better smartwatches
that we've seen because it tries to
really think outside of the box and in
some ways it already feels like it
succeeds because its input is just
already that much easier and that much
more fun to use and it makes the
SmartWatch actually easily intuitive for
the new SmartWatch user connectivity
like Bluetooth Wi-Fi and NFC will keep
it relevant as well but really what we
love about the gear s2 is that it thinks
a little bit differently from the rest
and that's where we give Samsung our
reward for one of the best devices that
