talked about for a lot of different
reasons but are they good or bad reasons
what we're going to find out because
it's Josh of agar from Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the HTC One a9 much of what you may
remember from the HTC One line is quite
different now a smaller overall body
brings quite a bit of symmetry rounded
sides and quarters along with a 2.5 D
glass over the screen make this phone
feel really smooth in the hand but the
5-inch screen also helps with overall
design making the a9 very easy to handle
the buttons are all on the right side
and they come opposite the sim and
microSD card slots and all the ports as
well as the speaker grille are on the
bottom
moving up front there is one really big
change that many users have already
spoken out about no more boom sound
speakers instead of dual front-facing
speakers we get a recessed fingerprint
reader that can also be used as a home
button and it sits alone below the
display the back has the HTC logo and
its new camera package is dead center at
the top you know I can't really help but
think that I've seen this design before
I got it the HTC Desire eye and the
desire 816 before it they both have the
symmetry and the rounded sides and
corners only this time around they've
just decided to put metal on it just
kidding but not entirely you see even
though this phone obviously has some
inspirations that people have been
voicing their opinions out on HTC would
be pretty quick to remind you that they
were first in creating a number of metal
devices and this time around you have AM
unibody design that unfortunately kind
of has the shape of not only the iPhone
success but it actually has the shape of
a couple of their mid-range offerings
also and I think a lot of people forget
that no that's not really enough to
reconcile what is happening in the
design of the HTC One a9 but there are
some people out there who have been
waiting for what they thought was
Apple's good design language to actually
hit the world of Android and that's
exactly what we have here if you hate
the design of this phone because of
where you think it got its inspiration
from then you're not going to get this
phone but for everybody else here it is
and by keeping the screen at five inches
HTC keeps the one a9 in a pretty good
place when it comes to handling full HD
1080p resolution is what you're getting
here which means that this display for
the most part is a decent performer
colors do benefit from the black levels
and the higher
contrast so things look a little bit
more saturated but when you get to
extreme angles you do see a washout over
everything on the screen and in bright
daylight you might have to pump up the
brightness a little bit just so you can
see what you're looking at still we have
to give the display some marks because
it is one of the better handling ones
available but it has a lot to do with
the design as well as the smaller size
of the display and in general usage for
media and play we did find that the
display was a pretty good performer but
definitely doesn't blow away plenty of
the other ones out there
performance takes on a pretty similar
outlook as we look at a lower tier
package inside of the a9
now the snapdragon 617 might have come
out fairly recently but it's definitely
not as fast as its 800 to your
counterparts three gigabytes of RAM is
available in the 32 gigabyte version of
this phone and it helps with loading the
applications together sometimes all at
once but the slower speed of the 617 is
what is hard to overlook abs take a
noticeable bit of time to load up and
when certain tasks are operating in the
background like GPS navigation the lag
actually gets worse still for typical
daily tasks it hasn't been unbearably
slow just definitely not giving us the
high powered performance of other phones
that we've gotten our hands on as of
late ultimately the display and
performance aspects have been closer to
mid-range than full on flagship which is
fine but the changes in the hardware
hope to bring more to talk about and we
start off with the new fingerprint
reader a front mounted unit underneath
the display and it works pretty well
even if it feels a bit tacked on as far
as speed goes it has to go to the lock
screen first and then as you hold
usually your thumb on that particular
area then it will go through the
unlocking animation this does add a
little bit of extra time when compared
to other fingerprint readers out there
but it's not so bad this is the thing
about the fingerprint reader though it
actually throws a wrench in a lot of
what was supposed to be part of the HTC
One line do you remember the sensor
suite the motion gestures that you use
in order to bring up the phone to your
face and then once it knows that it's
there you can tap on the screen or swipe
in any number of directions in order to
go to certain parts of the home screens
well now that you have the fingerprint
reader on here it's almost as if the
motion gestures are made moot you don't
even get to those particular areas of
the home screens because you have to put
your fingerprint down anyway so the
narrative behind the
HTC One m8 from before is kind of broken
here in the a9 and then there's also the
fact that you can use the fingerprint
reader as a home button when you have
this option on every now and then you
might switch between using that or the
soft key home button but the problem is
if you use the hardware home button then
there are no capacitive keys on its
sides you still have to use the soft
keys in order to navigate fiddling
between the two was actually really
common for us and of course there's the
omission of the boom sound speakers due
to this new feature one of the most
recognizable parts of the HTC One
devices thus no longer here and that's a
pretty bold move sound thus gets a big
downgrade now this bottom mounted
speaker just doesn't get that loud and
there's not a whole lot of body behind
the sound anyway storage options some
remain either 16 or 32 gigabytes with
three gigabytes being put in the 32
gigabyte version but expandable storage
in the a9 does give it an edge over
plenty of the flagships that have
omitted it this year and though my
version of this phone is a European SKU
and thus only connects to HSPA+ on 18 t
for now it has been quite reliable in
data in voice but in voice calls we did
think that there needed to be a bump up
in volume and finally in battery we have
a very small 2150 million of our unit in
here which comes with the obvious
problems but HTC does hope to help that
by including the Snapdragon 617 which
can be updated to support quick charge
3.0 so obviously it's all about having a
little bit of time in the middle of the
day to just charge up the phone so we
can get past the rest of the day but I
would actually use the word survive
that's because this small battery just
wasn't able to really get through really
heavy work days without needing to be
plugged in in the middle of the day
screen on time never really got over
three hours for me in my somewhat more
than moderate usage and unless you're
doing less than moderate usage and
taking advantage of doze by leaving the
phone down for a while you're probably
not going to get that much done
throughout your day before having to
plug in perhaps more so than ever the
HTC One a9 shows that quick charge while
great is definitely a consolation prize
in comparison to actual great battery
life and in camera a few past
experimental phases bring what HTC hopes
is the most effective combination of
camera packages yet
it starts off pretty well with the ultra
pixel front facing shooter four
megapixels is what you get here but it
does a good
robbed of flooding light in four
good-looking selfies we have to commend
HTC for sticking to their guns on
ultrapixel but they also know what
they're doing by putting it on the front
for selfie cams the rear shooter is 13
megapixels @f 2.0 aperture but let's
take a look at the app first it has the
same Zoe powered gallery backing it and
a number of different modes are
available underneath including the new
hyperlapse that was actually kind of fun
to use but turns out pretty low
resolution the pro mode brings manual
controls as well as raw capture which do
help in those situations where the auto
mode just isn't cutting it and HDR
though not auto capable adds a pretty
good amount of punch and tends to even
out to the shadows and the highlights
but its effect is not really all that
great in the colors as it doesn't
necessarily punch it out as much as
other competitors overall the camera is
simply decent if you are still sour from
the HTC One m9 though this might be the
camera you were waiting for from HTC it
isn't an incredible performer by any
means but it falls in line with the kind
of image processing that we've come to
expect this year details get decently
captured and colors get a bit of extra
saturation in the brighter conditions
but they do tend to taper off as the
lower light comes into play quite a bit
of noise reduction is still at work here
but not so much that the details get
incredibly smudged out now low-light
performance does somewhat get helped by
the optical image stabilization which
also helps when you're trying to record
video but there's a lot of noise that
accompanies these pictures and the
highlights tend to be blown out and
unfortunately in those low-light
situations much slower shutter speeds
that are used to compensate for the
low-light kind of make the OIS moot you
have to be incredibly steady when you're
trying to get that low-light shot it's
kind of funny to think that we are
impressed with this camera simply
because we have the previous HTC one to
compare it to but that also means that
this camera is well decent but shows
that HTC can be capable of moving up in
the image Department in future devices
and finally in software it's a pretty
interesting development as the HTC One
a9 will come with marshmallow out of the
box this was due to some close work with
Google this time around not only is
marshmallow at the helm but sense is
starting to strip down in order to be as
close to the stock Android experience as
it can be and also to allow for even
more frequent updates
but those are pretty miniscule by
comparison because since still feels
really prevalent in the skin after all
blinkfeed is still here which we
actually aren't really complaining about
and replaces what would otherwise be
Google now in the Google launcher and
the app drawer while a vertical scroll
liked it how this has been in since it's
still paginated and doesn't include the
line of the most used applications at
the top now this is one of the features
that we are a little perplexed didn't
make it in with sense trying to be a
stock light as it can possibly be
apparently but all of the major
marshmallow futures are included like
doze and app permissions are found in
the settings and will chime in when key
portions of the phone are accessed by
applications for the first time and
Google now on tap brings its on demand
searching service as well
ultimately of course we are happy that
marshmallow is available out of the box
and if the little things that since no
longer has allows it to be even more
easily updated in the future as they
claim then we're all for it it's an
interesting metaphor for the rest of the
device HTC is trying to adopt what it
knows is well liked by the majority of
users while trying to maintain its
identity in whatever way possible but
before we get a little too meta there
let's look at the price though 399 was
the original price that we showed in the
first look HTC was becoming quite clear
that this is a limited promotional price
soon after the price of the phone will
go up to 499 dollars and this has left
us a little bit conflicted and that's
because at a lower price I actually
think that this phone would have made
some waves there's really only one way
of describing this device experimental
everyone goes through an experimental
phase and I really think that the HTC
One a9 is kind of it let's say HTC went
back to the drawing board and start
messing around with what it thought were
the features that the masses wanted and
that we're missing from there let's say
lackluster HTC One m9 for the display
AMOLED may have seemed like the obvious
choice in the hopes of future proofing
the phone the Snapdragon 617 will
support quick charge 3.0 but the battery
is still the bare minimum ultra pixel
has been made a front facing camera so
HTC is still able to say that they are
using it but the rear camera is more
conventional yet it does provide results
that are actually pretty decent and even
if the fingerprint reader is in line
with new hardware expectations it
actually totally throws a wrench into
the general narrative that HTC tried to
form over
the last couple of years now see this is
a phone that actually gets the singular
parts right but doesn't find a way of
actually putting them all together in a
really coherent way and that might be
its biggest weakness but also its most
interesting trait after all I keep using
this phone and I kind of them smiling
when I'm using it because not only is
there some sort of craziness behind
putting all these parts together they
actually kind of work kind of well and
for the daily user this is a pretty good
device to have for the common daily
tasks HTC is definitely trying here and
their price will be a big stumbling
point but if the company really puts its
best foot forward we might see some
great things from the next one flagship
and that is because the one a9 has the
breeding ground for all the features and
quality that may have been missing in
the past what I recommend this to
everyone
know now when we have a lot of great
flagships already out at even better
prices but HTC loyalists can have a good
time with this experimental device that
addresses a number of issues that they
may have felt where in the one m9 and
the best that we can hope for is that
the experimentation proves pretty
fruitful and we can really hope for
greater things from HTC in the future as
always thank you guys very much for
watching and I hope you enjoyed this
review of the HTC One a9 it's not a bad
device but it's also not a very
overachieving device but what it does do
is it addresses some of the issues that
we have with the original HTC One m9 and
I think that's very worthy of being
mentioned nonetheless though with a
slightly higher price point especially
weeks after the original release then it
kind of makes this phone a little bit
harder to recommend but you can stay
