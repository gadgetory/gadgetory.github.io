authority what is going on everybody and
here we are taking a look at all the
different colors of the Samsung Galaxy
s6 it's going to be just a short video
obviously we have a different design in
the s6 now with a bunch of different
colors for it to be exact right here in
this shot and they all have a nice look
and feel to them with the metal
construction but more importantly in
terms of color we have a translucency to
the backings that allow it to have a
little bit more character rather than
just a plain color being shown on a
cover on the back of course we don't
have the removable cover anymore on this
particular device of course and that
makes for a unibody design that now has
four different editions I'm going to go
ahead and just bring up the versions
that we have right here these are the
white and black versions though I will
admit that the black version seems to
have a little bit of a bluish hue to it
but that might be because of the
translucency that I have already
mentioned just a second ago the white
one is still pretty classic and it has a
nice feel already and the white really
you can't really go wrong with white
it's always going to look and feel the
way that it is and in previous editions
this is really the type of tone that we
expected from the white version except
the black one just doesn't seem to be
all the way black but that's not really
a big issue nonetheless we have the
other two colors as well I'll start off
with this more metallic color right here
so it'll be like a gold edition and it's
quite nice looking what's nice about
these colors is that even if they are a
little bit showy or flashy like you're
going to see in a blue one they still
happen to fit in and blend quite well
despite maybe having a little bit a
little bit more vivid of a color that we
might be used to in our devices where we
might prefer the black and white
as usual but now we have the exclusive
blue version which is exclusive to the
galaxy s6 whereas the green versions for
the galaxy s6 edge now this one has some
real real vivid colors to it it's
actually really showy and flashy it
almost is just a little too bit but for
people who really want a phone that
looks a little bit different this might
be the one that is better for you but
you know tell us in the comments below
which color you think you might be
wanting and with the metal construction
around and the translucent colors on the
back they all have a uniform look to
them adjust the color just makes it pop
a little bit more depending on what
taste you want to have so that was just
a really quick look at the different
colors of the Samsung Galaxy s6 like I
said we have the black/white
a more metallic color over here in gold
and it's blue one that is exclusive to
just this particular original flagship
handset you'll see a color comparison on
the galaxy s6 edge as well and you can
tell us in the description below or
rather in the comments below it should
say what color you think you might be
getting for these particular phones with
a brand new design from Samsung so keep
it tuned here for all of the best
coverage of MWC 2015 this is Joshua
Bogart from Android authority and of
course we are here coming to you live
bringing you all the best in the world
