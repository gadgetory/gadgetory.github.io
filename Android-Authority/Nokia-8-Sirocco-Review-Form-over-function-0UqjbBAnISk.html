a rather difficult device for me to
review that's because on the one hand
it's a device that I personally really
like using but on the other hand it's a
device that I can't wholeheartedly
recommend to everyone without some big
caveats I might unction it ski stick
around for the full review and I'll dig
into why that is so one thing's for sure
this is definitely one of the most
beautiful Nokia devices that H&amp;amp;B global
has made so far it's really unique it's
really different and it's definitely
eye-catching and head-turning we've seen
just what they can do with a mid Ranger
in the seven plus and this is their stab
at a flagship and it really shows so the
device is made out of stainless steel
and it's covered almost entirely in
Gorilla Glass v that glass is on the
front and the back and it curves to a
nice point on the edges giving it kind
of tapered effect and it's incredibly
slim just 7.5 millimeters that grasssnap
metal gives it a really weighty and
premium feel in the hand and it just
looks and shouts quality the screen is
also absolutely stunning it's a to KP
AMOLED display that curves at the edges
giving it that cascading waterfall
effect like the s8 or the s9 the blacks
are absolutely black it's incredibly
sharp and crisp unlike some other
flagship devices this isn't an 18 by 9
aspect ratio it's a typical 16 by 9
which is interesting because they opted
to go with 18 by 9 for the 7 plus but a
lot of people actually prefer the 16 by
9 and in a sea of devices that were all
getting taller it helps to stand out
even more it feels quite square in the
hand and that helps with one-handed use
actually one downside to all of these
sturdy materials and the incredibly slim
form factor though is that some people
have complained that it feels a little
bit sharp and uncomfortable to hold in
one hand personally I don't find this to
be a problem it's not so sharp that's
gonna draw blood or anything it's just a
little bit narrower at the edges and a
little bit harsher than you might be
used to I would say this would hurt a
lot if you threw it at someone but then
I don't think that Nokia is actively
encouraging you to do that doesn't mean
that this doubles up as a nice
self-defense device though to me I just
absolutely love this design I think it
feels and looks really nice and I don't
mind holding it in my hand either in
fact the reason that I'm willing to
overlook some of the
shortcomings I'm going to talk about in
a moment it's just because I like the
experience of using it so much to me it
has that x-factor one of the big
compromises have to be made in order to
make this device so slim though is the
emission of a headphone jack and I know
that a lot of you are going to find that
to be a bit of a downside likewise
another downside of having such a nice
slim device is that there's rather a
camera bulge on here in fact it's one of
the biggest counter bulges that I've
seen in a long time on a modern device
again that's not a big issue for me
personally I don't mind the look of the
camera bulge but when it starts getting
in the way of practical use then it's a
bit more of an issue you sit this on a
table and it's it's very much at an
angle and then it wobbles on that camera
bulge so if you want to use it in that
position it's going to rock around
there's also a fingerprint sensor on the
back which works really well it's very
quick but at the same time it's very
difficult to find it's completely flush
with the device which I don't know why
it needs to be seeing as that bulge is
already there with the camera but it is
it's flush with the device and it's
quite hard to find with one finger which
isn't so much of a problem once again
with the 7 plus and once like Mile on
that beautiful screen unfortunately is
that where it curves you do see quite a
big color shift
it's very tinted and I didn't notice
this so much on other curved displays
and in fact actually the color
temperature veers a little bit blue in
general but don't let that put you off
because I think the screen in general is
wonderful one more plus about the design
though it is ip67 certified against
water and dust so you can submerge this
about 1.5 meters underwater if you wish
nice to have that peace of mind means
you can take it in the shower means you
can use it in the rain and not worry too
much another thing about the design
that's gonna be divisive is the buttons
so when you've got an edge here that's
so slim that means you're going to have
buttons that are really slim and they're
kind of sharp too and a little bit
tricky to find likewise again I don't
mind this in fact I kind of like them
again they're different and I like
different but not everyone will like
them and I really recommend actually
going to a shop and picking up this
device feeling it giving it a go
yourself before you make a decision on
it so yeah it feels great to use it
looks great to use it's really different
it turns heads I like all of those
things a lot but it feels as though
maybe a little bit style a for substance
or at least form over function to the
point where there are some
impracticality x' of the way it's been
designed that you're going to need to
keep in mind when you buy this this is a
six hundred and ninety nine pound device
here in the UK which means you're going
to expect a certain level of premium
build which it's definitely got we also
expect premium performance you expect
this be able to compete with other
flagships on the market for a similar
sort of price range can this do that
well in terms of the specs this is
running a snapdragon 835 chipset and
it's backed up by six gigabytes of RAM
that is not a next-gen processor it's
the same one found in the Galaxy s8 not
the s9 meaning you're not getting very
top-of-the-range performance out of this
device is that gonna be an issue well in
reality no it's not an issue in terms of
performances can do everything you're
gonna want it to do run everything from
the Play Store really nicely the
performance is really smooth on here
everything is buttery smooth
everything's quick I even got the
GameCube emulator the dolphin emulator
up and running meaning that I could play
Metroid Prime and Zelda Wind Waker with
relatively good framerate it's not great
but acceptable and that's quite a nice
benchmark it shows just how powerful
this thing is
fortunately one thing that it has going
in its favor in terms of performance is
the operating system this is running
Android Oreo and it's part of the
Android 1 program just like the rest of
HM these new devices that means that
it's you know basic stock Android it
doesn't have any bloat where it's going
to be the first to receive security
patches and updates it doesn't have any
ugly UI on top of it that's going to be
divisive and people are gonna like you
can customize it however you like so
that helps with the performance it's
really smooth it's really quick it's
already upgraded to Android 8.1 and it's
going to be one of the first to get
Android P when that comes out so or
that's great and we know that hmd has
got a good track record of updating
their devices of pushing out those
software updates so you can rest assured
that you will get that latest experience
when you combine that with a really damn
good chipset even if it's not the latest
you do get really good performance and
so I don't think performance is going to
be an issue it's just a shame it's not
the very best out there
considering that it's competing with the
very best out there actually gaming on
this device in general is really good
that Adreno 540 GPU is more than up to
the task of playing any of the games
from the Play Store without a stutter
like I said the screens really beautiful
so consuming media is also really great
on this device and the speak is also
nice and loud of course it's just a
single speaker down the bottom no dual
front-facing speakers here but it gets
the job done and actually it's quite
good at filling a room one mark against
the performance and the experience there
unfortunately is that once again as the
seven-plus I did encounter a few strange
glitches not as bad this time around but
still worth noting so the YouTube app
for instance would often stutter with
the audio I'd have to close it and open
it again and carry on watching a video
from wherever I was likewise I had the
Google app continuously closing on me
for no reason I just had to keep
dismissing that notification and a
couple of other things like that
obviously those are Google apps but for
some reason that seems it's not playing
all that nicely with the 8 Sirocco
firmware and hopefully that be fixed
with an update but for me that's what I
experienced and there were some issues
as well with the camera app which I'll
talk about in a moment in terms of
storage you get 128 gigabytes so plenty
generous it's not expandable
unfortunately once again I think that's
down to the slim profile of the device
but with 128 gigabytes it shouldn't be
too much of a problem the battery is a
very ample 3260 milliamp hours which is
plenty for getting through a day and
especially when you combine it with that
Android one experience it's not as good
as the nokia 7 plus the standby time is
significantly lower but like I say I'll
easily get you through a day even with
moderate to heavy use you probably just
not gonna be pushing multiple days on
this device fortunately it also comes
with fast charging and wireless charging
so it's very easy and quick to top that
back up when you do finally run out of
juice and that brings us to the camera
which these days of course is one of the
most important deciding factors when it
comes to choosing a device and remember
once again this is a 699 pound device
we're competing with the big flagships
on the market so can this compete with
the likes of the pixel to the galaxy s 9
etc that while a p20 pro the short
answer to that is no unfortunately the
primary shooter on this is a 12
megapixel lens with an F
1.75 aperture and the same sensor found
on the pixel 2 with 1.4 micron pixels
this is then backed up by a 13 megapixel
telephoto lens capable of 2 times
lossless optical zoom and that one has
an F 2.6 aperture because it's got two
lenses there it's capable of doing the
bokeh effect the portrait mode and the
app gives you a promo so you've got
control over things like aperture
shutter speed white balance etc so in
theory on paper it all sounds very good
it's got a high megapixel count it's got
a great sensor in there jool lenses and
great controls but for some reason to me
the results just aren't up there with
the very best in class it just seems to
me that when you take a photo with the
s9 or with the pixel it looks that
little bit crisper that little bit more
vibrant as compared with what you get
from this and whether that's down to
image processing or the hardware
these are Zeiss branded by the way the
lenses meaning that they should be
fine-tuned by someone who knows what
they're doing but there's just something
missing just that extra X Factor that
was talking about earlier you can get
some great performance from it if you're
patient and if you have the right
conditions actually the F 1.75 aperture
is a big plus for me because I love
doing those shallow depth of field
effect photos and we combine it with the
saturation which is actually really good
as well you get some quite artistic
looking photos just only in the right
circumstances or if you're willing to
put in the work with that Pro Mode
unfortunate as I mentioned earlier
though there are some problems I
encountered with the camera app and in
particular I struggled with the Baka
mode getting that to work in fact it
probably didn't work more often than it
did work so I'd open up the camera I'd
select bakka mode and I'd point it up
the subject it would say depth success
so you'd assume from that that
everything's working hunky-dory but then
I did not see any blurring around the
background in the live preview when I
took a photo I also wouldn't see any
blurring that's if I could even open the
photo cuz very often they'd been open
the photo it would crash or something
just nothing would happen I'd tap the
photo it wouldn't open and then it was
closed out of the afterwards weirdly
switch into video mode then I'd go into
the gallery and the photo would be
nowhere to be found also I could only
take one photo like this so that's
that's a big problem really and
hopefully again it'll be fixed with soft
rap dates and that's why I don't let
these things bring the score down when
I'm reviewing something too much because
hopefully they'll be fixed and
especially because hmd does have a good
track record in that regard but it's a
bit concerning it's a shame that out of
the box it's not working the way it
should and especially when it's such an
expensive device and it leads me to
think that HMV grayble needs to do some
work on the software side of things
because the hardware is all really good
and they're just not getting the most
out of it that seems to be what's going
on with the camera in general in fact
and I don't think that this is just a
glitch with my unit because I have the
seven plus and I reviewed that and I
discussed many very similar issues with
that one so when you combine these
factors it seems likely to me that the
software is somehow letting the side
down a little bit and hopefully that
will improve especially considering it
on Android one you'd expect the software
to be really good when it comes to the
front facing camera unfortunate it's a
bit more bad news it's only a five
megapixel sensor which is a considerable
downgrade from not only the Nokia eight
the predecessor to the nokia rate
Sirocco but also the Nokia seven plus
which has a 16 megapixel front facing
camera it's got a nice wide angle seems
to get a lot of people in images do look
really crisp actually and the Baka
feature works a lot better on the
front-facing camera than it does on the
rear camera at the moment so it's not
you know it's not terrible it's just not
perfect the rear camera is capable of a
video up to 4k at 30fps the front-facing
camera is capable of 1080p these are
perfectly serviceable they're what you'd
expect but of course there's no optical
image stabilization it seems so that's
one downside on that what the video does
have going for it is the three
microphones built into the device which
is supposed to give you 3d spatial audio
and that's a really nice feature it does
seem to work well for my tests and it's
something I'd like to see in more
devices actually the both II feature
also makes a comeback this is hm these
much-touted the ability to film or take
photos from the front and rear cameras
at the same time not quite the
groundbreaking feature that they have
you believe it's very easy to mimic and
I did say that I don't think it's really
got all that much practical benefit
however to be fair I've actually found
myself using it a little bit and in fact
when making videos on Instagram for you
guys I have been
using that both me mode in order to film
the device I'm talking about and myself
at the same time so credit where
credit's due it does have its uses and
actually I'll miss it when it's gone
on the 7 plus I didn't like the both
feature because I did a long vlog and
the audio got out of sync on the 8
Sirocco no such issued so far touchwood
so I guess again that comes down to the
better hardware I guess you can think of
the camera a lot like that Snapdragon
835 chipset there's nothing wrong with
it
it's a great performer in fact it's very
superior to an awful lot of what's on
the market it's just that it's not the
very best and when you consider the
price point and you consider the way
that this device is positioning itself
you'd be reasonable in expecting this to
compete with the very best out there and
it just doesn't quite it's perfectly
good it's just lacking that X Factor but
that's the camera that's the performance
and the design work are safe from me has
that X Factor it's actually not
practical really and that's why for a
lot of people I don't think that that
beautiful design is gonna outweigh the
drawbacks the downsides that I've just
discussed however if like me you pick it
up and you just fall in love with it
which could happen then you might find
that this is the device for you so I'm
gonna say it's a good device I do
recommend it it's really well made it is
different which I like it's got a lot of
great features it performs really well
Android one is a huge bonus
however it's not for everyone and it's
not the most powerful of best performer
for the price and it does have some
practical drawbacks it's not a home run
but it is a very good phone and
hopefully you're not get your 8 Sirocco
2 or whatever the heck HMV is gonna call
the next one of these will be that
amazing return to form that this so
almost was so I found this video useful
interesting guys if you did then please
leave a like please share it around that
