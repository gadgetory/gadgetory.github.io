Hindy the android authority app guide
we're reaching the end of June and that
means it's time to take a look at the
best apps that were released this month
first up this month is angry birds epic
yes I know it's an angry birds game and
many of you are tired of Romeo's cash
cow however the game has actually
garnered very favorable reviews so far
even from people i know who generally
dislike rovio in-app purchases and angry
birds it's an RPG that's free to play
with in-app purchases that do fall into
the realm of reasonable if you're an RPG
fan why not check it out boom beach is a
strategy game from supercell who you may
know as the developers of clash of clans
boom beach utilizes a lot of the same
elements of clash of clans that features
a longer campaign different battle
tactics and a more modern approach in
terms of armaments and troops it's also
free and it was a hit game on iOS
unfortunately our next item is only for
phones that run cyanogenmod 11 which are
pretty much you root users out there and
those rockin the one plus one is the
cyanogenmod theme showcase app and what
it does is allow you to mix and match
various theme elements to create a more
personalized experience it's really fun
to use and once there are more themes
made for it those rocking cm will have a
truly awesome choice in terms of you I
theming next up is the official AOSP
email app this was released so the
Google can update the application
without administering a system update
and it's always a good decision to do
that unfortunately you'll have to have a
phone running stock Android such as a
Nexus device or a google play experience
device but other than that it's free to
download whenever you want Google slides
was released right after Google i/o and
what that completes the trio that makes
up the Google office suite if you're an
avid user of Google Drive you'll need to
get this to view and edit presentations
along with Google Docs and Google sheets
for documents and spreadsheets
respectively it's free it looks really
good and if you use drive you'll
probably need to use it eventually
anyway lifetime alarm clock is another
application that was released and much
like timely it's a unique look at the
alarm clock it has a pretty fun design
it looks nice and it also has features
like battery life saving weight
challenges to make sure you're actually
up and more features you'd expect out of
an alarm clock it's great
nice and if you're tired of your current
alarm give this one a shot after all
it's free next up is terrain home and
Samsung actually had a small hand in the
making of this launcher it's invader
right now for those in the United States
only but it does have the potential to
be a pretty fun little launcher it
focuses on contextual content and
simplification it may take a few updates
to work out some of the bigger bugs but
most people believe it has a lot of
potential also it's free last up this
month is yeah who's a v8 launcher it's
been around for a while but it's
officially left beta and you don't need
an invite code to use it anymore a lot
of people like this launcher for its
simplicity and the official release also
includes a few new features for things
like contacts calendar and alarm it's
free and it's pretty nice and it
supports icon packs so why not check it
