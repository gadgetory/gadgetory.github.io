or you're looking to give one away as a
gift this holiday season either way you
just got your Nexus 7 and you are loving
it but there might be some things about
your new tablet that you don't know
about yet that's where we come in I'm
Josh Rimer car for Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is my
top 7 tips and tricks for the Nexus 7
the Nexus 7 is gearing up to be one of
the most popular devices this holiday
season
it comes in 8 16 or 32 gigabyte
varieties has very sleek looks and packs
loads of functionality underneath but
you don't have to stop there
here are some ways of enhancing your
experience on the Nexus 7 so let's jump
in with our first tip make your Nexus 7
stay still the Nexus 7 is a perfect size
for just about any type of viewing given
its location this should be one of the
more obvious features of your new tablet
the screen rotate lock found easily in
the notification drop-down this little
button locks the current orientation of
your Nexus 7 until otherwise hid this
comes in handy if you want the larger
landscape view for viewing images
websites or even movies or of course you
just want your display to stay put
which brings me to my second tip
capturing your screen one of the more
obscure features of the Nexus 7 is its
ability to capture whatever's on screen
just hold down the power and volume down
buttons and eventually a flash will
appear on your screen in the
notification drop down you will see a
message stating that your screen shot
has been saved this is one of my
favorite tricks on the Nexus 7 because
it is a great way to quickly save
information you might not be able to
save easily otherwise here's an example
viewing the spreadsheet on the browser
is nice but I'd like an actual copy it
isn't easy or fast to find the way to
save it so I'll just take a screenshot
instead after that I can view the
resulting image and use that instead
easy stuff
next trick will allow you to get pretty
creative when you take back your camera
the 1.2 megapixel camera built into the
front of the Nexus 7 is a welcome
feature for video calls and Google
Hangouts but why not be able to use it
all the time an app in the Play Store
can easily fix that the camera launcher
adds a shortcut much like any other one
found on an Android device just hit the
launcher and you can use your camera to
take silly pictures of yourself and your
friends somehow I don't think this
picture is going to make it into
Instagram anytime soon now this one's a
really important one pumping up your
volume let's face it speakers on devices
like these aren't usually very great
they might provide enough punch for
people in a quiet room but an extra
boost is always welcome luckily there
are enhancement apps in the Play Store
that allow for a ramped up and volume
one of them aptly named it's volume plus
a built-in speaker booster will give you
that
oomph you might need in a pinch or you
can be like me and circumvent the
built-in speaker altogether by buying an
external one this one by Logitech the
logitech wireless boombox is a great
addition to your tablet will hold in
order to sync our Bluetooth device is
our power switch now here's a great way
of enhancing your experience on the
Nexus 7 investing in a good keyboard
typing on the Nexus 7 can sometimes be a
challenge as it is bigger than a phone
but smaller than 10-inch tablets like
the Galaxy Tab or the iPad putting the
device down and doing two finger typing
like this might work but it doesn't
quite feel as natural as typing on a
real keyboard for the most part you
might end up typing like this using your
thumbs and treating the Nexus 7 like a
phone given its size this is actually
much more comfortable for an even better
typing experience you can just replace
the keyboard all together this is one
good example and it's called swipe it's
one of the most popular and
keyboards today you just use your finger
to swipe around the letters that you
want to get the word that you need swipe
can be found at beta swipe calm this
one's my favorite
it's called key monk basically it takes
the ideas of thumb typing and swipe and
combines them together you can use both
your thumbs to swipe around the letters
that you want in order to get the words
that you need quickly and easily
it actually makes typing not only faster
but actually a lot more fun Kamin can be
found in the Play Store for free and
five dollar versions
here's one thing people should know
about the Nexus 7 and pretty much any
Android device let's expand the Nexus 7
horizons does the lack of space got you
down you can't squeeze out that last bit
of your Nexus 7 8 or 16 gigabytes for
that one movie episode or song that you
really want to enjoy there's actually a
solution for that there are small
adapters that look like this and are
called OTG or on-the-go cables and they
allow for the connection of USB devices
to your tablet just connect the
appropriate ends and then connect your
USB storage device to your Nexus 7
through the adapter this works best with
flash drives you can then get an app
like the nexus media importer to stream
your media straight from the drive or
even save it onto your tablet if you
have the space now you have all the
expandable memory you can possibly want
the nexus media importer is a great tool
for non-rooted devices however if your
device happens to be rooted you can
definitely find apps inside of the Play
Store that allow you to not only read
what's on your thumb drives but you can
even write to them as well and now for
the final tip optimizing your Nexus 7's
lifespan all these tips and tricks may
enhance your experience with the Nexus 7
but they can only work if your tablet is
running long enough to use them you can
extend the battery life of your Nexus 7
by turning off all of the power-hungry
features for example the Wi-Fi you can
also turn off the 3G if you happen to
have that version and it will greatly
improve your battery life GPS is another
big battery sucker shut it off until you
get lost next time on top of that you
can turn off the Bluetooth bring down
the brightness of your display or change
how long it takes for your tablet to go
to sleep doing all of this will allow
you to enjoy your Nexus 7 much more for
much longer
alright so that does it for my top 7
tips and tricks for the Nexus 7 it's
hard to deny the fact that the Nexus 7
is not only a sleek looking device but
has a lot of functionality under the
hood
however the beauty of devices such as
this is that you can always expand it to
add functionality and to make things
even more fun to learn more about how to
expand your neck
