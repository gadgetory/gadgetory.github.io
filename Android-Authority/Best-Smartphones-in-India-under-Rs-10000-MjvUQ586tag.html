there let's talk about the best Android
smartphone under 10,000 rupees first up
G from xiaomi redmi 4 it's really a
shame that the ready for is difficult to
get your hands on because the device
offers a lot more than what the price
point might suggest while the specs and
features are generally what might be
considered with an affordable smartphone
the redmi 4 doesn't press in terms of
its metal build excellent fingerprint
sensor and battery life with a large
4100 million power battery able to keep
things pumping along for as long as 2
days if you're careful this device fills
a neat little niche I mean how often can
you find a large battery phone like a
4100 million power battery with a small
5 inch 720p screen that's not very
common nowadays and that means that
thing is just going to pump along a long
time I like this phone at least on paper
it would be fantastic if it didn't have
the Snapdragon 435 now it's still good
it's still decent but you won't be
playing FPS games at a high frame rate
but it's still a sweet phone for under
10 thousand rupees next up is Lenovo's
k-6 power
the Lenovo k-6 power is a good option
for its price point and one of the very
few choices in this price range that
features a full HD display now it has a
large 4,000 milliamp hour battery that
provides impressive battery life and
it's good-looking smartphone - with a
metal composite build that has great
feel in the hand the three gigabyte
version of the phone is priced at 999
rupees and there is a four gigabyte
model that's priced at ten thousand 999
rupees so let's talk about a
lesser-known option and that's the swipe
elite max the swipe elite max features a
beautiful metal and glass unibody
construction which is great to see in
the affordable category and also comes
with four gigabytes of RAM a fingerprint
sensor and a full HD display these are
all specs and features you'd expect to
see from a much more expensive phone the
swipe elite max is currently priced at
999 rupees next up is the you
unicorn I don't make up these names Wow
along the same lines of the swipe elite
Max is the you unicorn and you also may
not know about this brand either but it
is a subsidiary of the more recognized
Micromax the device features a
good-looking metal unibody construction
with a brushed metal finish and offers
specs that are similar to the elite max
with the exception of a mediatek
processor and a larger battery under the
hood the only real negative with the
unicorn is that it uses a custom unicorn
OS but it is based on android 5.1.1
lollipop but the experience is clean and
smooth the unicorn is currently priced
at nine thousand four hundred ninety
nine rupees now an even more affordable
option is the Samsung on five pro the
Samsung on five pro doesn't offer nearly
as much as the other devices on this
list but it is one of the cheapest
options out there with the exception of
the xiaomi redmi four which features the
same specs but is a thousand rupees less
expensive however where Samsung rules
the day is when it comes to name
recognition at some may not be
comfortable spending their money on a
relatively unknown brand like swipe or
you the Samsung online pro is priced at
seven thousand nine hundred ninety
rupees and last up let's talk the Moto
III power like the Samsung on five pro
the Moto e three power doesn't offer a
whole lot when compared to the other
smartphones on this list and it is
mainly banking on name recognition
however the Moto e 3 power does feature
a large battery that provides impressive
battery life and since it is a Motorola
device you can expect the same software
experience to be smooth and fast despite
the low end processing package the Moto
e 3 power is currently priced at seven
thousand four hundred and ninety nine
rupees so what do you guys think of our
list
do you have these devices what do you
think of them let me know in the
comments below or on Twitter verse right
there and before you ask yes if you
don't know yes I lived in India for a
while I lived near Pune on a hill
station I worked there for about half a
year and I miss it still today talk to
