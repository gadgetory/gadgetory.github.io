day that Samsung will reveal the Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 we also know now or very
likely that the s-pen will have
Bluetooth a dive into an FCC test report
shows that the S Pen Stylus on the
Galaxy Note 9 will be juiced up via the
phablet itself this presumably means
that the stylus is charged via the s-pen
slot rather than an annoying cable the
regulator filing also notes that the
s-pen can enter charging mode when the
phone is wirelessly charged heck this
all sounds similar to the Apple pencil
which uses Bluetooth and charges by the
iPad lightning connector Apple stylus is
rated for up to 12 hours of usage while
a 15 second charge yields 30 minutes of
use if Samsung can deliver this type of
fast charging and endurance I'm sure
that Note fans will be very happy indeed
and a recap for those of you don't know
the Samsung Galaxy Note rumoured specs
are a six point three eight inch Super
AMOLED display that's 20 960 by 1440
resolution with an 1859 aspect ratio we
expect the snapdragon 845 or the Exynos
98 10 depending on where you live six or
eight gigabytes of ram up to 512
gigabytes of storage yes up to 400
gigabytes via the micro SD card slot a
dual camera setup with variable aperture
and super slow-mo video at 960 frames
per second that's going to be sweet and
we also expect a 30 850 milliamp hour
battery well it turns out that the
Android tablet dream is not completely
dead because Samsung is trying to keep
that dream alive with the Samsung Galaxy
Tab s 4 based on the render that Android
headlines acquired the Galaxy Tab s 4
gets rid of the home button and might
feature a larger ten point five inch
display along with the display increase
might be a shift away from the Galaxy
Tab s 3 S 4 3 aspect ratio though the
lack of a home button leaves us without
a fingerprint sensor the Galaxy Tab s 4
might feature an iris scanner to make up
for the lack of fingerprint sensor
alternatively the tablet might feature
an under the display fingerprint sensor
but I wouldn't hold your breath on that
one that would put the price up pretty
high elsewhere the back features Samsung
branding next to the tune by AKG the
Galaxy Tab s three featured similar
branding and delivered great sound
thanks in part to their being for stereo
speakers we can expect that at a bus for
two also feature quad speakers with two
positioned on both sides of the tablet
in landscape based on previous rumors
the Galaxy Tab us four features a 13
megapixel primary camera an 8 megapixel
selfie camera snapdragon 835 chipset 4
gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of storage
a 73 hundred million power battery and
Android 8.1 re oh not much else is known
about the tablet though in a recent
visit to the FCC indicates that the
launch might be around the corner why
tablets really never took off nearly as
much as many people expected is in part
a mystery to me still I mean I know why
but quite frankly my goodness I use my
tablet more than my phone my phone is
used for phone calls when I'm at home
and when I leave when I go out and I'm
on the road I take my phone with me and
that's my primary thing but when I am
home the tablet goes with me everywhere
how many of you would buy a Samsung Tab
s four tablet let me know in the
comments below I wouldn't because I'm
looking for something Supan premium and
there's not a lot of good Android tablet
apps I mean it's the same old story but
man god still hurts a little you know
