remember that my first phone review was
of the lg optimus G not only do I have
fond memories of it because of that very
reason it was also a pretty solid phone
and then LG changed the game with the g2
by putting the button layout on the back
and again despite the glossy plastic
everyone pretty much agreed that it was
a solid phone and now we have the third
iteration in the LG g3 which again tries
to change the game this time by sporting
a 2k screen so does it live up to the
hype and is the third time the charm for
LG well let's find out because it's Josh
Booher from Android authority and this
is the LG g3 let's take a moment real
quick and either a plot or lament LG for
basically tricking us on the material
all the renders looks like a metal
finish but in reality it was always
going to be plastic don't get it twisted
though that plastic has been treated to
provide that brush design and it is only
one aspect to a overall a very
attractive device you can't talk about
the g3 without talking about that screen
but before we get to the display quality
the bezels should be equally as
applauded for being so thin you'll
pretty much get nothing else but screen
there and it makes for a device that is
simultaneously minimal and large due to
that 5.5 inch display now the sides
literally have nothing to them and why
because that rear button layout returns
once again in this third iteration I
remember having some reservations after
seeing the renders because it looked
like they were going for an overly
alveolar shape to pretty much every
button on there but in the end when
especially when you look at it in person
it looks very nice and blends in
beautifully with the overall design
aspect of this phone they are very meaty
and have a very satisfying click to them
far louder than the ones found on the lg
g2 and of course integrated into the
button layout is the camera unit flanked
by the flash diode and the new laser
focusing system the headphone jack and
the microUSB charging port are both on
the bottom while an antenna in this
Korean Edition comes out of the top
corner with us return to the back cover
made of a high-quality polycarbonate
that has been treated to have a brushed
look it's as if LG knew to go for the
best of both worlds the attractive brush
bill removes the issue of fingerprints
but keeping things plastic allows for a
removable cover even if it is supposed
to be tempered however it is far from
impervious from the occasional scratch
and ding access underneath the cover
gets you the replaceable battery and the
micro SD card slot even with that large
screen reaching the other side of the
display is almost shockingly easy and
with an overall size that comes in
smaller than most other 5.5 inch screen
devices easily keeping a grip on the LG
g3 is to me the marquee feature in
design and obviously the other marquee
feature is the display coming in at 5.5
inches this behemoth of a screen is as
I've already stated surprisingly easy to
handle but the resolution of 2560 by
1440 resolution and the pixel density of
534 pixels per inch make for an
experience unlike any other in a
smartphone that's not to say that a
higher resolution is really leaps and
bounds better than 1080p displays though
the bump up is noticeable when you're
really looking for it in comparison to
them as a master of panels LG puts in
the high quality IPS screen with the
pleasing color production that keeps
from being oversaturated while remaining
pretty easy on the eyes some extra
processing happens behind the scenes too
as LG has catered the screens to
selectively lower performance in certain
situations and spots to help with
battery life it's a feature that I did
end up noticing in one main instance
scrolling through basically any
text-based application like google play
music playlists or reddit lists
basically any place where I noticed that
the text did look somewhat less than
stellar it may be hard to reproduce
through the lens that you're seeing here
but it's something I noticed and due to
the gray battery life of the g3 I
ultimately appreciate it in the end you
have a display on the LG g3 that is for
the most part one of a kind especially
considering that this is the only phone
that will be widely available currently
with this kind of screen and it happens
to be a damn good performer now powering
the large screen is the Snapdragon 801
our current reigning king of processing
packages with 2.5 gigahertz of speed on
top the Drina 330 and in this case three
gigabytes of RAM this is a package we've
seen time and again by now and its power
should be without question long periods
of playing in justice brought few issues
and the only other place I noticed
slowdown was in the recent apps screen
but it has
to do with how the screen is structured
than the actual loading times of the
apps browsing Google now and subsequent
websites was also a breeze as was using
GPS and navigation which I will admit
was a big issue of mine in the g2 so
retaining good speed throughout in a
large high-resolution display is always
noticeable and in the LG g3 it certainly
does not disappoint in either work or
play what as last year's flagship
devices all took liberties with the
extra features added in we have a return
of some of the fundamentals in this
year's phones and the LG g3 is no
exception the biggest change from the
previous iteration is the inclusion of a
removable back cover that gives you
access to the battery and also the
microSD card slot and while there is
going to be an antenna in this version
of the Korean phone and pretty much
nowhere else you do also have all of the
connectivity options that you need
available including NFC and of course an
IR blaster for controlling your TVs
despite using an international version
of the phone I was thankfully able to
still access LTE networks on AT&amp;amp;T though
we can't expect this phone to make it to
all the major carriers in the States
when it does come out call quality was a
bright spot here as clarity was had in
either direction of the call but in some
instances I actually had to turn down
the speaker volume because it can get
pretty loud and the same can somewhat be
said for the rear-facing speaker which
gets very loud despite having the same
limitations of small grill speakers on
the back pretty tinny and it's not
particularly rich all around and finally
we have the battery which has a pretty
standard capacity of 3000 milliamp hours
considering the overall size of the
phone while the higher resolution screen
could mean trouble for power that
actually was pretty far from the truth
as battery life was simply great one day
in particular of usage included moderate
to very heavy usage in spurts and I did
notice that the very good standby time
helped the phone endure in the downtime
what ended up happening is I've blasted
past that 12 hour mark with plenty of
battery life left and that whole day
included long spurts of gaming quite a
bit of music playing and then of course
some camera usage speaking of the camera
we can pretty safely say that LG has
brought everything they possibly can to
their latest and greatest foe 13
megapixels are further powered by OS
plus even more superior version of
the cool image stabilization recently
found on the LG G pro 2 as we start with
the app what is striking is it starts
out with the most minimalistic interface
ever just tap to focus and shoot it is
when you hit the loan menu button that
all the elements fall into place where
there once was a slew of different modes
available you now have a few key ones
panorama magic focus and dual dual shot
works the way you would expect giving
you a picture and picture photo using
both cameras and panorama is familiar
and pretty simple to use auto mode is
what you'll use most of all as you are
not able to change many settings at all
leaving the phone to effectively cater
the shot itself but it does manage to do
a good job especially with the laser
based focusing system the marquee
feature of this camera is how fast it
goes from prone to focus to capture
because of it as such taking pictures
with this camera proves to be one of the
most enjoyable experiences in this
year's flagships so it's even better
than the picture quality holds up my
camera shootout showed that consistently
great photos are possible with the g3
with only the low land performance
providing the real big hole pictures are
generally nice and detailed though the
noise reduction does make for too much
softness in some photos color production
isn't bad at all though many of the
photos taken a warmer overall tone which
is something I personally like but I can
see people nitpicking on and in
low-light the noise really makes itself
prevalent making it clear that os+
isn't just a magic pill and the flash
will be necessary from time to time
stabilization helped with video as well
which was also quite good 4k recording
was easy and went along with little
incident though it is possible to
overload the processing with too much
movements as you can see in this shot of
the waves crashing on the shores of
Corona del Mar while saying a phone has
the best camera is highly subjective we
can pretty safely say this though this
is the best camera experience that LG
has thus far achieved now refinements on
the outside have more or less been put
into the software experience which has
been streamlined itself to have a
flatter look all around and to better
hide the elements that used to clutter
the interface in general shades of the
previous GUI iterations are here but key
elements like circles in the
notification drop-down and a better put
together Settings menu look great
previous LG features like the Q slide
apps are definitely here hit
behind a shade activated by a quick
Settings button and even the brightness
and volume toggles can be hidden for an
even cleaner drop-down customization has
always been LG's Forte over other OEM
interfaces and it continues with aspects
like even changing the soft key layout
LG tends to try too hard with its
interface really shoving its abilities
in your face but this time around
they're mostly easy on the eyes and
useful like the call and text pop-ups
that proved very helpful so the main
additions are in the smart software
ranging from quite useful to only
somewhat smart keyboard brings the
ability to shrink or elongate the
keyboard for easier typing smart cleaner
while we won't yet see its
recommendations for apps not used in
over a month for obvious reasons
monitors the temporary files at the very
least that can be deleted to save space
and finally we have the smart notice
which amounted to little more than a
nicely worded weather report right under
an already functioning weather widget
and it simply needs to be expanded in
order to become more useful as has
become the trend with plenty of other
aspects of this phone the software is
yet another example that LG has achieved
the best in this the third iteration of
their flagship smartphone while we don't
yet have a full handle on the unlocked
device price for the LG g3
we can't expect the phone to come to
major carriers for the premium prices on
their contracts this basically puts the
g3 up against every major flagship phone
that has already been released this year
and while we will be doing full
comparisons with them to find out how
the LG flagship fares we will say this a
larger screen on a more or less
conventionally sized body
high-resolution power and a good shooter
on the back make this package hard to
resist and so there you have it the LG
g3 as I've said multiple times already
in this review it's not hard to see that
the g3 shows the best LG has to offer
high resolution screen might not make
for an ultimately different experience
over the already available 1080p screens
but there is so much else offered in the
g3 that makes it compelling a good
camera that is faster than most shooters
in its class performance that is where
anyone would need it to be and despite
its larger screen this one's battery
life that is not just on par but it's
capable of going beyond not to mention a
great suite of first-party accessories
on the way if there was ever a time to
buy into the LG ecosystem
great smartphone certainly deserves the
title of flagship to light your way does
it outshine the other flagships already
available well that is up to you and
what you want but the g3 tries to offer
more than the rest and in a number of
ways it succeeds allowing you to receive
our newly established Editors Choice
Award only given to the top crop of
smartphones of which the LG g3 certainly
belongs near the top of that list it
looks like the third time was the charm
for LG as the evolution of the G line of
flagship smartphones certainly has
reached its peak thus far in the LG g3
as always thank you guys very much for
watching and hope you enjoyed this
review of the LG g3 while we do have a
great slew of smart phones here this
year the LG g3 is the newest of the
bunch and you know what it happened to
be one of the most fun devices that I
had while using it on the daily so keep
it tuned to Android authority for future
coverage of the LG g3 including all of
the comparisons we're going to do
between it and those other flagship
devices also stay tuned for more
coverage from my colleagues in Android
