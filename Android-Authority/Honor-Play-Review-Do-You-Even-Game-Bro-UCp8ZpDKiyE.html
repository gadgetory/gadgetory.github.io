for it but it seems that gaming phones
are now a thing we have the razor phone
we have the ROG phone and now we have
beyond a play but whereas those two
devices were quite premium expensive
high performance devices the honor play
is a gaming phone that's aimed at a
slightly more budget-friendly audience
so the question is though can it still
game
I'm Adam Snitsky and in this on a play
review we'll be finding out GPU turbo is
what honor is calling a set of firmware
customizations that aim to enhance
performance and frame rates delivered by
the Kiran 970 processor during gaming
we're also bringing a 4d experience via
smart Rumble support and this device
will acts as a kind of reference
hardware for that concept on the claims
that gamers can expect to enjoy a 60%
increase in GPU efficiency and a 30%
reduction in single frame CPU energy
consumption thanks to this technology to
this end you should be able to enjoy
smoother frame rates on higher graphical
settings GPU turbo also claims to reduce
power consumption during gaming by 15%
providing a solution to one of the
biggest challenges of gaming on mobile
this is also helped along by very
generous 3,750 million power battery
otherwise it's a fairly standard affair
the UK variant comes with four gigabytes
of RAM though a six gigabyte model is
available elsewhere and 64 gigabytes of
storage which is expandable by up to 256
gigabytes the screen is a 6.3 inch full
HD plus IPS LCD display with a 19 point
5 by 9 aspect ratio and that takes up
89% of the front of the device there's a
notch which will be off-putting to some
but that can be turned off in the
settings camera wise you get a 16
megapixel rear shooter backed up by a
secondary 2 megapixel lens for bouquet
effects and a 16 megapixel camera around
the front there's a headphone jack a
very quick fingerprint sensor around the
back and USB type-c down the bottom no
IP rating the honor play will ship with
Android 8.1 and anyway 8.2 on top of
that that unfortunately means you get
all the usual bloatware and ugly
aesthetics that the skin is named for
but hey ho you can hide most of that
with customizations
gone is the Aurora glass found on the
honor tenant code and instead you get a
map to the unibody metal design which
honor says was chosen to improve
I like the way it looks it feels pretty
premium actually but I have found that
the back panel scratches fairly easily
it's available in blue and black here in
the UK you can also get a play Edition
version in either black or red from the
website that brings more of a gaming a
static okay so that's the honor play on
paper but what is it actually likes a
game with can you expect to see improved
performance over non-gaming phones at
this price so in theory the ki-rin 970
SOC is already a flagship chipset it's
the same one that's found in the wild
way p20 pro and it's the one found in
all of honor and Huawei's flagship
devices it's more equivalent to these
Snapdragon 835 than the 845 however and
it's due a generational update one thing
to keep in mind as I have found in
testing the honor 10 and other devices
that on the phones seem to underperform
in benchmark tests and it's probably
translates the gaming as well so you
might be getting a boost that just
brings you back up to normal
lack of software optimization or bloat
whatever it is it left me with
relatively low expectations for the play
in terms of gaming but I'm very happy to
report that in geek convention and to
two scores to play mash to perform
around the same pace as a Galaxy Note 8
that puts it way ahead of the honor tens
original scores and when actually
playing games this performance is felt
frame rates are stable even with
graphics turned up and it all looks
great
unfortunately it couldn't quite manage
my own personal benchmark emulating
GameCube games but it came surprisingly
close I was actually very surprised by
this actually and GPU turbo should
affect anything that uses your phone's
GPU just keep in mind that only pub G
and mobile legends are actively
optimized for the feature meaning that
you won't get things like the rumble
effect with other games that said I
didn't really notice it whilst playing
pub G anyways and there are more
software tricks that also aim to improve
the gaming experience you can disable
the navigation buttons to prevent
accidentally exiting to the home screen
for instance and easily record gameplay
snippets with the shortcut tools keep in
mind that these features are also
available on older honor phones though
and GPU turbo has already landed on a
few via an OTA update the large screen
is unique to the play though and it's
immersive for gaming but I would have
liked to have been able to turn the
brightness up a little I was also
surprised at the choice to go with such
a glossy screen which doesn't make much
sense for a gaming device combined with
a relatively low brightness this led to
a case
no issues with daylight visibility this
was also a problem during general use
such as when browsing the web the UK
variant doesn't come with the
professional gaming screen protector
that honor claims can help to alleviate
glare and also the stress felt on the
fingers when gaming or diddums the Wi-Fi
radio could also be a bit stronger which
might become an issue if you plan on
using steam link that actually kept
crashing out for me when I try to use it
anyway but keep in mind that the app is
very much in the early stages still it
runs much better on samsung devices and
those have fantastic Wi-Fi reception
that's one of the subtle benefits you
can get by buying a more expensive
device the lack of dual front-facing
speakers is also a bit of a
disappointment on a gaming phone honest
says that the honor play has a 3d sound
field available via 7.1 channel hist an
audio and that should provide more
realistic sound effects by our
headphones or the speaker I don't know
about that but I can say that the sound
quality here is decent and actually
better than many other devices with a
similar setup overall then this thing
can gain and for the money it games
really well it's not going to compete
with other gaming phones or flagship
devices but it's well suited to the job
as a mid-range handset and performance
is great elsewhere to your honour play
powers through Android really well even
with the break that comes from UI I've
experienced one or two bugs on occasion
but these were rare and in terms of
sheer performance it's pretty great with
no complaints the camera is also
precisely what I've come to expect from
on our phones and has all of the fun
features that make these really good
shooters to play around with including
my absolute favorite star tracking and
light painting modes and Pro Mode AR
effects etc the actual camera
performance is somewhat
middle-of-the-road though not in the so
average it's not worth talking about way
but in the this has so many strengths
and so many weaknesses
I don't know what to think about it way
there are all those options and features
in the camera which I really enjoy 16
megapixels is a decent amount of
resolution especially for the
front-facing camera but then photos have
a tendency to come out really warm for
some reason giving a lot of scenes a
kind of orangey tint almost and then
there's AI scene recognition you know
the story by now is supposed to be able
to detect whether you're pointing your
camera a person a cake or a cloudy sky
and then older things like saturation
exposure shutter speed etc to give you
the perfect shot
it'll also turn on the portrait mode
automatically when pointing a human
subject I thought this was something of
a gimmick at first but it has improved
with each update on the honor 10 and as
a result I managed to get
great photos with it imagine the same
will be true here the aperture is f 2.0
and there's no optical stabilization
only a is I guess the thing about these
cameras is that they're fun and they can
pull off some incredible photos but
they're also not terribly reliable
they're still good going for a gaming
phone though and finally when it comes
to the day to day experience it's also
worth mentioning that 3750 milliamp hour
battery again because it really is good
and at the end of a full day of pretty
intense usage I'd have 15% of my battery
left gsm battery monitor calculated an
average of nine hours screen on time and
that's a big win for a gaming phone but
also for those power users out there oh
and call quality was perfectly good too
now drop calls and my voice carried
through loud and clear so to conclude
I've really enjoyed my time with you on
a play more than I expected to in fact
like other mid-range honor devices you
get a lot of bang for your buck and a
surprising number of high-end features
and specs only this time the real-world
performance lives up to the specs on
paper it's well-made it's fast and it
lasts forever the performance doesn't
quite compete with top-end flagships
despite honest claims and things like
dual facing speakers and stronger Wi-Fi
are missed but it's still great for
gaming and can handle whatever you throw
at it
so I'd say honor was achieved what it
set out to hear and what's more is that
a lot of those gaming centric design
choices also carry over for an excellent
day-to-day experience so thanks a ton
for watching guys hope thanks video
useful and interesting if you did then
please leave likely around that
helps us out immensely comment down
