by bitdefender mobile security it starts
like over here with android authority
we're here with mr. John Heinlein he's
vice president of corporate marketing
and we're just going to do a quick
interview on the great things that arm
is doing thanks nice to meet you need
you to write so you know at the show
today and we're talking about expanding
the mobile experience we see that you
know arms strong presence in mobile
that's been well established is going to
expand as we go into the future in three
key areas first if you look today there
around two billion installed based
smartphones in the world out of a total
of around six billion mobile phone
subscribers in the world so that means
around four billion of these of the
subscribers are on feature phones or
maybe voice only phones so even though
there's two billion in the market which
is great there's a huge opportunity to
expand smartphone capabilities into
broader market and so we can talk a bit
more about the diversity of bringing
different price points with mid-range
and low-end smartphones into that
broader market second we're expanding
the mobile experience away from just the
smartphone two things that work around
the smartphone obviously the app
infrastructure is what's made smartphone
so exciting but we're also seeing an
emergence and across the show categories
like of course wearables in fitness but
also many other kinds of accessories
that extend the smartphone experience
beyond just apps we often talk about it
as kind of hardware app extensions and
we're seeing entirely new categories
being created as a result and that's
been exciting a couple years ago you
wouldn't have seen Fitness wearables
those kind of things at Mobile World
Congress and we're seeing a rapid trend
to add those and third a little bit less
relevant for this show but still very
important for the market is we're taking
mobile technologies that we've
established energy efficiency but
bringing those technologies to the data
center cloud infrastructure for
efficiency we're seeing people able to
install for example storage servers
based on arm and get double the density
compared to conventional storage
infrastructure and and that's just the
beginning on that on the server and
cloud infrastructure and so right now
what sort of percentages server
infrastructure from in terms of
this is just a very very beginning we're
seeing just the very first of solutions
based on 32 bits arm-based processors
but now we're starting to get the first
64-bit solutions coming to the
marketplace so we're not only it's not
just the camels nose we're just seeing
the camels not camels nostril but
there's a lot more camel behind it and
we're working to develop that let's talk
about a Qualcomm mediatek and you know
other talk to your partners that you
work with on a closer basis sure well
you know at Mobile World Congress it's
so exciting because you walk the show
floor the entire show is based on arm
technology and media tag could talk this
week about rolling out some new
processors based on cortex 8017 and a
processor coming later in the year at
processor based on cortex a53 in a
64-bit ARM v8's based platform and we're
seeing a number of vendors that have arm
v8 platforms in the marketplace so it's
very exciting and what's also exciting
about v8 is that those vendors that are
adopting it get the full benefit of a
hunt percent backwards compatibility to
all the millions of arm 32-bit
applications in the world and then a
future proofing to 64-bit as that
develops also v8 is not just about 64
bit better also adds hardware
virtualization cryptography extensions
better micro architectural performance
so we're seeing tons of innovations come
as people move to our v8 thanks I know
if you were to say there would be one
thing you'd be most excited about 5-10
years down the line could you speak to
that a little bit i think the
democratization of access to information
via smartphones is incredible because
today if you think about it you know in
developing countries and and even BRIC
countries which are developed but
perhaps one notch behind some of the
developed countries the penetration of
smartphones is very low in some cases
it's nine percent twenty percent even
the higher end is forty percent it's
very very low penetration rate so
there's tons of subscribers there and
tons of people that would get better
access to information and I think you're
going to find that in developing
countries people's first and in many
cases only access to the Internet and
information will come from smartphone
platforms so just think about the kinds
of improvements in e-commerce if you're
a farmer in Africa you know do I plant
this week would I plant next week so
that the rain doesn't wash on my seeds
away you know can you get that
information and best practices
the internet and it's probably going to
come on a smartphone welcome miss Margo
let's talk about call comb just for a
brief moment I mean if they have total
dominance you know the upper end of the
spectrum you know for the flagship phone
market LT dominance and it seems to me
that they're in a position for that to
continue is there is something that
makes them special that offers them such
a competitive advantage Qualcomm is one
of many armed partners that we we love
all of our partners and I think all of
them are bringing different innovations
Qualcomm is invested in the room a
design of the ARM architecture they also
in some cases use our our processors or
cortex processors as well so I think
there's incredible diversity of the
ecosystem and what we like to see is if
you think about big.little for example
we've been talking about arm big.little
technology the pairing of our big
processors and our little processors in
the same chip well actually you're
seeing many different choices you're
seeing people with a big for big for
little too big for little you even
seeing people with all little and people
don't understand but actually that's
using the same big little technologies
just that they chose 0 bigs and littles
it's a point on the spectrum but it uses
the same task sharing infrastructure
that big littles based on it provides
diversity of choice does arm in any way
feel threatened by Intel with what the
ringing competition is healthy we're
excited that arm partners continue to
lead the way with choices across the
marketplace today the entire show is
based on arm technology and we want to
continue to bring innovation and keep
that vibrancy for years to come I just
want to say a huge thank you John it's
been a real privilege and pleasure to be
with you thank you you're all concerned
