handy the Android authority app guy do
you like stronger mobile signal and
faster speeds I know I do so after the
intro will show you some of the best
Wi-Fi and signal boosting apps for
Android first on our list is called
Android Wi-Fi signal booster this fundal
app helps you analyze your Wi-Fi
connection and strength so you can find
a better connection while this isn't
really useful for Home applications
finding the best Wi-Fi spot in say an
airport terminal can be really useful
the app essentially lists all of the
Wi-Fi hotspots where you are you can
then go to radar view to see which ones
have the strongest connection there is a
signal booster and people say that it
works so there is that - next on our
list is an app called Network signal
speed booster this is a simple
application that takes your phone
through a few steps to help increase
your call in signal strength and when we
say this app is simple we mean it is
like really really simple here's how it
works you open the app and then you wait
that's really all there is to it the app
performs all the steps for you and even
lists them out so you know what's going
on with your device so if you're not a
technologically inclined person that
this is a great app to try one thing
these apps have in common is that
they're all pretty simple to use and
Wi-Fi 3g signal booster is no exception
aside from Wi-Fi and data signals it can
also do bluetooth if you need stronger
connections there unlike most of these
apps this one has no trouble detailing
exactly what it does to get better
signal here's how it works
you just click a button and wait a
couple of minutes and the app does what
it needs to do so again it's very simple
and easy to use process that can be
helpful for a quick fix if you need it
Wi-Fi manager isn't a boosting up on the
face of it but it does help properly
manage what Wi-Fi spots you do connect
to which could affect what speed you get
it does offer a few options that you
don't normally have like switching from
a fixed to a dynamic DHCP again this
isn't a boosting app in the traditional
sense however if you're at a place where
there are a lot of Wi-Fi hotspots
picking the one with the best signal
can't increase your speed more than
boosting a really bad connection would
the main theme of this app list is that
you have to do very little to see
results and Wi-Fi signal speed booster
fits that perfectly this app looks at
your Wi-Fi speed in real time and then
show you its potential you then click
the button to fix your Wi-Fi and it
should get a little better because this
one was so ridiculously simple and
claims significant speed boosts weak
this one is speed test in our first
result it went from seven megabits per
second download to 15 megabits per
second download or more than double the
speed however we suspected something was
fishy so we uninstalled it and ran it
again which gave us 10 megabits per
second so it actually bogs down your
Wi-Fi a little bit to make the increase
look more dramatic but it actually does
increase the speed at least a little bit
on its own if you take a look at our
leaderboard you can see how some of
these apps stack up against one another
as per the norm these ratings are based
on download numbers and Google Play
Store ratings so there is no bias on our
part these apps all essentially do the
same kind of tweaks they'll restart your
modems so you can get a cleaner
connection to a closer Tower and things
like that there are no magic powers at
work here and some may consider this
kind of stuff snake-oil since it really
doesn't do much more than your phone is
capable of doing on its own so do
understand that with apps like this this
isn't a super magic fix and as always
your mileage may vary although we try
not to there is every possibility that
we may have missed a good signal or
Wi-Fi booster app so if there's one you
really like and we didn't mention it
