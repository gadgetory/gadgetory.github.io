Android authority and one of the biggest
advantages of Android is its openness
and that openness has led to one very
unique device from ZTE what does a
portable projector running Android have
to offer and who exactly is this product
for well that's what we're here to find
out with the ZTE s pro 2 the S pro 2 is
ZTE second foray into the portable
projector space and they've made a lot
of improvements over last year's s Pro
aka the live pro on Sprint the design is
basically just a large square with
rounded corners and flat sides all
around and it measures in at about one
inch in thickness it's shaped sort of
like an Amazon fire TV but it's much
bigger due to the display on top and
obviously the projector that's housed on
the front it's mostly made of metal with
the exception of the bottom and weighs a
little over a pound but it certainly
doesn't feel heavy and if anything the
weight makes it feel very substantial
and less like a toy in comparison to
last year's model going around the rest
of the device the volume buttons can be
found on the left side and they're very
tactile very easy to press and the same
can be said about the power button up
top on the right side is a fan to keep
things cool and along the rear is where
all the i/o is located there's a
proprietary port for charging HDMI USB
3.0 port and a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and below all of that sits a micro
sim and SD card slot for additional
storage finally on the bottom are little
rubber feet to keep the projector from
sliding around a standard sized tripod
mount for mounting the projector on a
tripod obviously and a tiny kickstand if
you want to prop the device upwards the
display on top is much larger now at 5
inches and bring 720p resolution to the
table which will allow for HD content
not only on the screen itself but also
the projector it's not a super high res
or pixel dense display but on a device
like this it doesn't really need to be
if you're using the s pro 2 as a
projector or Wi-Fi hotspot you won't be
looking at the screen all that much but
it's still nice that ZTE included an HD
screen it's bright vivid with good
colors and viewing angles
so if you decide to treat it as a
miniature tablet of sorts to play games
read emails browse the web etc it'll
certainly be good enough for that it's a
little bit odd to talk about specs and
performance on a projector but ZTE did
pack some power on the s pro 2 to handle
the more standard parts of the Android
experience under the hood is a
Snapdragon 800 Adreno 330 and 2 gigs of
ram yes I know this may sound a little
bit dated but again this is a projector
first and foremost and everything else
is secondary regardless the Snapdragon
800 still performs very well here and
everything from web browsing
multitasking and intense gaming run
perfectly fine if you really want to
hammer down on this device just be aware
that certain games and apps like
hangouts and Skyforce can be a little
awkward on this device due to their
portrait orientations the s pro 2 comes
with the usual Wi-Fi Bluetooth and LTE
connectivity to not only stream content
on the go but also share the devices
connection as a Wi-Fi hotspot for up to
10 devices there's also 16 gigabytes of
built-in storage which isn't a lot for
such a media centric device but the
micro SD card slot supports up to 2
terabytes of additional storage which is
a ton of space for movies or anything
else that you'd like to store for audio
the internal speaker is located on the
bottom and it's actually plenty loud
with great clarity for a single speaker
but if you want a better audio
experience you can link up your own
headphones or speakers via bluetooth or
the headphone jack
the star of the show and the main reason
why anyone would buy this device is for
the projector there's also some custom
software made specifically for the
projector but first let's start with the
projector itself it's a DLP projector
that measures in at 200 lumens and
brightness which is double that of last
year's model and is capable of
outputting a 720p image up to a hundred
and twenty inches in screen size the
projector is pretty bright and is still
fairly easy to see in a well-lit room
but in order to take advantage of the
highest brightness setting it
unfortunately requires being plugged
into a power source the s pro 2 also
features keystoning and if you're not
familiar with that term essentially what
this means is the image will always
maintain a rectangular image even if the
projector is not perfectly horizontal
this helps prevent a trapezoid effect
that typically happens on projectors
that don't have keystoning you may have
noticed that the s pro 2 does not
feature a physical wheel or switch for
controlling focus and that's because the
focusing is all controlled through
software now by default the projector
focuses automatically within a few
seconds after you've aimed it at a wall
the autofocus works extremely well but
if you prefer manual focus you do have
that option within the projector
settings as far as projecting content
this can be done in three different ways
content can be streamed or played
locally directly from the device itself
via mere cast or connecting another
device through HDMI streaming or playing
locally stored content directly from the
projector is the easiest way as it
requires no extra wires or additional
setup to get things going but
transferring content isn't always ideal
and that's where HDMI and mirror cast
comes in the HDMI port allows laptops or
any other device that supports HDMI to
be hooked up and this is a great option
not for only just regular media but also
things like webpages and PowerPoint
presentations for business or work
purposes the last option is mirror cast
and let's list any device supporting
mirror cast to be connected like your
phone or tablet for example once
connected any content from your device
will be shown through the projector and
it actually works surprisingly well with
very little latency between the
connected device and the projector on
the software front the s pro 2 is
running Android 4.4
kitkat but instead of a stock experience
like a last year's s Pro ZTE has skinned
the Android experience for easier
navigation and a more projector friendly
interface the interface features large
tiles grids of icons and individual tabs
at the top to easily find what you're
looking for and additional tabs can be
created for any applications that you
may want to group together there's also
a floating bubble that lets you quickly
turn on the projector regardless of
whether you're in an application or on
the home screen it's extremely useful to
have especially when you find content
that you want to project at a moment's
notice
and it just makes turning on the
projector a lot quicker and easier for
the battery the s pro 2 has a rather
hefty 6300 milliamp hour battery inside
and ZTE promises three hours of
projector time and ten hours of Wi-Fi
hotspot and so far my testing has fallen
in line with those claims after
streaming a two and a half hour long
movie starting from a full charge I
would be down to anywhere between twenty
to twenty-five percent which I have no
doubts is enough to get roughly another
30 to 45 minutes of video playback and
there was even one instance where I
managed to go a little bit beyond ZTE s
3 our claim this is a big improvement of
the original s Pro which was only
capable of only two hours of projector
use at best the ZTE s pro 2 will be
available exclusively on a tee starting
on April 24th for a price of 3 $99.99 on
a two-year contract or for 99.99 if you
want to buy outright plus an additional
$10 monthly fee on att's Mobile share
value plan now the price is a little bit
steep especially for purely casual use
like movies and games it's going to be
really hard to justify but for more
business use cases like PowerPoint
presentations and slideshows and things
of that nature it could totally be worth
the investment and you can still use it
for the occasional movie or two on your
downtime there's no denying that the s
pro 2 is a niche product but for what
it's designed to do it does it all very
well and addresses many of the
weaknesses of the original s pro like
the poor battery life low resolution and
brightness output it's a simple
projector that's
also portable and powerful and if that's
exactly what you need that's exactly
what you'll get with the s pro 2 as
