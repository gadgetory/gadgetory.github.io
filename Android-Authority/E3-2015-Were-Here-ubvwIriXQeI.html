the Android centric releases and
announcements of course so you'll be
seeing a lot of probably games that
you've seen in the Play Store already

soon with the guys who made CSR racing

this is our first day all of the
announcements have been yesterday so all
of the crazy stuff that I know you guys
are all really happy to see Final
Fantasy 7 remake uncharted 4 like I'm
kind of a sony guys so I love the ps4
the ps4 announcements but everything
from like you know the new call of duty
and everything like that all that stuff
is obviously out of our scope but we're
gonna try our best to take a look at
those things as well give you our
reactions to them because tomorrow we
have a long period of time where we
could just go around the show floor and
play some games w want personally I want
that right there street fighter 4 I
wants for street fighter four of my
utter for 345 I want some street fighter
5 in my life man and I can't wait for
that I'm also trying to get a demo

which is the spiritual successor to Mega
Man but yeah it for one thing it's great
to have you guys come here to my side of
the woods to my neck of the woods down
to socal la so it's really nice to have
like the whole crew down here for an
area that I'm so familiar with that

we're having a great time here what is
it that you're really excited to be
seeing her at e3 anyway yeah I know it's
not and related but I really want to
check out project Morpheus because it
seems like one of the dopest VR
experiences out there so I really want
to be able to check that out I've seen
so many videos on it so hopefully we get
a chance to kind of play around that
and just see what it's all about we're
going to check that one already and
hopefully there's going to be a ton more
VR stuff tore me to be able to take a
look at that's the that's the stuff that
I'm really looking forward to yeah
obviously some of the stuff that might
we might say are we were really excited
about don't really pertain to Android
but Android has some pretty awesome
announcements and and VR is going to be
one of the biggest parts of that and
really it's it's really fun for us to
just kind of get together and be at a
thing like III I mean all of us who have
been gamers in the past this is
something that we've all wanted to come
to and here we are so hopefully you guys
are going to enjoy all the content that
we have it may be a little bit fringe
compared to all of the usual device
centric things that we have but
nonetheless we're gonna bring you some
really I don't hope you're noticing just
I'm enthusiastic we are to be here like
it's like we're really having once you
