by bitdefender mobile security hey de
Strasbourg our from Android 30 what's
going on everybody
and we are continuing our plethora of
feature focus videos to show you what is
new on the Samsung Galaxy s5 this time
our future focus is on the camera
alright and here we are with the Samsung
Galaxy s5 here on the left side it is
positioned in such a way so that we can
get the background there Samsung was
gracious enough to have a small display
here in order for us to really test out
the capabilities of the camera and so
there you go you saw already that it
autofocus in a very quick manner and
it's focused on those hot air balloons
that are in the display now the camera
is an ISO cell 16 megapixel shooter that
boasts just fractions of a second in
terms of the autofocus and that's
exactly what we're looking at here now I
haven't in this one display over here so
that it focuses on the air hot air
balloons there but if I were to tap on
to the other side it'll find that area
very quickly I'll tap here in order to
get it on to the hot-air balloons again
as you can see there it does focus very
quickly I will move the phone over to
this display right here and as I'm
moving it you see that it's already
focusing so quickly on to those so
that's a nice feature of the new camera
here on the samsung galaxy s5 that
allows you to really get the focus just
right very quickly as you can see from
the interface as I bring the camera back
into the middle you can see that the
interface is a little bit different as
everything is now part of a circle if we
look at the mode you still have many of
the modes that were available in the
previous iterations and including the
beauty face the shot and more so let's
take a look at these settings here
so there you go there's so much to this
camera now that allows you to do a lot
to really tweak the various settings on
your pictures to really get the picture
that you want of course we have the
picture size at the full 16 megapixel
count and from there there are a bunch
of different modes and different tweaks
including stabilization which actually
is not optical but it does help in terms
of getting the right picture for you
without your shaky hands first shot face
detection
you also have metering modes that are
you know these are all settings that you
normally see on a full DSLR camera but
the one that I'm going to show you right
now is the selective focus now this is
the one that you saw in the previous
video and the processing time does take
a while after you take the picture when
you're using selective focus and this is
where we're going to show it I'm going
to bring it over just a little bit so I
can really get just an inner shot right
here alright so we're going to focus on
just one portion right now or just go
focus on here and then I'm going to go
ahead and take the picture
you hold the device steady while taking
the picture and then it will process for
a while because essentially what it's
doing is it's taking the focus different
shots of the focus in various portions
of the depth of fields you have the
display in the back and also the display
up front and we're going to see exactly
how that turned out all right now here
is the shot and now as you can see with
the lower aperture of the camera itself
you'll see that the back has a little
bit of blurriness to it that's the depth
of field effect that you get with the
full op camera however now that you have
a selective focus on you see how clear
this front one is we're going to see if
we can get the back cleared up as well
we have the near focus here but if I hit
far focus it will show the shots with
the far focus on instead you see how
clear that became and if we wanted to do
a pan focus it would be able to modify
the picture in order that everything is
in focus it's just a very very nice way
of just getting a selective focus in
your photos that some people would
really love to use that for something
like let's say Instagram there's a near
focus the for focus and the pan
so let's turn off the Selective focus
we're back to the full auto and if I
head back to the settings we will find
HDR right here
so now HDR is on and you probably saw in
the background already you see that this
subject on the left side which is in a
darker portion of this display and
there's a much brighter portion in the
back was finally brought into a much
better exposure so let's go ahead and
head back right there we have the two
various areas of focus I'm a little bit
close to this there you go we have it
there so when you have HDR on even the
blown out sections of the background
will be able to be in focus and also
exposed properly compared to the stuff
that is in a darker area now what we
have here is a subject in the front that
originally was very very darkened out
because the metering was focusing on
this area here and now what we have is
that difference here's the HDR off in
which the blown out areas in the back if
I focus on there the metering won't be
able to get it because it's too blown
out and then our subject in the front is
just darkened out turn on the HDR and it
does it in real-time and changes the
image so that you'll be able to get
something much much more usable so go
and just take that picture and there it
is there you go we take a look at the
picture there and we have a much better
exposed photo showing the details in the
blown out area in the back and also the
one in the begin in the front and so
there you have it for this future focus
on the Samsung Galaxy s5 camera we're
going to take a bunch of pictures with
this unit right here and try to get
those pictures out to you on the site
Android Authority comm of course and
report back with the quality of the
pictures we do expect them to be quite
great as samsung galaxy s cameras have
been quite good in the past but now it
has the ISO cell technology at 16 whole
megapixels which is a lot of power for
what could be one of the best cameras on
a smartphone yet the two features that
we did look at where HDR and the
selective focus and as we look through
here there are a lot of features and
settings that you can use to really
tweak for your photography and so keep
it tuned here too and row 30 for all of
the best Samsung Galaxy s5 coverage
we're taking a look at a lot of aspects
of this new flagship phone so we're
going to report back to you with all of
our findings it's Josh freghar from
Android authority reporting to you live
from the Mobile World Congress at the
Samsung booth here in Barcelona Spain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
