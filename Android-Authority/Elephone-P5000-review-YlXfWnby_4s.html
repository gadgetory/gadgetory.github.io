users I'd like to complain about its
battery life
today's phones come with a whole bull
during range of features including NFC
and Bluetooth and Wi-Fi GPS 4G LTE and
of course those lovely big screens but
they all eat into the battery life
combined with this push to make phones
thinner and thinner
it seems that battery life is being
sacrificed at every turn well today
we're going to be looking at a phone
that has a 5000 plus milliamp hour
battery hello there my name's Gary Sims
rounder Authority and if you need a
phone with a big battery then maybe the
elephone p2000 is the phone for you
because of the large battery the P 5000
is larger than many today's devices
however it isn't overly thick the specs
say the phone is 9.3 millimeters thick
but my measurements had it closer to
around 10 millimeters although 10
millimeters may sound thick is still
thinner than many of today's popular
phones at the Moto G and it's around the
same thickness as the Nexus 6 but of
course this one has a 5000 plus milliamp
hour battery like many of elephone
recent devices the P 5000 is lots of
dark colors in combination with rounded
edges and silver color trim there was a
silver cut band around the edge of the
phone and silver Commission on the home
button and on the logo as well as around
the camera lens on the front of the
phone your 5 to 5 inch full HD display
the front-facing camera and I set a
capacitive keys which flanked the home
button the capacitive keys light up when
pressed and the home button houses the
built-in fingerprint reader down the
right-hand side on the volume rocker and
the power button both are easily
accessible when the phone is held in
your left hand on the top you'll find
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
the microUSB port on the bottom edge are
the speaker grilles flipping the phone
over you will see the problem elephone
logo the flash and the camera lens in
terms of build quality the phone feels
solid and robust enough however the
power button on my test unit is slightly
ins't giving it a slightly spongy feel
when pressed at first I feel that the
button was actually broken however it
does function as expected although the
home button seems to not a way to detect
when it is pressed I can't tell this as
an issue with the software or the
hardware but it does get a little bit
annoying the 5-inch display on the P 5
really quite good he's an IPS display
with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 that
works out of 440 dpi the color
reproduction is faithful however when
placed to a next to a phone with a
better screen I notice that the whites
are peeled little off gray and lacking
in punch however it isn't something I
noticed while using the phone normally
only when plays next to a different
phone it's likely just the color
temperature of the display at the heart
of the p5 thousands the media take
mt6592 is knocked to core cortex a7
based processor which is coupled with a
Mali 450 MP GPU the Mali 450 is
spreading quite old now and only
provides OpenGL ES 2.0 and not 3.0
however it still performs really well
for 3d gaming my experience with the P
5000 was pleasant the user interface
responded well and I didn't notice any
legs or stutters swiping and general
navigation was always smooth and fast
for everyday usage like web browsing
reading emails checking my calendar I
have no complaint at all and while the
Mali 450 MP is certainly an older GPU it
was also able to handle games like
Riptide gp2 without any problems as for
the benchmarks the P 5000 managed to
choke up fifty four point three frames
per second on Epic Citadel in high
quality mode and scored an unverified 31
thousand seven hundred and forty nine
and two to one other thing worth
mentioning about the CPU GPU package is
that when pushed hard the device becomes
quite warm I'm used a little warm from
the back of her phone after playing a 3d
game however in this particular case the
front of the phone around the earpiece
also heats up someone called me while I
was playing some games on the device and
when I place it to my ear it was
actually quite uncomfortable thankfully
the heat dissipates quite quickly
but it's something to be aware of the
star attraction of the p5 thousands of
course it's 5350 milliamp hour battery
which is double what you get in some
other smart phones I charge the phone
overnight on Friday and started using it
over the weekend the battery lasts until
Monday morning that was a total of two
days and six hours with an on screen
time of five and a quarter hours the
whole time Wi-Fi and 3G were on as well
sinking so that I could receive my
emails also there was about 90 minutes
of gaming thrown into that mix
the speakers on the P 5000 are a bit
strange as you can see here are the
speaker grilles however the sound really
seems to come really from this area here
and even if the speaker grills are
covered with a finger or something he
doesn't change much of the sound anyway
here's a sample so you can judge for
yourself
the p5 thousands of dual SIM phone which
offers quad-band GSM which means the 2g
will work just about anywhere in the
world and tri-band 3G the 3G were
working lots of countries around the
world especially in Europe and Asia
however it won't work in the USA
the GPS performance is excellent the
device stable hid a lot indoors and
outdoors and I tested it using Nokia
here map so I was able to use a
turn-by-turn navigation without any
problem the P 5000 comes with 2
gigabytes of RAM which be expected for a
device in this price range in terms of
internal storage the device comes with
16 gigabytes of flash and has a micro SD
card slot thankfully unlike other media
tech based devices the internal storage
isn't divided up and you get access to
the whole lot which is around 13
gigabytes of use of this space the phone
has a 16 megapixel rear facing camera
and an 8 megapixel front facing camera
the pictures are crisp and the colour
reproduction is quite faithful the
sensor does struggle a bit in low-light
situations but for outdoor shot it's
quite impressive the inclusion of an 8
megapixel front facing camera is good
news for those who like to take selfies
however I did find a front facing camera
tends to overexpose pictures the
included camera app is the standard AOSP
app and offers a few interesting
features like HDR and panorama you can
also install and use third-party apps
including Google's camera app if you'd
like to see some more sample shots then
please check out the written review the
P 5000 run stock Android 4.4.2 you also
get access to Google Play and all of
Google services including YouTube Gmail
and maps
I think the device is rooted by default
as it comes with chain fire super su
pre-installed the reason why I say I
think is that the phone receive an
over-the-air update within the first day
of me getting it and after the update
super su complains that the SU binaries
are no longer installed
I guess that the OTA removed them and I
didn't check the phone's root status
before the OTA arrived the UI is
basically you would expect from stock
Android the launcher has been lightly
skinned by a Lee phone and there are a
few additional sections in the settings
for gesture recognition and for the
fingerprint scanner but other than that
there are very little differences
between the supplied version of Android
and pure stock Android the fingerprint
scanner is incorporated into the home
button and the software allows you to
set the screen to unlock
with your fingerprint overall the
scanner and the unlock mechanism work
well the number of miss Reid was
relatively low and they kept the feature
activated for quite a while I finally
removed it not because the scanner
wasn't up to a job but because having to
swipe my finger over the scanner to
unlock the screen was becoming a bit
tedious and so there it is the only
phone P 5000 got a full HD display comes
with an octa-core processor and of
course that lovely 5350 milliamp hour
battery you can pick one up today for
around two hundred and thirty dollars my
