weekly show is brought to you by just a
note the Logan ladies and gentlemen I'm
Joe Hindy the android authority app guy
and welcome back to android apps weekly
this is episode number 125 so let's get
started the google play store is once
again giving folks rentals for up to 75
percent off with this you can rent a
single movie for up to 75 percent off so
if there's a title you've always wanted
to watch this is a great way to do it
this is likely to promote the video
streaming side of the Play Store and you
can take advantage of this rental until
March 31st whatsapp has had a very
interesting week first it was announced
that whatsapp will be dropping their
yearly subscription charge now it has
been revealed that whatsapp will be
sharing details about its users with
Facebook in order to and I quote improve
facebook experiences we suppose it was
only a matter of time before this
happened and you'll have a whole new
terms of service to read as well a while
back renowned indie developer Chris
Lacey sold link bubble and tat path to
an unknown entity that would be revealed
later later happens to be right now the
company is called brave software and
lacey's applications will be used as
framework for a browser that will pay
you for advertising that you see the
idea is to get rid of large annoying
advertisements and replace them with ads
that don't compromise the experience but
also don't screw over publishers like
adblock does we'll see how that turns
out roadhouse interactive developers of
the popular Warhammer 40,000 carnage
game has announced that they're working
on an Iron Maiden game this isn't the
first time a musician or an artist has
used a mobile game to promote their work
with artists like Avenged Sevenfold and
I am yank doing similar titles to
promote their work it'll be out this
summer and it should be interesting the
latest humble bundle is now live after
announcing that the mobile exclusive
ones would be discontinued a new Humble
Bundle materialized out of nowhere and
we couldn't be happier about it this one
has a few pac-man games puzzle quest two
flight control and a few other games you
get three games for a buck you can get
six games if you pay the average and you
get every game in the bundle if you pay
more than five dollars for even more
Android apps and games news headlines

this week's newsletter which is linked
in the video description below we had a
metric ton of news that we didn't have

every Sunday afternoon okay folks to
take a look at the apps and games that
made a big splash this week as usual if
you want to check any of these apps or
games out you can find those links in
the video description below loot and
legends is a new game that was made for
the nerd in all of us it was designed by
Richard Garfield who is known for
creating magic the gathering and
includes enough pop culture and nerd
references to fill a large boat it's
technically a card collecting game mixed
with a board game but you'll have plenty
of opportunities to collect loot and a
whole lot more it's a unique experience
that feels fresh and Agenor that's been
overloaded the last couple of years
crash lands is a fun little action
adventure game where you play as flux a
trucker who gets stranded on an alien
planet your job is to deliver packages
while outwitting bad guys crafting all
kinds of things from random stuff that
you find and then defeating bosses there
are over 500 items that you can craft an
infinite inventory that manages itself
and RPG elements for character
development best of all there are no
in-app purchases which means no
ridiculous pitfalls mimic or alarm is
the latest application to come out of
the Microsoft garage project and it's
going to wake you up it's a
well-designed alarm application with
material design elements that makes you
play games with it in order to turn off
the alarm sometimes it'll ask you to
make faces into the camera speak various
phrases or actually get out of the bed
if you don't the alarm will sound again
it's well done and it definitely works
Lego the Lord of the Rings is the Lego
take on the epic fantasy adventure and
one of the few Lego games that actually
costs money this is a point-and-click
hack-and-slash game that retells the
epic story of the lord of the rings
except with a few fun little Lego twists
the graphics are actually pretty good
and the mechanics are solid even if they
take a moment to get used to it features
90 playable characters various control
schemes and tons of stuff to do there
are also no in-app purchases after a
very long time Kickstarter has finally
graced the google play store with an
official application thankfully the
extra time seems to have paid off
because the application is everything
that it needs to be you can quickly
browse and search through various
categories quickly log in and back
projects you want to contribute to and
despite having a ton of
formation the application does a great
job of not getting overwhelming it's a
free application and Kickstarter fans
should definitely have it this week's
episode of the Android apps weekly show
is sponsored by just a note this is a
simple note taking application that
works in tandem with your dialer
application so you can take quick notes

call as normal and when you're done the
app should open right up so you can jot
down notes if need be notes can be done
with text or you can use your voice by
pressing down on the mic icon and
talking you can also customize the theme
of your notes and the whole thing is
wrapped up in beautifully done material
design you can also add phone call notes
to your calendar for quick reminders

more it's also available in 8 language
