the LG g3 versus the new iPhone six-plus
we have two distinctive designs at play
here on the one hand Apple's well-known
form factor with the large circular home
button and also the rounded corners but
there's more of a curve on the sides as
well though the front and back are going
to be completely flat on the other hand
the LG g3 with its rear mounted power
button and volume controls now the g3 is
probably the more efficient design
simply because it's more compact and a
little bit lighter than the Apple iPhone
even if the two shared the same display
size that one of the g3 as well also
comes with almost all screen with just a
plastic band on the bottom and the
tapered edges are free of any
distractions making it feel even more
compact because of that signature button
layout on the back the iPhone 6 plus is
more of a centimeter taller and 23 grams
heavier so you will probably use this
device with two hands most of the time
especially because of its larger size
overall the iPhones aluminum unibody
gives it a luxurious more premium feel
but the g3 isn't far behind with its own
brushed metal finished plastic both of
these phones can be considered upgrades
when it comes to the displays because
the g3 was the first mainstream
smartphone to get the quad HD display
while Apple brought up the iPhone 6 plus
resolution to Full HD but the g3 still
holds the lead in terms of overall pixel
density but with that said the
difference in the crispness is likely to
go unnoticed by plenty of general users
but these are LCD screens and while
Apple did use a bit of extra technology
to improve the viewing angles you can
see that they're both pretty grey on
either device either way you're going to
have a good time on either display
unless you really want the bleeding edge
in which case the g3 gets the edge when
it comes to performance it's kind of
hard to give a real comparison because
obviously we're working with two
completely different ecosystems and
architectures here obviously the iPhone
6 comes with the in-house custom design
process or this time the updated a8 that
should be known for its superb
optimization in iOS but on the other
hand the LG g3 has one of the fastest
processors available of any Android
device - snapdragon 801 which should on
paper prove to be more powerful than the
a8 but it's safe to say that users won't
really notice that huge of a difference
given the two different ecosystems but
at the iPhone 6 plus comes with 16 64 or
128 gigabytes of storage but in g3
is able to have 16 gigabytes of storage
with microSD cards that will expand it
the batteries are almost the same in
terms of capacity but the g3 has the
advantage of allowing it to be removable
underneath that cover but the iPhone
six-plus does feature a touch ID
fingerprint sensor embedded in the home
button which is pretty nice for quick
and convenient security but one more
thing that is worth mentioning is the
long overdue presence of an NFC chip in
the iPhone six-plus though it's only
limited to Apple pay for now powerful
cameras accompany both of these devices
the iPhone 6 plus comes with an 8
megapixel rear camera of the previous
generation though Apple touts an all-new
sensor that should do much better not
only do you get an F 2.2 aperture lens
faster autofocus due to attack called
focus pixels but you also get optical
image stabilization on the video side
you can capture slow-motion shots of up
to 240 frames per second and 720p
resolution which is nice and on the
front you also get F 2.2 lens as well
the g3 offers a 13 megapixel larger
sensor and is the only smartphone to
come with a laser assisted fast focusing
system that we thought was quite great
but it also comes with the signature
optical image stabilization that LG was
a bit of a pioneer of when it came to
the original phones of yesteryear but
now the iPhone has always been known for
pretty good camera capabilities and we
will take a look at some camera shots in
the future but for now we will say that
both of these cameras should be pretty
good competition for one another in
terms of software we do get the iOS 8 in
the iPhone 6 that is not necessarily the
big overhaul the iOS 7 was but it does
bring some useful features to the table
mainly third-party support for keyboards
widgets in the notification drop-down
and a new health application that I
thought was pretty robust and also
continuity which allows you to have a
sync
among all Apple products overall the
iPhone 6 plus does bring a little bit of
a breath of fresh air to an OS that had
become still at one point and with this
new direction that has gone to and the
new features now it does look like it
has a pretty full feature set but when
you're talking about full-featured sets
the LG g3 comes with the GUI which got a
pretty massive upgrade not only in its
looks but also with the different
features like the addition of dual
window for the g3 and also smart
applications that allow you to do things
with the keyboard clean up the phone
easily and even have a smart notice
assistant on top of all things like the
Q slide multitasking and of course every
little feature that is still available
from original versions of the GUI as far
as software Suites go yes the g3 might
have a little bit more capability but
the iPhone six-plus does still have
quite a few features that have just been
introduced that do make it a little bit
closer on the edge and so there you have
it for this look at the iPhone 6 plus
and the LG g3 now these are both big
screen behemoths and for users of the
iPhone ecosystem the plus size is
probably going to be a little bit
staggering but it does make the new
iPhones a little bit more akin to the
Android ecosystem flagships whether or
not one is better than the other is
really up to you and it's going to be up
to you to figure out which features in
either ecosystem are better for you so
stay tuned to Android 30 for all of the
best coverage including our upcoming
comparisons we're doing even more with
the iPhone 6 and 6-plus here with all of
the Android flagships because we are
