phones increasing all the time
today's more affordable mid-range phones
are easily equivalent to the flagship
devices of only a couple of years ago
and the competition in this area is
really heating up there are lots of
devices at sub $300 and some even as low
as $200 now one company that's been
making a lot of waves in this space is
ZTE recently LAN reviewed the ZTE Blade
s6 and now ZT is released a bigger
version of the same phone the ZTE Blade
s6 plus with a 5.5 inch display and the
same internals of the blade s6 this
phone has lots to offer so let's have a
look at it like the ZTE Blade s6 it's
quite obvious what has inspired the
design of the s6 plus from its grey card
body rounded corners circular home
button and even the naming convention
the blade s6 Plus borrows heavily from
Apple's design language of course while
it looks similar to the iPhone 6 plus it
actually feels quite different the
entire body of the blade s6 Plus is made
of plastic and while plastic doesn't
necessarily have to feel cheap
unfortunately it could be set up the
blade s6 plus that it lacks a premium
feel
for example the plastic is coated in a
smooth satin finish and it tends to slip
around in the hand quite a lot although
I didn't drop the phone during my a few
days that I was using it as my daily
driver I could see that it could be a
worry for some although overall the
blade s6 Plus looks like the blade s6
there is one big difference in its
construction the blade s6 is a sealed
unit that uses trays for both the SIM
card and the micro SD card but the s6
plus is different the back is removable
and the cards are inserted in a more
traditional fashion however the battery
still remains non removable large blade
s6 have an issue with too much movement
in its back cover and as a result a
general hollow feel to it but because of
its different cover construction I
didn't see anything like that
with the blade s6 plus since the ZTE
Blade s6 Plus has a 5.5 inch display
it's quite a big device this isn't
helped much by the large space at the
bottom for the capacity
keys although we're only talking about a
couple of millimeters
it just seemed oversized to me but on
the positive side the device is fairly
thin at under 8 millimeters which when
combined with the rounded corners means
that the phone is easy to hold however
one handed use for me at least he's out
of the question
going around the device the power button
on the volume rocker located on the
right hand side and can be easily
reached the headphone jack is on the top
along with the IR blaster while on the
bottom is the Micro USB does ates 6 plus
utilizes capacitive keys up front and
they do have an appealing unique look to
them the home button in the center is
denoted by a ring that glows a nice
bright blue when you touch it or when
you have notifications or when the
device is charging to LEDs flanked the
home button to represent the back and
menu keys by default the back button is
on the left and the menu keys on the
right but that could be changing the
settings you can flip them the other way
round if you prefer the ZTE s6 plus
comes with a 5.5 inch IPS LCD display
with a resolution of 720 p this results
in a pixel density of 267 PPI
considering the size of the display this
resolution may seem little low to some
but my experience with the screen was
very good keep everything including
videos and games within great display
brings with it all the loved features of
an IPS LCD panel including bright but
not overly saturated colors great
brightness and good viewing angles if I
had to complain about one thing it would
be to mention the brightness levels set
by the phone when using auto brightness
was just a little too higher for me I
found myself adjusting the brightness
manually to compensate under the hood
the blade s6 Plus packs an octa-core
64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 1.5
gigahertz it's backed by an Adreno 405
GPU and 2 gigabytes of RAM this is one
of the best mid-range processing
packages currently available and for
everyday tasks gives a performance that
is similar to its more high-end
counterparts the blade S 6 plus is
snappy responsive and fast animations
run smoothly every time apps open
quickly and multitasking is a breeze the
gaming experience is also great with a
device handling graphic intensive
very well the device comes with 16
gigabytes of on-board storage which is
further expandable by an additional 32
gigabytes using a microSD card
however the storage comes partitioned
the 16 gigabytes is divided up into a
system area or four point two nine
gigabytes a user area of three point
eight seven gigabytes which is used for
installing apps and a phone storage area
seven point eight three gigabytes which
is used for data and media there is an
option to move app from the user area to
the phone storage unfortunate there is
no option to move apps from either the
user storage or the phone storage to the
SD card you are however able to set the
default right location to the external
sd card however this seems to be a bit
hit and miss in terms of which apps
respect will understand this setting
also the camera app has a separate
setting for where the images should be
stored but it can be set to use the
external sd card a single speaker is
found on the back at the bottom right
corner and why it does get the job done
it obviously doesn't provide as good as
experience as you would get from say a
phone with front-facing speakers
a standard set of sensors and
connectivity options are available
including support for 4G LTE but it's
worth noting that since this device is
catered towards the Asian and European
markets it won't connect to the LTE
networks in the US the ZTE Blade s6 Plus
as a 3000 milliamp hour battery and it
does a pretty good job the best I got
out of it during my testing was 36 hours
of off charger time with an on screen
time of three and a half hours there's
also a battery saver mode provided in
case you need to get some extra juice
out of that battery when it's running
low but you're away from a charger I
also did some individual app testing and
according to game bench YouTube will
stream video over Wi-Fi for about 6
hours on one charge whereas Epic Citadel
will run for about 3 hours before the
battery is fully consumed the camera on
the smaller blade s6 is quite impressive
and happily the blade s6 Plus uses the
same technology what you're looking at
is a 13 megapixel Sony made sensor with
a 28 millimeter wide angle lens when you
jump into the camera interface you're
going to notice two modes simple and
expert simple it's basically just an
auto mode that lets you snap photos
without having to worry or play around
with any additional settings on the
other hand expert mode introduces a few
additional controls like white balance
ISO metering exposure but that's about
as extensive as it gets
various shooting modes like HDR panorama
and a few others are also available but
one thing to notice they're only
accessible when you're shooting in
simple mode the pictures are sharp and
vibrant in color but not overly so as to
make them look unrealistic and in most
situations where lighting was adequate I
was able to pretty much get any shot I
wanted the F 2.0 aperture is also great
and you can create pictures with a
shallow depth of field quite easily
something you'd normally only achieve
with a DSLR in low-light performance can
be a bit hit and miss with high noise
levels but with a steady hand you can
get reasonable results however don't
expect too much as the camera has a
maximum ISO of 800 overall the rear
camera is a pretty solid offering and
it's certainly one of the plus point of
this phone if you're a selfie lover
you're going to enjoy the front-facing
camera as it comes in at 5 megapixels
the quality isn't spectacular by any
means but just like the rear camera
he has a wide-angle lens which means you
can easily fit you in a couple of
friends into a single shot with Android
5.0 lollipop out of the box the ZTE
Blade s6 plus is one of the few phones
that runs the latest iteration of
Google's operating system you get all of
the great features of lollipop plus a
few additions from ZTE including a
custom launcher while the custom
launcher does have its own unique
features a lot of the stock elements of
Android 5.0 are available here things
like the lockscreen notification shade
overview settings dialog and clock all
still preserve the material design from
Google like the software experience we
get from many devices from China the
custom launcher is colorful with squared
icons and does away with the standard
app drawer in favor of having all the
applications reside on the home screen
however with folders you should be able
to stop things from getting too
cluttered
of course it is still Android so you
always have the option to download a
third-party launcher from the Google
Play Store if you're looking for a more
familiar experience tapping the Menu
button or swiping up from the bottom of
the screen brings up the launcher
customization panel here you can choose
from a series of solid colored or
abstract wallpapers or even download new
ones from ZTE s online library there is
also a built-in slider which gives your
wallpapers a blurred look plus you can
also alter the desktop transitions once
you're satisfied with all your changes
that you've made you can create a backup
copy within the launcher preferences so
that you never lose them as a teen
you've also include the option of a
navigation helper called me pop it's an
onscreen bubble with navigation keys to
help with one-handed operation since the
screen on the s6 plus is quite large
this could be a very handy feature for
some and so there you have it the ZTE
Blade s6 plus what you're getting is a
smart phone with a large display a great
processor package and a solid camera
experience it's available globally right
now for a special launch price of 270
dollars later on it's recommended retail
price will be 299 dollars for those in
Europe and Asia it's definitely worth
considering if you want a wallet
friendly smartphone with a 5.5 inch
display my name's Gary since Lander
