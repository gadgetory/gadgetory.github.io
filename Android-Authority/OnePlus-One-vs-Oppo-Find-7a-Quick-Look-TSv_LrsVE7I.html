might seem incredibly similar but are
actually pretty different in some key
ways hey it's Josh Megara from Android
authority what's going on everybody
and this is the 1+1 versus the Oppo find
7 a now at first glance the 1+1 and the
Oppo find 7 both feature common design
aesthetics with an angular design with
smooth and sleek lines on offer with
both the similarities will continue as
you make it to the front as both come
with a minimalistic yet premium feel and
the black slight design on the front has
no embellishments you also get the same
capacitive button layout on the bottom
of either display but the oneplus one
does come with the option to switch to
soft keys if you so desire the oneplus
one display is also slightly raised and
is surrounded by a chrome ring that
further enhances the premium look this
minimalism continues as we turn to the
backs with both featuring the same 13
megapixel rear camera with a dual LED
flash and the oneplus and Opel logos are
found towards the center of either plate
you get a brushed metal finish on the
gray version of the Oppo find 7 and a
textured plastic on the white one but
the premium version offers a
carbon-fiber back plate with the oneplus
one featuring a smooth hard plastic back
in this white version in the case of the
oneplus one however you will get
removable backs that can be replaced
with various materials and I have been
told that the denim one is actually
pretty cool
now considering how similar these
devices are it's no surprise that the
dimensions are almost identical with the
oneplus one being ever so slightly
longer and nominally thinner and lighter
than the Oppo find 7 but what struck me
about the feel was how the weight
distribution seems much more even
throughout the oneplus one as a result
it was nimbler and easier to perform
Hanjin a sticks on you don't get it
twisted though both of these phones are
still tougher on one-hand usage than
most as you'll find out as we keep going
through this comparison the Oppo find 7
and the oneplus one or two exceedingly
similar devices in many respects the
Oppo find 7 version that we have the 7a
is the non quad HD device which features
the same 5.5 inch display as the oneplus
one with the latter also featuring touch
on lens tech that eliminates the
distance between the touch sensors and
the display panel and is also
significantly more shatterproof as
expected the colors do pop on either one
and there are no issues with brightness
and the viewing angles for both are
fantastic now while this version the
find 7a and the 1+1 come with 1080p
resolutions resulting in pixel densities
of 401 pixels per inch it does have to
be mentioned that there is another
version of the fine 7 the premium one
with quad HD resolution that has a
whopping pixel density of 538 pixels per
inch but until we get our hands on that
version of the phone this comparison is
pretty much head-to-head underneath all
that both feature the best processing
package currently available with a quad
core Snapdragon 801 processor backed by
the audrina 330 GPU now the processor of
the oneplus is clocked in at a higher
2.5 gigahertz compared to the 2.3
gigahertz of the find 7a and the one
does come with 3 gigabytes of RAM but
the find 7a including - that being said
the premium version defined 7 does
feature the same exact specs as the
oneplus one and in either case
performance is actually very fast and
there are no differences between the two
with multitasking remaining a breeze as
well now one benefit of the elbow find
7a that it has over the oneplus one is
the inclusion of microSD expansion over
the 16 gigabytes of built-in storage
while the oneplus one attempts to make
up for it by the availability of a 64
gigabyte version the elbow find 7a also
brings some real style to its
notification light as the skyline
permeates throughout the bottom portion
hindered only by the fact that it only
shines blue this is compared to the more
conventional blinking notification light
found in the earpiece of the oneplus one
and when it comes to the battery the
oneplus one comes with a slightly larger
3100 milliamp hour battery while the
fine 7 has a 3000 milliamp hour unit
which is removable however and gives you
the opportunity to carry around a spare
but this is where the comparison does
get skewed in favor of the Oppo find 7
however as the vogue fast charging
technology really helps put it over as a
power companion a better power companion
coupled with the fact that you can
replace the battery being able to charge
your phone from 0 to 100 in about an
hour has proven to be an invaluable
trade for the Oppo find 7 this is
something you simply do not get with the
oneplus one whose charging times will be
much more conventional now not to keep
harping on the same point but the camera
packages on either device happen to be
pretty much identical
you get Sony Exmor RS 13 megapixel
cameras with F 2.0 apertures and dual
LED flash units and both promised to
deliver amazing shots and the
of the Oppo find 7 however its app does
allow for the capturing of an HD photo
that blows everything up to a 50
megapixel shots in the oneplus one you
get the signage in mod camera app that
looks like it does include a lot of
different features in its own right
if selfies are your thing a 5 megapixel
front-facing camera is available on both
that can capture 80 degrees worth of
shot and we had a good experience with
the fine 7 camera and we can only expect
the same from the oneplus one as well
but stay tuned for a real comparison
between these two where we will actually
take a look at both cameras and camera
shootouts and then put them head-to-head
we may actually get to some real
differences now that we're looking at
the software as the oneplus one runs
CyanogenMod 11's a special release built
specifically for the one to take
advantage of all of its hardware and
features and is based on 4.4 kitkat you
get a clean minimalistic stock like
experience with a lot of customization
options available underneath and useful
software features such as the voice
command allow you to wake the device
using your voice or you can launch your
favorite apps by drawing preset gestures
on the sleeping screen as mentioned
before you can also choose between
on-screen and capacitive navigation
buttons to suit your preference
now the find 7a runs Android 4.3 jelly
bean and you get opus color OS on top
its general look is much more ethereal
opting for an interface that is not as
flat and in a number of ways isn't as
practical as CM but takes on a more
coarse stock experience and builds upon
it from there well we will say however
is that many of the gestures or features
you might use in one are found on the
other like tapping to wake the phone and
with the sheer openness opal has two
installations of custom roms it's
entirely possible to get a very similar
experience on the find seven and find 7a
that you would get on the one
nonetheless color OS is a very
interesting operating system to say the
least that packs a lot of features
underneath a look that is now maybe not
exactly as practical for many Android
users out there especially once you
prefer stock in their look and finally
in price this is where we will likely
find the biggest differentiating factor
as the Oppo find 7a is available for
$4.99 while the oneplus one starts at
the incredible price of $2.99 we can
argue that you get what you pay for in
either case the core Android experience
presented beautifully by the oneplus one
and the benefit of MOOC fast charging
along with the replaceable battery and
expandable storage in the opal find 7a
as a big proponent of the
fast-charging I think the 200 extra
dollars are somewhat justified along
with the other editions especially but
if you don't need those extras the one
plus is the absolute steal our reviews
of these two devices are coming soon so
stay tuned to Android authority for all
of that great coverage because we are
