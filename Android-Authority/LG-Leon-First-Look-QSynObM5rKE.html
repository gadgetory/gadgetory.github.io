devices here at MWC 2015 and we're here
hanging out with them to take a look at
four new releases the one you're seeing
right here is the third in the list a
charge of a guard from Andhra Authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the LG Leon as I mentioned already in
the intro we're dealing with the third
in a list of different mid-range devices
that LG is putting out at MWC 2015 as we
are here in Barcelona Spain this is the
LG Leon they are foregoing the the old
nomenclature of the F and L Series but
these devices are all going to be priced
very competitively compared to those
mid-range devices that LG had maybe
about a year or two ago let's get some
of the specifications out of the way
this screen right here is a 4.5 inch FW
VGA panel that has 220 pixels per inch
underneath we do have different versions
for 4G and 3G connectivity and they will
have respective specs to match that 1.2
gigahertz or 1.3 gigahertz in the quad
core processor underneath and as far as
the rear-facing camera goes it can be 5
megapixels or 8 megapixels with a
front-facing VGA camera memory
underneath will be 8 gigabytes with 1
gigabytes of RAM and the 1900 million
power battery underneath is removable
and replaceable but just going around
the actual device itself we have a
pretty small one here obviously it's at
4.5 inches but its thickness at ten
point nine millimeters really makes it
squarely in the mid-range market this is
definitely a phone in the vein of the
Moto mid-range devices and that is
exactly the market that they are going
for here we don't have any pricing or
availability that is available at the
moment but like I said before these will
be priced very similarly and
competitively to the old optimist L and
F Series phones we'll go through the
operating system in just a segue I just
want to show you the design of this
particular device and show you the
mid-range offering that LG is focusing
on here at MWC 2015 it's worth
mentioning that the 4G version that
you're looking at right now is the one
that will have this particular finish on
it the 3G version will have more of a
regular plastic backing but this is a
little bit more reminiscent of the LG g3
of course we have the rear facing button
layout here at the top which is iconic
now for
LG's design language but I just wanted
to make sure it's a differentiate
between the 4G and 3G versions like I
said the 4G version will have this
finish to give it a slightly more
premium look you can already see from
the operating system there that we're
dealing with a build of lollipop
obviously backed by the GUI elements
that we are pretty familiar with at this
point the app drawers right here we have
the soft keys here at the bottom and a
lot of what looks very familiar here is
coming from the GUI that you have seen
in previous iterations like the g3 and
the G flex 2 most recently you can
always see of course the lollipop
enhancements like the notification
drop-down right here that allows you to
get to the quick settings quite easily
up here and all of the notifications
will be used via cards from there we
have the Settings menu that is also
tabbed as well but the main addition
here is of course the recent apps screen
that now takes on a card on the
interface I should say so this is a
lollipop build and I will confirm that
for you just by going to the profile
down here software info and of course we
have the Android lollipop Easter Egg
right there having lollipop at the helm
of a mid-range device is already a
pretty great prospect and in these
mid-range devices LG is focusing on the
affordable price bracket so that if you
aren't able to afford the flagship
devices you can always get an LG
experience in these more affordable
handsets this is Joshua reguar from
Android authority reporting to you live
from Barcelona Spain we're hanging out
with LG taking a look at their brand new
phones that they're showcasing here at
the event</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
