Authority one of the most important uses
of a single board computer is as a rapid
prototyping and development platform
recently I reviewed the humming board
SBC from solid run and as they say the
proof is in the pudding that's why solid
runners use their own technology to
build a truly miniature PC and here it
is the Q box at just 2 inches by 2
inches by 2 inches the Q box is a marvel
of engineering on one side of the cube
is a set of ports including the power
socket HDMI Ethernet in two USB ports
the rest of the cube is fairly bland to
fully understand the innards of the Q
box you should check out the full review
of the humming board but in short the Q
box uses free scales imx6 processor the
imx6 range is based on arms cortex a9
design and scales from single to
quad-core the Q box comes in two
variants a dual-core version the Q box I
2x and a quad-core version the Q box I
for pro oven the two extra cores the i-4
Pro comes with 2 gigs of RAM rather than
one gig and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are
included by default rather than being an
option my test unit is the dual-core
version one of the primary uses of the Q
box is as a media player since the cube
supports Android and Linux there are
several ways of achieving this for
example you could use Android with an
app like Netflix or you could use Linux
with a media player like Kodi solid run
provides a couple of Linux distributions
that boot straight into Kodi one is geek
box and the other is openelec or open
embedded limits entertainment center
open Lake is a small Linux distribution
that turns the Q box into a Kodi Media
Center in fact you can order a micro SD
card preloaded with openelec when you
buy the Q box this makes using Kodi a
breeze just boot up the Q box and you're
straight into the media player I did a
brief test by inserting a USB stick with
some mp4 files the USB stick was
recognized by the Q box without any
problems I was able to navigate to the
files from within Kodi and played the
videos the playback was smooth and the
sound goes through the HDMI cable to the
TV one of the great features of
is that our Android apps which act as a
remote control I downloaded Yost the
XBMC / Kodi remote and tried it out with
the version of openelec running on the
cubox the app found the cubox straight
away and I was able to control Kodi
quite easily if you want to try another
operating system then solid run has a
special firmware called ignition which
allows you to easily download new
firmware version is download the
ignition from saurons website I'm
writing onto a memory card using
win32diskimager then you boot the cue
box with the ignition firmware and use
its UI to pick which operating system
you want to use ignition will then
automatically download the OS from write
it onto the microSD card once copied you
just reboot the cue box and the new OS
will start if you want a Linux distro
that isn't on the official list in
ignition there are plenty of community
provided distros can be written directly
onto a microSD card you can find full
instructions on solid runs website the
cubox is compatible with Android and
currently runs Android 4.4 KitKat it is
one of the official firmware that you
can download via ignition the Android
experience is pretty good and for the
most part you'll get the same experience
you would from a smartphone or tablet
sans the touchscreen lack of the humming
board the cubox I version of Android
includes Google Apps so you get access
to the Play Store as well as other
Google services like Gmail G+ YouTube
and so on the performance of the cubox
is basically the same as the hummingbird
I 2x the benchmark scores from the
humming board I - II actual review apply
here
ie the Q box called around twelve
thousand nine two two and four Epic
Citadel you'll get frame rates for
around 24 to 28 fps for media playback
the Q box supports accelerated decoding
for a large number of video standards
including mpeg-4 xvid h.264 h.263 and
vp8 I tested the cubox using YouTube and
Netflix both ran without any problems
the only minor problem with Android on
the Q box is it doesn't recognize flash
drives when they are plugged into the
USB port this isn't something that most
Android users try with their smart
phones so it isn't surprising that
doesn't work the humming board I - e^x
had exactly the same problem it is an
Android specific issue has USB drives
work fine and the Linux
and openelec there are several different
Linux distribution available for the
cubox many of our ignition on the list
you'll find popular names like Debbie an
arch and open SUSE unfortunately many of
the distros come without a desktop and
you need to log in via the command line
interface but doesn't mean you can't add
a desktop but extra effort is required
one exception is open SUSE during the
ignition installation you can opt to
install xfce after the initial
installation you'll be taken through a
text-based wizard which configures a few
things about open SUSE once the
configuration installation is complete
you'll have a full xfce desktop and
you'll have access to quite a wealth of
applications programs like Firefox and
GIMP are pre-installed and you always
have the choice to add more as I said
before there's quite a strong community
behind the humming board and the cubox
so there's no shortage of Linux
distributions and for those who want to
hack port code in tinker then the cubox
offers just as many opportunities as any
of the other popular SBC's or mini pcs
the cortex a9 calls using the imx6 are
more advanced than the cortex a7 cores
using the Raspberry Pi 2 for example the
cortex a9 supports out of order
execution while the a7 doesn't on paper
at least a quad core cortex a9 processor
should be faster than a quad core cortex
a7 processor the cubox is certainly
interesting mini-pc
it offers a lot of flexibility since its
support for Android and Linux is
excellent and excels running Kodi the
design of the cube is neat and
inspirational the box itself is
unimposing but yet when noticed it will
impress it's a clever way of turning a
television into a smart TV or a media
player you can buy the cubox right now
from a solid runs website at just 120
dollars and there it is my name is Gary
Sims from Andrew authority I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please
don't forget to give it a thumbs up also
don't forget to subscribe to and Roy
thora T's YouTube channel a big shout
out to my brothers at Android authority
Jace Joe Josh lon KB the tech ninja ash
and Tyler Martin and as for me I'll see
you in my next video
