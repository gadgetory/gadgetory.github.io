brought to you by Linda calm try
lynda.com free for seven days by
visiting lynda.com / android you ask we
answer its android authority QA for
August twenty-eighth 2013 hey everybody
I'm Chris what our first question of the
day comes from Mike who asks hey Chris
do you think Samsung will be launching
any new note tablets the note 10.1 is
outdated and the note 8 is a little
small I'm interested in s note for
college should i wait for any new
releases or should i just buy a current
note device with eva so close i'd say
it's worth definitely hanging on a
little while to see what samsung has
coming up for example we know they're
working on a 12 point 2 inch and a 10
inch tablet both of which look to have
pretty nice specs and some high res
displays if not i guess you're going to
have to take your pick from what's
available if you're in a rush alex asks
when do you think the next nexus phone
will come out and what specs could it
have well the last nexus phone came out
in november of 2012 so we could see one
in november 2013 but with the Moto X
having just come out I think it could be
a little bit longer maybe even into 2014
as to what specs it could have we have
no idea because we know so little about
the next Nexus phones right now it could
be anything from a minor upgrade to the
nexus 4 to something as powerful as the
LG g2 anthony says hey Chris I've heard
there will be an HTC One max should I
get it over the upcoming Galaxy Note 3
also do you think the one max will have
a stylist like the note series I'd wait
until both phones are released and
reviewed before we pick which one is the
better one to go for but they're both
shaping up to be pretty impressive the
HTC One max could have a stylist HTC has
done that before but something tells me
that it probably won't I'm kind of
hoping to be wrong on that though Bruce
vay asks is there any app that can use
the IR blaster and phones that have them
to replace a universal remote
unfortunately there doesn't seem to be
that sort of thing there were a couple
apps out there that require their own
dietary dongle to replace a universal
remote but I've never actually tried
them so I don't know how well they work
when it comes to using the IR blaster
and a phone like the galaxy s4 or the
HTC One there aren't any third party
apps that use that probably because
Samsung and HTC haven't gone out of
their way to expose the IR blaster to
developers keV says will verizon cdma
phones that use a sim card work
internationally if I put a working sim
card in without unlocking the phone it
depends if it's a global ready phone
also known as a world phone then yes
phones like the HTC One and motorola's
new droid series will work on both cdma
and gsm networks so they can be used
internationally if it's a cdna only
phone you're out of luck vladimir asks
hey chris is it safe to reroute an
Android phone in my case the HTC
sensation which has been rooted but then
locked again generally it is safe to
reroute your phone as it was to root it
in the first place but as always there
are some risks with brooding that said
it may be more difficult to unlock your
phone if you've had a firmware update
since it was last locked sometimes it
can even become impossible this last
question actually has to do with android
authority on car asked what happens
after somebody wins the sunday giveaway
what do you guys do after you announce
the winner and if I win do I have to pay
shipping charges after the winner has
been randomly selected we send them an
email letting them know they've won wait
until we hear back with an address and
then ship out the prize this can be as
early as Monday but if the prize is in a
weird spot it can take a little longer
and of course you don't have to pay
shipping charges it's on us and that
