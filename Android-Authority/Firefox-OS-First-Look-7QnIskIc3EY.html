from Barcelona at Mobile World Congress
I'm here with Christian Hammond yes he's
the html5 spokesperson sir with that
with the Mozilla Foundation and he has a
hands-on demo of the new Firefox OS
we're gonna be taking a look and diving
in so why don't you start talking about
it what are we looking at here what
you're looking at here is a Firefox OS
device it's a very very low-level device
basically do if I had Android on it the
only Android that would still run is
honeycomb okay so the idea of that one
is that we bring web connectivity to
people who cannot afford smartphones so
we bring emerging markets like South
America is where we're gonna start
Eastern Europe so our idea of Mozilla as
a foundation is to bring the web to
people and if right now this means that
you have to have a lot of money for a
new smartphone every two months that's
just not fair now so we thought it's a
good idea to bring a platform into the
play that could run on very very low
spec hardware but still have a good
performance of course you can't compare
it with an with an with the nexus 4
right now or with an iPhone 5 but
actually the idea is that we want to
replace feature phones with this so we
want to get rid of the old Nokia
Samsung's Erickson's Motorola's people
should be available it should be allowed
to be on the web and use the social web
and not only play snakes and send their
people text messages course so
everything you see here is html5 CSS
HTML and and JavaScript all of it the
operating system itself and the
applications or everything else in there
is a Linux core same Linux core that's
under Android code conk and that gave us
access to the hardware and that way we
got the apps there you see all the apps
that you would expect we got Facebook we
got Twitter
we got the Nokia Maps the wireless
here's a bit flaky so sometimes it can
take a while to load but these are Nokia
Maps running on a device now which 156
Meg of RAM and a one gigahertz processor
pretty impressed so that's pretty sweet
the other thing we have is that we we
are going to markets where people
actually pay by the megabyte so seeing
that all the apps are html5 they're much
smaller than their equivalents in the
Android Market so the good thing about
that one is I don't have to actually
install 32 max uh stuffs are tweeting I
can just go on and Twitter and do that
I also have a full control over how many
how many things I've already used and
how many things are how many of my
megabytes are already used and what I
used two months 3G or Wi-Fi and when I
get into the one mag or something that
engine starts getting ready I get alerts
so I make sure that when I'm on roaming
I'm not actually paying through my nose
we have a marketplace much like anybody
else
so like the Android Marketplace or the
iOS marketplace one main differentiator
is that you buy the app once and you can
install it on many many devices you want
to undescore on tablets and on the phone
because i myself i hate that i have to
de-emphasize wanna browse one computer
before I go to next month the really
amazing thing though is that instead of
having to go through marketplace as all
of these things are html5 they can be
indexed on the web as well which means
we have this system here called dynamic
app search so I can now search for a
band like I can search for YouTube
because I don't want to type many things
in and you see in the background I got
you two and it gave me the apps that are
actually have content of you to like
Grooveshark SoundCloud Wikipedia or
YouTube or MetroLyrics
and song cake so I did not need to know
the names of the apps I just wanted to
go from my content to the 2d app itself
I can then click on the click on be a
SoundCloud app for example I load the
html5 mobile version of it to preview it
I play with the app I play a song if I
like the app then I can mate then I can
keep it but I can actually just discard
it as well so it's actually the same way
as browsing the web we made app
discovery and app usage as easy as using
the web now if I like SoundCloud I can
go back to that do a long click and
basically just install it on my device
as well so I can then install it to the
home screen this work this is not a
bookmark like it is on iOS this is
actually just putting they're putting
the app on my computer and doing all the
cap caching as well it gets the data
offline so next time when I'm there
sound card is much faster cuz I don't
have to don't look down with the
interface anymore because it's already
there for me so the benefit of all of
this is that the phone will be very very
cheap to achieve and it is actually
updating constantly as well so I don't
have the problem that a very low-end
phone doesn't get newer versions of the
operating system that quickly
and we had we walked a lot with our
partners we got 19 different providers
that actually want to do read with us
make up things like telef√≥nica Telenor
and others and we got four different
hardware providers that want to build
Firefox OS phones already the other
benefit of course is if I got Firefox
running on my Android any of these
applications can be installed on my
Android and run full screen as
applications as well so when do we think
we're gonna be seeing Firefox phones in
a while though to go to market autumn is
the thing that we're that our partners
are going for we built the operating
system we actually don't build the
system itself okay but the main thing is
right now as a developer I can pre I can
get a geeks phone they can actually go
to geeks phone log home you can buy one
of those and test them out you can also
flash Firefox OS on an older Androids
like Nexus S and Nexus S 2 that's what
we use as test devices before but the
best way to actually get a cell phone
with same specifications as a phone will
be in the market is one getting one of
those geeks phones you can build 90% of
the app actually on your desktop as well
because there's an emulator built into
Firefox so you can do it on a Mac on
Linux on on Windows wherever you want to
use it so Firefox 4s is basically
bringing the web to the phone rather
than having the web as the last app on
the phone that you just use when you
don't find another answer
so aside from Ceti can you share some
information about the hardware partners
the Harvard partisan alcatel-lucent then
we have Sony just announced one Sonia
Sonia you way announced one and LG LG oh
that's fantastic
it is very very cool that a year ago
this was an empty folder on our desktop
at two years ago one year ago we had a
phone here that was a demo and now we
got so many partners and basically the
phones out it's really really nice to
see I wish you all the best and we love
your philosophy
bringing more connectedness to you know
the rest of the world that doesn't
have the economic resources to the other
day exactly thank you very much thank
you for your time sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
