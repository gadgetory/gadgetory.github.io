Computex 2012
I mean we're finding Android and all
sorts of things Android USB you know
mirroring your desktop experience from
your Android your computer and now what
we're looking at here is from a company
called Aero vision avionics so company
out of Taiwan now what they've devised
here basically is for trains and for
buses for in sort of entertainments you
know they claim to be able to power 60
different touch screens simultaneously
have tons of different audio feeds
obviously touch screen environment for a
bus or a train no desire to get into you
know airplanes quite yet but we can just
come over here and we're gonna be able
to see I just imagine a good way to keep
the kids quiet at home right pretty easy
to use just get some Angry Birds going
on there we go
of course as we can see Angry Birds on a
plane train or bus now as you can see
they've really really highly customized
Android and I'm not very good sorry I
mean it looks completely different it's
not like any other version of Android as
I've ever seen but it's got everything
you need
and of course it is designed you know
for usage in in buses and trains now
they're completely rewritten it all
they've caches the core kernel so the
apks will work
there's no Google services or anything
like that but uh yeah you know up to 60
different displays being powered it
seems to be really smooth operation
yeah and it's based off Android is based
off Android 4.0 just highly customized
anyway guys starts to like over here
from Computex 2012 just beginning to get
a sense of the flexibility that Android
is offering all these various companies
will have their own agenda but it's cool
to see being used in so many different
areas and really really customizable
alright guys thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
