doesn't actually make pokemon go
investors find out and they freak out
and shares plummet you've probably read
the stories about Nintendo's market cap
doubling in the wake of the global
phenomenon that is Pokemon go the
Nintendo Corporation enjoyed such great
success that it outstripped Sony's 40
billion dollar valuation and posted the
highest single day trading record in
Tokyo in a century but it all seemed to
be based on a slight misconception about
Pokemon go you see Nintendo doesn't
actually make pokemon go when its
investors finally realized this fact
over the weekend they freaked out
dumping Nintendo stock and shedding over
six billion dollars in less than a day
this is actually pretty comical because
people generally should know that big
brand companies often don't make the
product that they're mostly known for
Nike for example doesn't actually make
nike shoes no they outsource that to
other companies usually using child
labor apple doesn't make the iPhone
there the idea generator they do the
design but they outsource that to
Foxconn this is not uncommon it
shouldn't be a scandal it shouldn't even
really be a story but a six billion
dollar loss becomes a story now let's
talk about how Samsung responded to the
failed Galaxy s7 active if you recall
the Galaxy s7 active is offered to 18 to
customers in the US as a water-resistant
and dust resistant device that can
survive immersion in five feet of water
for 30 minutes until it didn't work as
designed brief recap here Consumer
Reports put the Galaxy s7 active in a
water tank pressure 22 point 12 pounds
per square inch which is the equivalent
of just under five feet of water and set
the timer for 30 minutes both of the
units tested failed really badly
resulting in a flickering screen and
moisture inside its parts now Samsung
has responded by saying the Galaxy s7
active passed rigorous tests to ensure
the ip68 certification for water
resistance so they're just denying it
but they did say this
Samsung stands behind this water
resistant certification and will replace
any galaxy s7 active under its standard
limited warranty should water damage
occur so it is unfortunate that Samsung
chose a non-response response but they
are standing behind their warranty I'd
like to hear from anyone who has the s7
active have you had this problem please
let me know in the comments below now
let's talk about the recent leaks
surrounding the galaxy note 7 in these
leaks here you can look at the security
settings and see where there's a new
option below fingerprints called irises
the disclaimer runs through the
limitations of the iris unlock feature
which is painfully long especially if
you were hoping to use them while
wearing glasses or contacts or in
low-light conditions if so you're going
to have a problem but as we saw in the
leaked video a while back in the right
conditions the note 7 iris scanner is
very fast indeed to set it up all you
need to do is position the phone 25 to
30 centimetres from your face with your
eyes in the on-screen circles and let
the front-facing scanner register your
iris other screenshots show the s-pen
air command menu including familiar
options like screen right s note smart
select an action memo but there's also a
new option glance you can also record
sections on the screen and create gifs
on the fly you might recall a while back
how Kurt makassar the CEO of cyanogen
claimed that his company was going to
and I quote put a bullet through
Google's head now they have laid off 30
of their staff that's twenty percent of
their total staff following an extended
executive retreat the majority of those
losing their jobs are on the OS side of
things putting the future of signage ins
vision of a Google less Android in
question but there are rumors floating
around that cyanogen is going to pivot
to creating individual apps but makassar
has taken to social media to refute
these claims and I quote we are an OS
company and our mission of creating an
open android stance he confirmed the
previous reported layoffs explaining
that quote startups and disruption are
brutal well Kurt it's also brutal to
have to eat your own words
