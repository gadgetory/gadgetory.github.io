handy the Android authority app guy and
is about that time of month to round up
the best Android apps that were released
in December if you want to check out any
of these apps for yourself you can find
those links in the video description
below
clip layer is a Microsoft application
from early December it's a simple
screenshot tool that can be launched
pretty much whenever you want you go
into your settings make it your default
assistant and then you'll be able to
long press the home button to initiate
the app you can then tweak which parts
of the screen you want to capture the
only downside is that you'll lose access
to personal assistant applications like
Google now if you use them it's a free
application if you want to try it out
Google went ahead and updated their
Google keyboard to simply G board at its
core it functions almost exactly as
Google keyboard always has the
difference is a nifty little Google
search button that's on the action bar
you can use this to look up everything
from directions to Jeff's without having
to stop whatever you're doing the new
features are a little buggy but we
expect Google to fix that over time it's
still a top-three keyboard for those who
are interested if you can't Lupe's is a
new jiff camera with it you can record
video from your device's camera and you
can also record your device's screen to
make your own gifs on top of that you
can use links from sites like YouTube to
import stuff to turn into gifs as well
you'll be able to create captions and
personalized with emoji to make
everything just right there is also a
share feature just as you'd expect it's
a totally free application if you want
to check it out NBA in play is a fun
little application that you use while
you watch NBA games the central premise
is that you select players that you
think will do well you'll then compete
against your friends or players from
everywhere to see who gets the best it
sinks using the audio from the
basketball game on your television so
you can hop in quickly it's a good
companion app for basketball fans and
you can even win prizes if you do well
enough it's a free download with no
in-app purchases Netflix VR is the
official VR application from Netflix and
it's the Netflix app you'll be using if
you want to watch on Google daydream
that means not everyone can use this one
you log into your account just like you
normally would on the regular Netflix
app the interface is simply a living
room setup where you watch TV and the TV
is where Netflix content plays the
controls are a little weird and the app
is a little buggy but we're sure Netflix
will clean this one up eventually
it's a
free download if that helps PayPal
business is an application for business
owners it provides most of the standard
features of PayPal however the
difference is that allows you to do
things like send invoices manage sales
view account activity transfer money and
access customer info much easier than
the standard app the interface is clean
and takes most of its design cues from
the official PayPal application it has a
few bugs here and there but otherwise it
seems to work pretty well it's also a
free download pyro browser is a
lightweight browser based on chromium
it's a rather simple experience overall
and works about as you'd expect its
claim to fame as the ability to browse
in full screen mode and its built-in ad
block capabilities both of these
features can't be turned on or off at
your discretion and the ad block can be
turned on or off on a per site basis
based on your needs it's a free download
but do beware of those early release
bugs quartz is a news application that
operates like a texting app when you
open the application it'll send you a
text about some news you can then choose
to learn more or pass on that news and
wait for something else you can have the
application send you notifications based
on your preferences as well the quick
nature of the app and the information
provided make it a good way to keep up
to date when doing something like
standing in line at the grocery store
you can also tap on any message to go to
the website source and read more there
it's actually not half bad trusted
contacts is a new Google application
that shares your location you'll open up
the app and then assign some trusted
contacts you can then broadcast your
location to them so that they know where
you are and that you're safe
they can also request your location if
they're worried about you the
application will only send your location
if you don't respond after a set period
of time it's great for things like when
kids go trick-or-treating or during
field trips it's also completely free
after years of being the aftermarket
recovery of choice team win recovery
project released their official app it's
actually an extremely simple app to use
you open it find your device choose the
version of the recovery that you want
and then the application will download
it those who have root access can also
have the recovery flashed right there in
the app this is quickly becoming one of
those applications that virtually all
root users should at least check out do
note that your phone will need to be
able to flash a custom recovery in order
for the flash to actually work and that
about does it for this one folks if you
want to keep watching we have more
absent games lists linked up there on
the screen and in the video description
below don't forget that you can check
out these applications yourself using
the links in the video description below
and keep it tuned to Android Authority
because we are your source for all
things Android thanks again for watching
everybody happy new years and have a
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
