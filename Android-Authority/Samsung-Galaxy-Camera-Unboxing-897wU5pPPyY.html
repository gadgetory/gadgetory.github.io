Android Authority and you're about to
see me unbox my new Android camera right
here on our YouTube channel Android is a
very powerful and flexible mobile
operating system it can power
smartphones it can power tablets it can
power televisions it can power watches
and yes it can power a point-and-shoot
cameras such as the Samsung Galaxy
camera EKG c100 I have one right here
still inside it's sealed box and I'm
very excited to see what's inside but
let me tease myself first by examining
the box itself here's the top side
showing a picture of the camera here's
the front side with just the model names
back highlights and Samsung URL on the
opposite side is a catch phrase it says
shoot Wow
share now this camera promises to
produce excellent photos and allows
instant sharing as this print says this
is no ordinary point-and-shoot camera
it's a smart camera here are the left
and right sides just informational and
protective stickers here the bottom side
has a list of the cameras main specs
this is a network capable device
particularly HSPA+ and Wi-Fi it has a
four core processor camera resolution is
16 megapixels screen diagonal is 4.8
inches just about the same diagonal
length as the one at the galaxy s3 but
no Super AMOLED here this time instead
the display technology is HD Super Clear
LCD and look at this it's a jelly bean
device quite a tease this box huh
now let's see what we have inside here's
the camera unit itself it's the white
variant and looks very classy it's very
beautiful though I myself am not very
fond of Gangnam style designs which this
phone loudly and proudly has here's the
housing for the 23 millimeter lens it's
still under the Samsung Galaxy series
here's the screen still covered in
protective plastic this is an Android
camera it has a quad-core CPU and uses
HD Super Clear LCD technology we'll take
a closer look at this later let's see
what else is inside the box here's a
packet containing the user guides and
warranty card and a white wrist strap
which looks like it's made of leather it
this one's the USB cable for charging
and data connection one end as you can
see is standard microUSB here is the
power adapter you'll need to assemble
this first here's the battery it's a
slim battery lithium ion rated at 1650
mAh
let's take a closer look at this
beautiful piece of samsung technology
here's the battery compartment let's put
the battery in this one's the Micro SIM
slot this one's the micro SD card slot
and this one in the middle is the micro
HDMI port this one's the battery cover
log this one's the cover for the micro
HDMI port it's not easy to pry open this
one's the tripod socket so you can screw
this camera to a tripod for stability
when taking photos here's the lens
housing with silver border this can zoom
in up to 21 times so you can capture
more detail here's the Samsung logo and
the auto focus assist lamp here's the
textured grip it feels a little bit
rubbery so this won't easily slip from
the hand this one's the microUSB port
with a cover that's rather hard to pry
open this one's the strap mount for
attaching the wrist strap and this one
is the headset jack at the top here is
the flash assembly here's the power
button this one's the zoom button this
is the shutter button and this one's the
microphone hole on the right side here's
the flash release button the loudspeaker
grille is down here the flash pops out
when you press this button
alright let's turn this thing on we
press the power button here it's booting
up it's gonna take a while because it's
the first time to boot up here's the
setup screen it's similar to what you'd
see in a brand new Android phone from
Samsung it will ask you for your Google
account credentials and so on this
camera also has 350 gigabytes of Dropbox
storage let's just skip the setup
screens for now here's the home screen
whoa very lovely very smooth and very
fluid look at that
navigation is very seamless this camera
has Android 4.1.1 jelly bean which
explains the insane smoothness of the
interface the rest of the interface is
very much jellybean with Samsung
TouchWiz so if you have a recent Samsung
phone the interface should be familiar
and experience similar let's try taking
a photo Wow awesome colors tap to focus
is very quick but there's some shutter
lag of about 1 to 2 seconds we'll
examine more of the interface in our
full review so stay tuned for it so this
is one of Samsung's newest celebrities
the Samsung Galaxy camera EKG c100 what
do you think of this camera share your
