original android hangout show on google+
I'm Derek Ross and I'm Scott Anderson
this week we're joined with returning
guest dan Charlton of team it Colonels
who hasn't developed a colonel in a
while I don't know if I'm going to have
to change my intro here soon for him
he's waiting for all the Intel processor
SEO and at the end fellow android
enthusiast Johnny Frank Joe Johnson
Franklin welcome back welcome back so if
everybody all right so Scott what are we
going to talk about this this week
although we got a lot of Android updates
this week this week in general has been
a lot of big news Android ecosystem
stuff um we are gonna be talking about
some device updates coming to y'all and
some rumors we're going to go on over
and we got a lot of app updates from
Google in particular and other providers
as well we're going to go over some
routing and raman stuff and then we're
going to finish up with some patent wars
Daniels favorite sections isolettes hit
the big news of the week so android 4.1
2 was released two days ago um AOSP was
released so those of you that are into
rooting and raman you'll be excited to
know that um just real quick if a few
notification changes we're done with
with android 4.1 point to know a lot of
bug fixes you know you know stability
performance yadda yadda yadda but the
major thing that a lot of people are to
notice me you can do a notification
expansion and contraction and jelly bean
now with just one finger you don't have
to figure out some weird way to like
pinch and zoom like a tiny little
section of your screen you know you
don't have a fat finger it anymore you
can just slide up and slide down some
pretty neat there's some why five fixes
on enterprise network so that use wpa
enterprise encryption and a few other
things up a lot of under the hood
changes as far as we can tell
far the nexus 7 was the first device to
receive that over the air update so if
you haven't gotten again you know you
can either spam your check now button
you can try clearing the cache foot in
and in for stopping the Google services
framework app or there's a whole bunch
ways you can do you can manually
download it and and flash it yourself
you can adb side loader there's all
sorts of way so go ahead and check our
website on various ways you can manually
install that if you did not get the
update yet personally I unrooted Nexus 7
and I've tried every way possible and
I'm yet to see it update that's I
actually 80 be side-loaded it as soon as
soon as I found that download link I
downloaded it in flash instead and ADB
side load it's real simple way for those
who they don't know Mom atb silence as
I've said now like 10 times is you
download the over-the-air update patch
file it's like 35 Meg you download that
directly from Google servers you reboot
to recovery cuz you know you don't need
to be Rudy don't get completely stock
recovery yeah you reboot you plug your
USB cable and the n-type actually book
before you even type anything you need
to go to stock recoveries you select ply
supply or apply update from a DB and
then you open up your command line
interface and you you type adb sideload
really long filename or whatever you
reduce you save the zip file to hit
enter it transfers it to your device it
applies the update and a few minutes
later everything's it's extremely simple
so Scott you should try that if you're
tired of spam in your button might have
to try that and I might just wait until
Google actually pushes it to me because
I kind of want to know how long it'll
take for Google to push it to me as
opposed to waiting for verizon so I'm
just kind of curious about that we got
tried clearing the cache yeah I mean
there's all sorts of neat little ways to
get it all right so besides me
7.the the Galaxy Nexus hspa+ version you
can get from the Play Store that the
attack jus version the factory images
are now available for that which are Jay
Z 0 54 k as well as the yak to version
which is the original global version of
the HEA hspa+ version of the galaxy
nexus that was actually out of tonight a
day later and just a little bit ago
actually the nexus s was added as a
factory image too so if you're you're
running stock or or not actually if
you're rooted to and you want to get
those on your gsm gox nexus or your
nexus s you can just download the
factory images and go ahead and flash
those if you're if you haven't had the
update push to you yet there's all sorts
of ways to manually get it um yeah so
Verizon Galaxy Nexus friend Galaxy Nexus
not so much um let's say two days since
it was released the nexus s in the nexus
7 or galaxy nexus gsm variants got it
within two days um i'm not gonna hold my
breath until the verizon or sprint
version gets that's just me no I don't
know you guys can do it up little bit
like a late Christmas present well I'll
tell you what we'll talk about how you
can get it other ways and ring the ramen
here a little bit a little bit later in
the show um what a related note to
factor images the Nexus Q has its ICS
image actually posted available for your
restoration pleasure if you decide that
hack the heck out of it you can now get
that back to factory Nexus Q goodness um
every single Nexus device has now
Android 4.1 point2 binaries available
basically you and I really don't care
about this unless your unless your
ramdev and then then you know you're
going to Rome to have all the things
you're going to download the play this
binary for sin slap them in your custom
roms we'll get to that a little bit
later in the show um moving on to more
Android news or
SI android news depending on how you
want to look at it or not to yeah
remember last week on the show we were
all excited about all these awesome
things coming to android 4.2 as we
typically are about new Android releases
yeah yeah so we were jumping down up and
down high five in you know we're doing
webcam NFC all sorts of crazy stuff yeah
we were we were we were really excited
about all these things coming well it
turns out that that they they were
fabricated android and me android and me
um where there was originally report
that it turns out that their source was
unconfirmed and was a hoax a trickster
playing a big hoax on the android
community they actually submitted the
story to a bunch of different the
android sites and we one of them took
the bait per se and you know what that
that sucks but hey we got to find out
about project LOL which jbq and dan
murrell let us know in google+ that the
project LOL was fully underway per se is
good for the letdown i'll laugh at the
same time yeah you know who knows maybe
some of those things will come to
fruition maybe not we'll find out here i
guess we'll find out here probably less
than a month if rumors are going you
know in firmers are going to develop on
time which we'll get to that later in
the show after we talked about some some
app updates this week's guy okay so we
move on to our app updates and new
releases so Google Plus the mobile app
got updated google plus page owners can
view post and comment from mobile this
is nice for companies or people that
have a bunch of pages on that want to
represent their brand and do easily
through a mobile device which they
really haven't been able to do before
also you can discover new people and
topics it's a new section if you swipe
to the left it's called fine people it's
kind of a nice setup needs a little bit
of work i think but it's nice for the
most part also you have an
new home screen widget and this home
screen widget has been redesigned so
many times I don't remember when it
wasn't even in the app but it it doesn't
have a scrollable it's on a scrollable
widgets you go from post to post and you
can't go back it's very odd and there's
a list of many of them right so yeah
that's no manager page feature yet I
have not can I tell you how awesome it's
not or is it not know so you would think
it would be awesome because we've wanted
this ability those of us that have pages
that we would like to manage well yeah
you have to sign out of your account
back out to the year in the home screen
then when you go to relaunch the app and
says hey do you want to sign in is your
email address your gmail account or add
a new account so now when you click your
email address like when you first very
first launched Google+ it comes up so
what I want to do I want to login as me
or then it lists all of your pages so
every single TIFF you you know
administrate multiple pages is such a
huge pain but even for one page you have
to sign out of your account close the
app relaunch it sign back in type all
your stuff view your notifications which
of you that every time oh yeah every
time and then and now here's what's me
so instant upload one of my favorite
features of the Google+ app your
pictures automatically get posted well
whenever you first launched the Google+
app brand new spank a nap new app you
have to go in and say I want to turn on
instant upload yeah you have to do that
to every single time you sign out to
manage a page so if you use instant
upload it's not enabled whenever you
sign back in it is is there across you
know I have to go in and did you turn on
instant upload every time okay I mean
the function the functionality is there
it's just you know slowly getting there
I mean okay is it so this should be
don't like gmail where you got a packed
into the spinner off topic cuz it's
nothing wrong account yeah that's
you're right John has got the best of
any really male type functionality is it
better than nothing yes in a pinch if
you have to make a post from mobile what
you will you do it yes will it suck yeah
but if you need to do it for mobile you
couldn't do it before yeah I mean it's
bad but at least the functionality is
there right yeah that's very true next
rather large and app that makes me very
happy and I know it makes Daniel very
happy to Google Play Store got updated
to 3.9 point 16 so if you guys remember
back in August that's when it was
updated last so in this new version you
can go if you go into my apps and then
you swipe over to the right side so all
apps you can multi-select apps by long
pressing one and then tapping any which
way any more apps so just like you would
select many emails in gmail it works the
same way and when you select let's say
you select 10 apps and they're not
installed or purchased apps you can
remove them from your history so this
has been nice because if you go into a
app an app that you want to try out but
you don't want to use it for a long time
it will stay in your history but this
way you can get or get rid of it which
is really really nice and kind of
letting himself every place for history
it gets very cluttered yeah especially
with those like you know nonsense AB C's
download and it's like oh no don't want
that yeah next is basically it the
google play store keeps track of your
location enlists so let's say you're in
the my app section and let's say you
want to go over to the all apps well if
you're going on the all apps and seeing
your history and then popping back to
your installed in my apps it would never
remember your location the list food
always have to scroll back to the bottom
wheel all the way back down yeah declare
yeah people used to play
store a lot and download a lot of apps
you know what I'm talking about download
the new one and you will love it it
wasn't serious yeah also it happen yeah
also the app update notifications are
now expandable which is nice and also
the the images for a nap width
downloading has changed and also when
you have downloaded an app and it is in
your notification bar when you pull down
the notification bar it actually has a
big icon for the app on the left as
opposed to that generic image that was
there before which is nice and it add
some color to the install apps which
didn't have before and then also um yeah
pretty much it adds a lot of
functionality and a lot of stuff in the
code is kind of leaked like wish lists
and all this new stuff that is coming
and some stuff with malware and a lot of
things to come for the Google+ village
mahalo we're against malware oh yeah
against not malware's but getting a nice
boy comes with your very own belviq
against malware okay odd derek was what
was going on with Google TV yeah so so
speaking of devices being updated to you
know with a new version of google play
google TV is following suit and they
actually got a whole bunch of play
updates starting Monday um playing
movies some devices actually got a
little bit early last week than they
have talked about last week but play
movies is now available for Google TV
playing music as well not play music
once again it was available a while ago
but not on all devices so the basically
Google TV is placed during all the
things starting with Sony devices a
revamped version of Google Play is
rolling out all the vices will
eventually get it so if you have a
logitech revue or the vizio co-star you
can look towards the later end of this
month to get those updates but right now
those of you that are getting it
it's basically like the Play Store
version that's on your phone or on your
tablet versus you know like the current
or the old version didn't look anything
like the play store that you would use
on your phone your tablet they're
completely different looking now it's
the same at basically the it looks
exactly the same you know there's
different the same type of categories
and everything so it they're really
integrating google play into into google
TV so if you have purchases of movies
that you've bought through Play you can
watch them on google play movies and TV
so so it's great I've tried it out and I
love it it's coming along very nicely
there's there's still a few things you
know personally that I have issues with
on the coast are but it's getting better
and this is a rumor that will be getting
better soon so you know that that's good
i'm happy to see google continuing to
update google TV and make it better okay
so moving on an app updates Dropbox got
an update to version 2 dot 2 and
basically what's new and this one is you
can look at your pictures and videos in
a better way basically they've
introduced a new Photos tab you can look
at all of your photos and videos that
are uploaded and it's very fast and it's
a very easy way to see all of the camera
uploads that you've enabled on your
device if you have and also you can
upload upload zip moved into the menu in
the file browser and a lot of under the
hood things have been fixed as well next
we have Zagat Google's acquisition that
they made earlier was it earlier this
year or last is messier this summer ok
so this summer on they purchase Zagat
which was a commerce this summer they've
had sang it for a while it was over a
year i think okay so basically Google
they came out with a Zagat app um it's
basically like Google Local in maps but
this app is just a standalone app um my
experience has been ok the only bummer
about it and I kind of understand it but
you need a Google+ account in order to
use it so I think a lot of people will
you know that will rub people the wrong
way because if I need a Facebook account
right if I need a Twitter account in
order to sign into something that makes
me angry it makes me angry only because
I don't want to use Facebook and trigger
and we prefer to use Google+ but tons of
people are happy with those things yeah
right let's yeah but all the time
integrate drone services in their own
ABS I mean yeah like i like i like ones
where it gives you a selection of
options and you can use your group of
credentials i mean i don't really see
that is being very different from your
google+ account because it's the same
thing but it's pulling all the data and
it's watching all the data from Google
Plus local and that's what it runs off
of it's actually not like a true
standalone product with one remember
when they updated the privacy policy
that they would share information from
product to product yeah I don't think
that this Zagat or Zagat as a company
ain't or a mobile app applies to that
how in the one wouldn't be honest with
you because it was a new acquisition and
it was made before that so it's not
written in there well speculations are
speculations I my way to see why it
wouldn't wouldn't be included in that
but hey I'm not a acquisition lawyer and
I don't read to service I just blindly
click accept and agree like every other
dumb American that doesn't repay it
regardless I like the fact that Google's
pushing google+ ok ok next app update is
foxfi if you guys have a Galaxy Nexus
from verizon and it's not rooted I know
a couple people that do you and you want
to Wi-Fi tether what I said and we feel
sorry for you we do feel sorry for you
and if you want a way to tether Wi-Fi
tether to your tablet or some other
device on without root then spies
the app for you and actually didn't push
an update to the app
store or to the Play Store it just
changed in the code some out on their
servers I don't know how it changed oh
yeah yeah i saw the developers like huh
I didn't do anything yeah cookbook but
now it works for jellybean device works
now yeah so jelly bean devices good news
and then nod Jonathan what happened with
contacts they finally fixed the contact
sync on there in where it doesn't
continually feed you low resolution
photos even though that you've updated
it you know you go to gmail and go to
your contacts in Gmail the image that
you upload now will not be compressed
down and pixelated anymore it will be
too high view your contacts think is
finally fixed on there in so you clear
out all your contact data whatever
you're going to get high-quality image
now where it's been broken for we've
been complaining about that for years
they said but any one of these are nice
to see that looks exactly like the
Google+ image upload to change your
profile or banner picture its own old
you know 2005 interface you could drag
and drop now you open your veil pretty
quickly across your make sure everything
you know it's the same thing that we
using google plus and it's nice i've
tried it out what is it 720p good no i'm
not sure the resolution but it's what
was the 01 like 96 96 right so anything
ya see somebody's face pop up on your
phone is just really wild card intuition
devices are nowadays well that when the
not even devices i mean the sheer file
size we have LTE networks that can deal
with that right now so i mean you know
why not plus you cast that locally
anyway you know which doesn't have
expandable storage but yeah
they destroyed the system and data
partition so it doesn't actually hit
your storage so stop your whining so was
this a certified pusher what was yes so
I've been able to store high-resolution
pictures in your contacts either on the
device or in you know in gmail or
otherwise no one it synced and I think
their server side effect out yeah yeah
so you were cool as long as you never
synced your contacts okay yeah which
normal device yeah let's move on to some
device rumors Oh scada I hear I hear
Samsung is getting making things smaller
well yeah this isn't really a rumor um
it was kind of mouse it was announced
today right in the Germany yeah uh
basically if t hat deutschland um
samsung released the galaxy s3 mini um
kind of a lackluster they kind of talked
it up I need a s3 equivalent but this
smaller so basically what it has it as a
dual-core 1 gigahertz processor as an
800 x 400 to paramus play on DGA support
for the front camera 5 megapixel back
camera on Bluetooth 4.0 NFC eighty eight
or 16 gig onboard memory it does have a
microSD expansion slot as a 1500
milliamp hour battery which I don't know
how that's device is going to survive um
it's just whether the last a good little
low resolution uh yeah and another
things I run it runs Android for not one
jellybean and I think a reason why the
battery so small is I don't think it has
LTE know so that might be this is
thinking they announced it in Germany
for a reason this is not an American
spec device because those bands are also
AT&amp;amp;T only barely yeah I wonder if
they're going to be bringing this to LTE
networks I I would have figured that big
of a degree whatever processor that is
for of 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
that dragon then they're differently
that's all they need to do so out of
this release what do you guys think do
you guys think Samsung talked it up a
little bit too much or you guys think
that this is a okay device I think this
is dead on arrival in America and it
doesn't like I don't see a E and it
doesn't have a leggy so neither none of
the other three carriers are going to
take it okay if if somebody was looking
for a mid-level phone at a fifty-dollar
to 100 dollar price range with a mail-in
rebate of physiology prefer take abroad
for 50 bucks you know what get to get
the razor in but if you don't want the
razr m then though very there you go the
galaxy that's three mini for fifty bucks
if thats its price i mean the thing is
this this device on these sexist is
useless America must you okay Mulder no
it doesn't support team oh oh oh snap
much bands but that's it I just wonder
how it's gonna succeed and I wonder how
their privy an iphone on these girls are
gonna be no data or no high-speed data I
Derek I what's this about the nexus 4
you know what I hate that name um so so
uh it's short move on and that's more
than nexus rumors so we have the LG
Nexus 4 or the LG Nexus G or the LG
optimus Nexus it's been called a lot of
things chances are it's you know we're
starting to lean towards the nexus for
this because we've seen inventory cause
the nexus 4 so that that's kind of
confusing to me and I even what the hell
I'm talking about early so I can act
like it pretty well so we do have the
nexus one right the first Nexus then the
nexus 2 is you know the nexus s and the
next um you know the third Nexus was the
Galaxy Nexus so the fourth Nexus
smartphone would be the nexus 4 but we
also have a nexus 7 which wasn't named
because it was you know the seventh
Nexus devices has said
because it was a seven inch device and
the nexus for the LG Nexus as a 4.7 inch
phone which is basically five so I'm
confused as hell I don't like the name
Nexus 4 it's good to confuse people that
don't know what the hell they're talking
about but then again most people never
heard of a nexus phone anyway so you
know it might might end up working out
with but yeah I they're gonna bring out
a pack of them and it's gonna be four
five six oh yeah if that ends up
happening but I just I don't know it's a
confusing name I think I don't like it
but besides the name so about a
Belarusian website on liner besides who
leaked all sorts of Nexus Gooden this
past week first they started out by a
leak in a couple pictures you know a
showing hey we have this in our hand you
know which was better than the previous
leaks from a Russian forum actually that
had a whole bunch of blurry pictures so
we like doing a little better quality
pictures and then they went crazy and
released high-resolution photos they had
a full 360-degree spin of the device so
they actually have the device in their
hand and they compared it to the iphone
5 hold the tube a side-by-side you know
hands up in the air one and one hand one
on the other into a drop test them
videos because so they have the vice it
it's coming i mean they're holding in
their hands it's not if this is no
photoshop um they also confirm the specs
so the they said the nexus a4 well come
with a 4.7 inch display with which you
know we can already knew since it's
basically an optimist g it's a 1280 by
768 pixels which is unusual well that's
16 green and i think is it and it has a
1.5 gigahertz quad-core Qualcomm
processor and 2 gigs of RAM which I said
that Optimus G here we're talking about
it the internals are basically that the
external is not it's different shell and
actually in my opinion looks like a
Galaxy Nexus from the front
if you were to hold the two side by side
stand back a few feet your way huh
there's two gods next I mean I that's
what they look like in my opinion on
similar enough about I don't think it
was broken to need to fix it honestly I
thought I like okay I understand that
now the pictures that are out there
don't show as much curved glass may be
slightly I don't know if that's just cuz
it's a picture and I want to see it in
my head yeah I it may be ever so
slightly curved glass um the back of it
is cannot the same as the you know the
Galaxy Nexus it looks completely
different the cameras off to the side
and then the back cover boy actually
came take off the back cover so it makes
it very very different in the Galaxy
Nexus but the back cover um has oh I was
like a crystal design pattern matrix
thingy it's pretty neat-looking I think
I like it almost reminds you of like the
live wallpaper that the nexus one hand
almost and but in like a physical form
um anyways back to the phone specs 8 8
megapixel rear facing camera and they're
saying that at least the version they
have comes with eight gig of internal
storage so right now immediately
everyone's gonna yell oh my god only
eight gig and no SD card what are we
going to do well you know maybe this is
the incredibly cheap version that
they're going to sell in the Play Store
for everyone to use you know everyone
sorry everyone to buy and maybe this
will be the $99 version the
hundred-dollar version whatever it's
going to be it's going to be really
cheap um will we see a 16 gig variant oh
you know I'm gonna guess and I'm gonna
say yeah we probably will we see a 32
you know so but they're going to have to
make something bigger than just ate you
know that's my opinion so um the the
nexus 4 was also rumored to launch
according to a separate website a French
newspaper reported that on october 29
there's going to be a global launch said
you know
no word from google and not to confirm
but it's exciting to know that here in
just a few weeks it's going to globally
launch if that rumor you know pans out
to be true but I mean as many leaks as
we're getting from this you know I mean
every day and something new leaks from
this phone so it is not as another
well-kept secret it's definitely coming
in the fact that more and more things
keep leaking means that it's going to
come soon um but another week has passed
a week Carphone Warehouse late to
screenshot of their internal sales
system showing that it's called the
Nexus 4 and then it comes in black and
it also comes in white so that's good
mean I said it's just another
confirmation that it's coming um I can I
kind of want to go back to the nexus 4
or is it getting to the point where
hardware is not what we're looking
forward to not necessarily but it's all
software that we are like oh these are
new things that we can do are you
kidding me as you see my great advice
yeah I honestly think that Nexus needs
hardware more than they need software at
this point for the specific us no I agar
that but the thing is functionality with
with software like things that are
updated I mean it what would be more
desirable for you guys a you know a
badass you know hardware and lesser
software or better software lesser
hardware why can't I have no no no I
agree with you there and that's what we
had to do well I think the biggest
problem with Google's software isn't the
base operating system anymore as much as
it is all the services that can offer
that would be updated on the Play Store
like google voice needs to be updated um
you know converging messaging services
converging new servant and this is all
stuff that doesn't really need an
operating system upgrade to accomplish
and so for that reasoning I guess I'd
lean
or toward wine to see that I think there
are a couple areas the Galaxy Nexus
needed needs to improve on like battery
life camera battery life camera and
maybe you know obviously speed with
newer supposedly new amazing battery
technology you know so we'll see where
that goes on the IPS display will help
cut down on battery there yeah a special
on google apps because anything with a
white background is just murdered own
led disparate ok so obviously we want
things that are better overall you're
like better screen better battery life
things like that but are there anything
any new things that you might add to a
device if you could like would wireless
charging be something that you would
want if it's there I'll take it but it's
not something I necessarily go out of my
way for ok good I mean you still gonna
take a plug around just to up the
poor yeah I'm gonna be not gonna yeah
you know plug in the mat by my you know
desk and yeah possibly for my desk
instead of having to plug it in it's
nice to have if you go or in a
stationary you know if I wanted to take
a charger to work it really just say
it's not much anything more than you
know it's cool to look at it but yeah I
think that wireless charging would be
something that as it becomes more
Universal just like NFC it'll be more of
a desirable thing to have it'll be kind
of like a no-brainer you can Co to the
airport or something and maybe a table
in a restaurant just set your phone down
you know takes care exactly and that's
the guest standardized to that extent
and it would be worth having yeah so
let's talk about another nexus rumor
over the past week whole carphone
warehouse and they're they're all about
taking screenshots of their internal
system and posting them anonymously on
the web it looks like it looks like
there's going to be a seven in the nexus
7 32 gig variant coming out very very
shortly that will replace
the 16 gig because the 16 gig on our
website was listed as end of life so
actually someone actually bought one I
believe they bought a 16 gig and they
got a 32 gig in a jam and Japan so it's
definitely coming then somebody
accidentally got one so let's let's talk
about some very far-fetched rumors based
on maybe a few far fetching facts
motorola awesome and motorola manta ray
so over the past week and actually even
in the past even for going even further
back various android blogs including
ours android authorities we looked at
our server logs we look at our Google
Analytics walls and we see devices
called Holcomb and manta ray and they're
running Android 4.2 apparently so so why
do we think these are motorola device as
well Occam's razor is basically a theory
a line of reasoning stating that the
simplest answer is most often the
correct answer and so who makes a device
that's called a razor well motorola so
is that is it a far reach yes but it's
not too far i don't think um the manta
ray well is that a tablet while you go
look back at motorola and you say the
stingray and the wing ray of the
Stingray a wing ray where Motorola's
Wi-Fi ltd zoom so it is it going to be
the next tablet is it going to be the
manta ray well maybe but but also the
zune was also referred to as the manta
ray when it first came out and people
were calling it the manta ray so google
/ motorola could be just testing 4.2 on
it it might not be a completely new
device you know like i said it's all
speculation well no but
it's it's fun to talk about you is it is
it a new Nexus tablet is it just a
motorola tablet is it the same one who
knows is this a new motorola phone is it
a motorola nexus fingers crossed
confidence probably average so i I'd
like to see a motorola Nexus I'd like
for this to turn out to be a motorola
Nexus you motorola makes has some great
hardware great gps great you know radios
great signal strength you know it's
pretty much top of the line when it
comes to connectivity so i'd like to see
it they don't quality too yeah you could
beat the crap out of somebody with the
zoom well they were thinking addendums
so its weaponry that's it for nexus
rumors i mean i'm sure next week we're
gonna have another another big batch
alone because we're gonna keep reporting
them non-stop until the device is
actually unless they're a rumored launch
date for the yeah i'm saying that early
October 29th yeah i mean if that truly
is the launch date for the new Nexus um
we're going to be getting a lot more
stuff very soon and it'll be a constant
flow of rumors pictures devices new OS
features stuff like that it'll be a
constant flow which we love here alright
so that's a couple quick hits here just
to talk about motorola razr HD at the
droid razr HD depending on the what you
want to call it and also the droid razr
maxx HD the official launch date for
them it was finally announced it's just
going to be here in a week October 18th
which so if you remember the
announcement arbitrary a while ago these
phones you know amazing battery life
great screens you know nice hardware so
definitely definitely you know check
them out if you're interested in a new
film but this would be one of the better
overall phones as far as for like we
said signal quality
this if you want to lead your family to
get one that you don't have to worry
about that's probably going people when
they take them to it definitely um so
let's talk about written in ramen you
know as we said earlier in the show that
Android is now up to four point one
point two so those of you there root in
Rome you want to you know you obviously
you're not getting them any type of
over-the-air update from from from
google since that functionality was
removed and your custom rom so where can
you get four point one point two well
cyanogenmod there they're pretty beastly
on the following day after the 4.1 1.2
announcement the first nightly yesterday
1010 that 1010 nightly came with four
point one point two on nearly every
device had a nightly available I I think
as well as their milestone one release
or sorry milestone two or month two
depending on what you want to call it
the end the series the m-series to that
was released today is 4.1 point to as
well bugless beast came out with 4.1
point 2 above this beast is pretty much
a stock Android ROM with very very few
changes you know there's a reboot menu
couple text messages and changes and
that's really yeah you know a tweaker to
the colonel i mean it's it's pretty much
stock android great wrong i used to run
it for a very long time for switched
over to to see em once seems battery
life and lag left so but with me is
another great rom it's all up to date
and paranoid android well paranoid
android is built off of CM so obviously
starting on 1010 paranoid android became
4.1 point2 as well there's a few other
smaller roms out there but the couple
the other popular ones aren't up to date
yet i'm sure it will be coming soon but
if you're itching for some 4.1 point2
you got to get that paranoid android
bugless beast or cyanogenmod now so
there's a few other small ones that have
available but the
the big guys big guys are working at as
you can see um twerk if you're at work
fan the team win custom recovery project
they updated today to version 2.3
points0 they have a couple tiny little
features and bug fixes the biggest one
that I noticed we're in the changelog
was a charging indicator now it always
said that you were you know what way
your battery percentage was when you
were in to work but now the charging
indicator is there and it's updated
every 60 seconds let you know it's
actually charging um it was rebased off
the latest AOSP code they added to a TV
side load code and faster boot
supposedly a few tweaks like I said so I
want to go and snag that you can install
it through a good manager if you use
that just you know install open scrip
Recovery Manager no go ahead and update
that if it's available for your device
and you can also download it and
flashing mainly if you wish to do that
all right so let's move on to Daniel's
favorite section patent boars so the
appeals court reversed um the injunction
on samsung galaxy nexus in yes yes and
pre freshly actually oh god again why
don't you summarize it and then i'll go
on into samsung's response because i
love their response yeah so basically
they said that Apple couldn't prove that
people were buying the Galaxy Nexus
because it had search functions or
because i had aggregated search
functions they couldn't prove that this
particular patent was doing anything in
any way shape or form to cost them any
business whatsoever so even if it is
bound to be infringing the damages
aren't going to be reasonable enough to
merit an injunction in the first place
so yeah they basically said the judge
cove the woman who's running the samsung
purchase apple trial using her
discretion and totally rejected the
injunction now then how'd that make you
feel then discrediting her like that and
calling her out well it's always nice to
see judges not doing their job get told
that they're not doing their job
it is the second time in like two weeks
that the appeals court has slapped down
in a junction out of her Court now can
there be ramifications for her actions I
don't know I don't know the particulars
of you know exactly where she sits in
the court I might be an appointed
position in which case it's an
impeachment thing where you're some
appointed positions are for a term some
are for life some judges are elected so
I just yet I don't know because I mean
one would assume if you rule in the
wrong way that's incorrect um that's not
only think there are the legal
ramifications for that I mean
potentially you could get just borrowed
I would soon okay well samsung responded
to the reversal injunction on the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus miska what base
what they said is they said we welcome
this reversal by the Federal Circuit by
finding that the district court abused
its discretion in order ordering a
preliminary injunction against the
Galaxy Nexus today's decision confirms
that the role of patent law is to
prevent is to protect innovation and not
to unreasonably stifle competition and
restrict consumer choice we will
continue to take all appropriate
measures to ensure the availability of
our innovative products good this
pavement yes and in separate Apple
Samsung legal nonsense uh in the ITC the
international trade cork Apple has been
basically complaining and accusing
Samsung of abusing its obligations under
fran fair reasonable and
non-discriminatory restrictions for
standards essentials patents and the ITC
pretty much just totally rejected every
part of apples argument just ripped it
to pieces Apple is basically saying
Samsung's is trying to impose an
injunction because we can't come to an
agreement on a fee for these ads well
there is a
says that's built for that exact problem
that Apple completely didn't bother
trying to hear they're just going
straight to court in an effort to lower
the price of the patents and so the ITC
rejected that all together interesting
it's always good to ceiling big balls
yeah they also said that Samsung even
under friend obligations has no
obligation for their opening offer in a
negotiation to be fair and reasonable or
non-discriminatory if you had an
obligation to negotiate in good faith
it's very interesting to see a company
like that trying to overreach and
getting denied well I mean part of it is
this is how Fran patent licensing has
worked for four years and years and
Apple is just waiting into this and
trying to run around saying no no we
made up all of this we're the best we
know everything but they're building on
the back of all of these standards
essentials patents that they don't have
any of and they don't understand how
they work not just in terms of like the
tech of how those pieces of technology
function but they don't understand how
the system around those patents works
and their action in the design patents
fear has disrupted things enough that
the tally a shin is all of these
standards such as patents and Apple
isn't willing to play by the rules
they're trying to play by the rules as
they want them to be but not by the
rules as they are sure I don't see that
he can make design patents more valuable
than to be as dollars it took to build
the cell phone industry to be exactly
well Eric Schmidt made some comments
about what he thought the the patent
industry was doing this week yeah he was
being pretty forward about it well I
don't really think anybody well some
people obviously do I don't think
there's too many people will do let me
rephrase that that think software
patents are are the best thing in the in
the world I think they need to be there
but they need to be there in a different
way so Derek you had some things you
wanted to touch
I'm just a few miscellaneous stuff here
actually I mean it's all related to the
Android BBQ that's next week so as I
said yeah the Android barbecues next
week um if you're into collecting
android minis you know i have a oh I
have a few back there my shrine um
you'll be happy to know that there'll be
two special edition special edition for
the Android BBQ minis released next week
if you're there if you're attending the
big Android BBQ you'll get to pick them
up for twenty bucks for the set the one
guy has like a Hawaiian shirt on and a
camera and he's like a forest almost you
know he's partying in the summer the
other guys grilling out on a grill you
know he's he's cooking them hamburgers
hot dogs a steak BBQ who knows maybe BBQ
says it is the Android BBQ I guess so
yeah he's ponies grilling out that's
pretty cool um they're nice they're very
well-designed I like a mom like I said
you pick off for twenty bucks on site
yet if you're at the BBQ if you don't
attend the BBQ don't worry you will have
you will have a fair shot like everybody
else too mad dash to the dead zebra
website and buy them in exactly 11 0 is
11am or 11pm I'm not sure on the details
on that 11am I'm going to gas because
that's when the other ones went on sale
on october 20th so so i'll double check
in the details if i'm wrong but yeah so
start spamming the the website if you
want to pick those up they're going to
go fast in my opinion and also remember
last week I made a few references 20 a
pink gorilla suit um so it looks like
that's gonna happen so so I have friends
enemies on to call that that has donated
money to this cause they raised they
raised the entire amount one hundred
eighty dollars to buy a hundred eighty
dollar pink full-body gorillas fuzzy
suit
and apparently it's happening on fellow
android enthusiasts Jody Barnes is going
to pick it up in a few days and yeah so
I'm sure we have all sorts of fun video
and photos to post from the BBQ of me
and that but I can't let him down you
know if they're they're buying it I I
jokingly agreed to it I never thought it
would actually happen but uh I didn't
notice the focus of this joke turned we
came from turntable FM when a whole
bunch of us in the BBQ and a whole bunch
and George fans were in there DJ well is
where the monkey suit came fast by the
monkey suit came from our hood I quit
back sorry I it all makes sense now so
you need a thousand points to get a
gorilla suit I don't remember how I
started are all the details and one of
the things was something like hey we
should use turntable don FM to DJ at the
pool party and I said something like oh
you know maybe by the time the BBQ comes
around I'll be able to be cool i'll have
a thousand points to be a gorilla and
one thing led to another and i said well
hey if I had a gorilla suit I bj at the
barbecue in a gorilla suit and
apparently someone said well let's make
that happen let's find a gorilla suit
for you to wear and ice again if you
find a suit all where you know we're in
the moment is a heat of the moment it
was a good time until they actually
found a pink one and until everybody bid
money to actually make me wear it but
hey I'm gonna have a good time but on a
happy note today I reached a thousand
points on turntable so now i can truly
DJ as a gorilla wearing a gorilla suit
so yeah we'll post pictures next week
sure that's an amazing accomplishment by
the way it's an android achievement
unlocked Bravo and tell you know now
there's gonna be a lot of achievements
unlocked at the BBQ that's all I know I
mean it there's good is it's gonna be a
good time there's going to be a whole
bunch of developers there's gonna be a
whole bunch of fans whole bunch of
vendors a bunch of swag come on your
Google+ bragging rights you know what
I'm gonna mix I'm gonna go to schemer
since I I know schemers meant for this
right go there and put all these things
to do at the bar
q and cherem don't shake your head i'm
doing i'm already rolled in creighton
right now okay alright guys so so let us
know what you think of the Nexus rumor
is the nexus LG a lot of people were
rant and rave and saying that they don't
like it then again everyone other people
say oh it's amazing so let us know what
side of the fence you're on the comments
do you love it do you hate it uh are you
going to hold out for another one you
know it is or is there going to be more
devices coming in the next few weeks so
we going to see the HTC five fingers
crossed call from Todd Derek once uh you
know the Nexus 5 is that it comes to
fruition so high school I do want to
know what features would you have in
your ideal phone that'd be kinda cool
things that you couldn't that you would
maybe use or everybody would use in it
from the teacher um so for all our
viewers and listeners some places you
can find us basically we are live every
Thursday night at eight thirty central
time yeah I'm sorry I had known either
up a dub when I was talking about my
android shrine hand made a comment
saying that I worshipped the shrine
three times a day always facing mountain
view that's actually like some five
minutes ago hahaha that's hilarious ok
so for those of you guys you're walking
with joy if you were listening or
watching um we're available on YouTube
you can watch us on youtube you watch
the livestream there every Thursday
night at eight thirty central time also
if you want to join the discussion if
you're commenting on the YouTube page
that's fine most of it of the discussion
actually happens on is happening on
google+ on the Andrew authority page on
Google+ and there you can ask questions
and we're watching that screen more than
the youtube comment stream um also you
guys can listen to us on soundcloud if
you don't want to look at us um because
you know we're not really that good to
look at some more so than others um but
we're available on soundcloud you can
download
of the podcast or you can listen to it
and stream it there or available on
stitcher radio that's a mobile app also
you can get us on iTunes and we also do
have an RSS feed and if you do go to
android authority com if you come to the
bottom right on the bottom right side
there is an on-air section that is where
we post all of our news and all of our
show notes for every episode okay all
right so uh yeah I'm that guy you know
we're trying to wrap up it but I'm going
to keep talking I'm that guy umm so so
Yousef at asked us some questions here
and he's asked twice and I feel that we
need to answer them real quick so i have
another minute or two and sure you guys
aren't going anywhere you're not doing
anything else so all right so uh he
wants to know what's up with the youtube
app we actually talked about this last
week um you too bad remember that it's
now kind of like Google+ you scroll up
and down into the swipe and left to
right to see comments related videos and
all that good stuff I personally hated
it John and Scott I think liked it you
guys still feel that way you like the
new youtube app design still plan it it
needs more features but yes it is nice
and it's very fast at least I like
scrolling better than swiping yeah I was
used to swype and like I said I'm
eventually only a used to it and I'll
put you know two months from now I'll
come back and I'll say this is most
amazing thing ever don't ever change it
but right now i'm not a fan and yousef
also was asking questions about the
appleton it recently expanded their
patent coverage on slide to unlock the
slide to unlock the original patents
were we're just you know basically slide
from left to right to unlock and it in a
straight line and that's basically on
set the new one basically says hey you
can slide unlock from anywhere and a
hold massive direction it's a very very
broad feature and almost saying that you
know you think they did I am NOT a
patent lawyer but um I wouldn't assume
that jelly beans slide on and it's not
really even a slide you know push in the
middle and flick to a ring to unlock but
whatever I I would assume it's safe
but I wouldn't from the way it's worded
but I also don't think it'll matter I'll
go who's gonna hold up its way to then
there's prior cases I mean the thing
that Apple seems to have forgotten
taking apple out of the equation forty
percent of patents that get tried and
tested fail as in forty percent of all
patents that are grant granted to the
world are complete trash so so Dan is
that like eighty-seven percent of
statistics are made up on spotters oh
that's like according to court documents
and court records I don't want to see
your source on that Dan well I would
have give a lot I would assume that a
lot of companies just apply for very
broad patents be exactly because if they
had a broad patent then they have some
type of footing to stand behind and once
they get that footing and then they get
another patent that is relatively
similar then they have more ground in
that area to defend themselves which is
ridiculous well I mean the thing is
patents are supposed to be used
defensively and I think that they're not
being like I think that the patent and
Trade Office hasn't woken up to the fact
that they're handing out weapons very
broad yeah they're handing out corporate
weapons that these companies are taking
and not just Apple and Samsung with
patent trolls and Microsoft and
everybody they're handing out baseball
bats that these companies are just
beating the crap out of each other with
the thing is um the galaxy s3 with the
unlock with the water theme or whatever
this patent says from the first location
to an unlocked region it needs to be a
predefined unlock region you can do the
s3 anywhere so that patent would would
not hold up against the s3 yeah cuz I
think this particular patent has been
rejected several times before but hey
the little engine that could keep trying
and that's the other thing is you just
keep putting a patent application and
then it goes to a different examiner
every time and
eventually one of them is just remember
stamping rubber-stamping rubber stamping
because they get paid by the approval
not by you know the quality of their
work very true okay so guys we're known
over time once again just kind of want
to say we are available on youtube
soundcloud stitcher itunes RSS feed
