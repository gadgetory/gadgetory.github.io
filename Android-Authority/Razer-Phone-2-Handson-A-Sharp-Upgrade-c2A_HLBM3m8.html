the race of phone was a unique
proposition a phone aimed entirely at
gamers that offered an incredible 120
Hertz display capable of displaying
silky smooth gameplay with
lightning-fast response times this ultra
motion is an effect that has to be seen
to be appreciated but it really did mark
the Razr phone out to something special
of course it also had all the latest
specs packed inside for optimal
performance and massive dual speakers
the razor phone received a lot of love
but it wasn't quite perfect the camera
for instance was something of a letdown
capable of only average photography
which was too much for compromise for
even some diehard gamers then there was
the fact that the Android ecosystem just
wasn't that set up for gaming few games
supported the maximum of fresh rates and
there was just no need to go all out in
the specs department in order to play
candy crush but fast forwards for the
end of 2018 and the razor 2 looks set to
rectify those mistakes and become the
phone of every gamers dreams
it might look very similar from the
front but there are a lot of upgrades to
be found if you look a little closer
that amazing screen is back with the
same refresh rate and the same one for
forty by two 560 resolution only this
time it sees a 50% increase in
brightness up to 645 myths the SOC gets
the expected bump up to snapdragon 845
with the same vapor chamber cooling for
reduced throttling and eight gigabytes
of RAM the result is that the razor
phone 2 can deliver 20 to 30% more
horsepower compared with its predecessor
although I was a little surprised to
learn that it would only come with 64
gigabytes of storage and I did notice
the device getting a little warm during
a session of pub G of course we'll need
to test this further before we can draw
any conclusions but rest assured that
performance is bound to be top of the
range
the massive front-facing speakers are
present and correct
- powered by Dolby Atmos now reportedly
crisper louder and water sealed and
backed up with an improved vibration
engine there's no headphone jack but a
USB type-c dongle with 24 bit DAC is
included in the box to abate those
offended by this omission just like last
time
also back is the four thousand milliamp
hour battery to allow for long gaming
sessions while software features such as
the game booster that allows for
performance tweaking on a per game basis
and razor cortex that makes it easier to
actually find good games from the Play
Store are also welcome the phone is
running an almost stock version of
Android 8.1 razer says that it doesn't
just want to make a gaming phone it
wants to make a premium flagship device
for gamers to that end we see many of
the top-end luxuries found on other
flagships that means we now get ip67
water resistance and thanks to a sexy
glass back panel wireless charging that
glass back gives the razer phone to a
more attractive and premium aesthetic
from the rear the front remains largely
unchanged
another aesthetic touch here is Razer
chroma which allows you to change the
color of the Razer logo while your phone
is in use you can pick any color you
like to match your outfit I guess as
well as different modes such as cycling
or breathing and if you use the
company's own wireless charging stand
and that will also light up and
automatically change color to match your
device's settings those that don't care
about battery draining can leave the
effect on 24/7 if they say wish whilst
those who find us a little ostentatious
can turn it off entirely I know it's a
gimmick
but I personally love it I'd give my
face RGB lighting if I could if Razer
truly wants to create a flagship though
and it's gonna need to work on that
camera thankfully though it seems the
OEM has been paying close attention in
this area the dual lens rear shooter
combines a 12 megapixel F 1.75
wide-angle lens with a 12 megapixel F
2.6 telephoto that should allow for some
great possibilities as well as the now
compulsory depth effects around the
front is an 8 megapixel shooter same as
last time unfortunately the camera app
wasn't quite ready when I got to test
the device but from what I saw it seemed
to be pretty capable and I managed to
produce some pretty decent shots
it even has slo-mo and a host of other
modes it looks promising we'll need to
spend more time with the device to give
a proper verdict on the camera and of
course the same goes for the performance
over time but on the face of it this is
a compelling proposition for just 799 US
dollars 779 GBP
or 849 euros you're getting flagship
specs and performance packaged in a
water-resistant premium feeling glass
chassis with a one-of-a-kind screen
amazing speakers and a host of game
eccentric features as a lot of value
compared to the likes of Samsung and
Apple's phones and if they get the
camera right then this device might
convince those that chose to hold off
last time and this may be the right time
for a new razor phone - with Android
gaming becoming increasingly popular
thanks in part to the success of pub G &amp;amp;
fortnight and the example set by the
Nintendo switch I'm personally enjoying
streaming games to my device via Steam
link a lot these days
but of course with that popularity comes
competition and only time will tell
whether the razor phone too has the
chops
to take on offerings from honor and
raagh so what do you think of the razor
phone team let us know in the comments
