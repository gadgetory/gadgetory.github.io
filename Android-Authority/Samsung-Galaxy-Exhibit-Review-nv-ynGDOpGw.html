bring the full Android experience to
budget minded buyers but does it live up
to those promises find out in our review
hey everybody I'm Chris look not
everybody needs a super phone but does
the Galaxy exhibit perform well enough
to be worth it well let's start the
review with a look at the specs the
Samsung Galaxy exhibit features a three
point inch wvga TFT display and runs a
one gigahertz dual-core processor
looking at memory it has one gig of ram
and four gigs of internal storage which
is expandable by microsd this is nice
since the internal storage only has one
point three gigs available to the user
for photos we're looking at a five
megapixel main camera in the rear
capable of 720p video recording and a
VGA secondary camera up front powering a
tall is a modest 1500 milliamp hour
battery the Galaxy exhibit has more than
a little in common with the galaxy s3
mini it's apparent in the specs we just
saw which are close to identical and
it's noticeable in the design as well
what does this mean well it means it
looks like a galaxy though it's smaller
size causes it to look a little more
rounded the standard galaxy layout is
mostly here the power button is on the
right the volume rocker is on the left
and you'll find the headphone jack on
top and the USB port on the bottom the
one slightly different touch is that the
microSD slot is on the left side rather
than tucked under the battery cover due
in part to the smaller size of the
device it feels weightier for its size
than many more expensive Galaxy devices
though this also gives it a more solid
feel whether or not it's actually any
tougher than a standard galaxy isn't
something I wanted to test resolution
isn't everything when it comes to
displace but it does count for a lot
with the exhibits 3.8 inch screen and a
resolution of 800 by 480 that leaves us
with a pixel density of 245 pixels per
inch now by destroying lilo but nothing
to write home about either the lack of
sharpness is definitely noticeable
especially when looking at text but the
small size of the display makes it
easier to deal with than it would be on
a larger device
the display is a TFT LCD so colors are
more natural and less saturated than
they are
on the Super AMOLED displays used on
Samsung's higher-end phones whether or
not this is good or bad is a matter of
taste personally I prefer the slightly
muted colors but there are a ton of fans
of the ultra colorful s AMOLED displays
viewing angles are decent right in line
with what we'd expect from a TFT
brightness could definitely be a little
better as viewability and bright
sunlight isn't great black levels on the
other hand are fairly good the Galaxy
exhibit runs in Nova Thor ste u 84 xx
chipset with a 1 gigahertz dual-core
processor and malley 400 GPU this is a
configuration we don't see much so we
are curious to see how it performed as
usual we started with antutu benchmark
and ran it 10 different times in
different conditions scores were fairly
consistent ranging from just over 6300
on the low-end to upwards of 6,800 on
the higher end our final average score
was six thousand six hundred and twenty
nine next we turn to Epic Citadel
because this is a cortex a9 processor
the ultra high quality setting wasn't
available to us which was probably for
the best anyway as the Galaxy exhibit
struggled a bit on the high quality
setting reaching an average of just 34
point nine frames per second the high
performance setting was a bit better
with an average of 37 point 4 frames per
second despite the expected low
benchmark scores the Galaxy exhibit
doesn't usually feel sluggish at all in
terms of normal use while you might
notice the occasional stutter when
scrolling through various screens apps
launch quickly and it never feels like
you're waiting for the phone gamers may
be disappointed as you're not going to
play the most Hardware intensive games
here but light gaming is fine call
quality is good but I wasn't able to
test data very well as both t-mobile and
AT&amp;amp;T have spotty service in my area at
times I was able to connect to HSPA+ and
achieve marginally decent speeds while
at others I was limited to edge the
Galaxy exhibit runs Android 4.1.2 jelly
bean and is overlaid with Samsung's
TouchWiz UI initially I was a little
concerned that this would affect
performance but luckily it didn't seem
to t-mobile branding is very present
from the home screen to the
apps a few of the usual suspects from
Samsung like its App Store S Memo and s
voice are included a whole lot more t
mobile apps are included like four one
one and more caller tunes mobile hotspot
t-mobile name ID t-mobile TV and visual
voicemail alongside other apps like Yelp
and lookout security some of these may
be useful but on a phone with so little
internal storage I'm sure that a lot of
people would have preferred fewer
pre-installed apps the Galaxy exhibit is
a budget phone so we expected a budget
camera that's pretty much what you're
getting here but that said the camera
was better than we were expecting
the camera UI is similar to higher-end
galaxy models I'll be it with less
features and shooting modes still
continuous shop smile Shaw and panorama
modes are included alongside more
gimmicky modes like cartoon you can also
adjust exposure ISO white balance and
metering if you want to get more
hands-on with your photos the five
megapixel main camera produces sharp
fairly neutral looking photos in single
shot mode with everything set to auto
the photos we took didn't appear over or
underexposed and colors were well
balanced if not particularly vivid the
720p video capture produces similar
results when it comes to color and
sharpness and motion was fairly smooth
all in all the camera was a pleasant
surprise here with a battery capacity of
just 1500 milliamp hours you might be
worried about short battery life and
with a stated top time of nine hours you
might worry a bit more granted this
phone isn't gonna last you through a
weekend but it should be enough to get
most people through even a fairly long
day
after a 15-hour day of testing
benchmarking and shooting all while
leaving the screen on quite a bit the
Galaxy exhibit had roughly 35% battery
life remaining this use included being
connected to HSPA+ or edge+ Wi-Fi
basically if you're careful with how
much you use it the Galaxy exhibit
should keep enough battery life on hand
to be usable throughout an entire day
but you might want to keep a charger or
spare battery handy just in case with a
price of $19.99 with a two-year contract
or $216 contract free the galaxy
it is a perfect match for somebody who
wants an Android phone without paying
too much at once yeah there are similar
phones with similar performance at
similar price points but if you're
looking for a Galaxy at a low price the
exhibit is hard not to recommend we have
