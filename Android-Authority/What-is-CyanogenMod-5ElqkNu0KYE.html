domain.com so you've likely heard of
CyanogenMod but exactly what is it and
why should it matter to you CyanogenMod
is one of the best-known custom roms out
there enabling millions of users around
the world to custom their devices until
their heart's content
CyanogenMod is so popular that the
people behind CyanogenMod started
cyanogen inc and developed partnerships
with phone manufacturers that have
CyanogenMod as the default operating
system but what exactly is a custom rom
Google releases the source code for
android via the Android Open Source
project which allows anyone to download
the source code for stock android and
modify it to their liking many people
add features to try and further optimize
the operating system to improve
performance when people talk about
flashing roms they are referring to
overwriting the old version of Android
that is installed and replacing it with
a third-party alternative like
CyanogenMod however the term ROM is not
necessarily used correctly when talking
about third-party custom firmware a ROM
per se in computer science terms is
read-only memory which can only be read
and not written more than once in the
most basic sense smartphones and tablets
use flash memory to store the Android OS
so the correct term should really be
custom firmware this naming convention
may lead to some confusion when talking
about custom roms just remember the
firmware is being changed
not any roms that might be on the device
now let's talk about the roots of
cyanogen CyanogenMod started out as a
simple alternative to stock Android on
the HTC dream and HTC magic devices with
the initial release of CyanogenMod 3.1
back in 2009 with androids open source
nature and the ability to obtain root
access anything is possible and with the
popularity of custom roms the
CyanogenMod community blossomed in fact
it boomed CyanogenMod really started to
be recognized with santa Jin mod 7 based
on 2.3 Gingerbread this release added
new and improved features over stock
Android like busybox in the shell as
well as improving the stock
apps now what exactly are the advantages
of sanity mod over stock Android well
the whole reason behind installing a
custom ROM is to add features improve
performance and change the look of stock
Android this is exactly what you get
with CyanogenMod there are features in
CyanogenMod that are simply not
available in stock android like the
ability to change the status bar to your
liking or apply different themes
CyanogenMod brings a lot to the table in
terms of freedom and one of the biggest
aspects of that is root access
you see root access gives you
administrative rights at least in
Windows terms to your file system this
means you can access all your system
files and just allows you to do a lot
more for example there's no official way
to backup your data
easily however if you use titanium
backup and it's route needed features
you can backup your apps and data and
transfer your data to another device
without fail however a word of warning
root access is not as secure as non
rooted now let's talk about Saanich and
mods release cycle because after version
10.2 Saanich and mod changed the release
cycle to make everything a lot simpler
there's really two levels there's the
development Channel these are the same
as Knightley's from before they're every
24 hours and are highly unstable you
don't want to use the development
channel on your daily driver device the
second is a release channel these are
like m snapshots and are made each month
which are suitable for daily use
although they may lag behind the nightly
builds by two weeks as far as features
and improvements now how exactly do you
flash CyanogenMod on your device well if
you look at the link below and the show
links there is a general step-by-step
guide to help you do just that let me
know how it works on your device what is
your favorite custom ROM have you tried
cyanogen and what did you think let me
know in the comments below if you guys
remember from like 15 years ago when
people were making money hand over fist
in the dot-com bubble remember we didn't
call it a dotnet bubble or dot org
bubble we didn't call them dot biz
billionaires we called them dot-com
billionaires because that's the power of
a.com now why is that because no domain
name extent
tells your story with the same degree of
trust as a.com or.net domain name
dot-com and dotnet domain name
