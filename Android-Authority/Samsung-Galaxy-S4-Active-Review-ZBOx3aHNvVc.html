new features is this the galaxy s4 that
some people wanted in the first place
hey it's Josh Oregon from Android auto
what's going on everybody and this is
the samsung galaxy s4 active when it
comes to general design you do get
shades of the original s4 but there have
been many changes personally I'm not a
big fan of this blue but it is nice how
you can see it along the very edges when
you look at the front the familiar
button layout of the s4 has been
strengthened and has a nice meaty feel
turning the active around reveals a much
different look from the s4 indeed rugged
is the term that comes to mind when you
see the four screws on each rubberized
corner and the smaller slightly textured
plastic cover adorning the body yes it
is still plastic but it's a better
feeling thicker less bendy plastic
remove the back cover and you get the
same access to this removable battery
and SD card slots just make sure it is
really sealed before you go splashing
water on it obviously to help the water
resistance there is a cover over the
microUSB port little plastic covers like
this don't always stand the test of time
but it seems sturdy enough in the hand
you get a heftiness that is very
noticeable when compared to the s4
whereas the light and nimble galaxy s4
had good balancing the s4 active really
does feel like a phone you can knock
around some it's like having a good case
on your s4 only that's not a case and
you're actually holding your phone I
will be doing a full vs. between the
active and the original s4 so
comparisons will come there I will say
though that I do really prefer the feel
of the active over the s4 and I know
that for a lot of people what they
wanted out of the s4 is at least being
heavily teased here in the active opting
against putting the usual Super AMOLED
screen on the s4 active you get the less
saturated LCD display still capable of
1080p resolution and 441 PPI it won't
throw colors out at you the way that the
s4 screen does but for some people that
might actually be a plus nonetheless you
get the same kind of performance with a
slightly different overall color profile
admittedly it doesn't handle contrast
quite as well as the Super AMOLED
display but that is far from a
deal-breaker it's still a great screen
and should proof fun for all media
consumption and text viewing what
surprises many about the
four active is that for a ruggedized
phone it has a top tier performance
package indeed the S 4 active took from
its counterpart all the right bits when
it came to performance you get the same
Snapdragon 600 CPU clocked in at 1.9
gigahertz backed by the Adreno 320 and
two gigabytes of RAM the 600 powers all
the top smartphones in the market today
and so there are no doubts when it comes
to speed if you thought the s4 was fast
and a great performer you're in for just
about the same experience here the same
goes for hardware as the s4 active has
quite literally all of the bits and
pieces that made the s4 special every
sensor for hand gestures interviews and
controlling televisions makes a return
here being able to expand the memory as
always a plus and as I said before in
regards to feel everything you know
about the original s4 has gotten beefier
so the story here is obviously the water
and dust resistance following in line
with many of the rugged phones becoming
available right now
the s4 active can be submerged in depths
of up to one meter for half an hour
those details are important because any
more than that and you might end up with
an s4 looking brick the dust resistance
is certified though there aren't really
any clean ways of testing it and that
LCD is covered in Gorilla Glass 2 not 3
it is scratch resistant but definitely
not made for getting knocked around
don't be fooled
the rugged feel of the phone is great
because it's vastly superior than that
of the original s4 but hold a real
rugged phone in your hand and you'll
know that while the s4 active can
withstand the elements it just can't go
charging into them it's really nice to
see that the S 4 active retains the
removable battery while you won't be
changing your batteries underwater
please don't do that having a spare of
the 2600 milliamp power unit often
proves very handy in my battery tests
the life of the s4 actives unit pretty
much holds up I didn't find any problems
getting through a whole day of normal
usage it might be the LCD screen that is
consuming power differently this time
around but rest assured that you get
everything you need finished before it's
time for bit the camera is really the
last of the few places that have to be
cut down in the s4 active instead of the
13 megapixel optics of the original s4
you get 8 megapixels here as far as the
app goes you get all of the same modes
originally available in the s4 - the
dual recording feature and with the
addition of aqua mode which I'll get
into soon now megapixels obviously don't
tell the whole story when it comes to
quality but a small decrease is expect
did when the resolution goes down
overall however the active manages to
take pictures on par with the quality of
the s for pictures in daylight and good
indoor lighting have very good detail
and color reproduction all of which
translate into video capabilities while
you won't be getting pictures you can
easily blow up you'll still get
great-looking photos of course the main
attraction with the camera is being able
to use it underwater now I don't live
near a beach nor did I have any time to
plan a pool party mostly because I don't
have a pool but when you do take a
plunge the aqua mode of the S 4 active
kicks in rendering there touch screen
unusable when in the camera app the
volume buttons can then be your shutter
or record buttons it's a nice way of
making the camera usable even when water
contact makes touch navigation tough as
would be expected however manipulating
the photos you take in aqua mode will
obviously have to wait until you're out
of the water all in all the
water-resistant camera is a great
addition to a phone that does want you
to get out more software wise you don't
really get any changes in the s4 active
as I said in the hardware section all of
the sensors returned in the active
making air hand and eye gestures
possible as far as apps go you do get s
health and group play and watch on all
programs found on the original s4 as
well for a full look at the software
capabilities on the s4 active you can
actually just check out my original s4
review and finally price there isn't a
very clear picture of how broad or
release the Galaxy s4 active will see as
of right now it is available on AT&amp;amp;T for
the price of 199 on a contract unlocked
prices are a bit fuzzy this early into
the release but the active should be
around the same unlocked price as its
original counterpart and so there you
have it
Samsung is definitely looking to create
some sort of galaxy s4 dynasty and this
is quite the start for the rollout the
s4 active should please plenty of people
who love the original s4 but wish that
it at least felt a little sturdier what
I do love about the s4 active is that it
gives an alternative if you haven't
pulled the trigger on the s4 just yet
maybe what the active offers will entice
you and hell if anything it's not just
pretty fun to do this
