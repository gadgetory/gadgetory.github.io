it comes to smartphone cameras and this
is a key part of what made the P series
stand out
although the p9 and p10 were not the
first to incorporate dual cameras they
represented a significant step up for
the tech at the time
now with the p20 Pro while we is pushing
the envelope further by introducing us
to the world's first triple lens camera
and it looks like it's going to be
something special
I'm Adam chin Itsuki from Android
authority here to tell you all you need
to know about the p20 pros the like a
triple camera let's start off by
actually explaining what we're looking
at here is there's a lot to take in at
the very top we have an 8 megapixel
telephoto lens with an F 2.4 aperture
and 52 millimeter focal length kitted
out with optical image stabilization
technology this is the sensor for all
you Baca fans out there as the longer
focal length will allow you to capture
those perfect portrait shots naraba is
looking very spiffing in this shot for
instance the middle sensor meanwhile is
a massive 40 megapixel RGB sensor with
an F 1.8 aperture and 28 millimeter
focal length
that's the highest megapixel count we've
seen on a single smartphone camera since
the heyday of the beefy Nokia Lumia 1020
way back in 2012 finally the bottom lens
is a 20 megapixel monochrome shooter
with an F 1.6 aperture which resides
just below the dual module and sits
almost flush to the rear of the phone
much like the mate 10 the p20 pro
features a four-way hybrid autofocus
comprising a blazer Det contrast and
phase detection that wouldn't be
possible without the device's array of
sensors so in the main module we have a
laser transmitter and a laser receiver
while the flash module below includes a
color temperature sensor while way says
this sensor brings a new level of color
accuracy to the pro's camera and it's
capable of differentiating between the
color of a subjects skin and the actual
color of the room they're in for
instance so that's the hardware out the
way but what's it actually like to use
well the first major boost is an
improved low-light performance we
already have a broad aperture range from
F 2.4 all the way down to F 1.6 which
should theoretically help to stop a lot
of the visible noise and the loss of
detail in low-light conditions while
we've gone a step further however an
integrated an all new system for
low-light photography which confused
four pixels into a single larger pixel
that bumps the one micrometer pixel size
on the RGB sensor up to two micrometers
the pro also boasts the highest maximum
ISO of any smartphone capping out at an
incredible 100 and 2400 for some
perspective Apple and Samsung's most
recent flagships offer a top is o of
6400 significantly less obviously if you
dial all of these settings up to the top
then you're inevitably gonna miss out on
the kind of detail and sharpness that
you'd get under normal conditions but it
also means the p20 Pro Swiss spoke and
night mode can capture an insane amount
of light even in near complete darkness
while ways also talked up the pros
ability to take a long exposure shots at
night normally capturing stunning light
trails requires some kind of tripod
setup to steady the device but while way
says the p20 Pro is capable of taking
handheld long exposure snaps for up to
four seconds this is thanks to some more
AI trickery moving back into the light
of day there like a triple cameras other
headline features it's five times hybrid
zoom function we've already seen
manufacturers like Apple Samsung and
even oneplus implement optical zoom by
switching between RGB and telephoto
lenses for two different zoom levels
meanwhile Huawei is previously stuck
with a secondary monochrome sensor to
enable two times hybrid zoom now though
it wants the best of both worlds by
introducing that third telephoto lens
while retaining the monochrome sensor
that results in three times optical zoom
which can be toggled via a circular zoom
button in the camera app or by pinching
the screen while we isn't giving up on
its hybrid zoom system from the may 10
however and just in case three times
optical zoom isn't enough you can
digitally magnify the image up to five
times with another quick tap of course
only the telephoto lens has the hardware
stabilization so you'd be forgiven for
thinking that the magnified lenses are
inevitably going to come out as a little
blurry in a bold claim however while Way
says that o is is in fact largely
unnecessary
thanks to the ki-rin 970 processor and
its neural processing unit as with the
Mait 10 series the dedicated on device
AI processing system powers a wide range
of applications on the pro including
what Huawei is calling AI image
stabilization the system dubbed AIS for
short because companies love making up
new acronyms which never stick around is
capable of capturing multiple scenes at
once
move noise and blur from the final shot
ais is complemented by 4d predictive
focus that actively tracks and predicts
object motion
rounding out the overall camera package
is wild ways usual camera modes
including 3d panorama motion photos and
a fully kitted out pro mode with
controls for ISO white balance exposure
shutter speed and much more whoa is also
added an interesting ultra snapshot
feature which lets you take a shot from
a screen off in just naught point three
seconds to capture those fleeting
moments without having to first unlock
your device there's also super slow
motion video up to 960 frames per second
and overall improvements to the scene
detection feature on the may 10 which
can automatically adjust your camera
settings the best capture photos of food
animals fireworks greenery and other
specific objects as you can probably
tell by now while weighs put a lot of
work into making the p20 camera the
phone's standout feature well the
world's first triple smartphone camera
live up to the hype in the long run
we'll need to put the phone through its
paces for a full review to know for sure
but the early signs are very promising
for while always new flagship until then
