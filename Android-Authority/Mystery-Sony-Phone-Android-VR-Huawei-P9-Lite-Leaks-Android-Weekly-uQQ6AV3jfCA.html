brought to you by domain.com so what is
this whale of a phone as the Japanese
OEM eagerly prepares to roll out its new
xperia x ii handsets images have
surfaced of a yet unannounced product
believed to be a follow-up to last
year's experience c5 ultra behold this
the pictures spotted by Xperia blog by
way of bay do show a gigantic 6 inch
Xperia smartphone complete with a giant
front-facing camera and a flash located
to its right a dedicated camera button
can be seen on the bottom right side of
the frame and a tiny power button in the
middle
the last point suggests this phone would
not come with a fingerprint sensor given
the approach Sony used with the z5
however anything's possible at this
point the report states that the phone
should have a media text system on a
chip and dual SIM card support
additional pictures indicate the phone
will also support NFC and have a
standard type USB connector the big
question here is whether this phone will
actually ever make it to market you see
and mobile while Congress only put a
great deal of emphasis on the new
x-series handsets but there is still a
possibility that Sony wants to create a
large smart phone for users who are not
particularly concerned about superior
specs but still want a very large phone
let's talk about how Android n shows
hints of a native virtual reality mode
Ars Technica and covered three separate
hints of upcoming virtual reality
support in the latest Android n
Developer Preview update the first is a
menu option of all things albeit a
slightly obscure one if you go to
settings than apps then settings again
with a gear icon at the top and select
special access where you will find a new
entry called VR helper services it
appears as though the apps will be able
to self-identify as VR helpers and
requests access to the API that the user
must then agree to once granted we
assume the VR helper app will provide
headset pop-ups while in VR mode which
is also referenced in the Android and
source code along with references to
something called the V
our listener ARS Technica's Rana Moneo
explains in the settings string there is
a permission warning related to the VR
service that states that a app will be
able to run when you're using
applications in virtual reality mode
therefore when Android kicks over into
what this VR mode actually is the helper
app will be able to pop up and do
something exactly we don't know what of
course this could lead to absolutely
nothing in the end because it is just a
Developer Preview but it does lend some
pretty convincing physical evidence to
the circumstantial rumors pointing
towards a standalone Google VR headset
wouldn't that be sweet
well that is likely what slipped out of
the webmasters mouth at a Romanian
online retailer that accidentally posted
the full specs and by links for the yet
unannounced Huawei p9 light late last
week the Huawei p9 Lite is listed on the
site as Venus what we can only assume is
a codename the same thing happened
recently with the Verizon HTC ten URL
including its perfume codename and is
available in black white and gold colors
the Huawei p9 light is priced at
approximately $300 u.s. according to the
listing the specs include a 5.2 inch
full HD IPS LCD octa-core kuren 650
system-on-a-chip
2 gigabytes of RAM 16 gigabytes of
internal storage but you can expand up
to 128 gigabytes via the microSD
expansion slot dual SIM card support 4G
LTE a 13 megapixel 8 megapixel camera
combo Android 6.0 marshmallow regular
box and USB type-c a 3000 milliamp hour
battery and a fingerprint sensor to boot
