authority and we're taking a quick look
at force touch on the mate s which while
we made a pretty big deal about during
the press event but it's only available
on the 128 gigabyte version or as Huawei
calls it the luxury edition it's pretty
limited right now as far as what you can
actually do with it but while we says
they plan on bringing more utility to it
in future updates but one thing that you
can do with it is force touch in the
gallery app you can force touch on an
image and this will magnify the image
and depending on how much force you've
applied it will affect how much it zooms
in on the image and it works pretty well
but it can be a little difficult to
precisely get the exact amount of
magnification that you're looking for
the second thing that you can do with
force touch are in the corners and
bottom parts of the screen which while
we cause magic corners and Magic bottom
instead of having the Android navigation
keys always showing at the bottom and
taking up precious screen real estate
you can hide them away and anytime you
need them you just simply force touch in
the corresponding areas where the
buttons would typically be so if you
want to go back you would force touch in
the bottom left middle for home and
bottom right for recent apps the top
left and right corners of the screen
work pretty much the same way and force
touching these areas will launch you
into applications like the camera or web
browser but they don't seem to work
quite as well as the navigation keys and
trying to get the applications to
trigger was very finicky and it took
many more attempts to get them to work
than I would have liked the last feature
that Huawei has added in to take
advantage of force touch is the ability
to approximate the weight of an item so
this basically allows you to use the
phone as a scale but since it requires a
specific amount of force the item needs
to weigh at least a hundred grams but no
more than 400 grams it doesn't
necessarily sound like the most useful
feature in the world but it is there to
take advantage of on the off chance you
need to figure out the weight of
something at a moment's notice but that
is going to do it for this quick look at
force touch on the mate s it works and
we always provided some pretty good
examples of how it can be utilized but
it definitely needs more polishing and
refinements so hopefully we'll see it
improve over time with software updates
as always thank you guys so much for
watching this video
