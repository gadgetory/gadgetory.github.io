Android or authority now people are
always wondering what is the best
smartphone that you can buy now we try
to take the guesswork out that decision
for you and in this installment or best
of Android we're turning our attention
to batteries which smartphone has the
best battery so if you're ready let's go
now before we get started let remind you
of the smartphones that we're looking at
in our best of Android series I'll give
them to you now in no particular order
we started with the Sony z5 premium then
we're looking at the Nexus 6p then the
LG v10 the note 5 the Motorola Droid
turbo 2 which internationally is known
as the Moto X force and the Blackberry
proved now which of these devices has
the best battery we're going to find out
so really the first question is which
phone charges the quickest if you can
always meaning to charge your phone
every day from the mini to be charging
it on the move it's good to know which
phone can charge quickest so let's have
a look at our test results as you can
see from these results the Moto X force
actually has the quickest charging time
at just under 70 minutes in second place
you have the LG v10 followed by the note
5 unfortunately the worst performance
comes from the BlackBerry Prive which
takes over a hundred and fifty minutes
to reach full charge now there are
different ways of testing the battery
one is to use some battery testing apps
which is what we've done and other ways
through manual testing and kind of use a
stopwatch to see how many minutes you
can get out of the phone we've done that
as well let's start with the battery
testing apps so here you can see we use
two different testing apps and two two
and Geekbench and the higher the score
the better and we can see from this that
the Moto X force has the highest score
for antutu and we can also see that the
Moto X force has the lowest score for
Geekbench so that gives us an
interesting situation one app tells us
the phone is very very good and the
other app tells us the phone is very
very bad so actually I'm not going to
put much stock in these results I think
it's better if we turn to our manual
testing and see what we found out so to
test a standby time what we did was take
each phone and reset it to the factory
defaults
then we added a few social media account
a gmail account and the BBC news
application and then switch the phone
off and see how much the battery dropped
over a period of 24 hours then we use
that number to extrapolate to see what
the total standby time would be so let's
have a look at the results as you can
see the best standby time came from the
Nexus 6p with almost 220 hours of
standby time next came the galaxy note 5
followed by that blackberry Prive now
the worst score was registered by the
Moto X force aka the droid turbo - with
only a hundred and thirty three hours
however go remember one hundred and
thirty three hours it's over five days
so even our worst score here is actually
pretty reasonable for our next test I
wrote a particular custom app that we're
going to use which cycled through six
web pages leaving a 20-second pause
between each webpage the phones were
using Wi-Fi and not 3G or 4G and we let
this run from a hundred percent battery
all the way down to less than five
percent and just so many how many hours
you could sit there loading web pages
simulating a quick pause as you read the
web page click on a link and on to the
next web page so let's have a look at
the results
so three phones here you've got very
good scores the LG v10 came in first
followed by the galaxy note 5 and then
the Moto X force now each of these
achieved over 550 minutes of web
browsing time the worst score here was
registered by the Nexus 6p
we've just under 400 minutes remember
those battery testing apps I talked
about a few moments ago but one thing
that does come out of the geek page
battery test is a maximum number of
minutes that the phone will work for and
here are the results that Kate Bane's
gave us for it run time numbers the best
result comes from the galaxy note 5 by a
long way followed by this Nexus 6p and
the Sony z5 premium however as with
other tests I don't really put much
stock in these results for the next test
we looped a HD video around and round
and round again to see how many hours
you'd get of video playing on each of
these devices again we started 100% we
set the video running and we left the
phone right down till it discharged or
somewhere under 5% so if we look at
these results we can see that the Galaxy
Note 5 had
very very impressive run in fact it made
over ten hours of video playback which
is quite impressive when you consider
the resolution and the size of the
screen on that device in joint second
place we find the BlackBerry Prive and
the Moto X force the worst score would
registered by the z5 premium but again
you might be to excuse that because it
has of course caught that 4k display so
what does all this mean well the phone
with the fastest charging time was of
course the Droid turbo to the Motorola X
force now that is an amazing charging
time of just 69 minutes especially when
you consider the size of its battery
three thousand seven hundred and sixty
milliamp hours however it didn't do so
well in all of our tests didn't really
win many of the tests now the phone had
the best standby time was the Nexus 6p
but again when it came to the video
looping test and it came to the
web-browsing test it didn't do that well
now the phone that seems to give you a
reasonable charging time and seemed to
be good at generally through all the
tests was in fact the Galaxy Note 5 now

reports and all the individual numbers
