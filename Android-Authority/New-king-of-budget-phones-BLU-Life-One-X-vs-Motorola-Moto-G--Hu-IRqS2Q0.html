used to mean a certain thing to us if
you weren't a big gamer or a picture
taker and just wanted a phone that was
cheap and could do a few things here and
there go get a budget phone right well
during the past year or so this has
slowly changed budget phones are getting
really really good good enough to gain
to take good pictures and overall just
getting to be very powerful the Moto G
has been the king of bunch of smart
phones for a while but with the
second-generation blue life 1x just
announced there might be a new king in
town hello everybody it's crystal Laura
and let's take a closer look at this
with the 2015 Moto G versus the 2015 Blu
life 1x both of these phones feel great
to hold for two reasons the first being
their smaller footprint the Moto G is
the smaller the two with a smaller
5-inch screen versus a life one x is 5.2
inch screen however in terms of thinness
the Moto G is a lot thicker with this
rounded back that's kind of the thing
with the entire Moto G's design along
with this rounded back all four corners
have been rounded off a lot whereas the
life on Nexus rounded corners are more
traditionally sharp all this being said
both phones are very light and are the
perfect size for one-handed use and it
will comfortably fit in most pockets the
second part of a great feel in the hand
is due to the materials they wear on the
back the 2015 Moto G's backplate is made
of a nice rubbery material which will
definitely allow for your hand to get a
good grip onto the phone and on top of
that we also have these little grooves
drought it to create a very cool
textured feel the Moto G is going to
feel very secure in your hands and even
more so with that nice Motorola dimple
Dax is a nice resting point for your
finger now with the 2015 Blu life 1x we
have an all around more sleeker design
with what looks to be a leathery plastic
pattern that's coated in a smooth paint
layer the pattern feels quite soft and
has little invitations and grooves all
around like real leather wood which
should also make you feel like you're
not going to drop the phone even with it
being a little taller than the Moto G
while the Moto G is made of plastic all
around the Blu life 1x makes things
interesting with this high quality
aluminum frame with a sandblasted matte
finish it really has some extra splash
to the phone's design which is something
most budget smart phones do not provide
both packs are removable although not
for exchanging batteries instead this is
where users connects as a SIM card trays
and microSD card slots however while the
can support up to a 64 gig card the Moto
G caps at 32 but there is one feature
this removable back on the Moto G has
that can not be found in the 1x you see
these little plastic pieces here and
here they're there for sealing up the
card trace because this phone is ipx7
certified water-resistant so this one
can be immersion up 2 meter of water for
30 minutes and still be fine which is
very impressive unfortunately you'll
have to leave the Blu life 1x behind
when enjoying some water activities the
Moto G is still a great feeling phone
and looks very nice as well but if you
appreciate a sleeker look the blue life
1x will probably be what you prefer when
it comes down to displays on budget
smartphones don't expect anything to
make your head turn with a 5 inch IPS
screen on the Moto G and a large 5.2
inch IPS screen on the blue life 1x
you'll have some really good viewing
experiences both displays look really
nice and seem to be equally bright good
enough to be able to see in sunlight
without much of a problem in terms of
colors the One X's display seems to be
more on the cooler side with really nice
and true White's while the Moto G is
more warm making the white see more
towards a reddish pinkish side if that's
not enough for you the 1x also has a
display setting that you can tinker with
called mirror vision which is an engine
that allows for interactive tuning with
real-time quality feedback this includes
preset picture mills like standard which
is what we were just comparing with the
Moto G a vivid mode that ever so
slightly boosts colors and really I know
this is up to preference but we really
love that extra kick in colors on this
display it looks gorgeous there's also a
user mode where you can unlock basic
color tuning settings like contrast
saturation picture brightness sharpness
and color temperature also a dynamic
contrast setting can be turned on and
off if you prefer a less hazed image the
Blu life 1x is still not done beating up
on the Moto G's display this 2015 Moto G
still is stuck at 720p which is a little
disappointing as you can clearly see the
pixels making for a fuzzier image than
the 1x is 1080p resolution after saying
all this the Moto G's display isn't bad
but it could definitely use a bump up to
1080p and then it would be great but
when comparing it to the One X's display
there's no competition really the
display on the One X here doesn't need
to be compared to any other phone to
show just how great of a screen it is so
let's get down to the reason why these
phones are so cheap and considered to be
budget phones you don't get a crazy
amount of power packed inside these two
phones but
seems to get just enough the blue life
1x packs a mediatek processor which is
clocked at 1.3 gigahertz while the Moto
G has a Snapdragon 410 processor which
is only a 1.4 gigahertz quad-core it's
still a great processor but with the
Moto G's base model only having one gig
of ram and the 1x having two gigs of ram
blu smartphones seem to take the upper
hand and you see this when it comes to
the benchmarks with our base model Moto
G Geekbench 3 shows a life 1x achieving
a much better single and multi-core
score and also a better ranking on into
G's performance app in normal use of
loading apps and switching between them
you'll clearly find the 1x as a much
better and faster job apps will always
load faster on the One X and not refresh
as much as a Moto G it's pretty
disappointing that the Moto G's based
model starts at one gig of ram while
still being more expensive than the One
X's base model with two gigs but we'll
take a closer look at pricing towards
the end we have an interesting
comparison when it comes to GPU we have
them more familiar Adreno 306 on the
Moto G while the Blu life 1 x has a mali
t7 20 GPU and when running some
benchmark tests with GFX bench when
looking at the low-level tests which is
all the Moto G had to offer we get some
mixed results some show the 1x falling a
bit short while others show it
outperforming by a lot but for
real-world tests we tried playing
asphalt 8 the Moto G actually seems to
load the game just as fast or a couple
seconds faster than the 1x both do play
great but expect a couple more frame
drops from playing on the blue life 1x
it's still very playable but with the
Moto G pushing less pixels that could be
why you'll see smoother playback when
listening to YouTube videos with the
speakers on these two phones we've got
complete opposites the Moto G has a
pretty decently sized front facing
speaker found on the bottom of the
display whereas the One X has a smaller
speaker found on the bottom of its
backing both speakers sound good but the
Moto G definitely has a better of the
quality even with the Moto G being the
much thicker phone blue managed to fit a
bigger battery into the taller 1x the
life 1x has a two thousand nine hundred
million by hour battery while the Moto G
has a two thousand four hundred and
seventy million power battery you're
going to get very impressive battery
life out of each phone and in no way was
I able to ever kill the batteries on
either phone in a day the only
modification I make to extend my phone's
battery is turning off bluetooth and
Wi-Fi scanning other than that all my
emails are set to push all account data
set to sync and with moderate use both
phones to last you at least four and a
half to five hours of screen
on time with the smaller and lower
resolution 720p found on the Moto G you
may get an extra 30 minutes of screen on
time over the 1x but when it comes down
to it it's hard to kill these in a day
if you're wondering which one is better
at charging times well there's no fast
charging or anything found here so if
you're heavy power user with these
budget phones you may have to charge
during the day and wait it out both
phones offer great and pretty similar
software experiences they're running
Android lollipop 5.1 and both companies
didn't really change too much creating a
really close to stock Android experience
there hasn't been any risk ins of the
menus or pulldown sections and instead
both companies just wrinkled a few extra
features on top of the already
good-looking and functional operating
system on the Moto G there aren't many
features but every feature on here users
love like moto display that lights up
your screen when you receive a
notification with fun and easy ways to
preview the message and jump into it and
you have some gestures to like twist of
your hand to launch the camera app or
chop to launch a flashlight on the blue
life 1x most features will be found
within settings and there are a lot more
within smart awake you can turn on
finger gestures when the screen is off
like drawing an N to launch your music
player C to launch your camera and OH to
launch a flashlight a DoubleTap to wit
feature is also here and there's some
more features like double tap of the
HOME key will turn off the display a
pocket mode they use it's a proximity
sensor to save battery flip to silence
calls or alarms and finally scheduled
power on and off modes so you can tell
your phone to turn off and on during
certain parts of the day which is pretty
interesting if you love a stock Android
experience you'll be happy with both
phones it's just up to you to pick the
features you prefer now in the past
Motorola was very timely with updates
but recently Motorola users are still
stuck waiting for the phones to update
to Android marshmallow which could be a
while
blue on the other hand has said they are
making an effort for timely software
updates and are making it a priority so
even with the blue life 1x just
announced we will probably lean a little
more towards blue rolling out in
marshmallow update first both cameras
here offer 13 megapixel rear-facing
sensors with flash and autofocus as well
as 5 megapixel front-facing cameras with
these phones being so cheap you won't
find any optical image stabilization
here both camera interfaces are very
simple which usually we like because
that means it's easy to use but on the
Moto G perhaps is too simple and
actually makes it harder to use you
can't have to focus
instead you need to drag to focus and
tap to snap a picture and your settings
are hidden and can only be accessed when
you pull out this little slider it makes
for a very confusing experience while in
the blue life one access interface most
of you go to options and settings are
already displayed on the screen with
tons of extra features that the Moto G
doesn't have tucked into this setting
menu here we have things like beauty
modes night modes sport modes dual view
and even a pro mode with manual controls
although as you'll soon see the Moto G
still seems to take the better pictures
even without all these extra modes both
cameras capture decent amount of details
and colors
however the Moto G always seems to have
a bit more sharpness to the image making
for a more pleasing photo colors always
seem to be much better on the Moto G and
they really come alive and make for a
beautiful picture the blue phone still
manages to create a nice picture but
with this darker image and more subdued
colors most users will probably prefer
the Moto G HDR also seems to do a better
job on the Moto G and not only does it
bring out the shadows and bring down too
overexposed parts of images like skies
but it's pretty fast
the Blu life 1x has an HDR mode - but
there's no auto mode to it so you'll
have to go into the settings menu and
click it to switch it on it does make
for a brighter image but it does say
quite a while with the progress bar
showing up after clicking the shutter
button and then you get a message urging
not to move the phone as it takes the
pictures so most of the time you'll end
up with a blurry picture still though in
these low-light photos both phones do a
really good job but the One X is always
going to need HDR mode on and a steady
hand to create viewable images the Moto
G manages a brighter picture even
without HDR but with HDR it adds some
better colors there is a night mode
found on the One X but once again you'll
end up creating very soft looking images
with not much detail due to the lack of
a steady hand the front facing five
megapixel cameras are more closely
matched but still the Moto G manages to
create the clearer and sharper image
although the One X tends to have the
better exposed picture with better
colors but it's very minimal HD video is
available on each phone although by
default the Blu life 1x is set to 720p
so make sure you change that within the
camera settings the colour is a main
difference you'll see between the two
the Moto G is much warmer than the One X
but this does come down to preference
the color temperature on the One X seems
to be less warm but still the colors are
pretty lacking compared to the Moto G
you'll see more saturated colors with
the Moto G even with this warmer tint
and you'll also get a lot more detail
out of the Moto G
and overall a better video quality
although the 1x does do a better job of
focusing on two things the Moto G is
capable of shooting slow-mo video at 120
frames per second with a lower 720p
resolution where the 1x has no video
features for such a low price point
these phones make for great cameras if
you're buying either one of these phones
the camera probably isn't going to be
the main priority for you so you should
be happy with either camera but the Moto
G does have a slight edge really if
you're in the market for a budget
smartphone the winner usually comes down
to the cheaper of the devices in this
case the blue life 1x takes the cake
with a much lower price point at only
149 dollars now the Moto G starts at 179
but you're only going to get one gig at
the base model so to get the same
storage and configuration as a blu life
1x you'll have to discuss some extra
cash at 219 which is $70 more overall
blue also goes even further to help this
one axis value is right out of the box
they include a nice pair of in earbuds a
screen protector and even a really nice
case is actually a back cover so once
you remove the leathery backing snap
this one on and will fold over the front
of the phone protecting it and
activating a black and white clock with
your notifications and even music
controls the Blu life 1x really is an
amazing value and it triumphs the Moto G
in almost every aspect when it comes to
budget smartphones there is a new king
in town well if that is the end of this
