brought to you by FreshBooks hey
blackberry Google you've been giving us
hints for a few months now we get it
you're hooking up you're doing the dilly
on Tuesday July seventh blackberry
registered to different domain names
Android secure comm and Android secure
net if you go over to Android secure
comm it redirects you to a curious page
announcing the new partnership between
blackberry and google now this
partnership was announced first in
February so there's nothing too new here
but even so this new website contains
some previously unknown details about
the Jew company's efforts which may
signal that we could expect to see
something more than just an enterprise
partnership blackberry doesn't need to
build an Android device to showcase its
hardware we all know about that the
software is what matters and that's
likely what we're witnessing here now
for those of you who are disheartened
regarding the leaks surrounding the
galaxy note 5 you may be happy to hear
about the LG G pro 3 if the leaks are
correct the LG G pro 3 will be equipped
with a 6 inch display offering 1440 x
2560 pixels resolution that's qhd which
also works out to be a pixel density of
490 pixels per inch the handset is
expected to be one of a rafted devices
powered by Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 820
chipset and should include 4 gigabytes
of ram 32 gigabytes for internal storage
and you'll be very happy to know a
microSD card slot for expandable storage
on the back the LG G pro 3 is expected
to sport a 20.7 megapixel rear camera
with laser autofocus dual LED flash and
possibly the color spectrum sensor from
the LG g4 presumably the handset will
also include optic image stabilization
and 4k video recording although this is
yet to be confirmed on the front the LG
G pro 3 will sport an 8 megapixel camera
which should capture outstanding selfies
and will be one of the highest on
current flagship smartphones now if
you're looking for a phone to buy your
mom who is just going to go buy an
expensive iPhone you may want to
consider the galaxy a8
it's coming very soon a new report this
week from nowhere else suggests that the
wait for the galaxy a8 is almost over
with Samsung expected to unveil the a8
in China on July seventeenth for around
four hundred eighty five dollars US
based on previous leaks we know that the
galaxy a8 is likely to feature a 5.7
inch 1080p Super AMOLED display and be
powered by an octo core Snapdragon 615
processor with two gigabytes of RAM
unlike the galaxy s6 edge flagship the
galaxy a8 will have microsd support
allowing you to expand 16 gigabytes of
internal storage the key selling feature
of the galaxy a8 is the impossibly thin
body at just 5.9 4 millimeters thick the
galaxy a8 is even thinner than the
galaxy s6 at six point eight millimeters
and the iphone 6 at six point nine
millimeters despite the thin body
samsung has managed to add a 16
megapixel iso cell camera and a series
of recent leaks have also revealed that
the galaxy a8 will have a tap based
fingerprint sensor like the galaxy s6
which should increase the handsets
appeal to the upper mid-range market the
handset will be available in three
colors black gold and white a separate
leak from a chinese website pc online
has revealed a gallery of images showing
the a eight in all its metal glory and
you'll be happy to know we have a little
mini preview of Android M first the app
drawer has once again been modified as
you might recall the first M preview
brought a new vertical scrolling app
drawer that was alphabetically sorted
and featured for shortcuts on the top
row while this is still true the
difference now is that the ABC lettering
on the side has now been removed you
also may remember the system UI tuner
from the first preview this made it easy
to tweak what icon showed up in the
quick settings menu though at first it
had to be turned on in the developer
options with the second preview this
functionality remains but it is also
extended to the status bar now I love it
when I get a sponsor that I've
personally used and can recommend and i
have used FreshBooks the super easy
invoicing software and it wasn't just
easy for me it was easy for the clients
no confusion I send the invoice date

expenses is also just as easy you can
