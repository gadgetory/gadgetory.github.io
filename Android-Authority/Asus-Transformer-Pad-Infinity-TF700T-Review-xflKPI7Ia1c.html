Clayton young we're coming at you from
the number one source for all things
Android Android authority comm today
we've got an in-depth review of the Asus
Transformer Pad Infinity TF 700 T and
this is basically a Souza's flagship
model as of right now and it's starting
to phase out the transformer primes
which used to be their flagship model
but this is an extremely spec heavy
machine it's got great software great
looks
an impressive build quality so let's
just check it out go ahead and lift the
tablet up you can see we do have our
10.1 inch screen this is a LED backlit
super IPS plus display coming in at a
resolution of 1920 by 1200 it's also
constructed from Gorilla Glass 2 which
is very very durable on there's no give
to the screen whatsoever
it feels exceptional you can tap on it
and it's a nice glass feel so any ways
around this gorgeous display we've got a
nice brushed aluminum exterior it's got
a nice a circular pattern going out from
the Asus logo there it looks extremely
great it's great build quality there's
no give to the back of the aluminum
either you can't really press your
fingers into it it's just very very
solid we've got an 8 megapixel camera
right here we've also got flash which
differentiates this from the other Asus
tablets that could be somewhat similar
got a small microphone there as well
the top we have our volume rocker this
is placed differently than the Asus TF
300 T for example which is on the side
they place this in a more usable area so
you can actually get the best use out of
the volume rocker also got our power
button right here on the side here we've
got our mini HDMI our 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack which also has microphone
in then we've got our little mini SD
slot and then on this side we just have
a small mic and we have our thing it is
a 16 pin connector on the bottom here
and then our two little log connectors
for the mobile dock and we also have the
mobile dock on deck will show you us
some of that but anyways let's just
start this bad boy up go ahead and go
into the lock screen as you can see some
of you might recognize this is running
Android 4.0.3 currently so
it's Ice Cream Sandwich we'll go ahead
and unlock it this is running the asus
wave share UI over the Ice Cream
Sandwich operating system but the wave
share UI usually sticks true to the AOSP
Android and it's not to true Civ it's
not too gaudy there's not really much
theming done just some different soft
keys down here and then a different menu
in the status bar so if we go ahead and
open up our settings you can see that it
is very very basic a OSP android we have
all our usual settings for Ice Cream
Sandwich our Wi-Fi Bluetooth data usage
and then under more settings we have
airplane mode VPN and then we can attend
the mobile hotspot and set up
peer-to-peer connectivity no server
sound options or display options now the
display options are pretty much basic
from the main settings menu here where
you really get into them is right here
on the status bar where we can select
the IPS plus mode where it brightens the
screen drastically it has 600 nits of
brightness you can view that outside for
outdoor readability and stuff like that
and also enable the auto brightness
which dims the screen incredibly and
saves a lot of the battery now you're
going to be getting close to 10 hours of
battery life with the actual tablet and
then an added 5 hours with the included
mobile dock which has a battery built in
but anyways we'll just keep going
through here we have our asus customized
settings where we can enable the super
IPS mode choose which key actually takes
a screenshot on the device we have our
system performance mode which can also
be accessed from right here we have our
power saver our balance in our
performance mode now the performance
mode is going to really push the Tegra 3
in this device this is a quad-core
device running at 1.6 gigahertz
that's the highest clocked Tegra device
or a processor I mean from the factory
without overclocking or rooting your
device in any ways we've also got one
gigabyte of ddr3 RAM in this bad boy
push in the apps and hum and right
alongside the Tegra 3 to give you the
best performance possible we also have
our touchpad in our pointer behavior
which is in conjunction with the small
mobile dock now we'll go through we have
our accounts in sync we can set up our
google accounts and we can use the asus
sync feature
anyways under developer
of course we can enable the USB
debugging and also the forced GPU
rendering with 2d hardware acceleration
native to Ice Cream Sandwich under about
tablet you see we do have our Android
4.0.3 we have the model number the usual
information that comes with the Asus
tablets and the Ice Cream Sandwich
operating system nice little Easter Egg
and stuff I mean the tablet just looks
awesome when displaying anything such as
HD movies or gaming or anything that
uses the IPS display so anyways I just
give you a basic look at this wave share
UI it's really nice we have our app tray
here all of our different apps we come
preloaded with the app backup the app
Locker we have the Asus vibe application
this also comes with Polaris Office for
a great mobility of especially compared
I mean in conjunction with the mobile
dock you get great workspace we also
have the my net the my cloud with free a
su storage we have a press reader and
then we have the Zinio we have a lot of
cool native widgets such as the asus
battery widget email the task manager
the my zine is great it's a nice
aggregator for social media and then a
weather and stuff like that we do have
the asus weather we'll go through we
have our usual Ice Cream Sandwich
bookmarks here nothing too special about
those we'll go ahead and add a widget
just to show you what it's like go to
our task manager and set that here now
we have all of our processes that are
running and we can one-click clean wipe
them all free our RAM and now with our
free RAM we'll go ahead and run a
quadrant test to show you exactly how
fast this beautiful machine is now mind
you we can also kill our recent apps
from the reasons just like that swipe
them all away and now we don't have
anything running you have a full
optimization of power for the quadrant
test we'll go ahead and run that right
now we have the results of our benchmark
test here go ahead and send our results
flip it up this way so we can get a look
now our device came in at 30 802 which
actually came under the transformer
prime for some reason unbeknownst to me
this is clocked faster
it has the ddr3 RAM and I wasn't running
any applications but you know these
aren't always the most incredibly
accurate things we can go ahead and run
another some other time let's see what
our bottleneck was we have our CPU
clocked at one o'clock but it's our CPU
came in at 7500 18 just fairly good we
our memory came in at 3987
our IO at 4367 2d was very very low at
654 and then our 3d was 2485 but this is
still a great fast machine it does stand
up to the HTC One X and a transformer
prime as you can see which both have the
Tegra 3 this does have the fastest clock
and you can route this device at
overclock of course you know us we're
gonna make a video showing you guys how
exactly to do that and how to route you
know all that stuff custom roms anyways
back into the device let's test out the
camera our 8 megapixel camera has a 5
lens filter it has a great aperture so
let's go ahead and do some test shots
I'll set my Galaxy Nexus right here and
you can see if we can't get some nice
photos of that and I'll just go ahead
you can touch the focus and we'll snap
our pic not the fastest shutter but it's
not very slow at all we can go ahead and
press it a few times doesn't have the
instant shutter that like the Galaxy
Nexus per se does videos will go through
our camera options here we have our auto
flash options our white balance options
usual Ice Cream Sandwich our exposure
options the different scenes now wait
we'll go back we have our camera menu
right here we have our store location or
aspect ratio we also have the picture
size the focus mode where we can choose
continuous autofocus or regular or
infinity infinity is my favorite we have
our ISO our anti flickering and we have
our shutting a shutter sound on or off
go ahead and go into our video records
at full 1080p HD just do a nice sweep of
the Galaxy Nexus like this we'll go
ahead and play that video give you a
nice no demo of what the display
actually looks like when it's running
like this so it did look nice and I was
actually impressed with the microphone
quality that we just experienced there
is a few different mics placed around
the body and it does have the Asus sonic
master audio technology so that's very
nice I like the audio quality I was
quite impressed anyways we'll go ahead
and check out a browser test here we can
restore our actually we won't restore
and it'll take us to our Asus we were
prompted to download the Flash Player we
won't do that right now I will just show
you the basic browser we have our usual
ICS browser we can request a desktop
site on all sites for app we have our
bookmarks our new tab
incognito tabs we can simply add a tab
just like that the browser is really
quick
I have a pretty fast connection right
now but the browser is very snappy we
have our settings we can enable the labs
for our quick controls and stuff like
that
you never advanced settings so it works
really great for browsing document
creating gaming watching videos taking
videos and just having a great tablet
well go ahead and check out a youtube
video now to check out the HD of this
device HD performance and go ahead and
click our unboxing of this device now
this is the actual device that I'm
touching right now so it does look nice
plays videos great we'll go ahead and go
back I'll show you quickly the nice
mobile dock now the mobile dock is
constructed and matching in the same
color as the infinity pad is we do have
the little instructions here in the dock
it's full QWERTY it has a touchpad and
it also has a nice USB 2.0 slot right
here and it has a microSD slot actually
not micro but a regular full size SD
card reader right there and on the back
we just have our brushed aluminum looks
really great
has our nice four pads here so we don't
scratch up the aluminum we have our nice
strong hinge so we'll just insert our
Asus tablet into the dock like that we
have our nice little arrows to indicate
where it's at we slide it in until we
hear the click we have our nice little
bar that can release the tablet when
they have
then we have audio confirmation that the
tablet is indeed in the dock now I'll
just go ahead we can just simply start
typing we type too and read authority
brought it up on the Google search just
like that and then we can simply search
for it or anything like that we have all
of our quick controls on here we have
the back we have our network functions
Bluetooth we can disable the touchpad
change the brightness almost just like a
laptop model brightness and go to our
camera that's actually the screen shot
we can enter the web browser go to our
settings just like that control our
media we have all of our different
controls we can get the menu just like
that we can go home we can search our
touchpads nice we've just got a nice
little mouse and we can scroll around we
also have our gesture control with the
touchpad we can switch screens simply by
using two finger slides like that
actually we went to the wallpaper and
slide with two fingers we can scroll up
and down with two fingers in webpages
and then two finger hold is the long
press so anyways guys go ahead and check
out this awesome TF 700 T it's a little
steep in price but I really really love
the tablet I think it's Asus best tablet
yet and that's including the Nexus 7 I
definitely enjoy this a lot it's great
has great build quality looks sexy I'm
gonna get a lot of compliments on the
device it runs fast it's very powerful
you can game you can create documents
watch HD videos relax with the device
and then it's very portable the
clamshell design on the little mobile
dock in the asus is even smaller and has
a thinner profile than most of their
other clamshell designs with tablets so
go ahead and check it out guys we're
also gonna have routing guys for this
thing there's a lot of different rom
reviews cool performance mods and stuff
like that so stay tuned with hands are
the 30.com and as always thanks for
watching the video guys we really
appreciate your views have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
