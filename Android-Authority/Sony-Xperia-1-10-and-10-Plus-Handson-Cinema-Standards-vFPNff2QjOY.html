MWC and Sony is showing off a few new
phones here now we saw the Xperia XE 2
and X 8:30 last year and those were
obviously their flagships but this year
we've got something new it's called the
experience 1 totally rebranding this
phone because it's got so many new
features it's a totally new form factor
and they're just moving in a totally new
direction with all their phones here so
the biggest thing that you're gonna see
in both the Xperia 1 and the Xperia 10
and 10 Plus which are the lower-end
models are these 21 by 9 display and
that's crazy I mean a lot of movies are
shot in 21 by 9 and its Sony right so
you obviously are going to try to get
that same cinema experience that Sony is
always touting with their phones now
with the 21 by 9 display obviously it's
gonna be a little big for most people
but they're trying to fix that by making
multitasking a much more fluid
experience in these phones so you could
use an app like you're texting you could
also be watching a youtube video at the
same time and they said that they want
to enable the ability to be able to
multitask a lot more fluidly so they're
gonna have a separate little app action
here that allows you to do that
so both phones are 21 by 9 but the
Xperia 1 is obviously going to be the
flagship for this year it's got this
beautiful 4k HDR OLED display which is
kind of custom for Sony we saw a very
very nice displays in the Xperia x8 2
and x2 3 last year but these are gonna
be a little bit better they're working
with the bravia team here so you're
gonna get that beautiful OLED display
just like you would get on a Sony TV now
the other probably major feature on the
Xperia 1 are these triple cameras on the
back you've got a medium a wide and a
telephoto camera here they're all 12
megapixels but they said that they've
worked with the sony alpha team from the
a7 camera series to kind of deliver a
more cinema like experience so you can
shoot in 20 by 9 by 9 as well not a lot
of phones let you do that and they
really want you to be able to get this
nice movie experience on these phones
they've also added the option to shoot
in 24 frames per second because
obviously that is kind of the cinema
standard these days so that's really
nice to see here as well just a quick
note that our MWC coverage is brought to
you by digit daily your daily dose of
text
bring to your inbox check out the
description below to learn more next
year one doesn't have a headphone jack
unlike the Xperia 10 an experience n
plus but it does one of the first phones
to have the qualcomm snapdragon 855 it's
got six gigabytes of RAM around 128
gigabytes of storage so it's definitely
a true 2019 flagship especially because
of the SOC you're getting in here an
Xperia e NN the 10-plus are a little
more mid-range in the 10 you're getting
the Snapdragon 630 and in the 10 plus
you're getting these 636 so they're
definitely mid-ranged phones but they do
have headphone jacks if you want to
experience the full breadth of Sony's
audio processing all three phones also
have a side mounted for your print
sensor like we've seen in previous Sony
devices so you're not getting in the
back you're not getting in the screen
but I've always thought that these side
fingerprint sensors are actually pretty
cool now we don't have regional pricing
or availability for either of these
phones but both the Xperia 10 and the 10
plus are coming March 18th while the
Xperia 1 is coming later in May alright
if you want to learn more about these
phones we obviously have all the
nitty-gritty detail over on Android
authority comm we've got a full post
with lots of photos and we're probably
going to be seeing a little bit more
from sony here at MWC 2019 so make sure
you stay tuned to all of our coverage
and we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
