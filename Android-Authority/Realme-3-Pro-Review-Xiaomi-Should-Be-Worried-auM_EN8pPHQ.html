advanced device from real me yet and it
still has a microUSB so real Mia's been
making a name for itself as possibly the
best manufacturer and it comes to sub
$100 devices their devices generally
offer a really great value for money
really great performance for that price
the only gripe I really had with them
was a the fact that they didn't always
improve that much between generations
they released a lot of devices very
quickly and B they always had a microUSB
and by now three generations are on a
device with Pro in the name you'd think
they'd get rid of the microUSB probably
not going to change the way you use this
too much on a day to day basis but it's
definitely backwards thinking and it's
the only real blight on what otherwise
is a fantastic value proposition so with
that little break out of the way what
else do we got well the device makes a
good first impression that design is
actually quite nice the back panel is
supporting the same gradient effect that
we saw on the real we 3 but now also has
a light grating effect basically this
means lots of very thin lines that you
can only just make out but it really
adds to the texture and it's kind of in
a slight S shaped pattern so yeah add
some extra detail to the back and does
make it feel a little bit more premium
it feels quite light in the hand there's
got tapered edges on the whole it's very
nice to use perhaps the only real odd
thing about the design is that there's
no obvious design language between these
different devices in the real mean line
that's not going to be a problem for the
end user really on the other slight
blight in terms of the design is that
the volume rocker is to set four buttons
which always feels a bit cheap but it's
not the end of the world either there's
a speaker grille down the bottom just a
single one but it's perfectly loud and
there's a fingerprint sensor which works
really well around back the face unlock
also works really quickly and there's a
headphone jack the only big omission
unfortunately is NFC which I know isn't
a big deal in a lot of markets but for
some people that's likely to be a
deal-breaker if you like paying with
your phone for instance that said some
users will also be very happy to see if
there's a dual SIM tray here on the
front you've got a 6.3 inch 1080p
notched IPS LCD display looks nice and
punchy nice and bright along with good
sound not groundbreaking but given the
roughly $200 price tag that we can
expect it's very nice to see that it's
not a 720p as you do see on some
competitor models around this price it's
also
Gorilla Glass 5 so that's nice and
shouldn't mean that doesn't get damaged
too quickly but the good news continues
on the inside with the inclusion of the
snapdragon 710 SOC and that comes with
the very welcome Adreno six one six GPU
this is a big step up from the real me
to pro and an even bigger step up from
the real me 3 that's the kind of
improvement that I like to see between
different versions and pro models and
it's also superior to the redmi note 7
pro which sports the 675 SOC so that's a
very good win for real me if you watch a
lot of my videos then you'll know one of
the ways that I like to benchmark a
device is by putting it through its
paces using the dolphin GameCube
emulator and the good news here is that
this device can actually play Metroid
Prime as a stable and tolerable
framerate which is really impressive for
the price in fact this is something that
not even my Exynos 9810 sporting note 9
can do and that device will cost you
about five times as much as this one so
that's a massive win and generally all
throughout the UI performance has been
good no real stutters no real lag very
very good performance also really
impressive is the 4045 milliamp hour
battery which gives it all day
performance thanks to the efficiency of
the chip and Android 9 really you can
use it all day without worrying about
charging it up again and the camera
setup is also really good if a little
bit weird on the back you get a 16
megapixel lens with a 5 megapixel
backing it up it's a Sony IMX 5 1:9
sensor so produces some pretty good
quality but around the front you get a
whopping 25 megapixels so that's quite
unusual not only to see a selfie camera
that has a larger megapixel count than
the back camera but also a significantly
larger megapixel count the performance
on that type of camera is just as good
as you'd expect
also the AI smarts of the snapdragon 710
make themselves known with the bokeh
effect which work really well at cutting
out my gelled hair then there's the AI
Beauty mode which I was going to say
they really care about but actually I
really like how I look in some of these
stealthy photos so yes actually alright
and the rear camera is not too shabby
either
again it's not groundbreaking but the
photos come out nice and sharp I only
had one or two incidents where the auto
exposure came out a bit funny
the
Ã¡i again is really good at detecting
scenes and actually enhancing them for a
change instead of just over saturating
everything you shouldn't be disappointed
with this camera at all video is a
little bit less exciting only 1080p at
30fps there's also some cool features
here you get super slo-mo actual super
slo-mo that's 960 fps only at 720p
though but that's really great for a
device this price also you get the night
scape mode which I said in the real me 3
review that I wasn't blown away with
there's nothing wrong with it don't get
me wrong it just it takes a while to
work and it's not quite as impressive as
even the regular setting on a flagship
camera it's a bit better this time
around it's not amazing but I'd
certainly rather have it than not and in
situations where you don't have much
light it will definitely boost the
clarity so that's a welcome addition
certainly doesn't hurt finally rounding
off the package is the software you get
color OS 6 over the top of Android 9
that is a slightly heavy skinned
certainly not to everyone's tastes that
rather ostentatious notification shade
is still present and correct the
settings menu is pretty hard to navigate
not very intuitive and generally there
are some aesthetic touches throughout
but I'm not a huge fan of it's a bit iOS
inspired still but it's improving I
don't think it's gonna be a deal-breaker
for a lot of people or at least it
certainly shouldn't be it doesn't really
get in the way it's just that it's not
my favorite choice and so overall the
real movie pro is a really fantastic
package you get some really good
performance here better than any
flagship from last generation in many
ways you get a really decent camera
which is capable of some cool nifty
tricks especially that selfie camera
you only letdowns really are the lack of
NFC color OS for some people and that
Dan microUSB if they just get rid of
that then this would be an incredible
package as it is it's still a really
great package and one that I would
recommend to a lot of people in fact my
own wife anybody who's looking for a
device that's going to perform really
really well
doesn't want to spend a huge amount of
money and then one who isn't too
concerned about things like USB type-c
in other words no tic fetishists I think
Xiaomi should actually be a little bit
worried
don't found this video useful
interesting guys if you did then please
leave a like down below please share it
around that helps us out immensely leave
a comment in the comment section down
below and let me know whether that micro
USB is a deal-breaker for you or whether
you think it's a big fuss about nothing
