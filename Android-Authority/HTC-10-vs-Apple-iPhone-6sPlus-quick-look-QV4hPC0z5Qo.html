designs as we look at the latest
flagship the one less HTC 10 it's a
phone that not only aims to continue the
company's legacy but to become one of
the more notable flagships for the first
half of 2016 before all that though
we're quickly pitting it against what's
arguably the best selling smartphones
around hey guys John Velasco here with
the Android authority and I'm taking a
quick look between the HTC 10 and the
Apple iPhone 6s and 6s plus each phone
has its particular quirks but we can
agree that metal is the best way to go
when you want something premium some
folks will prefer the sleeker more
uniform flatness of the iPhones design
but the HTC tends contour helps it to be
a more ergonomic in the hand the HTC 10
is also significantly easier to handle
over the larger iPhone 6s plus since
that phone is just a lot of phone to
deal with but the iPhone 6s is even
smaller than the two of them while the
iPhones design is unmistakable the HTC
10 definitely manages to etch out an
interesting silhouette that's genuinely
unique it's still unclear whether or not
Apple's new 3d touch technology is
something that's fancied amongst users
but the retina displays on these iPhones
deliver some top-notch qualities
fortunately for HTC they're taking a
substantial approach because the 5.2
inch Super LCD 5 display is now offering
a more contemporary quad HD resolution
so yeah there are more pixels bunched up
into the screen making it far more
detailed it looks pretty convincing
however HTC is emphasizing the improved
touch responsiveness of its new display
Apple popularized the idea of having
fingerprint sensors in phones again but
the HTC 10 employs a similar
implementation with its own one they
work pretty good now don't be fooled by
the iPhones Hardware punch either
because it's deceptively fordable
its dual-core Apple a9 chipset combined
with 2 gigabytes of RAM makes the phone
fly including graphics processing which
sometimes proves to be too much for
phones with quad HD screens HTC doesn't
hold back either with its latest price
stallion powered by snapdragon 820
chip coupled with four gigabytes of RAM
and the audrina 430 GPU we're pretty
confident that it will prove to be more
than capable as well Apple's iPhones
have always been solid snappers by
taking some good-looking photos no
matter the condition that's one
megapixel iSight cameras have proven to
be quite the charmer with their
excellent all-round performance
meanwhile HTC we see flack about its
so-called ultra pixel cameras in the
past and for the longest of time now
they've been beyond it up but the HTC 10
has something ambitious you have a 12
megapixel HTC ultra pixel camera it's
combined with an F 1.8 aperture lens and
1.5 5 micron pixels which intends to do
phenomenal on the low-light one nice
things about iOS is that it's very easy
for almost anyone to quickly adapt to
using they've optimized it over the
years but where it lacks in the
customization department and makes up
with its ease of use for the HTC 10
we're greeted with the most up-to-date
version of the platform that's Android
6.0 marshmallow but it comes with a
revamped Sense experience its latest
version of scent
still commands the same look and feel
we're familiar with but interesting
enough I'm intrigued by HTC decision to
eliminate clutter by no longer throwing
in its own apps which is a good thing in
making the experience more
straightforward price-wise the HTC 10 is
coming to us unlocked and outright for
$700 through HTC's own website so
absolutely have several convincing
reasons to pick it up over the iPhone 6s
or 6s plus we start at 650 and 750
respectively friends updated design the
higher resolution display fingerprint
sensor and a new camera gear the HTC 10
is poised to be a pretty good competitor
to Apple's finest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
