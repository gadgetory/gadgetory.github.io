name HTC hopes that its new flagship is
no longer just the one but it is also a
perfect 10 it's Josh freghar from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and here's your first look in
our hands-on with the HTC 10 at first
glance the HTC 10 still retains a lot of
what made previous HTC devices so well
received
you have the all-metal construction but
there are a few things here that have
been changed around as they are features
that were introduced in the HTC One a9
from a little while ago we'll start with
the front of the device which has a 5.2
inch display and so far it hasn't been
that hard to handle in one hand but are
a couple of reasons for that but first
we will take a look at the bottom of the
device where you see that one of the
boom sound speakers has been removed
much like the HTC One a9 there are now
capacitive keys down here including a
capacitive home button that is slightly
recessed because it also houses a
fingerprint sensor boom sound is still
around it just has been changed around a
bit at the top there there is a full
speaker still that also doubles as the
phone speaker and at the bottom is
another grill right next to the USB
type-c port that is actually supposed to
function more like a subwoofer the
result is supposed to be more fuller
richer sound coming out of the phone
speakers while you're looking at media
or gaming for example but the other main
changes on the backing where we have now
what's called the silhouette design
edges or slopes are now all around the
rim of the device which provide a bit of
a curve that makes the device feel even
better in the hand as a contours to the
shape of the palm which helps with the
5.2 inch screens handling but really it
is a nice design choice because it
accentuates the htc area in the middle
while the light reflects off the edges
to provide that silhouetted look and 2.5
D glass covers the LCD 5 display which
comes in a quad HD resolution now so far
the colors look quite nice on this
display but what HTC really wanted to
drive home is the fact that it adheres
to the NTSC standard much more than any
other phone out there underneath the
surface is the Snapdragon 820 with 4
gigabytes of RAM and yes microSD card
expansion as we continue with hardware
the fingerprint sensor in that home
button seems to work pretty well this
far registering a fingerprint is as easy
as you would expect
to be on any Android device these days
and it's just a matter of holding the
finger on that particular area and the
phone will wake itself and then unlock
after reading your fingerprint battery
life hinges on a 3000 milliamp hour
battery which has proven itself in other
phones already to be a good capacity for
maybe one to one and a half days worth
hopefully two days with good power
saving features whether or not it does
make it to that 2 day mark is something
we'll save for the full review but with
quick charge 3.0 and a USB type-c ports
half an hour's worth of charging could
bring one day worth of battery life
overall which is a pretty nice prospect
one of the biggest additions and the HTC
10 is the ability for this phone to
really Drive good headphones and with a
DAC inside and also a headphone amp that
is built into that headphone jack found
centered on the top the HTC 10 is
supposed to provide one of the best
audio experiences around the camera has
always been a bit of a sore spot for HTC
but the ultrapixel returns and now bring
12 ultra pixels in the main camera at
1.5 5 micron sizes laser autofocus and
optical image stabilization are also
included to back up this F 1.8 aperture
package there are plenty of modes in the
app including hyperlapse and a pearl
manual mode to cater all of the settings
for a better shot and 4k video recording
is also available but it now records
high res audio which seems in line with
the boom sound capabilities the front
camera might please quite a few people
with 5 megapixels that also boasts F 1.8
aperture and a slightly wider field of
view for better selfies but what really
makes it nice is the included optical
image stabilization this is a first for
a front camera and it will allow for
even better photos in lower light
conditions not to mention the ability to
create more stabilized selfie videos and
in software we do have the return of HTC
Sense you still get the regular home
screens and the app drawer is included
if you are worried about that in this
version of Android and you also get
blink feed on the side for an easy way
of taking a look at the latest headlines
HTC made a big point of saying that in
cooperation with Google they are trying
to consolidate their applications where
there were once duplicates with HTC apps
and Google Apps there may now just be
one application for example the
messaging app is still available despite
there being a Google version
messenger and instead of having their
own gallery inside of HTC Sense they are
now just going to use Google photos a
couple of software additions include
Boost Plus which brings some finite
control to the RAM management storage
and even background application
management for better battery life and
the theming engine has been enhanced to
provide even better customization but
those are all things that we will leave
off for our full review the HTC 10 is
available for pre-order beginning to
date on April 12th with shipping in
early May the unlock Edition will come
in silver and gray and will cost six
hundred and ninety nine dollars and so
there you have it for this first look
and hands-on with the HTC ten we have
had our hands on this review unit for a
little bit now so our full review might
be coming a little bit sooner than you
think
with a solid and beautiful design and
focus on audio and camera this time
around the HTC 10 just might be the
alternative to the other flagship we see
this year that you've been waiting for
but you're gonna have to see what we
think on our full review coming very
soon keep it tuned to Android authority
for all of that and even more coverage
on the HTC 10 and make sure you
