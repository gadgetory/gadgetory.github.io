been four months over four months since
I last saw this phone at MWC 2016 Earl
in a year and in that span the time
since it was announced - now we've seen
a lot of great phones but when it comes
to value for the buck don't count out
this one phone that we're checking out
right here hey guys John Belasco here
with Android authority and this is a
quick look yet again at the Alpha tel
idol 4s
they see this here this is the Alcatel
idol 4s now it's not a phone right but
this is actually the packaging it comes
with so when you pre-order it right now
you're going to get the VR headset
bundle so it comes like this which is
pretty cool but when open up you have
the handset this is the phone inside but
it's really nice because at the box
right away it's a VR ready so nothing by
additional peripheral for that it comes
with it and the cool thing about this
case too I like is that it also doubles
as a storage compartment for all the
other accessories like the wall charger
the cable the phone itself and also the
headphone so everything to put inside
your traveling got to go on a plane and
you want to bring your VR headset this
just makes it a lot easier to do that
not a whole lot has changed from in
terms of the specs for the idol 4s it's
actually it's the same from what we saw
back at MWC so that includes a 5.5 inch
quad HD AMOLED display you have a 16
megapixel rear camera an 8 megapixel
front-facing one JBL certified speakers
you're gonna have NFC Snapdragon 650 2
processor 3 gigabytes of RAM 32
gigabytes of internal storage micro SD
card slot dual SIM it's unlock and it's
running Android 6.0 marshmallow they say
it's gonna get upgraded but we don't
know exactly when but that's the specs
right there but there are two notable
changes with the phone now the first
change is found on the back of the phone
if we look back at MWC and what we saw
then they had a sticker beneath the
camera lense of the idol 4s now we know
why because it has a fingerprint sensor
which definitely adds value to the phone
because for the price point it's really
nice to have it right there so it gives
you the added level of security and
secondly there's going to be a special
bundle for the phone now it's going to
go on sale officially on August 3rd
through hotels retail channels and it's
gonna sell for $400 399
to be exact and that cost includes the
phone the VR headset the JBL headphones
the incipio case and also a tempered
glass screen protector so a lot of stuff
included in that foreign dollar costs
but it's going to go on for pre-order
starting on July 15 and at that point
you could actually pick it up for only
$350
that's for watch it for the idol 4s I'm
kind of excited about this foam because
for the price point it's pretty
aggressive it's going to compete against
some other mid-range or phones that are
released since then but given the specs
or the included goodies that come with
package it's pretty aggressive I'd say
and top that the design has definitely
evolved you know have that glass metal
finish with it giving it that premium
feel and top of that the price point is
pretty pretty nice also so if you guys
want to learn more about the Alcatel
idol 4 edge you could check our website
