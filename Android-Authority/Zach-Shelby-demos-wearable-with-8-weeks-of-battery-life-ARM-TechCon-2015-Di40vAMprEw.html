Wrangler authority we're at arm techcon
2015 in California and I met up with
Jack Zack Shelby from arm hey Zack nicer
for you Gary pleasure so tell me a bit
about what you do from so I'm lucky
enough to be one of the IOT nerds at arm
so what we do is we go and build
technology and work with a whole bunch
of partners to make IOT into what we
know from mobile and cloud something
really easy to build into real products
and real solutions now I OT is a word
that the industry is talking about but
maybe the average consumer doesn't
really know what it is yet what will I
OT mean to consumers slowing I think
about it is that when when I OT is
really successful our lives just be a
little bit easier a little bit more
intuitive when we're working with real
devices and I'll just use the thermostat
as a great example right what nest did
with the thermostat is they recreated an
everyday object that was kind of clunky
right you just you never really got it
was boring but they spent the time and
energy to really make the user
experience of the thermostat better and
what the user experience is is it learns
how you live and does its job for you so
you don't have to think about it at all
and I think that's the magic of IOT
right we're going to see that happen
with your door lock right with your
automobile with your other everyday
household items that you use in your
life and they'll just get a little bit
easier to use a little bit more
automatic you won't have to think about
them are worried about them and that's
when we've succeeded in IOT now that is
a really good definition I realized I
know what's arm roll arms role in this
IOT revolution so arm as a technology
company armed with our partners we
produce most of the ships that go into
devices that that are in the IOT so
electronic gadgets in your home in your
street lights and your energy meters all
over and what we can do thanks to a
common architecture is we can provide
software tools for developers cloud
services to make things easier to
everyone in our ecosystem and that's
exactly what we're doing right now we're
a software ecosystem we call em bed so
make it easier for everyone to create
IOT solutions and I mean everyone right
i mean everyone from the the tinkerer
who's thinking about the new cool IOT
thing to the startup that's already on
their way to creating a new company to
big established companies that are
making their products better right we
want to make IOT accessible to all of
these guys and in fact for the sort of
the hacker at home the the entry-level
price for em but is really cheap is it
like twenty twenty dollars or something
and you can get yourself up and running
yeah twenty dollars a simple development
board we've made the operating system
that we've launched recently embed OS
we've made it completely free free as in
go to production make a product tell us
about it and we'll help tell the world
about what kind of success you had in
doing that and we found that doing that
in an ecosystem we have everyone from
cloud providers like IBM all the way
down to silicon vendors working together
to make that easier that's really
exciting that's that's power of an
ecosystem rather than doing every
exactly the power of the ecosystem I
think we're gonna look at some demos now
yes great so this is a new wearables
reference design that we created to try
to show what are some of the cool things
that you can do with wearable thanks to
em at OS and so we have a fully
functional low-energy wearable and by
low-energy the really amazing thing is
with a new type of software energy
consumption savings technology we're
able to use cortex-m microcontrollers
and produce something that has eight
weeks of battery life did you just say
eight weeks weeks not eight days not
eight hours eight weeks so here I'm
still at seventy-eight percent battery
life six weeks left over eight weeks in
total and that's running a real watch
with real applications on it absolutely
that's actually amazing it's great it
make it's going to make it's going to
make wearables and our other products a
lot easier to use and a lot of a lot
less intrusive in our life things like
recharging so this is the main PCB
inside the watch what you can see here
we got a cortex m3 from sigh labs we got
m0 from Nordic semiconductors and we
and f cortex m4 from st we also got a
gps from you blogs we got an NFC chip
from st and we got a 9 access motion
sensor chip we also got buses and LEDs
and vibrator and an SD card if you want
to throw some some more information and
here you can see the small battery we're
using it's a 160 million hours lithium
polymer and if you look on the screen
here you can see that we can achieve
very low power consumption it gives us a
battery life around one to two months</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
