handy the Android authority app guy
baldur's gate was released in 1998 and
it was single-handedly responsible for
renewing the RPG genre on PCs now it's
been released for Android and we're
going to check it out if you play
baldur's gate before a lot of this won't
feel new to you however the last time
you played it you probably played it
with a keyboard and a mouse which
allowed for a lot more action at once in
this version you'll be playing with
touch controls and believe me the
experience is vastly different you can
do pretty much everything you used to be
able to do attack cast and learn spells
pick up and use items switch between
characters and all of the other things
you're used to being able to do for
those who have never played before your
character and another character named mo
in our lifelong friends who embark on an
adventure to save Baldur's Gate from
sinister forces it is a very long
adventure along the way you meet new
friends and digest a lot of story line
the game can go for well over 40 hours
even if you're a quick game player for
first-time players it'll be much longer
than that comparatively speaking folders
gate is one of the largest longest and
most complex games ever to be released
on Android and that's really it for
gameplay folks you start the game you
play the story get through the quests
and the story ends it is worth
mentioning that there are two additional
characters available as in-app purchases
along with a voice set and a portrait
set you can use these to augment your
experience and customize your character
a little bit it also includes pretty
much all of the dlc and expansion packs
from the original boulders gate
mechanics are where things start to get
sticky where there were once hotkeys and
keyboard commands and mouse movements
there are now touch controls admittedly
things are a lot slower on mobile than
they were on PC you tap on areas to
navigate to them or on objects to
interact with them this includes
staircases doors chests traps people
enemies and general navigation on the
left side there are icons that open
various things such as your spell list
inventory journal character sheet as
well as buttons that let you rest and
pause the game resting of course also
doubles as a way to learn spells and
pausing the game is an essential element
to get your party in order during
intense moments of the game because
touch controls simply aren't fast enough
on their own on the right side is your
party list where you can switch between
characters as well as buttons that do
things like raise and lower character
names on the screen and show objects on
the bottom is an action bar where you
choose your special abilities attacks
spells and items that you can use
much everything in this game is tapping
you tap to move tap to attack tap to
select things and tap to do pretty much
anything else there really aren't any
weird swipe or gesture commands in the
journal you can take down your own notes
and use the device keyboard for that
okay so here's what we liked about
baldur's gate the story is long and
complex it ranks among the longest games
available on Android it's almost twice
as long as Bard's Tale and that's not
counting the black pit dlc and the other
various expansions that come included
with this game for free if you're a
gamer and you like games that actually
take a long time to beat I think you're
gonna like this the graphics and music
are above average they're not amazing
because if you pinch-to-zoom on screen
things get a little bit fuzzy however
the game as a whole including the
cutscenes are very fun to look at there
are virtually none of those things that
people typically complain about with
android games there are
microtransactions but they in no way
affect the game and are optional add-ons
there are no advertisements or buying
energy or anything ridiculous like that
just the pure baldur's gate experience
the story is actually pretty good
considering the time when it was written
and considering the scope of the game it
also has those reputation mechanics that
you can earn or lose depending on your
action and dialogue choices all of this
adds to the complexity but in a way that
the player can control lastly there is
multiplayer support you can connect
using tcp/ip connection or through the
game server and play through the game
with friends if you so choose and here
is the bet the controls are quite
complicated and it may take a beginner
some time to master there are a lot of
screens and need a lot of customizations
and commands if you're a beginner it can
be quite overwhelming until you get used
to it some of the mechanics are tedious
for example you'll have to pause the
game fairly frequently to plan out ways
of attack in order to stay on top of
things if you are hoping for a Diablo or
World of Warcraft style realtime hack
and slash you were mistaken while the
port is responsibly done for the most
part there are occasional glitches and
missing features some people have
reported screen freezing and lockups
lastly there are no Google Play game
services so no cloud saving no
achievements or anything like that and
this is a game that could have used
those things overall whether or not you
will like this game or hate this game
depends on what kind of gamer you are if
you're strictly casual like Angry Birds
or even clash of clans you may not like
this title if you're a PC or console
gamer looking for that level of game on
droid you may very well like this title
if you get to play it without most of
the bugs that are being reported it's a
long and amazing game that pretty much
any RPG enthusiast will enjoy it does
have its problems but fans of the series
and the genre can likely get past them
to enjoy the game
it's $9.99 which is a little steep but
in all fairness this isn't your standard
$1 game if you want to try it out so
we'll have a link posted in the written
companion which is in the video
description below
