Authority and today I'd like to talk to
you about the Nordics EE 52 and the
Nordic thingy 52 is an IOT sensor
platform that's got built-in Bluetooth
Low Energy and because of that it can
talk to devices like your smartphone or
to a Raspberry Pi and it's absolutely
brilliant for experimenting and for
prototyping interested in when you're
playing around with any IOT projects you
have or any IOD IOT ideas so if you like
to find out more about the singing 52
please let me explain
so as you can see the Nordic singing 52
is a six by six rubber square it's a
couple of centimetres thick and it's got
built into it a whole bunch of sensors
including pressure sensor temperature
sensor co2 sensor got a nine way axis
motion detector
it's got LEDs cause it's got Bluetooth
Low Energy at the heart of it is an arm
cortex-m for microcontroller now the
idea is basically this you want to
measure something with centers whether
it be temperature or pressure or the
motion for let's say making a fitness
tracker and that information is relayed
over Bluetooth Low Energy to a
smartphone or to a Raspberry Pi now nor
did give you all the source code for the
thing in 52 itself and for an Android
app and for an iOS app so basically you
have all the building blocks that you
need to take a device like the thingy 52
and talk with onto your smartphone and
develop any kind of IOT project that you
like now getting started with the scene
52 is really easy you basically switch
it on you have to rubber cover off
there's a switch there you switch it on
you then go to download the sample app
from the Play Store you search for the
device using bluetooth and then the two
are then connected together and then the
internal app the sample app they've
given you allows you to monitor the
different sensors so you can want till
the temperature and the pressure there's
even a button on that you can press you
can see if the buttons press or not you
can see all of the different things with
the motion the 9 axis motion is what
compass is got heading settings you can
also play around with the led to turn
out different colors and it's all there
for you in the source code so if you
have any kind of
Android app development experience you
could very easily take the app and
develop it into your own app to do your
own kind of thing with it now one other
interesting aspect of this Nordic region
is it had them built in microphone and
speaker and Nordic give an example of
how you can actually do audio over
bluetooth low energy between the
smartphone app and the c52 so in one
case you can record something on your
phone and it will get played through the
speaker on here or you can speak into
the Nordic 52 and it will get received
on your smart phone and so the
possibility for that also with home
automation are great you can actually
connect this up in such a way that you
speak into this this could be somewhere
on your person on a wall you speak into
it and it talks to maybe one of the the
digital voice assistants like you know
Google a system because it's API is
available for Android and for of course
for the Raspberry Pi so that it shows
you the possibilities of Low Energy a
Bluetooth low-energy audio but it also
shows you what you could do with it now
as a caveat it's worth mentioning that
the quality of the Bluetooth Low Energy
is quite low because none of its
compresses all PCM staff 8 8 kilohertz
which is very very low but good enough
as a demonstration and the reason for
that is is they don't want to put any
coding and decoding like of a codec like
mp3 or AAC C or whatever into the the
little microprocessor on here of course
it can be modified to do it however you
see best
now a real power of this kind of IOT
setup is when we involve the internet or
singly involved the cloud itself so you
could for example connect up the app and
there's already like the hooks already
there to connect up the app to IFTTT i
if this then that so basically you
couldn't basically set up a situation
where if you press the button the Nordic
thingy will talk to your smartphone over
Bluetooth Low Energy your smartphone
will then contact IFTTT till it
something's happened and then you can
build an applet to to action that so a
simple example you press the button you
go to the smart phone smart phone talks
in the cloud IFTTT then sends a
notification to your phone very simple
but you could do it better you could
check do things so that when the
temperature gets to a certain level then
you tell your nest thermostat to do
something or when it gets a certain time
of day you can do something with your
Fitzhugh light bulbs or any fact
anything that can be connected to the if
this then that service can be controlled
according to what the sensors are
picking up on your thingy 52 now if you
want to for example get cakes up to the
Efus then that service have got full
instructions over at the article that
goes with this video includes tell you
what the event names are when different
things happen on the thingy 52 so go
read that article and you'll get
yourself kicked it up really simply now
one more thing I'd like to mention that
the Nordic 52 is it has the
infrastructure for over-the-air firmware
update already built into the system so
that means that if you want to update
the software on your thingy 50 to the
Android app can do that for you
automatically in fact things on my
Fitbit I'm always getting updates for
this imagine if you've got other IOT
equipment and also the security concerns
we have today with IOT it's important
you're able to update the firmware on
your IOT products and that already built
in here so you just have to make a new
firmware available and the app knows how
to upload it - the thing is - over
Bluetooth so all that hard work force
updates and for for deployment cycles
and for all this stuff concern about
security Valatie it's already built in
there for you so again nerds and all the
head
listing so to summarize basically this
is a great toy to play with if you're
kind of a tech enthusiast if you like
the idea of playing with if this then
that and having sensor data and maybe
like to record it maybe you like to
analyze it so this is just it's good fun
and it's a good way to kind of
understand Bluetooth Low Energy and
understand IOT that's great but if
you're a developer if you have any kind
of Android development experience then
this is an absolutely bring it because
you don't have to modify the code on
here because all of the services all
those sensor data is available just
through the Android app and you need to
modify the Android app to do whatever we
want to do if you want to make the next
Fitbit rival using the motion sensors
that are inside this then go ahead and
do it you get one of these start
modifying the app and just go for it now
the other thing is if you actually are a
professional developer then the great
thing is all the source code is
available the Bill of Materials
available the schematics are available
so you can actually build consumer level
products with everything in order to
give you know why they're doing this
because Nordik want to sell their
Bluetooth low-energy chips and the
microcontroller chip that's in there
they want to sell that so that you can
then sell millions of them in your
greatest IOT product that comes out next
well i'm gary sims rounder authority and
i hope you've enjoyed this look at the
nordic thingy 52 if you did please do
give it a thumbs up also let's forget to
subscribe to and rathore --'tis youtube
channel you can follow me on twitter and
last but not least please go over to
