authority I'm live here at MWC 2017 I'm
here the nubia booth I'm checking out
the Nokia n1 light it was announced here
at the show and this is basically a
lighter version of the Nubia n1 so first
thing is inspect this entry-level model
so you have a 5.5 inch LCD display 720p
kind of dick ative of its price point
they did announce the price but you
expect to be very in a very inexpensive
it also features a 3000 milliamp hour
battery it has some sort of mediatek
processor inside I believe some MP 67 37
chips you have a rear camera 8 megapixel
rear cameras 2.0 aperture duo the flash
you have a front facing five megapixel
camera and you have to talk about the
RAM stick speaking about the internal
storage and its end is running Android
marshmallows unlocked phone of course
for design goes it's pretty
straightforward
I can't say it's anything great the
metaplastic most mostly yet the speakers
bottom here you have a fingerprint
sensor which is nice 100 level
smartphone can't expect that nowadays
with most devices and if you have some
these angular products on the side and
you have this metal trim accenting via
corners here but overall nothing really
the standout design you could definitely
tell that it is going to be an
inexpensive entry-level price smart
phone of course the basic stuff it
should be able to have but I really
doubt it's going to do anything for
games and if you're looking for
something that's not going to cost your
whole bang for the box and you really
don't care about the best performance or
the fastest smartphone this might be
something that might appeal to you is
going to be coming out in Asian European
markets I doubt it's going to come to
the US so if you guys want learn more
about the Nubia n1 light if you check
our website andrew authority comm this
is John V signing
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
