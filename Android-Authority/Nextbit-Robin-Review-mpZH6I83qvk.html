kickstarter-funded device that quite
literally has its head up in the clouds
this is Joshua car from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the next bit Robin we have
changed up the review format a bit you
are watching the video review right now
made by yours truly of course but then
you can head on over to Andrew authority
comm to see a full written review by an
arab Gandia that puts together both of
our perspective so you can get even more
comprehensive look at this the next bit
Robin so before we even get into the
video review why don't we get all of the
specs out of the way
you
design is a wonderful beginning calling
card for the next bit Robin as you can
see this is the mint color right here
that has the white all around and
accenting baby blue colors now if this
color is not necessarily a cup of tea
there is a midnight version that
replaces all of the white with black and
I've already asked a few people and they
would prefer that version over this one
but I do think that this makes the phone
quite different from pretty much
anything else but the other thing that
we really enjoy about this phone is its
shape it's very unapologetic about its
form there are really no curves
whatsoever on this flat device all
around even the flat sides top and
bottom and to the front and back
everything about this is just a
rectangular slab and we think that is
actually playing in its favor
the volume buttons over on the left side
have a very sturdy click to them and the
power button which has a fingerprint
reader embedded into it actually makes
the power button a little bit more
concave into the body now it takes a
little bit of getting used to to
actually press down hard enough and to
leave the finger there in order to
trigger the fingerprint reader but once
you get used to it
it is pretty sublime but what this phone
does have in spades is symmetry now you
already see that the colors are on the
top and bottom here and also on the
backing but we also have the
front-facing dual stereo speakers which
are completely centered on the top and
bottom of the device the circle motif is
very prevalent as well as the
front-facing camera the light sensor are
circles as well as the rear facing
camera and it's flash and then speaking
of symmetry you have the USB type-c port
which is over on the side on the bottom
and I might get a little bit of getting
used to but it is directly below the
headphone jack symmetry is definitely
the name of the game when it comes to
the design language of the next bit
Robin and of course on the back there
you see that iconic cloud for next bit
and the LED indicators underneath that
show you when it is accessing your cloud
storage handling is also very great
mostly because of this flat design it is
easy to grip the flat sides and going
from side to side is not much of an
issue though if you're trying to get to
the top to bring down the notification
drop-down it might require some hand
gymnastics when it comes to the display
it's kind of what you would expect for a
phone of this price 1080p is a pretty
standard resolution and it's exactly
what we expected the phones have it is
an IPS screen that does do a good job in
broad daylight though we do have two
crank up the brightness all the way in
order to make everything legible but
even then colors are still quite nice on
this display and provide just what we
need to enjoy media games and text all
over the Internet performance is
actually a pretty big story for the next
bit Robin because on paper its spec
sheet is similar to another phone that
we are familiar with the Nexus 5x we
have the Snapdragon 808 and the adrenal
418 with this time 3 gigabytes of RAM
now we're not comparing this phone to
the Nexus 5x obviously in this video but
we wanted to use that as a bit of a
benchmark because the Robin has shown us
that that extra gigabyte of RAM actually
makes all the difference
performance is very smooth all around
and even though the 808 might be that
half-step behind the Snapdragon 810 and
it is noticeable for us we think that
the general user won't really notice it
at all on the daily the only app that
has actually crashed on us from time to
time is the camera but it wasn't really
because we were overloading the device
multitasking is also pretty good as you
go through the recent apps screen and
you're opening pretty much anything
that's in the background one quick note
on gaming we do have longer loading
times in certain games especially in
this case we have Final Fantasy 9 but
once the gameplay is actually loaded up
and you're into it really it doesn't
provide any slowdown that we've seen and
then one final notes the next bit Robin
actually does get quite warm NORAD was
actually able to get the phone to be way
too hot for his comfort and I haven't
had that kind of severe experience but
we did find that when plugged in and
multitasking or even when gaming which
was my case the phone does tend to get
quite warm and it mostly is centered up
here on the upper half where the cloud
would be located Hardware actually has a
lot to offer on here as this phone is
capable of taking a sim from any popular
GSM network and we've had a good time on
here with AT&amp;amp;T Mobile at least for me
and calls came in loud and clear with no
drops on either end
NFC also is installed on this device so
you're not going to be missing that
feature on the next bit Robin but we'll
go ahead and move on to the sound you
have the front-facing speakers which are
on the top and bottom of the device up
on front and they are actually really
loud that clip you saw earlier of me
playing Final Fantasy 9 was actually
shot outside so let me turn up the
volume on that real quick and you will
get an idea just how loud this was even
outside
the fingerprint reader we already
mentioned is quite good and it does a
good job of unlocking the device without
any extra input you just leave your
finger on the power button after you
press it now the placement does make it
so that it's more for right-handed
individuals but it wasn't that hard for
me to register my index finger or even
my middle finger on my left hand to
easily unlock the device using my left
hand I'm going to change it up a little
bit and talk about the battery before we
get into the cloud storage
now with the battery we have a 2680
milliamp hour unit that actually
provides I guess just decent longevity
in my case I used this phone quite
heavily throughout the last week and I
was able to get three hours of screen on
time throughout the day but even then I
was having to plug in the phone before
the end of the day on a couple of
occasions now the USB type-c cord does
provide somewhat faster charging than
normal micro USB constituents but there
is no fast charging involved here now
before we even get into the cloud
storage we have 32 gigabytes that is
already onboard in the next bit Robin
and actually think that that is enough
for many general users the average user
is not going to fill up all of that
space very quickly and even then it will
take a lot of pictures and a lot of
applications to fill all of that up but
if those two things do end up filling up
the space you have a hundred gigabytes
of included cloud storage with the next
bit Robin and any app stats are not
really being used anymore and very old
pictures will be uploaded automatically
in the background when the phone is
plugged in and on Wi-Fi but of course
you can change those in the settings now
all of that sounds well and good and I
think that it does do its job quite well
we just hope that in the future we can
get even more access to that 100
gigabytes of storage after all that's a
pretty sweet deal to have but you get no
access to pretty much any of that
getting into the application or the
option for smart storage only shows you
how much has been taken up and not what
apps or what pictures are up there you
are able to access whatever has been
archived by hitting the greyed out icon
in the home screen and yes this also
works in third-party launchers and you
are able to call back those applications
about having full access maybe through
some sort of next bit application that
you can install from the Play Store
would provide an even better steal for
this phone because that 100 gigabytes is
really enticing the main camera of the
next bit Robin is a 13 megapixel Samsung
ISO cell camera
at F 2.2 aperture with a five megapixel
front facing shooter that accompanies it
now if that camera specs sounds familiar
is because we already had it in the
samsung galaxy note 4 and if you
remember we actually thought that that
was a very decent and actually really
good camera for its time now given that
this is a test unit more modes are going
to be put into here as we were missing
in particular a panorama mode but you do
get auto manual and video modes now the
manual mode is actually quite nice
because I think that this is one of the
most intuitive ways that it has been put
together now first of all it's not a
full manual mode because you don't get
access to the shutter speed and the
white balance is of that incandescent
cloudy type but when you access let's
say the ISO or the manual focus on the
left side a slider appears right next to
the shutter button on the other side of
the phone easy for you to access and
move with your shutter finger video does
include recording in 4k and it for the
most part does do a good job of
providing some nice videos but there is
no optical image stabilization found on
this camera so shaky hands will show and
we finally get into the picture quality
and it's actually very similar to the
good performance we had in the note for
a while back we do have very detailed
photos but some noise reduction is going
on here so when you actually zoom into
the photo you see that the lines aren't
quite as crisp and sharp as they should
be but when zoomed out everything looks
really nice and I got some wonderful
photos out in Arizona with this phone
HDR is actually a pretty good performer
on here but it does more to bring up the
shadows rather than to bring down the
highlights so if you have blown out
areas of your photo they're not going to
be that evened out when compared to just
how bright the entire image becomes when
using HDR the camera has really proven
itself and it's more than a decent
performer and we do enjoy what we see
when we use this phone on the daily
taking pictures low-light performance
could use a boost it's kind of decent
but the F 2.2 aperture isn't doing it
any favors
and actually the only other issue that
we've had with the camera is that it's
kind of slow actually pressing the
shutter button when not using HDR in and
of itself provides one to two seconds of
delay and then when opening HDR it
actually doubles that amount of time
finally when we talk about software we
have the next bit Robin experience and
this is on the backbone of Android 6.0
marshmallow now it actually is a very
stock like
experience except for the main area and
that is the home screens that's because
there's no app drawer now I know some of
you are already getting your pitchforks
out but the ability to actually see a
bird's-eye view of all of your
applications gives you easy access to
any ones that have been archives and
even then you can swipe down from any of
the applications in order to pin them so
they aren't going to be uploaded to the
cloud and then if you actually need
access to your widgets you can pinch on
the display in order to access them in
this nice-looking ethereal
overlay that goes over the home screens
ethereal is definitely the word I would
use to describe the software on this
device because well there's a cloud
motif on everything the live wallpaper
in the background has that effect and
when you have dialog boxes come up
everything gets a little bit blurred out
in the background and everything has a
light color to it there's only really
one place that I didn't really enjoy
this motif and that was a notification
drop-down which in and of itself is
already a pretty light color and then it
tries to give you a transparent look at
everything behind it which I thought was
just redundant so there isn't a whole
lot else to say about the software on
this device except that we still think
we should have gotten more control over
the cloud storage for example we could
have just swiped up on an app and it
would have offloaded to the 100
gigabytes of cloud storage included that
would have been one nice little addition
and probably would have been a nice way
of knowing exactly what applications are
going to be put up there and again we do
think that an actual application that
gives access to the storage for any
uploading would have made this a very
very good deal the next bit Robin is
available on their website for three
hundred and forty nine dollars which is
a pretty standard price point for what
we would call an affordable flagship but
it also comes with that 100 gigabytes of
cloud storage and a lot of ways this
feels like the kind of phone that
everyone wants unique in its design and
provides everything that an affordable
flagship should provide this definitely
feels like the kind of phone that the
Nexus 5x should have been and it
definitely feels like the phone the
oneplus 2 should have been because it
provides everything and even puts in 100
gigabytes of cloud storage but the only
real grab we have with this phone is
that you don't have a whole lot of
access to that cloud storage there's a
lot that you have to do in order to
finally get it to trigger and even then
you don't know what's going up there
until it actually happen
having access to that cloud storage for
actual uploads much like a Google Drive
for example would have really sweeten
the pot for what is already a pretty
great phone in general this is a phone
that does great on the daily and as a
phone that's supposed to be cloud first
we were really happy to see that it is
still really good at being fallen
forward so as always thank you guys very
much for watching and hope you enjoyed
