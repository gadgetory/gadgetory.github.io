a pound so being safe but nonetheless
it's judge McGarr mentor authority
what's going on everybody and every
photo and video like the one you're
looking at right now on the road to San
Diego was taken on the cameras of the
HTC Desire eye
and of course since we have 13
megapixels on the front-facing camera
you'll see a lot of self-portraits in
this video these two were taken when I
was outdoors doing the unboxing but
let's get indoors and see what that
performance is like the grain and the
fuzz and the noise just really tend to
flood in here and as is the case with a
lot of smartphone cameras the low-light
performance is just aggressively decent
not really all that great when you
compare to outdoor shots which will have
a lot more of later on these 100 crops
will show you how the detail kind of
tapers off there and the noise and the
grain just really smudges everything out
it's kind of unfortunate because the
low-light performance is probably where
the HTC Desire I needed to really sort
of excel because it was going to focus
on being a self-portrait camera
experience but nonetheless it is still a
fun experience which I'll get into later
with all of the different modes like the
split capture as you see right here and
a couple of the post-production modes
like being able to merge faces together
and have a lot of fun with your photos
after you take them I did find that the
auto exposure on either camera did
sometimes have some trouble especially
in lower light situations of really
getting the white balance perfectly
right and you'll see it in this next
photo where everything was just yellowed
out when I use the auto white balance
and I had to manually set it to
incandescent white balance and then
everything started to look okay after
that so one thing that's really nice
about having a 13 megapixel camera up
front is that it is also kind of wide
which makes vlogging with this
particular phone quite nice the picture
quality I'm still sort of on the fence
about but as far as video goes I do
enjoy using the front facing camera
especially for these small little
moments where I get to talk to you a
little bit
vlog style but now we can finally get
into the outdoor shots and this is where
either of the camera actually starts to
hit more than it does miss that the
reason why is because with all of the
lighting as is usually the case with
smartphone cameras a lot of the detail
can be captured and there's a little bit
more data for those sensors to be able
to capture front-facing camera right
here with a little bit of a lens flare
but you can see that the detail actually
looks quite nice and the colors look
pretty accurate there's a little bit of
a level of saturation here but it
doesn't keep it from going too far off
one end and then at the same time these
photos aren't really too bland either so
really it's an average performer that
tends to do
better jobs out in the daylight as far
as modes go here is the photobooth mode
where you can get four different photos
and stitch them together in a number of
different ways but the auto exposure can
also be kind of aggressive as you can
see there with my one photo on the
bottom right being lighter than the rest
a quick mention about the dedicated
camera button on the bottom right hand
of the units it's a nice addition to
have for pretty much any smartphone
camera but on the HTC Desire eye it has
one big problem holding it halfway down
allows you to lock the focus and the
exposure which is nice because you can
change the composition of your photo on
the fly but pressing it all the way down
is kind of tough it's a very squishy
button and what that ends up doing to
your photo is blurring it out because
your hand and thus the phone will move
while you're trying to trigger that
shutter just a kind of a big annoyance
that I had with the phone stabilization
looks like it's okay I'm really tensing
up in order to keep this thing smooth
but nonetheless you're seeing that the
quality on the rear or the front facing
cameras tend to be quite good out in the
daylight the front-facing camera does
tend to overexpose the photo just a
little bit when compared to the rear but
as you can see here there's a really
nice coloration to these pretty good
detail and things tend to look quite
good as long as you have a very nicely
lit situation a lot of the photos that I
take on here are pretty much perfect for
social media especially when you use a
split capture which I personally love
using and ultimately for social media or
anybody that really wants to just put
themselves out there on places like
Instagram these cameras do a pretty good
job of doing that and then finally we
have some HDR photos here you can see
how a blown out the background is and
then I turned on HDR and things started
to look a lot better HDR does a pretty
good job on the HTC Desire eye when you
use it in the right situations and these
are pretty much those situations where
the background is really blown out and
then it needs to lighten up the
foreground and then when the Sun starts
to go down you can get some lighter
photos using HDR as you can see right
here in old town San Diego and as the
Sun continues to go down you can get
even better shots then a lot lighter but
the detail does tend to get a little bit
grainy after that ultimately the HDR
mode is useful in particular situations
not for every photo so it's not
something I would suggest having on all
the time and on the rear facing camera
it can help if you are in the right
particular moments but on the front
facing camera HDR simply doesn't really
do a whole lot
maybe lightens up the photo a little bit
but nothing too drastic
so as always keep it tuned to android
authority for all of the best coverage
and wait for my full review on this
phone where i will get a little bit more
into the general experience concerning
the modes but for now I wanted to show
you the quality of the front and rear
facing cameras on here ultimately it's a
hit or miss situation more missing than
hitting especially when you factor in
the indoor and low light situations but
as far as social media goes this is a
great combination to have and with the
split capture one of my favorite modes
you can have quite a bit of fun with
this camera nonetheless keep it tuned
