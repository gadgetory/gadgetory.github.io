brought to you by the love of a good dog
yeah sometimes the best thing to get
through a hard day is the love of a good
pooch or new cool never seen before
technology I could work too in this past
week Google is showing off a lot of that
new exciting technology starting with
project soli project soli which was just
announced at Google i/o aims to create a
new way of controlling the technology
around us especially smaller screens
instead of physically touching our
devices Sully wants us to use our hand
motion vocabulary the technology solely
is working on would be able to direct
incredible small motions allowing you to
use natural hand motions to perform
specific tasks so if you think of your
hand as an interface performing a small
hand motion over a small sensor would be
able to complete a task on a SmartWatch
alarm clock or anything else even if the
piece of technology isn't around you at
that moment a tap is using a radar
sensor to complete this task wait what
is a tap this is Google's advanced
technology and projects group a tap
formerly a division of Motorola so a tap
is the group of geniuses that's been
working on project soli this group has
supposedly shrunk down a radar device
from the size of a gaming console to the
size of a quarter a tap will release an
API which will give developers access to
translated signal info which will let
them do basically whatever they want
with the technology these api's will be
available sometime later this year
targeted at smaller form factor devices
such as smart watches now this
technology could be scaled successfully
we could not only cruise the internet
but Tom Cruise the Internet now as many
of you know I have been skeptical of
project ara but at Google i/o they
actually built a working project or a
device right on stage now project ara
has been shut off before but the big
difference here is that this is the
first time it has been shown off fully
working Google engineer Rafa Camargo not
only built the phone on stage by adding
modules into the frame but he also
turned the thing on
let it boot and took pictures of
everyone in the audience for those not
familiar with project ara it's a
smartphone built for you by you
it's like Motorola's Moto X times 100
you don't only get to customize the
finish but also the processor camera ram
battery and many other components it's
truly a phone that's made for you
because it allows you to purchase the
components that matter to you most
someone who plays a lot of games on
their smartphone will most likely want a
better processor and better ram where as
a photographer will opt in for a higher
quality camera now the best part of
project ara is that there won't be a
need to buy a completely new phone when
you feel that a component is getting
slow or if one component breaks then you
can simply purchase that one new
component but just keep your pants on
because I'm skeptical and you should be
too why well there are very few
incentives for manufacturers to build
modular phones at scale this means
they're gonna sell fewer phones think
about it if I have a modular phone and
the RAM is slow and I just want to add
some RAM well that's gonna add to the
life of that phone significantly I'm
gonna buy fewer phones making
manufacturers fewer money because the
phone is a much bigger purchase than
just is a one or two different modules
manufacturers are gonna make less money
unless something with the business model
changes I don't see a meaningful
compelling reason for manufacturers to
buy into this what do you think now
let's talk Google now on steroids or
Google now on tap the basic idea behind
Google now on tap is to get access to
the information when you need it without
having to leave what you're doing to get
it contextual awareness is the name of
the game here giving you the ability to
take advantage of any assistance from
Google regardless of which app you've
opened up in your phone or what you're
doing for example say you've received an
email for a friend who is asking you
about going to a movie like pitch
perfect - while within the email
application you're using inbox by Gmail
in this case a simple long press of the
home button will bring up Google now
card and all the relevant information
about that movie such as its rating cast
info etc also available are a list of
apps to get more information from in
this case being IMDB or Flixter as well
as YouTube to directly watch a trailer
for that movie of course this works with
voice search as well with users being
able to use the okay google voice
command from any screen and any app on
your device Google now will then bring
contextual awareness here as well for
example if you're listening to a band on
Spotify you can just say okay Google who
is the lead singer and it will recognize
the context of your search without
needing you to mention the name of the
band and give you the answer you were
looking for thanks for watching Android
army my name is Jay slow to connect with
you right here on Google+ or Twitter you
know my brethren and Android over here
they've been working their tail off over
at Google i/o to give you all the
coverage possible really really quick so
check their stuff out they're trying to
be your source for all things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
