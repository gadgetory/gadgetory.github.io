will soon give you a hands on of the
xiaomi redmi pro but let's talk about
what you need to know right now xiaomi
continues to strive to be your best bang
for buck option the redmi pro features a
full metal unibody construction with
brushed metal finish an up front is a
2.5 d glass that covers the 5.5 inch
full HD OLED display the change to OLED
from the usual standard IPS LCD is a
nice touch and should provide a more
vivid viewing experience you see while
some Xiaomi smartphones like the redmi
note 3 have featured fingerprint
scanners on the back it's now moved to
the front on this device embedded into
the physical home button below the
display this is to make way for the dual
camera setup that the device now boasts
which is almost certainly a first for an
affordable flagship smartphone like this
and speaking of cameras the setup
includes a 13 megapixel primary camera
which is coupled with a 5 megapixel
shooter that captures depth information
the primary camera also comes with a
dedicated depth of field image sensor
and supports dynamic depth of field
which Xiaomi says will allow for adsl
like bokeh effect
we'll see I'd like to see proof of that
now there are three variants of the
red-meat pro that will be available
while the 32 and 64 gigabyte iterations
will feature 3 gigabytes of RAM the
high-end model with a 128 gigabyte
storage will come with 4 gigabytes of
RAM there are also differences in the
processing package with the 64 128
gigabyte iterations being powered by the
mediatek helio X 25 64 bit Decca core
processor man that's a mouthful while
the base 32 gigabyte version comes with
a mediatek helio X 20 Decca core
processor other hardware specs you want
to know about include USB type-c port a
dual SIM support expandable storage
which uses the second SIM slot and a
large 4050 milliamp hour battery that
should allow for a lot of battery life
the device will also come with fast
charging capabilities on the software
side the red-meat pro will be running
the latest
MIUI 8os based on android 6.0.1
marshmallow right out of the box
let's talk pricing and man is this sweet
the base model of the red meat Pro will
cost roughly $225 u.s. or $14.99 RMB
while the 64 120 gigabyte iterations
with the Helio x.25 processor will be
priced at 255 or 300 dollars USD
respectively what do you guys think guys
it looks pretty sweet I look forward to
the hands-on review you guys remember
from like 15 years ago when people were
making money hand over fist in the
dot-com bubble remember we didn't call
it a dotnet bubble or dot-org bubble we
didn't call them dot biz billionaires we
called them dot-com billionaires because
that's the power of a.com now why is
that because no domain name extension
tells your story with the same degree of
trust as a dot-com or dotnet domain
name.com and dotnet domain name
extensions and jet credibility into your
online presence save 15% on domain names
