still have one last look at the Samsung
Galaxy s6 to bring you these Samsung
flagships go head-to-head in this the
Samsung Galaxy s6 versus the Galaxy Note
4 perhaps for the first time ever in a
samsung vs. samsung vs. we're looking at
metal frames and both devices these are
design choices that you may have already
seen in the galaxy alpha but now they
are becoming the standard for Samsung
smartphones we'll start with the note 4
which still is a samsung phone through
and through with its faux leather
plastic back that is also removable so
you can get to the replaceable battery
and the microSD card slot the signature
samsung layout is up front with the
tactile home button integrated finger
scanner underneath and the recent apps
and back buttons flanking it with 2.5 D
glass adding a little bit of visual
flair to the front of the device and if
you go to the bottom of course as this
is a note device we of course have the S
Pen nestled in the corner the galaxy s6
may retain these signature Samsung
design elements which Samsung has
certainly moved on in terms of its build
material now favoring that metal frame
and glass back combination for premium
look and feel in the hand well you will
notice about the metal frame on the
Galaxy s6 is that it still retains that
somewhat tapered raised look on the top
and bottom corners that were originally
introduced in the galaxy note 4 which is
really nice the curved sides on the
edges allow for more rounded look
overall despite this compared to the
more rigid lines of the note 4 but the
s6 is still as thin and sleek as ever
found in their line this design choice
is not without compromises though in the
s6 the battery is not replaceable and
there's no option for microSD card
expansion because the backing is of
glass rather than a plastic and it is
not removable and this is something that
I think many fans are going to miss
about too the s6 the camera module also
tends to stick out quite a bit as well
which could be a problem when lying the
phone flat on a surface or sliding it
around like some tend to do the playing
field is evened out on the display front
with the note 4 and the galaxy s6
featuring Super AMOLED displays as per
usual with Samsung devices but now with
quad HD resolution across the board with
the only real difference being in size
5.7 inches for the note 4 and 5.1 inches
for the galaxy s6
but the pixel densities also change from
515 - 577 so that's a bit of a sizable
difference but when you look at these
two devices side by side the difference
isn't actually all that noticeable
Samsung is also well known for its
display prowess and that certainly
shines through with these flagships you
get deep blacks bright and vibrant
colors great brightness and good viewing
angles all found here and both of the
displays really do pop but nonetheless
both of these devices should provide
very good media experiences no matter
which one that you choose and with the
5.1 inches being the size that we pretty
much prefer when it comes to handling
maybe that is a compromise many of us
are willing to make in performance we
see Samsung setting a bit of a precedent
going from the note 4 to the galaxy s6
as the note 4 packs a quad-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 805 clocked at 2.7 gigahertz
backed by the audrina 420 and 3
gigabytes of RAM the other version of
the note 4 boasts an equally powerful
octa-core exynos processor in the
performance on either is pretty much
what you would expect pretty great but
with the galaxy s6 Samsung seems to have
given call come a passed this time
around as globally the s6 will be packin
enix enos 7420 along with three
gigabytes of RAM now the s6 just oozes
power and I cannot emphasize this enough
that in the little time that I did have
with the galaxy s6 I thought that its
version of TouchWiz that's probably the
best and most fluid one that was
available yet the transitions look very
nice and it was actually kind of scaled
back in terms of just a feature set that
is really in your face from the get-go
and I did enjoy my experience with it
already and we'll see what it's like in
our review units things remain largely
identical in terms of additional
hardware though with both featuring
fingerprint scanners and heartrate
monitors but to the s6 it doesn't come
with expandable storage and of course
the big plus point for the note 4 is the
ability to use the S Pen Stylus but if
you are using the note 4 as many have
without to the S Pen that is perfectly
fine as well as it performs just as well
without the stylus experience on the
battery front the note 4 packs the
larger 32 20 milliamp hour battery
compared to the 2600 milliamp hour unit
of the s6 of course the battery is also
replaceable with the notes and so we'll
definitely have to see how the s6
performs in the real world to see if
it's non removable nature makes any sort
of impact the exceed o 7420 is said to
be a lot more frugal with its power
consumption so the step-down in terms of
battery size
maybe will not matter we're going to
take a look at the cameras now and
though we don't have any samples to show
you the differences in quality between
these two phones we imagine they're
going to be well pretty similar because
both devices feature identical 16
megapixel rear cameras and as such the
experience should be largely the same
across the board but in the galaxy s6 we
have some improvements to the optics on
both ends we have a 5 megapixel camera
on the front and both of these cameras
on the front and back that is have 1.9
aperture Zef 1.9 apertures along with
auto live HDR found on both so you
should be able to get some pretty good
photos already in low lights given the
conditions are at least somewhat ideal
and the auto HDR will allow you to get
an even more vivid shot because you will
be able to see what kind of shot you're
going to get with the HDR on with more
testing required we can certainly expect
that the very least that we will get
more of the same from the galaxy x s6 if
not even better and that's something
we're really excited to test out once we
get our review unit and finally in
software we do find it pretty easy to
dismiss the next Samsung iterations as
has been the case over the last couple
of years because TouchWiz is TouchWiz is
TouchWiz that's always been the case but
it seems that that story has changed
this time around but TouchWiz is always
usually packed to the hilt with features
with even more so being found in the
note 4 because of the s-pen and all
those additional features do tend to be
a little bit overwhelming for plenty of
users that being said a lot of the note
4 features despite not necessarily being
used do have a function in one way or
another and a number of the features
like multi window and certain clipping
features of the s-pen do tend to help
out from time to time so for some users
out there to eat especially those who
use the s-pen they may have a great
productive experience with the note 4
things are certainly different with the
s6 though even if not aesthetically so
much the number of features and
applications pre-installed have been
kind of reduced with users now given the
option to pick and choose what they want
and what to uninstall and the s6 as well
like I said before a lot of the features
that you're usually used to having in
the s6 don't seem to be all up in your
face anymore and because of that you
have a much more fluid experience going
in and out of the home screens and
through the app drawers and even with
the notification drop-down which usually
shows all of the different features that
are available but this time around
didn't really seem to be all that over
for veterans of the Samsung ecosystem
you might find the Essex to be a breath
of fresh air especially if you think
that TouchWiz has gotten a little bit
too big for his britches over the last
year or so that being said though the
note 4 brings a lot of great features to
the to the table and you can always turn
off the ones that you are not going to
use but that being said the s6 kind of
might be the experience we've been
waiting for from Samsung and we can't
wait to get our hands on it to take a
look at this version of TouchWiz for our
full review and so there you have it for
this quick look at the Samsung Galaxy s6
versus the samsung galaxy note 4 these
are the two giants currently in the
Samsung ecosystem and they are certainly
worthy of the term flagship what matters
here though is what features you really
need in order to get the most out of
your daily smartphone usage it seems to
us that the Galaxy s6 is trying to
retake the flagship name but Samsung had
to compromise in creating a very sleek
and very thin and very beautiful device
in removing some of the features that
really made Samsung one of the top
device manufacturers of the Android
world but if you really need things like
the replaceable battery and the microSD
card slot you can always find that in
the note line and from our assessment we
think that the note line is going to
have all of these features going forward
so if you need the full feature packed
device that maybe the note line is what
you're going to stick with but the s6
looks like it's going to change the game
a little bit and we're excited to see
where that goes so keep it tuned to
Android authority for our future review
of the Samsung Galaxy s6 and for a more
in depth vs. between these two devices
that I will do once I get that review
unit but until then you can keep it
