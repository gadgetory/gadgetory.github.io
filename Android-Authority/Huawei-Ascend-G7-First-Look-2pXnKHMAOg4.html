authority once again from the huawei
ascend made seven launch event but they
also have another phone here that could
be considered huawei's let's say mitt to
your phone but it does pack quite a bit
of power underneath to be able to
contend with some of the best out there
we do have the ascend g7 right here and
it has a lot of the same design aspects
from the mate7
including this metal design that has a
very rigid feel to it but provides a
very nice slender device all around with
a nice feel on the sides that is easily
Gribble
but this 5.5 inch screen is a 720p
resolution screen and you can see right
here that it does exude the emotion you
like quite well the emotion UI has
continued to get even better and
continues to with themes that are
available from users that have really
tried to customize experience to what
they believe the users really want
looking at some of the elements here we
do have the quick settings here in the
notification drop-down and the recent
apps screen as available with all the
lovely transitions that go in and out of
all the different applications now
taking a look at the actual
specifications that are underneath the
hood we have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410
that is a quad core processor with 1.2
gigahertz they will have 32 and 64-bit
capabilities which is nice for a future
proofing for these particular phones
when Android continues to improve and
from there we also have 2 gigabytes of
RAM and 16 gigabytes of on-board storage
taking a look a little bit more at the
design while I go through a couple more
of the hardware aspects we do also have
a 3000 milliamp hour battery that is
underneath and should provide pretty
good specifically around because the
specifications are not quite as
bleeding-edge and will help with the
power consumption we'll go ahead and
jump into the camera which in this case
has a 13 megapixel resolution
watch the phone there and we have the
same kind of viewfinder that we have
from the other phone I'm looking at the
front-facing camera at the moment but
here is the viewfinder for the rear
facing camera again this is a 13
megapixel camera that allows for some of
the features from before you have the
photo mode the video mode and also an
all focus mode that allows you to pretty
much get a bit of a depth of field shot
looking at some of the modes that are
available here we do have all of these
here for everything from beauty mode to
HDR to panorama but nonetheless that is
the huawei ascend g7 you can use like I
said already you can consider this the
mid-range when it comes to Huawei's
market but you know what it does pack
quite a few great features that some
flagship devices out there might be
missing we do have a great 13 megapixel
camera that should be powerful enough
for plenty of people out there already
and we have a wonderful screen here that
does come in at 720p resolution but
provides a very nice exude of the
emotion UI the metal construction is
also a premium feel as well that really
gives it a bit of a boost and at 299
euros currently for this particular
phone it also comes in a pretty
affordable price one that is certainly
accessible for plenty of people out
there so that is the huawei ascend g7
and we are going to go ahead and head
over for even more coverage here at
Aoife in Berlin 2014 make sure you keep
it tuned here at Android authority
because we are your source for all
things Eva 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
