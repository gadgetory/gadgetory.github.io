never even heard of is really looking to
provide the best and the latest
specifications possible including a
Snapdragon 820 it's Josh Vergara from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is the late TV Lai
max pro before we get to the actual
performance of this device which you
should know we aren't really able to
give too many opinions on the Snapdragon
820 as of right now because we've only
been able to use the phone for a little
while we'll talk about that in a little
bit
but we're going to go through all the
specifications the display is of a six
point three three inch size and comes in
at quad HD resolution and underneath the
chipset is four gigabytes of RAM and 32
64 or 128 gigabytes of storage available
as far as connectivity goes you have all
of the usual types but USB type-c is
what you're going to be using to charge
the lai max pro but ultimately we still
enjoy the pretty nice construction here
that utilizes metal and even if the
screen is quite big the bezels on the
sides do make it so that it's actually
not all that hard to use in one hand
though of course most the time you are
going to be using two hands to keep this
thing secure you do have all of the same
buttons everywhere pretty much
everything that you would expect and I
already mentioned the fingerprint reader
on the back that you're going to be
using to unlock the device and it does a
really good job already now we can talk
about the Snapdragon 820 which is the
new iteration the latest and greatest
from Qualcomm now the Snapdragon 820 is
supposed to address some of the issues
at the 810 and the eight away hat while
providing that boost in performance that
we've been waiting for
now the 820 on here of course is going
to be the first of its kind that we're
seeing in the wild but when we're going
through the e UI on here we do notice
that it is really smooth now the
operating system does go through quite
well throughout all of its elements this
one doesn't have an app drawer so it's
not really going to feel very familiar
to any Western users at least and this
is a thing that we already knew about in
the Eastern phones that there's no app
drawer and the operating systems tend to
be a little bit different usually a
little bit more bloaty than usual but LD
TV has been putting their own pedigree
into this operating system by providing
a way to get to there
streaming services very quickly the
button that would otherwise be the app
drawer takes you straight to the
streaming services and you can go ahead
and start enjoying all of the content
that they have on their services but we
did do a benchmark on here and you can
see it running right now and what we
found is that the Snapdragon 820 is
definitely scoring very high in the
benchmark scoring and you can see it
coming up right now of course we're
going to be reserving our thoughts on
the Snapdragon 820 until we actually get
our hands on a review unit and spend a
lot more time with it but as of right
now we are really excited to see the 820
in action and letv
is the manufacturer that is giving us
that first step and even after some
gaming with Need for Speed Most Wanted I
didn't find there to be any big problems
with the performance on this phone thus
far now we are again really excited to
see more from this so keep it tuned to
Android authority for even more from
letv about the lay max pro and you're
going to want to stay tuned for our full
review when we get our hands on a unit
and until then you can watch all the
rest of our coverage here at CES 2016
and hopefully you can keep it tuned here
because we are your source for all
things CES 2016 and Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
