us out for CES 2014 so we wanted to head
over to them and see what they were up
to with their new fuel cell technology
enhancements and we found out that not
only do they work well for automobiles
but also they have a lot of other
applications as well for those of us who
are new to the term fuel cell how can
you explain to me how do fuel cells
actually work very simply it's using one
of the most simple chemical reactions
that's combining hydrogen and oxygen to
create water and we introduce the right
environments for that the right amount
of heat a platinum catalyst and you get
electrochemical reaction that creates
electricity so I are doing a finding
hydrogen oxygen and you get electricity
so it's actually creating the
electricity on board whereas the battery
stores the electricity so instead of
having to plug the vehicle in and
recharge it the way that you do a
battery electric vehicle you refill it
with hydrogen so it takes about five
minutes to refill the vehicle and you
get about 300 miles of all-electric
range what would you say are the biggest
benefits of fuel cell technology
especially in a vehicle such as this
with the biggest benefit for the fuel
cell technology is really the range that
we can get out of it and the power so
you can scale fuel cells up to be large
enough to power buildings or semis even
buses and they also get you the longer
range so there's a certain limit to how
far we can get our battery vehicles and
we think that we can get the fuel cell
vehicles further is there a future with
fuel cells for say let's say handheld
electronics or even just general
electronics that are outside of the
automotive industry definitely yes
toyota is already partnered with company
in japan to have fuel cells that provide
power for homes but when you're looking
to smaller appliances we've seen fuel
cells that are powering phones actually
the chargers that we have behind us here
for all of our cell phones that for our
staff here are feel
powered so we use what's called a low
temperature feel so it's a proton
exchange membrane fuel cell and that
requires hydrogen as a fuel but you can
do other fuel cells for example you can
do phosphorous feel self or a lot of
people use methanol cartridges so you
just use a methanol and that will be
your cartridge for your fuel cell stack
then that could power like a battery
charger or cell phone what makes this
updated fcv so exciting this year but
must have most exciting part about it is
that we're bringing it to market 2015 so
this will be our first commercial launch
of the fuel cell vehicle do you feel
that fuel cell technology is our future
absolutely the future for vehicles is
going electric and I see the feels
thought being playing a huge role in the
future of that all right well that is a
quick rundown on the fuel cell
technology here at Toyota we have a
wonderful vehicle right behind us that
oh I wish I could drive this off the lot
but I think I'm gonna get in trouble if
that were the case but I would all right
what Jackie thank you very much it was
very much very much a pleasure all right
we are here android authority at Toyota
here at CES 2014 we're taking a look at
these cars we really wish we could drive
them but yeah I'm I don't wanna get in
trouble if I do what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
