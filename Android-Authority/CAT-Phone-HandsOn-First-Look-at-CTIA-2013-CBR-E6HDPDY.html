what's going on everybody and I'm here
with Simon Jones and he's going to show
us the cat phone my caterpillar
if you don't know caterpillar and you
see the big logos you can see the top
there on a lot of track so kind of in
here in your construction zones like
they have come out with a smart phone
this is their second one thanks Josh
yes so this is the new cat b15
smartphone that was launched at CTIA
today the idea behind the phone is that
it blends design and durability to meet
the demands of an active lifestyle it's
targeted at a broad range of people from
the obvious objectives in engineering is
construction industry to anyone from
parents to outdoor enthusiasts what
makes this phone unique is the the
actual design itself we see aluminium
sides rubber casing very durable can
stand a drop of six foot can be
submerged in water at three foot of
water for about half an hour is dust and
scratch resistant you can see there's a
gorilla glass screen on the front it
runs on the latest version of Android so
jellybean 4.1 we've got a four point one
inch screen battery life of about nine
hours during use and a standby time of
about nine days we've got a removable
but move more battery you can have
additional storage and so really what
you get is all the capabilities of an
Android device but what you get on top
of that is the qualities that you would
associate with the cat brands so
reliability strength and the durability
to ensure that you're not paying for it
for broken handsets all the time and
what you'll see is the phone is
relatively slim and sleek and
lightweight and
if you actually compare this to a
smartphone with a case that would
provide the similar level of durability
find that that phone is probably going
to be bigger initially it will be
available on our website at cat phones
comm and we're working on partners with
online retailers and also the telecom
carriers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
