Authority and as you could see from the
introduction today we're going to be
looking at the vivo x6 plus now you
probably haven't heard of the VEVO brand
they're a Chinese company that are
looking to make inroads into the Western
markets now the X 6 and the X 6 plus
were announced recently and as you can
imagine the X 6 plus is the bigger of
the two devices in fact it has eight 5.7
inch display that's full HD super amoled
now powering this phone is a qualcomm
snapdragon 6 1 v that's an octa-core
processor along with the Adreno 405 GPU
there next to that you find 4 gigabytes
of RAM and 64 gigabytes of on-board
storage so we have full HD super amoled
octa-core processor 4 gigabytes of RAM
and 64 gigabytes of on-board storage
this has got all the makings of being an
excellent device however let's dig a bit
deeper and see what we find out so
looking around the device we have the
5.7 inch full HD Super AMOLED display on
the front on the bottom are three
capacitive keys that are not backlit and
of course at the top you have the
front-facing camera around the sides you
have the volume rocker and the power
button on the right-hand side
and the SIM tray card on the left hand
side looking at the bottom of the device
we find the single speaker grille some
holes for the microphone and a micro USB
port while at the top we find nothing
other than the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack flipping the phone over you'll see
that you have the camera the fingerprint
reader and the vivo logo so when you
look at the back of this device you'll
see that it does bear a striking
resemblance to another type of
smartphone made by a company with a
fruity logo now I'm sure that's pretty
intentional by vivo because this is
aimed for the Chinese market and the way
the Chinese market works is a bit
different to how it is here in the West
so really we're looking at this okay you
have to admit it's not original in its
designing even these bars here at the
top and the bottom are very very similar
to the iPhone however if we get past
that we can see what else we can see
about this phone now while this phone
does use an octa-core processor is not a
high-end octa-core processor a high-end
octa-core processor today we're probably
using four cortex a 72 cores and four
cortex a53 calls however the Snapdragon
650 eight cortex a53 called which means
going to be slower than many of the
other leading processors so to test the
performance I ran some benchmarks and a
full benchmark results are in the
written companion that goes along with
this video and you'll find that over at
andrew authority calm now just to give
you an example of what kind of
performance we can expect from this
phone
I ran Geekbench 3 now the single core
score for Geekbench 3 was 759 while the
multi-core score was 3000 161 now that
score is actually slower than many of
the octa-core phones I was testing in
2015 and in fact it's slower than some
of these Snapdragon 801 phones I've
tested during 2015 so overall this phone
isn't a high-performing bone because of
that Snapdragon 61 5 processor now if
the performance of the 605 is a bit of a
disappointment it power efficiency isn't
this phone has a 3000 milliamp hour
battery and because of that Qualcomm 6-1
5 processor you get excellent battery
life now unfortunately there are no
battery usage pages on the software on
this version of Android that's running
on this phone so I've done some tests
now for example I ran some 3d games and
according to my calculations you can run
3d games for around four and a half
hours on this phone that's quite
impressive because there are other
phones available but don't even give you
four and a half hours of on-screen time
in general before you even go near 3d
gaming now in fact when you try to do
lighter tasks like browsing the web and
watching youtube videos I found you can
actually get over 15 hours of usage out
of this phone and that's quite amazing
now what that basically means is you
will really get a full day's battery
life without any problems whatsoever and
depending on your users you may even get
two days of battery life so really a
thumbs up for vivo for putting in such a
big battery along with that power
efficient processor now when it comes to
charging the battery vivo who installed
a piece of technology in this phone
called dual engine quick charging now
basically that's a variation of the
different quick charging technologies
that exist today and the idea of course
is that up to eighty percent the phone
charges very quickly now I did some
charging tests and this is what I found
out the phone overall takes two hours to
charge which isn't that quick however to
get to 50% it only takes 23 minutes
which of course is quite impressive if
you want to charge to 80% that only
takes 55 minutes
however to go from 80% to 100% takes
another hour a little bit more than
another hour so you can see this quick
charging technology is very good to 50%
to 80% you're going to get there very
quickly however a full charge is going
to take just over two hours now on the
software side we're dealing with thumb
touch OS and this is vivos custom
version of Android based on android
5.0.2 lollipop now it really is quite
different to stock Android again because
it's aimed at the Chinese market for
starters there's no app drawer but after
that a lot of the icons are more
reminiscent of maybe the iOS interface
rather than the and stock Android
interface also there are some new pages
to do with the fingerprint reader and to
do with smart motions and you can do a
swipe up from the bottom as well so
there's quite a lot different things
going on here and if you're not used to
it it does take a while to learn how to
use this phone now unfortunately there
are no Google services that means you
get no gmail no YouTube and no Play
Store now it is possible to install the
Amazon Appstore which I did and that
with that I was able to download and
install many of the apps I've been using
for my testing now it's also possible to
download Google Play via vivos own app
store now I've done that and I have some
success with it I was able to install
some app but a lot of apps kept giving
me errors saying they were incompatible
with the phones that's something to
watch out for if you're buying this
phone here
the West and the two more things I want
to mention one is the fingerprint reader
the fingerprint reader on the vivo x6
plus is excellent in fact I would say
it's just as good as the fingerprint
reader you find on the wall a mate s and
the Huawei mate 8 it really does open
the phone quickly and you can just put
your finger on the fingerprint reader
and roll the phone in one swift move and
it's lightning fast so that's a really
good feature of this phone now on the
other side I'd like to mention the
network coverage this phone does not
cover the networks that you need in the
USA or that you need in Europe so I was
able to get two G GSM I was able to get
three G however with my carrier I was
unable to get 4G now as always you
should check the compatibility of a
phone with your carrier before you go
ahead with any purchase now the camera
that comes bundled with the vivo x6 plus
is excellent it's got a load of
different range of modes including HDR
and panorama and for some automatic mode
but it also has a professional mode
which is really a manual mode the manual
mode you can change things like the
shutter speed and the ISO settings and
the white balance but you can also do
manual focusing it's quite good fun
playing with the camera I'm focusing in
all things manually yourself that's
really good actually for close-up shots
I found having said that the camera
itself doesn't seem to take great photos
now as a caveat I must say that I've
been taking these under a cloudy sky
drew my time testing this phone I
haven't had a sunny day so all the
outdoor pictures are taken with a very
heavy cloudy sky now knowing that I
could give the camera the benefit of the
doubt however I really do have a feeling
that the pictures lack punch the colours
really aren't that bright now again if
you go over to the &amp;amp; Roth or 'ti website
you'll find the article that goes to
this video and there you'll be able to
see all of the pictures that I've taken
during my testing of this phone
what does all this mean on the plus side
we've got a nice Super AMOLED display
got four gigabytes RAM we've got 64
gigabytes of internal storage and
there's a very good fingerprint reader
now those are good aspects of this
device however on the negative side
we've got fun touch OS which is really
quite different to stock Android and
really is aimed at the Chinese market
there's no Google services 4G coverage
for the West just isn't there and the
camera is maybe underperforming now in
terms of availability this phone will be
available first of all in Asia that's
its primary market and it will be
available for around five hundred and
fifty dollars however that price is not
yet confirmed now there is a rumor that
vivo working on an international version
of both the X 6 and the X 6 plus and
maybe that will solve some of the
problems like stock Android and the
Google Play services and the 4G coverage
so where that version does ever come out
this phone will definitely worth be
looking at for those of you in the West
