brought to you by carbonite head to
carbonite.com right now for your free
15-day trial hello again ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy and welcome back to
Google Play weekly christmas is coming
up soon so a lot of awesome things are
going on right now Google Play has
released their top apps as voted by you
guys there's a brand-new Humble Bundle
to buy and yes san andreas is out and
finally working without further ado
let's get started first on the docket
this week is opera max opera max is a
new browser from the makers of opera
that focuses on using as little data as
humanly possible and it does fairly well
it's in beta right now and you can get
it by joining the beta community the
browser works like any other browser in
terms of functionality but it compresses
all non-encrypted HTTP traffic before it
gets to your device which can
drastically lower the amount of data you
actually use if you're on a limited data
plan keep an eye out for this one grand
theft auto san andreas has finally been
released it's one of the best sandbox
games ever released and now you can get
it on android you can pick it up for 699
in the Google Play Store and you no
longer have to worry about any of those
obnoxious bugs a few hours after release
Rockstar released a patch to fix the
download failed error and all was right
in the universe again so far people who
have played it seemed to really enjoy it
but if you want to see more of it before
you spend the seven dollars check out
the review of the game we have planned
for this weekend on our YouTube channel
the google play store has released their
list for the top apps and games of 2013
as voted by you guys the consumers some
of them were pretty obvious but a few
were rather surprising we kind of
assumed youtube would be the most
popular google app but never in a
million years with this app guy have
predicted the bejeweled blitz would win
best game franchise google also gave
some honorable mentions to the apps
which had the most write-in votes which
included ingress and SwiftKey to see the
full list check out the written
companion in the video description a
pops was a reasonably good idea by
google that let people control
application permissions from within the
operating system without any third-party
apps however as of android 4.4 point to
a pops is now gone some people have said
some scathing things about Google for
removing the feature and many think it
should have been left in however Google
pointed out that leaving a pops in as it
was gave the user too much power and
they could break a great many things if
it were left there so for now it's gone
and we don't know
when or if it's coming back air our last
bit of news this week we're going to
talk a little bit about the latest
humble bundle in the latest whole bundle
there are six android titles you can get
your hands on right now for about 4
bucks included his hero academy gemini
rue little inferno jack lumber and one
more whose name I don't know how to
pronounce the average price right now is
four dollars and sixteen cents which is
what you can pay to get all of them of
course since a lot of this goes to
charity we encourage people to toss in a
little more but if you want a few
android games for really cheap go pick
up Humble Bundle eight so who wants to
see some trending applications as usual
if you want to check any of these apps
out you can find the links in the
written companion in the video
description before we get started with
our trending apps will take a quick look
at Carbonite my associate chase loves
the desktop version but I've been using
the mobile app for quite some time to
back up my photos and videos if my
device ever gets stolen the Carbonite
app comes with built-in anti-theft
functionality to help me get it back of
course the best course of action is to
have backups of everything in carbonite
service for your desktop is a great way
to do it you don't have to worry about
storage restrictions just pay once and
you're good for the year if you want to
see what it's like you can get a 15 day
free trial right now and if you purchase
use the promo code android to get two
months free with your purchase check out
the website in the video description to
get started first up this week is
ingress if you haven't heard ingress is
a real-time augmented reality massive
multiplayer online game and it has
finally left beta and is available to
the public if you like walking around
town and the thought of hacking portal
sounds good to you you can find it right
now in the google play store if you get
into it there's a very healthy community
of players on google+ that you should
totally check out skype was recently
updated to include a few fun new
features in the update is a new
organizational feature that lets you
zoom in and out of individual letters to
help find contacts faster the big new
feature though is the ability to
multitask while video chatting so if you
want to watch videos or something while
you're video chatting you now can yes
even though the game had a rough release
day it still made the trending apps list
thus far it's had a lot of downloads and
we're sure the negative reviews will
clear out once people get the patch
downloaded and actually get into the
game it's a little disappointing that it
happened but it is release day and these
things happen kudos to rock star by the
way for getting it fixed very quickly
zedge released an update to version four
point oh a couple of weeks ago but
actually didn't make it official until
earlier this week we did a review and
here at the end of the
video will link you to that essentially
zedge has taken their extensive
collection of media and put a brand new
interface over top of it if you need
wallpapers or ringtones this is
definitely the app we would recommend
the amazon's kindle app has been slowly
improving over the last year or so among
other things that you I has been
improved as has the performance with the
recent update there are now some
organizational features that allow you
to sort your books for easier access if
you haven't given the kindle app a
chance in a while now is a good time to
check it out again once again I'm Joe
Hindy the android authority app guy feel

below also if you're going to stick
around for a minute we have some awesome
videos right over there for you to watch

written companion in the video
