mechanism and yet a stunning full screen

worth it's $500 ish asking price this is
Bailey Stein with Android authority
you're watching our video review of the
meizu 16 s on the outside the 16 s isn't
much different from its predecessor the
16th overall the design is quite
minimalistic
our carbon black model is stealthy but
you can certainly spice things up with
the other color options the phone has a
slim profile at seven point six
millimeters and 165 grams the 16 s
features an in display fingerprint
reader which works quite well
it is optical though meaning it shines
light up as you scan your finger which
can be kind of annoying at night if
you'd rather the 16 s also supports face
unlock and it's really really quick
easily rivaling the fingerprint reader
speed as for what's missing here well
first off the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack to be fair Maisie makes a strong
argument that this was necessary in
order to fit a larger battery the 16 s
is also missing water resistance and
wireless charging the latter of which
makes me even more frustrated with the
glass back as the coating they're using
makes the phone unbelievably slippery I
unintentionally conducted a dozen or so
drought tests during the few weeks I use
the 16s and think one of them is to
blame for the deep scratch that
developed on my units front display
quite frankly I think you'd have to be a
little crazy to use this phone without a
case as for the front display it's a 6.2
inch 1080p AMOLED panel the phone still
fits comfortably in the hand though
thanks to its curved corners and a 91.5
three percent screen to body ratio as
for the display quality Samsung actually
custom-made this panel for meizu and the
colors are expectedly rich with pretty
good sunlight readability to Mesa really
hit a homerun in this category
performances also top-notch and is
undoubtedly on par with other flagship
level smartphones Mizzou has been
talking a lot about their one mind 3.0
AI engine recently which is basically
just a bunch of software tweaks designed
to make the phone feel faster
it's hard to objectively test this but I
can say the 16s consistently launched my
favorite apps quickly and it never
seemed to miss a beat overall with this
iteration meizu increase the battery
size significantly from three thousand
to three thousand six hundred milliamp
hours overall battery life is great but
not exceptional I was consistently able
to get a full day of moderate to heavy
use with 5 to 6 hours of screen on time
my biggest issue here is with the
software's aggressive smart background /
app setting for basically every single
app I wanted to receive notifications
from I had to go in and manually disable
this which quickly became annoying the
global variant of the meizu 16 s should
work well with most non-chinese LTE
networks particularly in Europe however
I wouldn't recommend it for use in the
US well I stayed connected to t-mobile's
band for LTE for most of my review
period well you know what occasionally
drop down to 2g or just lose service
entirely moving onto the cameras the 16s
features - on the back the primary is 48
megapixel F 1.7 with oh is and the
secondary is 20 megapixel F 2.6 when
lightning is good these cameras are good
the 16s produces images with a pleasant
color profile one that's not too flat
but not too unnaturally saturated either
basically you get accurate images with
colors with just the right amount of
punch dynamic range is also pretty good
I did however notice the 16s struggle
with processing things like bright red
colors in a few cases it also didn't
correct for white balance as much as I
would have liked finally while the
software portrait mode has gotten better
it can still be hit or miss meizu says
the secondary sensor enables three times
lossless zoom but I'm going to push back
on that claim photo shot at three times
zoom simply aren't as good almost always
they come out over sharpened and with
dual colors this quality discrepancy is
even more noticeable in low-light
overall low-light photos are generally
decent the 16s is able to maintain most
colors but does struggle with detail
there also tends to be a fair bit of
noise but that's when shooting in the
standard
mode meizu actually just introduced a
super night mode which performs
significantly better by combining up to
17 frames into a single image compared
to Google's nitesite on the pixel 3xl
meizu super night actually seems to have
an advantage when a moderate amount of
light is available google's night sight
tends to really bump up the shadows at
the expense of blowing out the
highlights
whereas mazes super night is more modest
by bumping up the shadows but keeping
the details in the highlights meizu says
it will ship the 16s with fly me 7.3
over Android 9.0 in the past I've really
enjoyed using fly me for its clean
design making it one of the best among
Chinese manufacturers and while I still
like the design here I think it's time
for Amazo to refresh it a bit as for
extra features I really like the quick
app launcher on the home screen the
navigation options are also really good
I think Google should just straight-up
copy them for Android cue actually but
you better not care about future
versions of Android if you decide to go
with the 16s as there's like a zero
percent chance that it ever gets updated
and to make matters worse mezzo has
sparingly provided global users with the
same fly me skin updates that they
frequently release for their Chinese
users and that's really unfortunate
because when we made this video the 16s
the software was riddled with bugs
presumably Mesa will be announcing
pricing and availability for global
markets soon for reference the maze of
16s costs 3200 UN or about 462 dollars
for the 6 128 gigabyte model and 3500 UN
or about 506 dollars for the 8 128
gigabyte model in China all things
considered the Mesa 16s has the
potential to be a great choice if Mesa
can get their software act together but
as it stands it feels like Mizzou has
quite frankly neglected their global
users that combined with strong
competition makes the 16s a tough sell
