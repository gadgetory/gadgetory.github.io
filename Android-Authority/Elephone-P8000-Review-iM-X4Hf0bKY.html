shipping in late May elephone announced
the p8 thousand a very similar phone
with a few changes so now that the p8
thousand is available should you buy it
this is Bailey Stein with Android
authority and this is my full review of
the elephone p2000 to use many of the
design elements found on the p7 thousand
and that's certainly not a bad thing the
P 8000 is considerably substantial in
the hand not only because of its heft at
205 grams but also because of its
somewhat thicker profile of 10.1
millimetres and well some users may find
this a bit disconcerting at least at
first I'm thinking that the majority of
users will gladly take the extra half
for the larger 4000 milliamp hour
battery more on that in a minute
regardless it's immediately clear when
picking up the p8 thousand that it means
business and that's inflated by the
phone's metal band in overall
surprisingly premium build the plastic
rear cover kind of looks like a
carbon-fiber D brand skin and the Sham
furred edges and subtle curve contribute
to a very nice overall design while you
can access the dual SIM card slots as
well as a micro SD card slot the slot
for removing the back cover is actually
very thin and difficult to use without a
sharp fingernail add some relatively
strong clips and you can be left
struggling to get the back cover off in
addition to that the microUSB port isn't
perfectly centered and while this
complaint is admittedly nitpicky I could
definitely see the imperfect placement
bothering some users what's perhaps more
annoying though is the black border
around the display which appears to have
been intended to obscure the actual
bezel sides personally I'm not a fan of
a look and I know many others aren't as
well there is a 5 megapixel Samsung
front facing camera on the top left of
the device as well as 3 capacitive keys
on the bottom menu home and back the
home button is illuminated and if you're
lucky it may also function as a
notification LED allophones first batch
of 5000 units do not include the LED
however and elephone actually has a page
on their website stating that they quote
head to make a compromise in order to
keep up with the man
first batch buyers can request a
discount on Ella phones next flagship
the Ella phone bounty but there doesn't
appear to be any other sort of
compensation available the P 8000s 5.5
inch 1080p display looks great and has
excellent color reproduction the color
temperature seems neutral and the
maximum brightness is fairly bright
sunlight readability is still about
average for the price and unlike on the
P 7000 there's unfortunately no gorilla
glass I'm most concerned with quality
control however as I did have a few
issues on my unit out of the box I
noticed a line of LCD bright spots on
the right side of the display a dead
pixel near the bottom left corner and a
bit of dust trapped between the LCD and
digitizer these are issues that I can
live with but it's alarming that there
was this much oversight and quality
control before shipping featuring the
octa-core 64-bit mediatek mt6752
processor collect at one point three
gigahertz the P 8000 is a capable
performer while the processor may not be
as powerful as the slightly older mt6752
the elephone still provides reasonably
good performance I didn't have any
issues using it day to day and I think
that performance is good when you
consider the price it also has a
generous three gigabytes of RAM which
should be enough for even heavy
multitasking coupled with a male T 720
GPU the P 8000 is able to play virtually
all casual games without any issues do
keep in mind however that graphically
intensive 3d games may be slow to load
or drop frames during gameplay the
elephone PA end includes support for 802
11 and Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth 4.0 I
think the Wi-Fi signal could be a bit
stronger but I didn't have any issues
with GPS for cellular network support
there's tri-band GSM dual band WCDMA and
non-us LTE bands unfortunately it does
not support t-mobile at all actually and
only partially supports 18 t 2g due to
the missing GSM 1900 band I was able to
receive 2g speeds with AT&amp;amp;T but only
occasionally while outdoors I couldn't
use the phone while indoors at all and
often found the phone to be dropping
signal even when only a couple of miles
away from the cell tower so if you're in
the US this is not
going to be good at all if you want to
use it as an actual phone the PA
thousand speaker sounds okay but it's
neither loud nor clear it's good enough
for basic use but the distortion
prevents me from wanting to use the
device exclusively to play music war
videos the headphone audio quality is
good as is the case with almost all
modern smartphones but I did notice that
it is a tad quiet the lower volume is
probably best for my hearing but I would
have liked the option to turn it up to a
level more comparable with other devices
this may just be an issue with a stock
rom so hopefully elephone can fix this
in the future the four thousand milliamp
our internal batteries should be able to
get most users through a full day of use
although your numbers will depend on
your usage I powered up the P 8000 from
a full charge at 9:30 a.m. and was able
to get it to last until about 10:30 a.m.
the next day with just over 5 hours of
screen on time that was without cellular
connectivity Wi-Fi and brightness set to
about 75% a somewhat expected trade-off
of having this large of a battery is the
amount of time that it takes to charge
the device from 0 to 100 even with the 2
amp charger it took me a little under 4
hours to charge the device completely
battery life is definitely better than
most phones nowadays but I did notice
that it drained very quickly once I
started using the device hopefully this
is just a bug with a stock rom that
elephone can fix in the future
unfortunately the fingerprint reader is
on the back of the device which makes it
difficult to use without visually
looking for it it's advertised to be a
360 degree sensor but I didn't find it
to be very accurate when using it from
different angles I tested it a few times
and found that if I place my finger
perfectly on the sensor it was able to
read my fingerprint with about 70
percent accuracy
obviously this will vary a bit from
person to person but if you are having
trouble it can't help to add a single
finger twice so that the phone just has
more data to compare with overall it's a
nice addition although I do wish that it
worked more accurately from different
angles or was placed on the front of the
device now the phone may be talking up
the 13 megapixel Sam
rear camera but it didn't really produce
anything above average for this price
category in my testing sure you can get
a good image but it does have some
issues focusing and setting exposure
values HDR helps but it's still kind of
an issue low light performance is also
very poor and I never felt that I could
count on the camera to get a good shot
the camera app is just the open-source
mediatek app so there's nothing really
new here but hopefully elephone can
improve the camera in the future the PA
thousand runs android 5.1 lollipop out
of the box it's completely stock with
the exception of the elephone launcher
there isn't an app drawer but i do like
how you can swipe between different
folders of apps to quickly find what
you're looking for the third-party app
icons can look a bit too modified in my
opinion but all of this can be remedied
with a third-party launcher there is a
theme store but individual theme changes
only affect the wallpaper and system
icons as far as I can tell there does
seem to be a bug that prevents you from
changing the lockscreen wallpaper in the
current build so hopefully elephone can
resolve this in the future
before you go commenting telling me that
I don't know how to change the lock
screen wallpaper I'd like to confirm
that I've tried changing it in both the
launcher and system settings with both
the gallery and photos apps with no
results other than those minor changes
the elephone p8 thousand runs a
completely stack build which many
enthusiasts will appreciate that also
means that the p8 thousand is missing
extra setting options for things like
double tap to wake sadly the phone does
not support gestures at all which is odd
considering that the P 7000 included
these you do get mirror vision however
which lets you adjust the display colors
to your liking the phone is said to be
working on CyanogenMod 12.1 and niai
roms
for the p 8000 but it's currently
unclear when those will be released they
have released a fly me ROM as well
although I haven't tested it myself you
can purchase the elephone p8 thousand in
either white silver or gold for about
$170 there is a single 16 gigabyte
partition and you can always expand that
with a micro SD card up to 64 gigabytes
so that brings us to my conclusion
although the P 8000 may look impressive
on paper there are just too many
deal-breakers for me to recommend this
device while it does have excellent
battery life a great display and a nice
design there's also a few glaring flaws
the camera is average at best quality
control seems to be lacking when it
comes to the display and the speaker
output sounds distorted if you're in the
US the zenfone 2 is going to be a better
option since it offers full 4G LTE
support for AT&amp;amp;T mobile and if not the
meizu m2 note and Lenovo k3 note are
much better devices overall and they
actually cost less thank you for
