Android 40 and if you're looking for
some great tablets that aren't going to
break the bank
LG believes they have the perfect
solution let's take a look at the LG G
pad 7.0 and the G pad 10.1 so the LG G
pad 7.0 and 10.1 are budget tablets
there's no denying that so they're not
going to rival some of the higher-end
options out there but with that being
said these two tablets have pretty solid
build quality and look a lot nicer than
their price would lead you to believe
they're both made entirely of plastic
but they feel very sturdy and
lightweight the 10.1 does feel a little
more substantial in comparison to the
7-inch model but overall the build
quality is pretty good on both and they
both feature matte finishes so you don't
have to worry about covering them in
fingerprints these 7-inch G pad is a
little bit thicker in comparison to the
10.1 but considering it's a lot smaller
it's not going to be that big of a deal
the button import layouts are similar
but they do have their differences the
power and volume keys are on the right
side if you're looking at both of them
in portrait but on the 7-inch model the
microUSB port is on the bottom and your
3.5 millimeter headset jack is on the
top with an IR blaster and a micro SD
card slot that's covered by a flap on a
10.1 the IR blaster is on the same side
as the power and volume keys while the
3.5 millimeter headset jack micro USB
port and micro SD card slot are on the
top or left side depending on how you're
looking at it these speakers are located
on the back on both and whereas the Jeep
has 7.0 looks like it has dual speakers
it's actually just a single speaker
while on the G pad 10.1 you really do
get dual speakers the placement on the
back is a little unfortunate especially
on the 10.1 but for budget tablets they
actually don't sound half-bad
now the displays are obviously different
sizes with a 7-inch screen on the G pad
7.0 and a 10.1 inch screen on the G pad
10.1 respectively but even though
they're different screen sizes the
resolution is exactly the same with 1280
by 800 pixels on both so not a very high
resolution meaning you'll be able to
spot pixels pretty easily especially on
the 10.1 but again these are pretty
mid-range tablets outside of the low
resolution however these screens aren't
half-bad they've got pretty decent
looking colors viewing angles are pretty
good too and they get plenty bright so
there's not much to complain about
outside of the resolution also the same
on both are the internal specs because
after all these are practically the same
tablets just in different sizes they're
both being powered by a Snapdragon 400
processor the Adreno 305 and one
gigabyte of ram which is pretty common
specs in mid-range devices the
performance however is actually not that
bad despite the specs there is a little
bit of lag here and there and sometimes
there's frames being dropped but overall
I really didn't have an issue using
these tablets on a day to day basis apps
open quickly multitasking wasn't really
an issue and they both played games just
fine whether it was simplistic game or
something more graphically intensive the
adrenal 3:05 does a pretty nice job with
games so if you were worried about the
performance of these two tablets there's
really not much to be worried about as
they both perform admirably with all
things considered on the back of the G
pad 7.0 you're looking at a three
megapixel camera and a five megapixel
camera on the 10.1 and there's no flash
on either one so it's pretty basic just
like you might expect it to be getting
into the camera interface it's the same
simplistic camera UI that can be found
on other LG devices like the g3 and
because it is so simple it really lets
you focus on taking photos without
messing around too much with the camera
settings since these are fairly basic
camera optics don't expect too much from
the picture quality they're there if you
want to take a photo or
Kord a quick video with them but I
wouldn't recommend trying to use either
one of these tablets as your primary
option for a camera it's just not a good
idea as far as the battery life goes to
Gpad 7.0 features a four thousand
milliamp hour battery while the 10.1 has
double D capacity at 8,000 milliamp
hours what you sort of expect because
the 10.1 is a larger tablet after all
and with moderate usage you should be
able to get a few days on both but I did
find the battery life on the 10.1 to be
a little bit better I was able to
consistently get about 8 hours of screen
on time on the 10.1 whereas on the 7.0 I
only got about 6 hours so not too bad on
the 7.0 but the 10.1 is definitely the
better choice at least when it comes to
the battery life with the G pad 7.0 and
10.1 you are getting Android KitKat
right out of the box which is nice and
obviously if you couldn't already tell
the latest version of LG's GUI is here
as well so the experience for the most
part is pretty much the same as what you
would find on the LG g3 from the lock
screen to the home screen and the app
icons and even features like dual window
knock on and knock code are also here so
if you're familiar with the g3 you'll
feel right at home with the G pads one
really unique software enhancement that
will be very beneficial if you own an lg
phone is the cue pair feature which
allows you to pair your phone and tablet
together in order to receive
notifications like phone calls text
messages social network notifications
and even transfer cue memos between the
two devices so if you own an lg phone
like the g3 you'll be able to take full
advantage of the G pads and their
software features the G pad 7.0 and 10.1
are available now for $150 and $250
respectively their Wi-Fi only income in
a few colors like black red or white and
for the price I think they're pretty
decent tablets so if you're looking for
a decent bang for the buck
budget-friendly tablet the G pad 7.0 and
10.1 are pretty solid options given
their particular price point but that is
it for the G pad 7.0 and 10
point one they're pretty solid tablets
given their respective prices so if
you're looking for a tablet that you can
enjoy without burning a hole in your
wallet check out the G pad 7.0 and 10.1
but that is it for this review thank you
