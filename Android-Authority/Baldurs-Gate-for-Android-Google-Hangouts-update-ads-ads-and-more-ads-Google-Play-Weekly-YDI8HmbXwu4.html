Hindy the android authority app guy and
it's Friday and you know what that means
this week we're going to talk about a
bunch of new advertisements a bunch of
applications on sale and a bunch of
application updates as well as virus
shield again so let's go our first bit
of news this week the google play store
is having a spring sale that features 19
games some of the more well-known games
on the list include the room to the Dark
Knight Rises Riptide gp2 need for speed
most wanted and 10 million but pretty
much every game on the list is pretty
enjoyable it is not known how long this
sale will continue so if you're up for
buying a few awesome games now is the
time to do it it's also worth mentioning
that the sales page may not be up for
all regions just usually is not a
problem as you can just go to the game
itself in the play store and get the
discounted rate there if you want the
full list and links to each one will
have that linked in the written
companion which is in the video
description below google announced
earlier this week that they're going to
be bringing app install ads as well as
deep a plinking to both google search
and youtube okay so these two pieces of
news mean two wildly different things if
you're a frequent visitor of sites like
yahoo or Facebook you've seen app
install ads before it's essentially an
ad that when you click on it will
install the advertised application
directly to your device this is meant to
help bolster app downloads and get
people out of their shells to try some
new things arguably the more interesting
piece of news here is the deep app
linking here's an example of how this
would work say you did a search for
house m.d. advertisements and the
results would point you to things like
Netflix if you were a netflix subscriber
you could click on that advertisement
and the netflix would open on your
device and put you on the house m.d.
page ostensibly this would make
advertisements more useful and would
probably generate not only more clicks
but encourage people to use their
android devices and android apps more in
their everyday lives a couple of weeks
ago we talked about virus shield the
world's most useless application this
week Google is sending out refunds
people who purchase the application all
received an email from google
apologizing for not taking quicker
action against the waste of space that
was adorning their top paid apps list
along with the email que me redeem code
that people could use to get a five
dollar google play credit so they could
go purchase something else and with that
the story of virus shield comes to a
and we sincerely hope there won't be any
more of them so Google Hangouts got an
update this last week that takes SMS
messages and hangouts messages and
merges them into one thread along with
some other features people seem to be
really happy about this update and I
guess I can see why it helps clean up
the multiple threads problem and makes
the experience more streamlined
ironically the update also included a
separation of phone contacts from
hangouts contacts so while messages are
mixed contacts are now separated it's a
good update and pretty much everyone
should have it fine now I was really
hoping for something like SMS support
and chrome extension or a standalone
hangouts application on desktop but this
is still good to you know baby steps her
last bit of days this week Samsung is
bringing advertisements to milk music
and it's causing mayhem worldwide not
really this is kind of a big deal
because its original selling point was
that it was ad free however as the fine
print states the ad free part was for a
limited time only and unfortunately that
limited time is running out faster than
we would have liked here's the thing
even with the advertisements this is
still a pretty decent music service for
samsung devices it is still free to use
and it's still powered by slacker radio
which means you're still getting more
music than you would with Pandora it's
not going to stop people for being angry
about it and that's okay but if you have
it and you're wondering if you should go
back to Pandora or another music service
I'd wait and see how bad these ads are
before tossing it away for good so who
wants to check out some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the briton
companion which is in the video
description below first to get the nod
this week is ES file explorer it's
already ragingly popular but if you're a
root user ES file explorer is latest
update can be really helpful it includes
a new route only permission that allows
it to read and write to your SD card
thus circumventing the new android
kitkat SD card limitation problem
currently it is one of only a few file
managers that can do this so if you're
rooted and suffering from the KitKat SD
card blues ES File Explorer has you
covered if you're a fan of the original
baldur's gate then I've got some good
news for you the original game has been
re-released for Android with some
enhancements to make the mobile
experience better it's one of the better
action rpgs to come out over the last 15
years and it seems to continue that
proud tradition there are in app
purchases that include more missions
re-recorded voice sets and artwork it's
a little expensive at 999
you're looking at 60 hours of gameplay
so it's probably worth it another big
game released this week was amazing
spider-man 2 from Gameloft they just
finished up releasing Captain America a
couple of weeks ago and now there's a
new spider-man game the graphics are
actually pretty good and the gameplay
looks like it's a lot of fun you play as
spider-man as you battle against classic
bad guys as well as new bad guys the
only potential issues that the game
costs for 99 and also contains in-app
purchases gameloft seems to really want
to push it with their customers but the
game still rates a 4.1 in the google
play store at least for right now I know
this isn't as exciting as other releases
but there was a farmville game released
by zynga this last week we did a review
here on android authority and i'll link
to that here at the end of the video as
well as the video description below this
is the essential farmville experience
with the classic farmville mechanics if
you like and play farmville you know
what this game is about if you didn't
like it then you probably won't like it
now at the very least it is free to play
last up this week is the now venerable
clash of clans this insanely popular
online multiplayer strategy game got an
update recently that has introduced a
new game type called clan wars the
concept is very simple your clan goes up
against other clans and you battle it
out for a few days it has some new life
to an aging premise and they manage to
do it in a way that newer and veteran
players can't enjoy the game is free as
usual so there's no harm in checking it
out once again I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy don't forget to
subscribe to our YouTube channel and if
you want to follow android authority
