innovators thinking outside the box but
this is bananas
banana phone is a bluetooth-enabled
mobile handset that connects to your
smartphone so you can talk to your
friends and family on a banana and
awesome
this banana shaped device is available
on IndieGoGo and can be had for as low
as 40 bucks this is a very low price for
a phone right that's because it isn't
exactly a phone the banana phone
essentially works as a Bluetooth
communicator it connects to your phone
wirelessly and doesn't work as a
standalone device it really doesn't do
too much but it is fun in fact it only
has three buttons volume up volume down
at home it can receive calls as well as
make them using voice assistant of
course battery life is estimated at 10
hours of talktime making it a handy
gadget for those who'd rather not pull
out their phones to make a call and
prefer to do it with a fruit now why
does this banana phone have appeal
especially because it needs more apps no
my friends it is actually serious monkey
business it's for endangered gorillas
check that link out there below proceeds
will go to help endangered gorillas it's
for a good cause
all right so moving on to rumors
surrounding a Motorola tablet that may
have a long for feature the report comes
from android police who received a slide
show that shows off this feature from an
unnamed but trusted source the slide
show shows that the tablet will have a
Productivity mode which will allow for
Android apps to be pinned on the
navigation bar the slide indicates that
users should be able to switch between
those apps by tapping on their icons in
the nav bar in theory this should allow
people to switch from a word processing
app to a note-taking app quickly without
having to go through the normal Android
homescreen don't keep in mind guys we
know nothing else about this rumored
device we don't have a release date
specs nothing like that but it is a
feature that does begin to close the gap
between tablets
and laptop so let's talk about what
could be the next generation of
fingerprint scanners the Fraunhofer
Institute has demonstrated a brand new
OLED micro display that can identify
even the smallest sweat pores of your
finger the institute's new invention
might mean that we are one step closer
to a highly advanced and secure under
glass optical fingerprint scanning
technology now if you guys remember what
are the rumors surrounding the Samsung
Galaxy s8 before it was launched was an
under screen a fingerprint scanner now
of course that didn't actually come to
fruition but the question is what does
this new invention actually mean for
people like you and me
in short increased security the
Institute States and I quote we have
used an extra thin encapsulation for the
chip of this fingerprint sensor thereby
the distance between finger and image
sensor has been minimized and the
fingerprint can be captured excellently
thus an additional imaging optic is not
necessary for this application what this
means is that despite the thinness the
high spatial resolution can identify
even the smallest sweat pores on top of
your fingers meaning these OLED based
optical fingerprint scanners are
extremely secure optical fingerprint
scanners are the oldest method of
capturing fingerprints and because they
rely on optical images of your finger
it's not as difficult to manipulate them
the Fraunhofer institute's new sensors
therefore address this major drawback
and for all my Indian friends out there
Wi-Fi hotspots may be coming to you
Facebook and Indian carrier Barta Airtel
have joined forces to bring millions of
Indians online with 20,000 Wi-Fi
hotspots the program called Express
Wi-Fi has been created in partnership
with 500 local businesses in the states
of Gujarat and Rajasthan and these two
places that I won't try and pronounce
it's rolled out thus far to 700 hotspots
with the remainder to follow in the
coming months according to BuzzFeed news
the cost of access to the Express Wi-Fi
hotspots is decided by the partners not
Facebook and they're said to range from
10 rupees for 100 megabytes to 300
rupees for 20 gigabytes of
per day in the statement Facebook's head
of connectivity solutions in
asia-pacific munis Seth said quote
Xpress Wi-Fi is designed to complement
mobile data offerings by providing a
low-cost high bandwidth alternative for
getting online and accessing apps
download and streaming content
