brought to you by lynda.com go to
lynda.com slash Android to start your
free trial hello again ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe handy from Android
Authority comm and this is Android QA
where you ask in we answer this week
we're going to be talking about 64-bit
processors Android 4.3 on all Samsung
phones battery life problems and a whole
lot more so let's get started well Raj
asks weight for 64-bit processor from
Android or buy an Android phone with a
32-bit processor I plan to have my phone
for at least two years here's the thing
with 64-bit processors there's still a
whole bunch that we don't know we don't
know if Android Kit Kats going to
support 64-bit processing we think that
they will but we can't be sure until
it's actually announced device
manufacturers haven't announced the
phone yet that'll have a 64-bit
processor and processor manufacturers
are still just trying to get these
things off the line so what I'm gonna
suggest to you is to get a 32-bit device
for right now and then when you're ready
to upgrade again there will be more
64-bit devices for you to choose from
and you can make that transition more
easily Anna Ruud asks hey my mom just
got a note 3 which is supposed to have
great battery life she was using a bada
phone previously which she charged once
every 3 to 4 days with moderate use
while I was checking out the note 3 at 8
2 to 4 percent of battery an hour is it
a problem or is it supposed to be like
that given the screen and the processor
4% drainage per hour actually isn't half
bad most Android devices get about 12
hours a day with some getting about 16
hours a day at 4 percent drainage per
hour you're looking at about a 25 hour
charge which is substantially higher
than the average for Android smartphones
and beats out pretty much every other
smartphone that you can think of these
days see no slug asks what is a stable
AOSP ROM based on Android 4.3 for the
Galaxy s2 i 90 100g any ideas for uses a
daily driver I did a little searching
and I found out that Santa Jomon 10.2 is
available for the Samsung Galaxy s2 I 90
100g according to their known issues
page there are no known issues with this
ROM so if I were to recommend one it
would be that one of course be sure to
make an Android backup just in case
there's something wrong that's not on
there unknown issues page so you can
revert back if you need to ritchie asks
hi Joe I'm currently using the Xperia Z
should I upgrade to the Xperia z1 or
wait for next year's Xperia z2
that's a really good question the Xperia
z1 is an amazing device with some great
specs but according to rumors the z2 is
going to be even better however those
same rumors say that the phone isn't
supposed to be released until next
spring or about six months from now so
the question I have to ask myself is do
I want to wait six months for my next
smartphone if the answer to that
question is yes then I would keep what I
have and just wait for the z2 to drop if
the answer to that question is no then
go ahead and get the z1 it's still a
really great device and you really can't
go wrong with either of them lots of
people asked when will the galaxy s3
galaxy s4 and Galaxy Note 2 get the
Android 4.3 update according to Samsung
the update should be finished and
rolling out to people by the end of
October of course that time may change
depending on your carrier some people
make it at knocked-over others may have
to wait for November and December and
for Verizon customers it'll happen
eventually given the number of carriers
and devices that have to be updated I
can't give exact dates because none of
them have been announced yet so just be
patient because it is coming once again
