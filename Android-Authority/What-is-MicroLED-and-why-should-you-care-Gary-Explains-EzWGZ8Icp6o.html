Android authority now at the moment we
have two major types of display
technology in our smartphones
that's LCD liquid crystal display and
OLED technology including hammer lid and
that stands for organic light-emitting
diode now there is in the future a new
technology coming called micro LED or
micro LED and this offers lots of
benefits over OLED and LCD so if you
want to find out more about micro LED
and what it means for smartphones of the
future please let me explain
let's start with a bit of context LCD
displays use a backlight that is shown
through a matrix of liquid crystals that
can be altered to let certain amounts of
light through and that is very good and
well known technology and we have it in
lots of things from laptops or
smartphones and TVs its disadvantage for
mobile is that the backlight is always
on even when the screen is black which
means that it's very hard to get those
really deep contrast and deep blacks and
you are using sort of power on the
display even when actually it's not
displaying anything and the other
technology is
OLED that's organic light-emitting
diodes these are LEDs that use an
organic compound and they can be
switched on and off individually which
means you get better blacks you get
better contrast and it uses less power
now if you want to find out more about
the details of both those types of
displays I have a video linked up here
which compares OLED to IPS LCD 2 retina
displays into infinity displays and
gives you kind of an understanding of
all these different technologies and how
they are used in our smartphones today
now micro LED uses the same technology
as Oleg we're talking about light
emitting diodes we're not talking about
a backlight with a kind of crystal
matrix we're talking about individual
pixels that we turn on off but as you
guessed by the word micro they are much
smaller and the reason they're much
smaller is they are using inorganic
compounds to produce the actual the red
green and the blue pixels now micro LED
technology has several advantages over
current OLED technologies including that
the displacement actually be thinner
because you no longer need a polarizing
and an encapsulation layer these are
some of the layers that you find in the
overall manufacture of OLED displays it
actually makes the over
all display a lot thinner but it's more
than just thinner because actually the
way these LEDs work because of this type
of compound this inorganic compound
they're using you actually need to use
less battery life less power is needed
in fact some estimates say that an micro
LED display you did 90 percent less
power than an LCD display and up to 50
percent less power than an OLED display
so here we're talking about significant
power reductions in micro LED displays
and because micro LED displays use
inorganic materials they don't suffer
from the same burning problems that you
can get with OLED displays if you want
to find out more about why you get
burning and what happens with the blue
pixels on OLED displays I've got a video
up here it talks all about it so we've
got thinner displays and we've got less
power and we've got no burning issues
these are all great advances that micro
LEDs can give us but there's also
another big advantage because they are
micro LEDs you can pack more pixels into
a smaller space you get greater pixel
density and so there will be excellent
for 4k and even for 8k displays but of
course there is a catch and that is
these micro LED displays are very hard
to make so for example this year at CES
SC is 2018 Samsung demonstrated a big
television 146 a television which they
called the wall which was based on micro
LED technology
it was modular it wasn't one big panel
it was several panels that they're able
to stick together and the problem is is
that Samsung was saying that the yields
on even these big panels is actually
very very low now there is a thing
called the pitch which is the distance
between the pixels now the pitch on
these big displays was actually quite
large which is why they actually chose
to make it a wall because you have to
see it from far back now you can imagine
of course on a smartphone you're seeing
it with only just you know a few
centimeters away so you need a very
small pitch between the individual
pixels you don't want kind of black
lines appearing and as of yet to make
those micro LED displays with a small
pitch and a high pixel density is still
not commercially viable now fan
some said at sea yes they're expecting
to see micro LED displays appearing
within the next two to five years now
whether they meant just for televisions
or whether they meant for televisions
and for smartphones I'm not sure but you
can certainly imagine this is going to
be a long-term investment from companies
like Samsung and in fact it's not only
Samsung are involved in this there are
rumors that Apple are involved in micro
date displays LG are involved in micro
LED displays and you can be sure that
other companies are also researching and
looking at this technology and of course
as you can imagine the first generation
of these displays that come out are
going to be expensive we're talking low
yields we're talking the new technology
and they're definitely going to be what
in high-end televisions and super ultra
flagship smartphones but of course over
the long term the prices will come down
but we're talking five plus years before
this starts to trickle down into kind of
you know the mainstream so as a quick
summary micro lead gives you the same
advantages as OLED that includes the
fact that each of the pixels can go on
and off individually gives you those
nice deep blacks it gives you a good
contrast ratio and a wide color gamut
and you also get thinner displays
greater pixel density and they use less
battery life up to 90 percent less than
a standard LCD display but unfortunately
they're hard to make they aren't yet
commercially viable and when they do
finally come out they are definitely
going to be expensive
however ignoring the price and the
consumer viability I think as we look
for the long term it's going to be
interesting to see how micro LED
displays filter down into the mainstream
and what that can mean for our
smartphones in five six eight years from
now maybe we're all going to be carrying
around 4k 8 k displays that use less
battery life wouldn't that be great so
it's going to be interesting to see how
this turns out okay my name's Gary Sims
and this is Andrew authority I really
hope you enjoyed this video if you do
please do give it a thumbs up also
please let me know in the comments below
are you excited about micro LED
technology what it can mean for
smartphones the VR of the future also
please do subscribe to the channel and
don't forget to
share this video on social media okay
that's about it please don't forget to
go over to Andrew orator calm because we
are your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
