Andrew authority now we all know there
are different versions of Android
Android server and Android hate Oreo and
so on but now there seems to be
different flavors there's kind of stock
Android there's Android one there's
Android go what are the differences
between all these different flavors well
if you want to find out please let me
explain
okay so the way it works for a
traditional OAM like Samsung or LG or
while way would be that Google publish
the source code for Android part of its
Android open source project and then
anybody can take that code and build
Android for a smartphone or for any kind
of development board but on top of that
Google have a series of services for
example the Google Play Store and things
like YouTube and things like the Google
music and Google Play movies and those
are all things that are provided by
Google but they're not part of the
Android Open Source project so therefore
to get a normal Android smartphone you
need to take the source code from Google
and you need to have certification so
that you can use their apps that they
will send you now on top of this normal
way of dealing with Android we also have
these three variations that I talked
about the first is stock Android which
you get on devices like the pixel the
pixel 2 and before that the Nexus
devices like the Nexus 5x and likes at
Nexus 6p and so on now those devices
they actually get a Android directly
from Google so as soon as a change that
Google want to ship out whether it's a
security update or a bug fix it comes
from Google directly to the phone and
then there is Android one that Android
one was originally launched in India and
it was aimed at low-end phones but over
the years it's actually grown and now
includes some kind of mid-range or high
mid-range devices like the Moto X 4
which I'll talk about in a moment now
the thing that the Android 1 program
it's actually Google offering software
services to OEMs
so maybe the OEMs are good at doing
hardware hardware manufacturing at doing
retail channels and advertising and
sales but they haven't got an experience
at doing much software so Google's say
well we'll do the software for you and
we'll also guarantee to ship update and
upgrade for a certain amount of time on
to your handset
and that's the Android one program and
then there's Android gonna Android go
really replaces the original plan of
Android one which was for low-end
devices and it's a cut-down version
since if it doesn't have too many
pre-installed apps and there are some
special apps like maps go and Gmail go
which are aimed specifically for low-end
devices now the big difference between
stock Android and Android one and then
Android Go is that Android Go doesn't
come directly from Google Google give it
to an OEM like Nokia and then Nokia
release it and knock you have to release
the updates and the upgrades when
they're pushed down from Google now I
have got hold of three different devices
one running each of these flavors of
Android and I had a quick look to see
how they differ so I've got the pixel
which has got stock Android on it comes
with Android 8.1 Oreo and has a security
updates including April and I'm videoing
this in the month of April I've also got
the Motorola MOTO X 4 which is an
Android 1 device and that has Android
8.0 Oreo and it has security updates up
to March
I've also got the Nokia one which has
got Android 8.1 Go edition on it but it
doesn't have any security updates from
January so it seems to be a bit behind
there on the security updates now when
you look at these three phones side but
I said there are some cosmetic
differences in the launcher the way
things are arrays the widgets that you
get in the wallpapers that you get but
that's all cosmetic stuff that each of
these om manufacturers including Google
itself has decided to include on the
skin of Android but it's not radical
changes we're talking colors and
wallpapers and things like that when it
comes to pre-installed apps the Moto X 4
had the most pre-installed apps not from
Motorola but actually from Google
because they pre-installed things like
Google Translate and and Google Play
Books whereas the pixel had less of
these google apps it had the bare
minimum kind of the Play Store and
YouTube and things like that but it also
had the daydream application because the
pixel is a daydream compatible handset
and the other extreme we've got the
Nokia one which had very very few apps
pre-installed but they are all available
all three devices all the apps from
Google are available on the Play Store
but now
of them came with kind of bloatware they
all came with basically a pure Android
experience however it is worth noting
that some apps are the same across all
devices so for example the calculator
app was exactly the same across all
three but other apps can be quite
different so the camera app was
different for every single device and
they had different ranges of
functionality with each device so even
though you're buying an Android device
and it might be Android one or it might
be stock Android the camera app isn't
guaranteed to be the same and that's
mainly because the hardware that it's
running on what's available is very
different so for example the Moto X
forwards got your camera whereas a Nokia
one doesn't for example so there's a big
difference in what's available and
therefore the camera app has to reflect
that okay just to sum up so you've got
to stop Google it's on the pixel and the
Nexus range and that comes directly from
Google and the updates and security
patches come directly from Google then
on the other hand you've got the Android
one program where again the software and
the updates come directly from Google
and Google offer a period about two
years of updates for those phones then
thirdly you've got Android go like on
the Nokia one and that comes directly
from the OEMs in this case from Nokia
doesn't come from Google the changes and
security packages are shipped on akhiya
and then Nakia have to ship them out to
the handsets my name is Gary Sims and
this is Android authority I really hope
