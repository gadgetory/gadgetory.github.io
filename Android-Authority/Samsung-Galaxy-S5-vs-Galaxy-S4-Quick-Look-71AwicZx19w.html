by bitdefender mobile security it's past
versus present on this edition of vs. as
its Joshua regard from Android 30 what's
going on everybody and here we're taking
a look at the Samsung Galaxy s5 versus
its predecessor the galaxy s4 the galaxy
s5 is slightly larger and thicker than
its predecessor due in large part to
that big display and the phone is also
about 15 grams heavier but the s5 does
move away from the glossy fuel of the s4
as Samsung has opted for a soft touch
material for the back on the front we do
still have the same layout but instead
we have a change from the Menu button of
the s4 to a recent apps button for the
s5 now one thing that the galaxy s5 can
definitely boast over the original s4 is
its water and dust resistance an ip67
certification helps it really stand the
elements as far as the screens go we do
have a slightly larger screen on the
galaxy s5 the Super AMOLED screen coming
in at 5.1 inches compared to the five
incher that was on the galaxy s4 yes
these are essentially identical screens
however and that means that you have
some oversaturated colors but overall
really good and enjoyable performance in
that user experience for the display
while we do see a big update in the
processing package for the galaxy s5 we
will say that the Snapdragon 600 that
was originally in the s4 is still doing
a great job even to this day and that
should only mean that the Galaxy s5 will
really set in a higher bar when it comes
to processing power but then when we
move on to the hardware department will
we will find that the galaxy s5 does
have a slightly larger battery jumping
from the 2600 milliamp power unit in the
s4 to the 28 hundred million power unit
on the s5 but we will say however is
that the Snapdragon 805 in theory should
be more powerful and also Samsung added
in quite a few options for power saving
when it comes to the new features
however everything that came from the s4
does make it to the s5 and then you have
the additions of the fingerprint scanner
which is a slide type and also the
heartrate monitor that's found on the
back when it comes to the cameras we do
see that the 13 megapixel unit on the
galaxy s4 is looking to be trumped by
the 16 megapixel ISO cell sensor that
has been introduced in the galaxy s5
this is a sensor that is supposed to
take pictures with less noise and even
in low-light condition to produce a very
nice picture now the app on the s5 has
also been redone from the s4 touting all
of its settings when you hit the
Settings button everything comes up that
you'll be able to tweak for a good
smartphone photography and in the end we
do see that the s5 is looking to just be
a better camera overall compared to the
s4 and finally when it comes to software
we were really hoping that there was
going to be a big evolution from the s4
to the s5 when it comes to TouchWiz
unfortunately some of the aspects of
TouchWiz were changed but not enough to
in order to make it really feel like a
big difference the inclusion of a recent
apps button on the s5 does allow it to
have a little bit more multitasking that
is more easily accessible as you can
just jump in and out of apps very easily
instead of having to hold the home
button in the s4 and finally the my
magazine UI has been brought to the
front and is now a second screen all the
way on the left much like a Google now
in stock Android so it does change a few
of the aspects but in the end TouchWiz
still pretty much looks like TouchWiz so
if you are expecting a big change
between the s4 and s5 you probably
didn't get it here in the end both of
these phones do represent some of the
best that Samsung has had to offer and
in terms of the s5 it just continues
that tradition whether or not all of the
new things are going to be useful for
you it's definitely a question that you
can answer for yourself
what the s4 is definitely no slouch so
it doesn't deserve to just be dismissed
in this comparison we have a lot more
coming on the Samsung Galaxy s5 so make
sure you stay tuned to android authority
as we report it all to you from the
Mobile World Congress here in Barcelona
