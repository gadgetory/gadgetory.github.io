thinking Jase this is just some MacBook
Air clone and there is some truth to
that
but it also represents a major shift in
strategy for Xiaomi because they're
announcing to the world that it isn't
just about phones anymore there are two
sizes of the me notebook air a 12.5 inch
and a 13.3 inch while neither of these
fit the typical size of a workhorse
laptop they definitely fulfill the
ultraportable demands of a highly mobile
lifestyle the 13.3 inch model is both
thinner and lighter than Apple's 13-inch
MacBook Air and the 12.5 inch is thinner
but a little heavier than Apple's 11
inch air both sizes of the me notebook
air feature full HD displays that's 1920
by 1080 that equates to a pixel density
of 176 pixels per inch on the 12.5 inch
model and 165 PPI on the 13.3 inch model
compare this to 130 PPI on the 13-inch
MacBook Air on 142 PPI on the 11 inch
model and you're getting more pixel
density display we can't comment on the
quality of Shami panel just yet though
now when it comes to price this is where
Xiaomi always wins the price is the 13.3
inch my notebook air is 4999 1 or $750
u.s. and you'll pay as little as 520 us
for the 12.5 inch model well there are
some less impressive and turtles on the
smaller laptop you do get an additional
2 hours of battery life on the 12.5 inch
model these are pretty impressive specs
and are roughly two-thirds the costs of
Apple's offerings now let's get down and
dirty with the specs
first up the 13.3 inch me notebook air
comes with an intel core processor i 5
that's up to 2.7 gigahertz with an
nvidia geforce 940 max GPU and there's
eight gigabytes of ddr4 ram 256
gigabytes of SSD and a PCIe with one
empty SATA slot 4 shall me serviced
Maree expansion the smaller model comes
with some lighter specs including an
Intel Core M 3 CPU and it has no
dedicated GPU it has 4 gigabytes of RAM
128 gigabytes in the SSD via SATA and
again with one free PCIe slot there's
only one USB 3.0 port on the smaller
model but you still get HDMI and dual
AKG speakers this model is reportedly
good for 11.5 hours of battery life in a
weighs just over one kilogram another
interesting feature is that both me
notebook airs will be available in
silver and gold but can be unlocked via
bluetooth with your me band 2 device now
when it comes to availability the xiaomi
me notebook airs will be available
august 2nd in china but no release date
plans have been announced for the global
markets i expect that if it does really
well it will open up well wait and see
personally on paper these look great i
would love to get one there look
fantastic and sleek and very affordable
i mean they're much much cheaper than
the competitors my only concern is
Windows 10 you know what I'm saying
you guys remember from like 15 years ago
when people were making money hand over
fist in the.com bubble
remember we didn't call it a dotnet
bubble or dot org bubble we didn't call
them dot biz billionaires we called them
dot-com billionaires because that's the
power of a.com now why is that because
no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions inject
credibility into your online presence
