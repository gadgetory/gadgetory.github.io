handy the Android authority app guy
frequency is kind of like the mix
between RSS and YouTube and in this
video we're gonna take a closer look at
it okay so here's how frequency works
think of an RSS feed you search for your
favorite websites add them to your RSS
feed and then when you check your feed
you see all of the new stories frequency
is exactly like that except instead of
stories you'll see videos when you open
up the app for the first time you'll see
the sites that you're pre subscribed to
at the top along with the feed view down
below between those two UI elements is
the navigation bar pressing that will
open up a side menu where you can view
your channel top picks trending social
and all of the categories for
discovering more channels the settings
are very simple you select whether or
not you can turn on autoplay sign in to
Facebook Twitter and YouTube or sign out
of your frequency accounts you can use
categories top picks and trending to add
feeds to your own personal channel and
your personal channel will be
ever-present at the top of the app as a
horizontal scroll bar I spent a good 25
minutes adding stuff and there doesn't
seem to be an upper limit to how many
things you can subscribe to it's also
helpful to note that there are a huge
number of categories including text
sports comedy gaming and a bunch of
other stuff overall this is a very
simple application the navigation is
easy to get used to and while the
interface is a busy place there really
isn't all that much to do just pick your
feed find the video and watch it and it
really is that simple ok so how can you
use this if you're one of those people
who likes to watch Internet videos then
this is a great app to kind of congeal
all of your video watching into ones
place
YouTube has subscriptions but only for
YouTube channels frequency is kind of
like that except for it pulls from a lot
more places than just YouTube in short
it's a place where you can find all of
your favorite videos in one spot you
find the channels you like subscribe to
them to add them to your own personal
channel and then you have a list of
videos to watch whenever you open the
application from people and websites
that you enjoy ok so here's what we
liked about frequency it's a very simple
application I reviewed a lot of RSS apps
that liked to be complicated for no good
reason other than to be flashy frequency
is not like that you pick your feeds and
go watch videos and that's it no side
nonsense to worry about it has a lot of
options and it's easy to search the
categories to find what you like it
doesn't matter who you are or what you
like you can probably find it unless
channel is brand-new with like one
subscriber you can pretty much find what
you're looking for
it runs smooth I had no lag problems
whatsoever and everything loaded nice
and quickly videos played smoothly and
without hiccups it was nice while the
interface could use some Android design
line goodness frequency manages to pack
a lot onto one screen from the main
screen you can browse your fees go to
the settings search and watch videos the
menu pops open where you can get to the
rest of the functions so there are
really only two screens on the interface
and that's kind of impressive and here
is the bad some of the app navigation
features could use some tweaking for
instance you can organise the fees at
the top by long-pressing and then moving
it around however if you have a lot of
feeds than moving them around can take a
really long time and it can be pretty
annoying during my testing I had some
trouble signing into YouTube and my
social media feeds never loaded all that
well I don't know if it's API
limitations bugs or if my friends simply
don't post any videos but if I had to
pick the weakest point of this
application it would be social
integration the apps greatest strengths
are also among its greatest weaknesses
you can watch all the videos you want
from all the feeds you want but that's
pretty much all you can do with them you
can share them but you can't comment on
YouTube videos or anything like that
it's not a huge deal but if you'd like
to engage on videos it's something to
keep in mind overall frequency is a very
well-done application the fact that this
app gets it done using essentially a
main screen and a menu is fairly
impressive add to that the sheer number
of options and the ease of use and this
is quite frankly one of the best ways to
organize your internet video watching
available today it does have a couple of
issues but the issues are either
temporary or minor so there really isn't
anyone I wouldn't recommend this to it's
free to use in the Google Play Store and
we'll have that download link in the
written companion which is linked in the
video description below if you want to
try it out once again I'm Joe maybe the
Android authority app guys don't forget
to subscribe to our YouTube channel and

myself or the rest of the video team you

hanging out for a minute we have a
couple of awesome videos for you to
