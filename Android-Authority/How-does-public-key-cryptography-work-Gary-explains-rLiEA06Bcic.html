authority now this is my second video on
encryption I've done the first video
which talked about how encryption
started with the Caesar cipher with
substitute alphabets all the way up to
modern-day encryption using DES and AES
hardware acceleration in ARM chips for
AES and so on and I asked the end of
that video would you like another video
on public key cryptography and the
resounding responsibles yes so here it
is a video on public key cryptography
now the biggest problem with encryption
is you may have very very powerful
encryption method like AES but unless
both parties know the key the password
that you use to encrypt any particular
piece of data it's useless and the
question is how does the other party get
to know the key now if there are two
friends we'll call them Alice and Bob
and they live near each other they can
meet up and they can say is my is my
secret key okay thanks and then they can
exchange messages using that piece of
information that they exchanged but if
one lives in another country maybe on
the other side of the world then getting
that key securely to that person is
difficult because the moment that key is
read by a third party and we'll maybe
Eve and Eve dropper
now if Eve gets hold of that key then
all of those communications between
Alice and Bob become useless no matter
how strong the encryption method is
because the key is known now in the past
governments have used some very very
complicated systems couriers diplomatic
bags you know armored cars to try and
get keys distributed around the
different parts of the government
different organizations that needed
these keys but is there a way that two
strangers who've never met before can
exchange keys and then exchange messages
encrypted using those keys without
anybody knowing what the encryption key
is well thankfully there is so what we
need to look at now is a thing called
the diffie-hellman Merkel key exchange
system now it was discovered by Martin
Hellman he was work
with Whitfield Diffie and Merkel was
later added for recognition for his work
because they were working together as a
team so let's look at it but before we
do that I need to explain one concept
that's the idea of modular arithmetic
sometimes called clock arithmetic now
when you divide two integers and you're
not dealing with any fractions if you
divide two integers you get the number
of times that can be divided and a
remainder so 11/5 for example is 2 2
times 5 is 10 and a remainder of 1 now
it's this remainder that we're
interested in that's the remainder is
what you get from modular arithmetic so
11 modular five-in-one you might call
that 11 mod 5 and sometimes the computer
programs you see the percentage sign
used instead of the word modular so 11
modular 5 is when a wise Eagle Claw cool
because 12 modular 5 is 2 13 modular 5
is 3 14 modular 5 is 415 modular 5 is 0
because 15 could be divided by 3 times
and there's nothing left over and then
16 modular 5 is back to 1 again so we go
round and round and round and you always
go number of digits on the clock is the
number that you modular that you user
bytes of modular 5 now the thing about
modular modular is that you can't go is
what a one-way function you can't go
backwards so we know 11 modular 5 is 1
but also 16 modular 5 is 1 also 22
modular 7 is 1 so having that one
there's no way to go back to where we
came from Neph what's called a one-way
function and one-way function are really
important when it comes to key
distribution now hit those one more
thing to understand in fact there are
two it's a little ever thing I want to
mention that is that the factorization
of large numbers is infeasible
now what do I mean by factorization well
if we take again the number 15 okay and
I ask you what are the prime factors you
can tell me pretty simple it's 3 &amp;amp; 5 3
is a prime number five is a prime number
3 times 5 is 15 that's great
and in fact you could probably do that
in your head for several small numbers
you know 20 49 I mean you could you
could just work it out it's not that
difficult but if I start to give you
bigger numbers then how easy is that to
work out here's one for you for example
yeah what are the prime factors or
of 44 million 120 3267 what are the
prime factors well if I gave you a pen
and paper you might be to start working
out with a calculator it might be a bit
quicker with a computer you could
probably write a program that would
solve it in a few moments however it's
not the maths that's hard it's just
division and trial by error to find you
get the right thing there's no system
for finding you have to just keep trying
different variations in case you're
interested the actual answer is seven
thousand six hundred ninety one
multiplied by five thousand seven
hundred and thirty-seven those are the
prime factors that number that's great
but what happens if I gave you a number
that had two hundred digits in it just
ten two hundred digits how long would
that take you to work out its prime
factors well actually they discovered
they did this is experiment a few years
ago and they're using hundreds of
computers in a network they took two
years to find the prime factors of a two
hundred digit number now when we're
dealing with key distribution we might
be dealing with three hundred digit
numbers or even larger and the whole
basis of public key cryptography and key
distribution is based on the idea that's
really hard to work out which two
numbers multiplied together to give you
a bigger number multiplication that step
is easy and go up to that number but to
go back down again it's another kind of
one-way function is really hard by the
way if you do crack this problem you can
find a quick method or factorizing any
number you'll bring the whole world to
its knees all cryptography will crumble
down into heat okay so we've got two
parties Alice and Bob we've never met
each other and they can't exchange keys
because they're far apart from each
other how do they do it well it starts
by Alice and Bob both picking random
numbers now in this case we're going to
say that Alice picks 10 and Bob picks 2
now they've both previously agreed on a
one-way function which is y to the power
of X mod P and we're going to say that Y
is 7 that something is established
beforehand it can be publicly known by
anybody and we're gonna say that P is 13
that's also established beforehand and
note that their prime numbers is all
we're dealing with prime numbers here so
a lot of these numbers are going to be
prime and I'm using small prime numbers
but obviously in a real world situation
you may use
big prime numbers with like lots and
lots of digits hundreds 200 300 400
digit numbers so Alice plugs her random
number into the former and therefore
gets 7 to the power of 10 mod 13 which
gives us 4 and Bob does the same he goes
7 ^ 2 2 is his random number mod 13 and
that gives him 10 so Alice has 4 Bob has
10 now this point Alice sends the 4 to
Bob and Bob sends the 10 to Alice now if
a third person is listening to that
exchange it doesn't matter because all
they see is a numbers 4 and 10 and they
don't know the random numbers that they
have picked now he comes a magic if but
Alice uses Bob's 10 as why and keeps X
as 10 that was around the number she
picked then she gets 10 to the power of
10 mod 13 and that's equal to 3 now Bob
that exactly the same thing he will use
the 4 from Alice use his matter random
number which gives him 4 to the power of
2 mod 13 which is also equal to 3 now
Bob and Alice both have the number 3 and
all the eve was able to see was the
number 4 and the number 10 going past
she doesn't know the random number
picked by Alice she doesn't know the
random number picked by Bob and yet now
after applying this they both have the
number 3 and that number can be used for
a key to encrypt a message clip between
each other
now obviously they said you would use
bigger numbers and that you wouldn't
just use 3 you'd use much bigger and now
here's an example I was going to flash
up on the screen for a moment that shows
you the bigger number you also find it
over the anger Authority website here we
go now you want to pause the video hall
to look at that more go tendril sorta
calm website to find out the math behind
a bigger number ok so now we have a
system where two complete strangers can
exchange messages exchanged keys having
never met before well done Martin
Hellman
well done diffie-hellman and Merkel now
while Whitfield Diffie was looking at
this stuff with Martin Hellman about
modular Sun to the powers and come out
with this key exchange system he'll also
come up with the idea of something
called an asymmetric cipher now at the
moment all crypto we've discussed is
symmetric you take some data you encrypt
it using
with them using a key a password then to
decrypt it use exactly the same
algorithm maybe in Reverse and you use
the same key and you get the data
there's a symmetry down the middle
encode and decode but Hellman came a
diffi story came up with the idea that
what happens if we could have one
function and password for encrypting
something and then a different function
and a different password for decrypting
it so no longer symmetry here it's a
symmetrical one thing for encrypting and
a different thing for decrypting and so
in having that idea he came up with the
idea of public key cryptography because
the part to encrypt it can be publicly
public for anybody hey here's my key if
you want to send me a message encrypt it
using this password I don't care if
everybody knows it you should all know
it because no one can decrypt it unless
they have the second half which is a
different process and a different
password public key cryptography and
that's what we use today on the Internet
HTTP I'll talk about that in a minute is
all public key cryptography now that's
what he invented he published a paper in
the mid 70s but he didn't know how to do
it so he liked the idea brilliant idea
they didn't know how to do it now it
actually fell to others to come up with
a mathematics for a system that would
work as Diffie explained it and there
were three people working together there
was Rivest Shamir and Adleman r s a when
you put their initials together who came
up with this idea of a practical way of
implementing whitfield diffie idea and
RSA is something it's companies it
states the system we use today and it's
very very powerful and I'm now going to
try and explain it to you
keep your hat on it's a bit complicated
but let's see whether we can work to
work through an example see how this
works ok we start off by Alice picks two
prime numbers and we're gonna call them
P and Q and again we're going to use
small prime numbers let's use 17 and 19
ok and now the product of these P times
Q 17 times 19 is 323 now remember
323 means is more difficult now to work
out the factors of the
okay this was a 200 digit number it'd be
really difficult okay so the idea of
using the product of these two numbers
is it's difficult to go backwards
towards the two numbers you multiplied
together to get the final product
now we'll call this n okay so two
hundred three hundred and twenty-three
is M now we choose another prime number
that's publicly known it's called E and
waiting for it seven everybody agrees on
it is part of the system so seven is e
now Alice publishes n 323 hey everybody
here's my public key information 323 use
it if you want to now Bob wants to send
a message to Alice now I'm going to say
he wants to send the word hello we'll
start with the letter H H in ASCII has a
value of 72 so we're going to try and
send the number 72 to Alice and the way
Bob does that is he takes the 72 he
raises it to the power of seven which is
the number a that we chose and he
performs modular arithmetic on it using
Alice's public key so 323 so 72 to the
power of seven mod 323 is 13 now Bob
sends Alice that 13 now if someone else
sees that number going across the 13
going from after Bob they can't use that
to recreate bulbs messages it's
impossible now when Alice gets that
number she needs to plug it into her own
formula a special formula that uses P
and Q now to do that she needs to
calculate another number called D okay
and in such a way that 7 which is our
number e 7 times D mod P minus 1 times Q
minus 1 is 1 now way to work that out we
have to use you cleared we have to use
some algorithms but in this particular
case we'll see here that D is 247 now
the point is you can only make this
calculation if you know P and Q now
Alice published the product of pain cube
she never published P and Q so she can
now use this special information she has
which is the factors of that number to
decrypt the message she now plugs it
into her own formula which goes like
this
you take the ciphertext you raise it to
the power
d which is 247 and you perform the
modular arithmetic on it of 323 so 13
the number Bob said ^ 247 mod 323 is 72
which is the ASCII for the letter H so
now Bob and Alice have exchanged
messages it was encrypted one way and it
was decrypted another way and anybody
intercepting it in between cannot guess
P and Q and they cannot guess the
message that Bob sent so that is public
key cryptography now if you go to the
angel tourists comm website there is the
whole article that goes with this video
and I go through all those steps there
again so you can really watch and follow
it through to see how that worked out
now today we use HTTP HTTP hypertext
Transfer Protocol the S at the end means
secure and that's what we use to connect
to web servers when we don't know the
web server we don't know they don't know
us we don't know that we need to
exchange keys we defined a way of
getting some information encrypted
information and what we use today is RSA
we also use the different held member
call key exchange programs or depending
on how it's done now basically HTTP uses
used to be called SSL that got
transplant superseded applaud on by a
TLS but TLS was based itself on it and
also you find times people to omit SSL
TLS they're kind of interchangeable
basically it's a protocol that says hey
web server how are you I'm great can you
give me your public key yes here it is
can I trust you I you say who we are yes
I am good well let me say encrypt a
message to you and that's basically this
protocol defines that how those two
computers talk but basically it's just
using RSA or diffie-hellman local key
exchange and that's how it works today
and the whole thing is that today they
use 248 bit or 496 bit public keys and
the certificate basically from an
authority that says you can trust this
computer it really years eBay it really
is Amazon it really is PayPal you can
connect and vote and I sign this to say
those are really them and that's where
we are today public key cryptography
