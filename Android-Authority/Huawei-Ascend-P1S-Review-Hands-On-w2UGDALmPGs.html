at the pep calm exclusive a digital
experience event my name is Darcy
lacunae we're looking at two stunning
android phones here from Hawaii flying I
can never really pronounce it correctly
my apologies anyway 960 x 540 resolution
what we're looking at here in this
particular instance this is the p1s what
makes this special is that this is the
slimmest smartphone ever created how
slim is it you might ask well we're
looking at six point six eight
millimeters thin it makes my galaxy s2
well I'm not going to say it's not very
polite but it makes them look a lot
heavier but the quality of construction
is really excellent no flex at all it's
got a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core like I
said before it is a qHD resolution
AMOLED display is going to be identical
to the same one found on the droid razr
really really vibrant colors smooth
performance they've assured us that this
will be getting ICS there is no release
date yet other than that one gig of ram
is got an eight megapixel camera on the
back with an LED flash and autofocus it
feels like a polycarbonate body like I
said it's really solid in the hand no
dedicated camera button to speak up it's
got a little bit of a but at the end to
it also is an LTE device
DLNA everything you know dual
microphones about MHL it seems like a
really quality device we really can't
wait for you guys to check this out
anyway this is the Hawaii p1 s just the
slimmest Android phone in the world
thanks for checking out our YouTube
video guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
