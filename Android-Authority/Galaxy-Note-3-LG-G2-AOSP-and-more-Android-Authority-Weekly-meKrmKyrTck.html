brought to you by Linda calm try
lynda.com free for seven days by
visiting lynda.com / android this week
we found out more about the impending
release of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and
also the Moto X a new Nexus 10 was
somewhat teased and unfortunately and
sadly one of the heroes of open
development has decided to leave hey
Josh of a guard from Android thority
what's going on everybody and it's time
for another dose of the week's top
Android news it's android authority
weekly as was expected last week the
Android device manager was recently
released giving users a Google official
way of locating ringing and erasing a
lost or stolen device the great news for
a DM is that the rollout seems to be
happening across the globe so it's not
just restricted to the US check your
security settings and you should see
Android device manager in the device
administrators either now or soon the
web interface is also live and you can
find it at google.com / android / device
manager if you do have and have started
using the new ADM let us know what you
think of it in the comments below the
long-awaited update to the Galaxy Note
line looks to be a part of the next
Samsung unpacked event Samsung began to
send out invites to unpacked part 2
which will be held in Berlin ahead of
the ephah conference it will be streamed
online for everyone who isn't able to
attend and of course we'll have all of
the coverage of the announcement here on
android authority speaking of releases
we got a pretty big one this week the LG
g2 was officially unveiled and it is
quite the incredible device make sure
you check out Chris's coverage of the
event which he attended with his hands
on and also his first impressions but
here is the gist a powerful Snapdragon
800 processor powers the g2 backed by
the updated Audrina 330 the screen is
actually five point two inches and this
was made possible by moving the button
layout to the back thus opening up the
bezel space yes the volume rockers and
power button are now found on the top
back portion of the device making those
buttons accessible via your index finger
even if it does look radically different
Chris and plenty of other people out
there have stated that it's actually not
all that bad also included is a new
feature called graphic RAM which reduces
the displays power consumption one on a
static image it will be available soon
on major carriers including AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon stay tuned for our full review
when we get our own copy of the g2 also
kind of a little funny thing that I
figured out earlier today even though
the new flagship by LG doesn't bear the
optimist name we can still look back to
the first iteration of this phone and
call it the og get it LG optimus g LG OG
because it is and from there we move on
to some key lime pie apparently there is
a certain build of this new version of
the android operating system that
already works on some current devices
well this past week we did start finding
k builds of android popping up and they
were being run or at least tested on
nexus for phones and Nexus 7 tablets
this could very likely mean that Google
is in the process of testing the next
iteration of Android it's an interesting
prospect and if it's true Android could
be getting a major refresh sooner than
later so there's no doubt that the Moto
X clogged up the airwaves for the better
part of say the last two months but
finally last week it got officially
unveiled people are still somewhat
reeling from the unveiling of modos new
flagship but at least this past week we
finally got some real release info
reports from ad age claim that the
definite release date is going to be
august twenty-third and it's going to
happen on all four major US carriers
that would be AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile Sprint and
Verizon while this has yet to be
completely confirmed it is nice to see a
simultaneous release across all major
networks unfortunately however the moto
maker app made for customizing your
future Moto X will remain an AT&amp;amp;T
exclusive for at least a little while if
you are on any of the other three
carriers you may just have to settle for
a predetermined build now you may not
have been one of the many people out
there who lamented the mid-range
somewhat specs of the Moto X but you
must have certainly heard all of the
babble either you thought that the 720p
display or the s4 pro was a big miss
remoto or you understood that maybe it
had to do more with the user experience
rather than what
to be on paper well Motorola SVP of
product development Iqbal Arshad wanted
to throw some gas on the flame not just
by addressing the naysayers but by
directly comparing the Moto X to top
current devices for one thing he defends
the processing package as one that
focuses on utility rather than just an
arbitrarily raw number of course but
then he goes on to state that the new
features on the samsung galaxy s4 didn't
really make it smart at all quote I mean
what do you do with the galaxy s4 that
you can't do what the galaxy s3 the
answer is nothing while most of you
won't know for sure if the Moto X is
better than other phones in the market
today until you actually get to
physically compare them there's one
thing we definitely know for sure the
competition is heating up while you
shield yourself from the crossfire
distract yourself with this juicy bit of
rumor from Taylor Wimberly apparently
Motorola will be developing a Nexus
device that is set for release by the
end of the year and no it's not a google
play edition of the Moto X though very
vague speculation now points to Motorola
as the next developer of a nexus phone a
motorola nexus interesting and now i
move on to some sad news one of the
champions of AOSP perhaps one of its
most important has decided to step down
jean-baptiste guru technical lead for
the AOSP at Google has left and while he
probably isn't gone from google
completely his departure seems to
involve more than meets the eye j BQ has
stated that his leaving has to do with
the decreasing openness of the open
software he so passionately supports and
unfortunately one of the main culprits
behind this recent trend is qualcomm
though a generally quiet entity holcomb
has kept their property pretty close to
the chest making it tough on the AOSP
community to make headway on nexus
devices since then a petition to
Qualcomm to release all drivers binaries
and the like to AOSP has been created
the people won't Qualcomm to play ball
and have come together to try to make
that happen j BQ disagrees with this
tactic however because primarily it does
add burden to those people in the system
who are already trying to find a salute
if you wish to see or sign the petition
we will provide a link in the
description below however also voice
your opinion about this ongoing saga in
the comments below we end on a hopeful
note a hope for the next Nexus 10 when
the second-generation Nexus 7 was
finally unveiled a journalist at the
Wall Street Journal spoke too soon DARPA
chai about the nexus 10 and was
supposedly told that samsung would
develop it in time for the holidays well
that was about hopefully half right
turns out sundar never actually said it
was going to be Samsung and several
sources have dug deep to find that the
next 10 inch tablet by Google will
actually probably be developed by asus
since the original Nexus 10 was released
around mid november of last year no
matter if it's ASIS or Samsung or
somebody else it should be nearing the
final stages of development well we'll
let you know what we find out when we
get more information on the new Nexus 10
but rest assured in the coming weeks we
should be seeing a lot more rumors
speculations and more leaks and as
always you can find a written companion
