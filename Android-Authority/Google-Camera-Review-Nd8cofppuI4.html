handy the Android authority app guide so
Google released Google camera to the
Google Play Store today and we're going
to check it out
right now okay so this is a camera app
which means it does camera app things
like taking videos and pictures the
camera app comes with five modes
including panorama mode photosphere mode
regular camera mode regular video mode
and a new thing called lens flare mode
the regular video and camera modes are
pretty much self-explanatory panorama
and photosphere mode are a little wonky
to use but once you get used to it you
can take some really good photos with
them
it works by starting out with a single
image and then you must follow the dots
to create a complete panorama or
photosphere depending on whether or not
you have high quality or low quality
enabled in the settings it can take a
minute or two to process everything but
the photos usually come out looking
really good lens blur mode allows you to
take a picture that keeps the subject of
your photo in focus while making the
background blurry this is a popular
depth of field effect that is enjoyed
predominantly by people who have DSLR
cameras if the blur is too much or too
little you can adjust the level of blur
after the photo is taken and that's
really it folks there is a settings menu
where you can adjust various resolutions
and quality settings I wasn't able to
find any options to change the storage
location if you were wondering about
that but essentially this is Google
camera for a camera application it's
fairly well designed you can change your
camera mode at any point by sliding to
the right from anywhere and the modes
will slide out from the left side if you
want to view any photos you've taken you
simply slide your finger to the left and
it'll open the most recently taken photo
it's worth noting that this doesn't come
with a gallery application so you'll
need to supply your own or go get google
photos if you want the complete Google
experience the settings are set up in a
way that is easy to understand they seem
a little bare-bones but you can adjust
the front and rear facing camera
resolution turn location on and off and
turn on manual exposure if you need it
there are other fun little design
choices when you zoom in and out using
pinch to zoom you see two little bars
that will show you how sumed in the
camera is at the bottom are some quick
setting icons for flash exposure
changing from front facing to rear
facing cameras and an icon to add a
three by three grid panorama mode lens
blur mode and photosphere mode are
really fun and easy to use the camera
guides you to taking some really good
photos and although rendering and
processing can take a while the results
usually look quite nice the interface is
really
simple and easy-to-use you're never more
than a swipe or click away from pretty
much anything inside of the application
switching modes is as simple as sliding
the options out and clicking on them the
quick settings accessing the gallery and
pretty much everything is right there
just off screen for easy access it does
what it says it does all of the features
worked as intended I personally didn't
experience any crashes or issues once
you learn how the various modes work
there shouldn't be any problems using
them
finally there are little design things
that are just fun the dual line zoom
meter bar thing is fun to use and when
you're in video mode it'll try to get
you to shoot in landscape mode by using
a spinning icon to prevent you from
shooting in portrait mode you can still
shoot in portrait mode but let's face it
no one likes it when people shoot in
portrait mode and it appears as though
Google is trying to remind people of
that and here's what we didn't like so
much its simplicity is its greatest
strengths but it's also its greatest
weakness if you're used to having more
complicated settings of other camera
applications then this is going to feel
a bit lacking for some people you can
adjust ISO white balance there are no
filters and there are no features like
image stabilisation it's really a pretty
basic application some people have
already begun experiencing some bug's
there isn't a single bug that's
affecting everyone but little things
that are affecting a number of people
one such experience that I've heard a
few times is the app crashing when
trying to use lens blur mode I haven't
had any of these issues myself but
apparently they do exist depending on
your device and version of Kit Kat the
last problem I want to talk about is the
lack of options when it comes to storage
if you have a device that has an
external SD card like I do you cannot
use it for storage in fact you can't
change the storage location at all this
is likely because of the Kit Kat SD card
limitation problem that a lot of people
don't like so I hope your internal
memory card has enough space because
that is where your photos are going to
go over all this is a solid camera
application it brings a lot of those
nifty Google camera only features like
photosphere to devices that don't
normally have that feature available the
design is breathtakingly fresh and
enjoyable and nothing about Google
camera is difficult to use the only
issue seems to be a few bugs that people
are experiencing that said I do hope
more features get integrated eventually
because it is very simple but almost a
little too simple
Ronna may do from Ars Technica did an
app teardown and Found code hinting to
an advanced settings feature that I
totally hope becomes a reality and a
time-lapse feature that also sounds
fairly cool here's hoping those get
introduced in future updates until then
Google camera is a great application as
long as you keep things in perspective
it doesn't give you the level of control
of other applications but you really get
that vibe that it's not supposed to if
you're looking for something a little
different in a camera application it's
definitely worth downloading this one to
give it a shot
