authority coming to you live from mobile
Congress 2016 and we're taking a look at
one of HTC's latest additions to the
desire lineup this is the desire 5:30
it's a mid-range budget smartphone with
a body enclosed in a polycarbonate or
plastic shell and has the same design as
previous Desire phones with the slightly
rounded corners and sides and the
signature dual front facing speaker
grills on the top and bottom of the
display HTC is also making these new
desire phones a little bit more unique
than usual with a bunch of paint
speckles on the backside that HTC likes
to call micro splash and the cool thing
is that this isn't some sort of preset
pattern so each and every desire will
look different from one to the next you
can also customize these phones further
with colorful lanyard loops and snap-on
cases that have the same micro splash
effect added to them as far as the rest
of the specs go there's a 5 inch 720p
display in the front a Snapdragon 210
processor 1.5 gigs of ram 16 gigs of
internal storage with support for
microSD card expansion an 8 megapixel
camera on the rear and a 2200 milliamp
hour battery inside if you need a little
bit more you can opt for the desire 630
which is for the most part the same
phone with just a few differences
it'll ship with a slightly more powerful
chipset with a Snapdragon 400 2 gigs of
RAM a 13 megapixel rear camera a 5
megapixel front camera and support for
high res audio and boomsound speakers
obviously these aren't the most powerful
specs in the world but this phone is
designed for people who aren't overly
concerned about specs and just need a
phone that can do what they needed to do
the software is Android 6.0 marshmallow
with the standard HTC Sense UI on top
and it'll be a pretty familiar
experience for anyone who has used an
HTC device within recent history all the
features that you would expect from
Sense are here like the vertical
scrolling app drawer blinkfeed widgets
and just the overall clean experience a
sense typically brings to the table
availability will be starting in the
month of March and while pricing is
still to be announced they should be
extremely affordable if you want to know
