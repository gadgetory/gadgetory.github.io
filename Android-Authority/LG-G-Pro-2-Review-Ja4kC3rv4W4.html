their own large device offering quite
literally blowing up everything that
made the original Optimus G great this
year their follow up hopes to continue
the momentum this time piggybacking on
the design and success of the g2 but is
it more than just a much larger version
of their other flagship phone well this
is what we're going to find out because
it's Josh magar from Android 30 what's
going on everybody and this is the LG G
pro 2 when it comes to design whereas
Mini is a pretty self-explanatory term
LG takes pro to mean a much larger
offering of an already established
device and that's pretty much what you
get here with maybe a few changes the
black slave front is not interrupted by
any buttons and neither are the sides
and this is because of the signature LG
g2 button layout that returns here and
makes for a very sleek and thin device
the power and volume rockers are quite
large on the back matching the overall
size of the device and have a short but
very meaty press to them the headphone
jack is up top while the microUSB
charging port is found on the bottom
what is most striking about the design
of the G pro 2 is its back material
though and the fact that it is removable
this time instead of the fingerprint
prone glossy plastic of the g2 we get a
mesh like textured plastic that
alleviates that very problem it does
actually look very nice now removing the
back cover of the LG g2 gives you access
to the removable battery and the micro
SD card slot along with the SIM tray but
when it comes to the actual material
itself there is just one big gripe that
I have with it yes it does keep you from
having finger print prom material on
here but this Matador mesh a texture
plastic on the back is quite slippery
you'll find that the phone is easy to
slip around in your hand and you have to
get quite a good grip on it but getting
a grip on the phone this large is
probably what is most difficult about
its size after all that large 5.9 inch
screen on the G pro 2 is perhaps its
most polarizing feature while plenty of
people out there love the larger screen
sizes it is simply just a boon to anyone
who requires easy as easy a handling
experience as possible
something that the G pro 2 simply does
not provide
but as is the case usually if you do
come for the screen size you'll probably
stay for its quality LG continues to
prove its display prowess with a 1080p
resolution 5.9 inch screen with 373
pixels per inch there is no problem
reading just about anything on this
display and all media looks just plain
lovely even the colorful default optimus
UI shines through this IPS screen that
thus also does quite well in direct
sunlight and of course a very
respectable bezel around the screen
continues the tradition started by the
LG g2 screen and thus you'll have a
great time here no matter what you throw
at it and despite its size making it
rather difficult to handle at certain
times now while I will save right off
the bat that there were no problems with
performance on the G pro 2 the one part
worth mentioning about this processing
package is the fact that it might get
outdated rather quickly in the coming
months the Snapdragon 800 clocked in at
2.2 gigahertz is backed by the adrenal
330 which is then also bolstered by 3
gigabytes of RAM which does do well to
handle the multitask
now here the point is that the
processing package is the very same as
the one found on the original g2 and
you're sure to be eclipsed within the
next number of months by already updated
versions of this already powerful
processing package though powerful it is
as there really are no hiccups and while
getting through the elements of the
Optimus UI and most multitasking really
don't have any stutters any ones that
you might run into are likely due to the
feature-packed user interface and it
also is plagued by the same problems
that perhaps TouchWiz is as it is the
main comparison in hardware Pro also
seems to mean that everything you might
not get in the original comes here as
well after all not only do you get that
extra gigabyte of RAM the 16 or 32
gigabytes of on-board storage are
expanded by a micro SD card slot found
underneath that back cover
you also get every form of connection
here with Bluetooth NFC and in this
Korean version of the phone there is an
antenna for watching Korean broadcast
television now the speaker on the back
of the phone which is located right here
actually does really well in terms of
its loudness in terms of the quality
however you have very nice highs and
only very decent mids and lows making
this speaker actually somewhat
above-average over other smart
ah freaks the call quality was about as
good as it should be with no real
problems on either end but what could be
mentioned as we just talked about the
speaker on the back is that when you use
it for calls it actually is quite nice
now what the proper frugal usage it is
possible to eke out a solid day or a day
and a half worth of usage especially
what the power saving features turned on
standby time is also really great as you
can leave the phone unplugged and in
standby all night without losing more
than maybe 10% but when you get into the
territory of let's say power users you
really do find that the phone really
does drain its battery quite quickly one
particular instance saw me waking up at
10 a.m. unplugging the phone and then
going out with a bunch of friends who
played around with the camera quite a
bit I will admit but then after that I
use the phone for looking up directions
a little bit of music and some Google
searches but at 10 a.m. being the start
it was really disappointing to see this
phone conk out at 5 p.m. that's only
about 7 hours worth of usage and even if
it was a pretty heavy it still should
have lasted longer than that other days
were about the same I would get close to
single digit percentages by bedtime
which is something you don't often
expect to happen on a big device so you
usually get the promise of long battery
life with bigger phones but
unfortunately with the G pro 2 it's just
a rather inconsistent performer now what
might be the best enhancement in the g
pro 2 is the updated camera which is a
13 megapixel shooter with software
optimized optical image stabilization
now called oh is plus the LG g2 camera
was higher in the list of last year's
Android cameras and much of what you
might remember of it returns here the
app is quite feature-packed and even
includes its own version of the focus
selection in your pictures now what did
play the g2 was unfortunately slow
focusing speed which also does return
here when you tap an area to focus it
runs for at least a second or two until
finally finding its spot after that
though you can snap as much as you want
as the shudder runs pretty quickly
optical stabilization also helps with
the video recording which does include
UHD 4k recording I already have pretty
steady hands but having added
stabilization is definitely welcome as
you can see here now we were already
impressed with the picture quality back
in Barcelona
or MWC and that continues here details
are very well captured through this
camera and the level of sharpness was
quite impressive and once you are able
to get the focus right you are able to
get pretty consistently good quality
pictures from the G Pro to stay tuned
for a full feature focus video regarding
the camera and you'll see even more
examples then of just how good this
camera can be and finally when it comes
to software there's a good chance that
you know what to expect here if you've
been an LG user before the Optimus UI
returns here with it's in your face
tendencies as many of the different
features take up quite a bit of space
all around colorful icons and wallpapers
are on a pretty monochromatic backdrop
but you get a glimpse at everything the
Optimus UI is capable of in the
notification drop-down everything from
the small qslide apps to the q' memo and
all the different features in the power
widget are right there in your face in
this version of LG's flagship however
there are some key enhancements and we
already covered one at length in the
future focus video the NOC code which is
an enhanced version of the knock-on
feature that allows you to turn on and
unlock the phone easily using a set
pattern of tabs that are put onto the
turned off screen and as far as
multitasking goes this large screen
allows for nice dual window capabilities
on top of the LG created slider side
feature ultimately the Optimus UI is
definitely one of the most full-featured
user interfaces available and a lot of
the features may or may not be your back
but as long as you are able to find a
few that are very useful for you like
the NOC code you'll find that the
features in the Optimus you I really do
set this phone apart now finally when it
comes to price we don't really have a
clear handle on what the final price
point will be and we want to be
surprised that the G pro 2 comes in at a
very high price tag though somewhere
near the $700 range at launch and so
there you have it the LG G pro 2 well
this is definitely an upgrade from the
original Optimus G pro we do kind of
question how much of it is that much
better than the original g2 it does
sport a bigger screen and arguably
better material choice on the back and
an enhanced camera experience with óas
plus however the enhancements point into
the software experience like the NOC
code are actually set to come to the g2
anyway in the coming
months so especially considering that
the g2 has the exact same processing
package as this newer offering it really
is up to whether or not you used the g2
and you pretty much just wished it was
bigger so keep it into Android authority

our coverage of the LG G pro 2 including
the future focus video regarding the
camera so until then make sure you give
