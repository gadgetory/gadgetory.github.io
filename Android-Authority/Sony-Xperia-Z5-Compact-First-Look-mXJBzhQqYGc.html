for guard from Android Authority what's
going on everybody and here's your first
look at the Sony Xperia z5 compact now
one thing we really love about Sony is
the fact that they don't really shy away
from the smaller size market the z5
compact is going to have many of the
same specifications as the originals z5
ware has plenty of other companies tend
to take their flagships and really throw
mid-range all over the place just so you
can get a smaller easier to handle
display in this case you have four point
six inches in the IPS display and yes it
does come in at 720p resolution but for
a smaller display here it does still
provide great viewing and great
experience but it's what's underneath
that really counts because the
Snapdragon 810 is still what powers this
device backed by the Audrina 430 and
this time two gigabytes of RAM but still
you have under the flap on the side
there
despite 32 gigabytes of on-board storage
you have microSD expansion so even this
small phone will provide more than what
many of the much larger flagships do in
the other companies now the whole phone
itself in the design is still very
symmetrical but it feels it's probably
the easiest phone that we've had to
handle an entire event so far and it's
really just sort of easy to grip and
even cover up with your entire hand but
that's the whole point of the z5 compact
now that being said however the whole
device is still IP 65 and IP 68
certified so that you have water dust
resistance on here and a twenty seven
hundred million of our battery will be
able to power this for quite a long time
2,700 milliamp hours for a smaller 720p
display should be able to make this one
last for quite a while especially when
you factor in all of the different power
consumption options that they have built
in now the cameras as we mentioned in
our z5 first look or what we really want
to put through their paces because the
new Sony Exmor RS 23 megapixel rear
facing camera is sort of reimagined at a
f 2.0 aperture should be able to provide
some pretty good low-light shots
especially when you factor in their new
steady shot stabilization but the thing
about these cameras is that they're kind
of the first new cameras to come out on
the Xperia line in quite a while and
because Sony was really
their alpha line in their camera lineup
we really hope that they've been able to
take some of the great quality from
there and finally put it into their
experience because the Experian needs to
keep up with the great smartphone camera
quality that we've seen from other
companies thus far really the one thing
you can't get past when it comes to z5
compact is just how nimble how small it
is and at 138 grams it's going to be one
of the lightest and easiest phones to
handle so keep it in two and row 34 even
more about the z5 compact and the Xperia
line in general as we bring you our
coverage from Aoife here at the Sony
booth FIFA 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
