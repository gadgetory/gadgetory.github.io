today I've got a video comparison for
you between the Samsung Galaxy s3 and
the iPhone 4s first thing to note of
course is the screen size this is a four
point nine inch screen one to 80 pixels
down by 720 across a very high
definition screen
similarly High Definition you've got a
3.5 inch screen on the iPhone 960 by 640
that's how they feel in the hand the
iPhone doesn't feel quite as nice as the
galaxy s3 it's heavier and it's got sort
of rough edge feel caused by the antenna
the s3 is much more wears machine far
better and feels soft smooth ER and most
of the whole in handy the cameras both
have an 8 megapixel rear camera they
take photos of roughly the same quality
and the front-facing camera on the s3
that is 1.9 megapixels whereas you're
stuck with VGA on the iPhone 4s which of
course isn't as good sound quality both
then produce roughly the same sound
quality I'll say the Samsung is slightly
more clear or has more clarity to it
overall not much in it to be honest the
process is of course sentence remarked
upon this is a dual-core a4 chip and
running iOS 5.1 I believe and you've got
Android for running on the s3 across a
quad core Exynos chip which is clocked
at 1.4 Gertz this has 512 megabytes of
RAM this has 1 gigabyte of RAM to be
honest it's not really a fair comparison
to use the iPhone 4s it's a year old now
it's becoming by the technology in the
market standard dated phone better
comparison for such devices would be
when later this year hopefully Apple
they're going to release another phone
hopefully an upgraded version the iPhone
which would be a fairer contender for a
better fight between the iPhone and the
Samsung Galaxy s3 that's all from me
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
