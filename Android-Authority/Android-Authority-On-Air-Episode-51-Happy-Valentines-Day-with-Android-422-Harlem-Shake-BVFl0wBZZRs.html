hi I'm dare cross and welcome to android
authority on air the original android
hangout show on google+ i'm also joined
with scott anderson king of the Harlem
shake Joshua Vergara and Johnathan
Franklin and Dan Charlton thank you guys
for showing up this week on uh Harlem
shake a new meme making its way around
the interwebs the past week or so what
is that isn't it that thing we just did
oh I thought we just regularly dress up
like um yeah so you know Google did one
Facebook did one intel i guess i didn't
see that of other companies are doing it
you know everybody's doing it's all over
the news first of all if you guys are
watching or listening to this on
soundcloud uh head over to youtube no
check it out right us yeah if you want
to see Scott Anderson in Valentine's Day
red boxers in nothin all the way it was
in the feedback you guys put it in the
feedback I appreciate it yeah so head on
over to uh youtube if you want to see
Scott dressed like that alright so this
week in the world of android version 4.2
point to start to roll out to nexus
devices um we had some significant app
updates just going to talk about a
couple big ones here that they are
popular apps and big changes coming to
them some more rumors because now that's
the time of year it is you know new
phones coming now have rumors about new
devices and a little bit of a routing
and ramen news just because well we like
to talk about rude and ramen so they
said android 4.2 point2 began rolling
out this week to nexus devices such as
the
oxy nexus the nexus 7 Wi-Fi and 3g Nexus
10 and Nexus 4's daughter going up to
which one first started to roll out to
the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 and gsm Galaxy
Nexus first Nexus actually uh was about
two days later yeah I wonder what
everybody has now had as the updates
roll out to them except for the
redheaded stepchild except for the
bastards of the group the Sprint and
Verizon Galaxy Nexus the sprint version
is now one update behind because it
recently got four point two point one
but the real bastard of the group the
verizon galaxy nexus is now for updates
behind official it's on 4.1 it's still
14 point 1.1 it never got four point one
point to it never got four point two
four point two point one in the noon
yeah it's a I mean bad for a Nexus
device for devices but I mean for
updates behind it's only halfway a Nexus
device well that's debatable you know it
it I called a Nexus device but I'm
getting hard to fight for it you know
yeah so dan I can't if that's not a
reason to start rooting and flashing
your Galaxy Nexus I don't know what is
yeah yes jellybean came up at Google i/o
last year what month was this I mean
we're gonna be you know yeah yeah yeah
sorry yes summer of last year yeah last
summer almost here a little lesson year
ago so android 4.2 point2 we don't have
an official changelog but we have some
on official changes that people from the
android community and around the web
have been picking up on and noticing as
well as us you know using an hour
devices is well on a big one that they
changing the play store is battery life
yeah but you know what that's not only a
change I mean ok now just it kind of is
it's an upgrade for the battery life
it's not battery life before said you
could get 10 hours of ereading eight
hours of HD video so now they just
change the same up to 10 hours no no
it's not a change they just didn't list
you can get eight hours if you do this
you can get night out do this you get
ten have to do this they just made it
simpler and easier because that's the
competition does it's not changed I
don't think we need to talk about it
that is my opinion yeah I completely
agree plus it's always gotten that good
of battery life this isn't anything you
were special about it it's just as good
as it's always bad dan every change form
I have interesting for those of you
listening dan is a white screen of his
name right now pretty interesting piece
no I want dragon yes you better
transform back pretty soon I um so what
we got up with community Anna unvieled
unveiled stuff well so we have actually
toggles via quick settings you know
before when 4.2 first came out
everyone's like yeah these are awesome
we don't need to to route to get our
quick toggles and then you're like oh
they're not they're just they really are
what they're called they're just quick
settings there a quick access to
settings and take the exact same amount
of taps to disable Wi-Fi disable
bluetooth so they really r they weren't
in my opinion what i wanted that while
it was cool but it still took the exact
same amount taps to turn stuff off now
with four point two point two you can
long press bluetooth and Wi-Fi to
disable them or enable them so they are
true toggles now so that's nice i I like
that i'm a big fan of things that save
me time and I'm you know that's that's
good I think you better if they reversed
it though if you tap it to an able to
discipline then long press to go into
the menu but what everybody's nose like
cyanogen all the other wrong yeah I
agree very I agree
um a DB got a little more secure so
those of you that are in the routing and
ramen it's cool if you're not then this
really doesn't apply to you that much
but you'll be happy to know that if you
were to lose your device this makes it
harder for somebody to use adb hackery
to steal your data so uh real quick non
too technical term what it does is it it
uses your computer's like fingerprint
whether it's called an RSA key today and
it saves that to a whitelist the first
time that computer connects to your
Nexus device so you want to let's say
you hook your nexus 7 up to adb it's
going to pop up the windows and hey are
you sure you want to allow this computer
with this key to connect and you're
saying why yes yes i do and then you're
good to go now if your device doesn't
have a passcode on it or a lock screen
you know protection one way or another
then that doesn't matter because person
that steals your phone is going to hit
yes I do allow a TV access so if you
have the lock protection on your device
then they won't be able to hit yes allow
this connection and they won't be able
to get into your device through adb and
do all sorts of fun stuff so once again
lock your device is the only as good as
your weakest security point so but you
know if you want to have the ease of a
key unlocking your device know that it's
kind of a trade-off of security that I
mom 14 lock in your device you know we
have so much personal information on
these things that it might take an extra
two seconds to get into your device but
I think those 10 seconds out of your day
you know is well worth it in my pan um
hey dance videos working you gotta fix
good job oh my god turn it off so so new
gallery loading animation so that it
makes the galleria load a little bit
faster in android 4.2 point2 who doesn't
like an app that loads faster when
you're going to look your pictures good
deal that's nice when you're downloading
malt
apps let's say from the google play
store you'll you'll now see a progress
bar indicating the time remaining with a
percentage is it um yeah it just kind of
helps you hey if you got 10 apps queued
up you'll be able to say oh well it's
gonna take another minute and then five
seconds it's three percent done you know
whatever so yeah you know but
notifications is cool i like that change
um one of the bigger fixes was the
Bluetooth right yeah so previously when
4.2 came out a lot of people's at all my
audio Bluetooth it's skipping a tip
hiccuping yada yada yada it's bad so
they fixed that I tested out myself or
my next 7 I didn't have any hiccups and
he skips and ink streaming audio to my
little bluetooth speaker here I got from
my buddy Randy Kelly down the big
Android BBQ it's the only bluetooth
speaker i had the test and I tested that
guy out and it works great um anyways uh
glue to fix in on multiple devices and
new sounds so if you have a nexus 4 and
you're going to wirelessly charge it
with the new orbs charging orbs that are
now available in the Play Store for 60
bucks sixty dollars you can well hey if
you spend the money for 300 other phone
are you kidding me a sixty-dollar
charger it is overpriced but hey it's
something that you know it's fairly new
okay so if you're using the LG pad which
is 40 or 50 bucks depending on where you
get it all right so if you're using the
a wirelessly to a wireless charger when
it wirelessly charges you're gonna have
a new ding a new sound and also a new
battery alert sound a low battery
indicator sound thank goodness i hated
the low battery indicator before so now
it's new i'm waiting for my nexus 7 to
discharge enough so i hear it um and
renewable and a bunch of lag that people
were talking about on people complain
that a lot of butter was gone on the
nexus 7 I by self I'm not noticing any
any issues on my Nexus 7 it's a little
smoother of you guys you know
agree/disagree that you know lag has
gone on for point-to-point to gone her
I'm not improved if it's definitely
improved um
it's still present depending on how much
stuff you throw at it at least that's
what I've seen how about you Dan you're
an expert in all things that how's your
nexus 7 working for you have an updated
yet but it's been working great on 4.2
phone line okay so David no speak
English ah do you have the update
available to your device yet dan you're
gonna 80 be side-loaded or you just uh I
mean it's running a custom roms or no
the update is not pop up popped up for
me okay but I could very easily get it
it is that's one of the perks of being a
Nexus device the images are actually
available now so if you want to test it
out for yourself and flash a back to
stock you can go and download the custom
are the factory images now one thing
within the nexus 4 that's a little
different than the other devices it
received a radio update and said radio
update did something for those of you
that were using LTE on supported ly on
your Nexus 4 next the nexus 4 no longer
has LTE capabilities with that that
radio code update broke it took it away
so sad face however if you do live in an
ATT supported area or in Canada you know
that has the dirty been like one of the
eight places on the planet yeah there's
not too well there's not too many places
with you really yeah AWS LTE in any kind
of like commercial deployment yeah but
they do have it in various large l and t
mobile is rolling it out but AT&amp;amp;T not so
much so if you live in a supported area
i'm pretty sure if you flash the old for
point-to-point one radio LTE will work
again i haven't confirmed that i put it
out for a few people that do live in the
areas to test they haven't gotten back
to me yet but as well as people were
talking about it on XDA a little bit
later I noticed so I'm sure I'm sure a
custom rom and or just the radio itself
will fix that in the near future for
those of you that want to use LTE
unofficially on your Nexus 4
yeah that was good so who uses a minus
the popular free cloud storage app I was
big into it when it was a strictly cloud
storage when it first came out and i use
it for a huge file backup yeah so look
if you're watching the show in the
comments I let us know if you're a fan
of minus if you still use it for storage
or if you've recently moved away from it
the reason i ask is everybody used in
the beginning was tons of free storage
everyone to everyone tried it out a lot
of people stayed with it a lot of people
not those of you that left some kind of
left when it turned into almost like a
photo sharing app and now today for
Valentine's Day they pushed out a
massive overhaul on the app to where
became a photo sharing social network
it's a location-based photo sharing
network like Instagram but only it's
called minus so they completely change
their direction it's really really
really weird um I'm really know what to
say I mean to talk about what the app
does yeah you can share your photos to
everyone near you you can see what
others are sharing nearby like I say its
location based on whoever's around you
you can browse their photos and say
hello so somebody you're at the lake and
somebody shows a picture of the lake and
you see it on- you're like oh hey I'm
here too I'm not stalking you i just saw
your photo pop up in your butt right not
stalking um if you don't like the
direction that they're headed they did
say to android police and a private
message today that you know they're
still going to support people in the
android community you can still download
the APK if you don't want to upgrade and
they're going to also support galleries
on the website and play on integrating
into to future apps as well blah blah
blah hey wizard so basically they're
saying if you think this totally random
new direction sucks you can still have
the old thing too
you slay the whole thing to be
compatible with every upcoming android
version is kind of useless yeah it I
don't know it's just weird i mean that
that's that's just like trying to think
I mean that's like Flickr saying one day
hey we're we're gonna no longer accept
photos but you wanted it but if you i'm
saying is an example let's say flickr
said hey we're no longer to accept
photos well we're gonna accept uh random
cloud storage files and become like
mediafire but no more photos we're just
you know this is weird very odd yeah
that's strange so like I said if you if
you use minus now you're gonna try it
out uh this new social network have you
already tried it out have you found
somebody to stalk close by and sent them
a private message sure Scott are you
guys oh yeah I come for Rupert world
yeah this unit if you live a live in
Minnesota and you see s Anderson uh with
red undies with red undies don't auto
ship loading photos of himself the
Harlem shake you hit it run away run
away any white guy that's on a Duke
happen hoodie yeah okay so Minnesota
let's be serious yeah that's how we all
dress let the white be autumn public
every day alright so good now Google now
I love it I i use it you know
contextually every day the dan how about
you cool no yeah at least in some
capacity yeah I use it every day as well
if you are gay here also you know I keep
telling people you got to use build a
more often it's it's really that great
and you know what the more you move
around if you stay put in your house all
day yeah it's not gonna be the greatest
dad oh yeah it's gonna tell you the
weather to do enemy your private so many
people say it just tells me the weather
it tells me that I need to go to work
like well you need to use it more you
know if you the more that you use it the
better it becomes and this week it got
better and better there's this really is
it true if you don't use it you lose
you know what we haven't had a sexual
reference yet the show so there you guys
go out good job so let's got there
surrounded boxers I think it's a sexual
reference hey hey it's Valentine's Day
the entire episode yeah so Google nail
had a big update and since a nap we love
will talk about it here for a minute um
I don't have Fandango around here for
movie passes because i live in the
middle of nowhere but if you live in an
area that supports it call no movie
theaters for you you can uh it has now
you know Fandango support by reading
your Gmail which is cool yeah also a big
addition was college sports yeah college
sports now you can actually manually
search for college basketball not works
in general there was a big uproar of
well if you search for football you're
gonna be waiting a while for those uh
those you know scores to come in to
understand that you're just young
basketball now yeah but still there's
other sports what about college hockey
true you know what I'm gonna want that
another year and then just go to Scott
is a big hockey players think it's there
Chris my cosmic because my filipina play
hockey so uh rotten tomatoes right now
to show up on movie ratings so right now
I don't know about you guys but I
normally go see a movie on Friday or
Saturday mom when I seen the vehicle
that's an odd day to see a movie on a
Friday or Saturday night you go see well
anyways I every friday and saturday
night I get movie updates from the local
theater AMC my theater is big enough to
be on there you know we don't have
Fandango but you know we're we're on
google now um so the the updates for the
movie listings are now going to have
rotten tomato ratings on that's good no
let me know if I need to go see it or
not um and then real estate listings so
if you're searching the web for houses
in Detroit Michigan because you want to
move up there and be close to Dan the
next time you're in Detroit you're gonna
have a google now card say hey look
you're looking for houses around here to
buy and it's going to give you a real
estate listings I tested it for my area
and it works it's pretty neat if there's
a new less
things are from zillow though yeah I
mean like I said Google now keeps
getting better and better and I'm very
anxious to see what comes in android
well with the net q Empire the next
major release of Android I think Google
now is going to play a big part so
moving on to big app updates this week
up Plex anybody big fan of plex or use
plex Tony wants it all the time very I
do yeah I use it every day so I got to
talk about I feel like I've been talking
forever but no well um Lex all right so
short version plex allows you to stream
media from your computer to your android
device your google TV device and
whatever they have an a decent ass out
there now but in terms of Android UI
design it could be a little bit better
so they said you know what we're going
to set out to design the best android
app possible and they did a little
teaser video this week and it looks
awesome that's good it's completely
redone a little bit of hollow in there
you know I I love it from what I've seen
if you're a plex playa if you're a plex
pass subscriber you will be able to get
that first and then soon it'll be
available to everybody but right now
it's only available to flex pass
subscribers our arms sorry it will be
available it's not available yet so I'm
supposedly it'll be available I the end
of the week and I guess that's tomorrow
or saturday so should be pretty soon it
should be available i'll let you guys
know what i think of it when i'm running
it on my nexus 7 um the other big app
want to talk about and then we're done
boring avenues I swear is dashclock
who's tried that out the app from Roman
York he our store yeah it's it's nice
it's a very simplistic but informative
yeah absolutely a lot of a functional
simplicity there it looks like the
original stock Android clock which is
good because it's very easy and elegant
on the eyes stuff like that um but you
can add a bunch of widgets on there to
get some extra information and the cool
thing I liked about it was that you can
put it on your lock screen which is
really though yeah say you locked in
your home screen
and you could it has he been to have
extensions on it so he put two
extensions initially weather and um miss
call miss Carter Eppley author email
doesn't whatever but you must think that
this is essentially what 4.2 lock screen
widget should have been to begin with
yes absolutely yes without all the
excess you know what I was saying is is
that other developers can put apps in
the Play Store to add functionality to
that so Falcon pro actually was updated
to allow Twitter integration somebody
put a currency extension out there on
there's a what else is there there's a
other ones and cook for my nexus 7 to
look at it here what other Oh battery
yeah there's a battery out there so you
can see your your battery discharge or
charging and percentage left the battery
temperature and then the voltage and
everything so in the battery health so
yeah there's I'm sure we're gonna see a
lot more extensions added over the next
you know a few weeks as more people use
this as becomes more popular i love it i
think it's awesome everybody should try
it out it's called dashclock widget is
josh said those green in your your home
your home screen if you're on 4.2 yeah
but I said that backwards you know in it
will be a good base to eventually build
off of definitely let's move on to some
device news shall we yes we'll talk
about the HTC one m7 101 you know
apparently it is definitely gonna be
called the one HTC one which is
confusing as hell cuz you know a year
ago the HTC One X s and V came out six
months later or so the one x+ came out
so now we're just going to have the one
and only yeah so so drop these deviation
to this or an upgraded version to this
because this is old bill one I think
it's gonna confuse people the average
person is going to look at that and be
like also the one
x plus is the best right no just a 11 x
plus no one no but the thing is you know
that they're trying to build a brand
just like Samsung is with the galaxies
and you know then pick one and stick
logistical I mean they are they are kind
of sticking with the 1-series yeah so I
want now remember they are coming out
with another phone the g2 which is a 3.5
inch screen with a one a single core 1
gigahertz processor it's going to be a
very low end model I'm curious to see
you know what what that's about but hey
it's gonna rock since 50 I guess oh hey
i'm all for cheap phones i guess until
that cheap phone six months from now
sucks and people complain about the
cheap phone that they bought an android
sucks because this phone sucks and yeah
I I have a lot of opinions about that
you know you buy a low-end phone and
then six months later you complain that
the phone sucks na or six minutes later
this that's the case with any old former
you buy a 3gs right now and it's gonna
suck to the same thing with a car as
well alright so anyways so what a gram
so anyway said this weekend problems
started to leak stuff on their website
if you remember next week februari 19th
i believe they're having a event in
london as well as new york city chances
are they're going to they're going to be
announcing the m7 / 1 / g 2 / on what's
the other one called dan we talked about
last week a sudden / 1 g 2 and then
something that's not worth it worth it
for us to remember haribol little like
320 x 2 80 screamed it's three and a
half inch yeah 180 BPM so everybody is
are you excited for the HTC One that's
what I want to talk about it's going to
be announced next week who wants to go
buy it who's like yes I've been waiting
for this thing everything else is shit I
need to buy
this question will it have stock Android
no then No thank you that's that's my
personal opinion I mean somewhere out
there there's an HTC fan it is like yeah
you know they're excited for this and I
want there has to be you know what I've
always been an HTC fan and here you have
just gotten fed up with them what have
you gotten in front of whip they're not
outright hostile to the development
community they do everything they can to
maintain the appearance of being open
and accessible to the development and
they're unlocking program is
realistically very good it has some
locations that are annoying but easy to
bypass and people make more deal about
it than I think they should but their
inability to release kernel source in a
timely fashion is just unacceptable it's
just it's ridiculous they are breaking
the license under which they are
releasing these devices there are legal
ramifications that just mean ultimately
comes out of the fact that nobody has
the money to sue them over it for but if
somebody did put up the money for it
they would lose so strictly kernel
source not like anything else not just
that either they do a lot of proprietary
stuff that just makes it extremely
difficult to work with their devices
they do a lot of stuff that they
integrate in with various pieces of the
device in ways that it just shouldn't be
and it makes it impossible to work
around and I go figure to integrate our
things into the ril into the actual
radio structure the operating system has
no business doing that in that kind of
way there's no reason that HTC needs to
change the way that stock Android works
for hit the radio later like there's
just no reason for that and they do it
anyway to make it more difficult and
work with it yeah and you know I mean
they're made me there may be no reason
for it but you know Android you can so
and that's really gotta cam but they
keep doing that and they can see they
used to be the most open to development
there used to be the company that
everybody wanted to get homes from when
there
making the nexus one and the HTC evo and
the incredible and the desire and the
hd2 that's freaking still running
everything under the Sun two and a half
years later right like they used to make
the phone so that everybody wanted and
since then they started locking things
down making it harder to read their
devices making root more inaccessible
routing more of their system into the
ril and into other systems making it
less portable less modifiable whereas
Samsung has been abundantly open to
develop my community going so far as to
hire somebody like it's like a sign
heneage head right like you can't get
much more pro developers and hiring the
guy behind cyanogenmod then point worth
noting because it's almost that's almost
when they flip flop in terms of sales
and they under play there might not be
that many people rooting phones or
unlocking phones compared to the
majority of people on the market but
when your mom or your grandma or
something comes and asks they're going
to ask that person that's really into it
they're not asking average tech people
and that's really where your motive your
yeah that's where your word of mouth is
really being fueled from his the
enthusiast and that's almost when HTC
completely turned around and started
losing out yeah yeah I mean not to
suggest that Santa Gemma doesn't work
hard on all the devices that they try to
support because I know that they do and
I know the developers involved with it
and I know the barriers for the HTC
devices that they've been facing but
they get much better access to Samsung
for obvious reasons and since then
Samsung devices have exploded the market
Samsung the user ship and cyanogenmod
has exploded and release after release
you see Samsung devices supported first
by then an HTC distant second third
fourth fifth if at all yeah i mean the
evo 3g the entire ax 60 platforms so the
evo 3d the sensation the resound the
holiday / raider / they called it
something else somewhere else
I think there's a whole slew of devices
there none of them ever got official
cyanogenmod support for nine or eight or
ten and they won't because it's just
freaking impossible to work with that
yeah now let's uh I started talking
about LG the optimus g pro we know a
little bit of stuff about it it was
outed before Mobile World Congress
coming up here 1080p resolution 5.5 inch
screen quad-core nice specs well the
optimus G had really good specs already
so if you're gonna yeah is it that big
of a leap I mean they're great specs but
at this point it's just kind of becoming
oh yeah another quad-core 1.5 plus
gigahertz Qualcomm processor with a 722
1080 screen between four and a half and
five and a half inches yeah I think the
big thing that's going to be more common
that isn't common right now is the 1080p
screens and I think that'll be the thing
that definitely gets a lot of people to
switch you know yes it's definitely a
PowerPoint it's not the drastic swap
that to HD to 720p was but it's scalp
noticeable oh but every flagship that
comes out this year is going to have
amazing specifications and it's getting
to the point that the mobile kind of
stagnating compared to the first couple
of years where we start off with 600
megahertz processors and yeah I remember
a year ago samsung pretty much told us
that the spec was dead here's the galaxy
s4 s3 look at all this cool software
stuff it can do the software is
definitely going to be the
differentiator and it's wide open
because everyone the OEMs from stock has
made changes for the sake of change and
not necessarily for the better but they
can really it's going to be whichever
one of them kind of makes the bold move
of making a really good decision there
and I really hope that happens because
as one of the device
viewers for android authority I'm
getting worried that next year on the
coming year is every next review is just
going to be this has the same stuff as
the last one except for this one thing
as a two minute video that's all is
going to be you know 1080p screens are
awesome i I've used to now droid DNA and
the oppo which by the way is a great fun
the Optifine five looks really felon we
build yeah it is that's the thing I was
going to say earlier I think HTC phones
are some of the best built phones like
boys data they can stand up to a lot of
punishment the Oppo can also plus it's
it's pretty heavy so you can tell
there's that there's that build quality
80 that's really good but 1080p screens
as cool as they are I don't I don't see
it being I guess they're trying to tap
into that television mentality like big
yeah more more p you know like it's on I
met a deaf give me a couple know what
full nature he needs antenna he's been
all the rage and in TV sales for years
now haha yeah I think they're trying to
push it bigger than what it really is i
mean it's a progressive update you know
well this is it so hard is it is it so
hard to get a 1080p resolution on a 4.7
inch screen do they all have to be 5
inches that's my question cosmin export
our that's all it doesn't have to be
doesn't have to be okay it's easier with
LCD than LED mmm samsung really just
kind of getting it started as 20 LED
spin slower to the pixel game yeah
what's that will improve you know
technology for different types of
screens and we'll get different types of
screens at high resolution so I mean
there's still room for improvement but
you know progress over it now yeah I
would say Oh LED in terms of pixel
density and sort of quality at that
pixel level is about a half a generation
behind LCD especially when you're
looking at the LCD to and the LCD 3
technology the basis HTC has been using
it's fantastic the on the line displays
in those HTC devices yeah so let's start
okay we went from HTC LG now HP another
star p Pete yeah another big I so HP
rumored to get on Tiger for tablet
now what was the last tablet that they
made the touchpad that I'm here what did
that run that ran whoa virtually really
hunter HP officially a tranny HP webos
soldiers so webos and how long did it
take them to give up on that but well
that's what that's why they did the fire
sale and sold him for a hundred not I'm
just trying to make the point that are
they really going to be sticking with
this or are they gonna be I mean they
bought webos from palm so then that then
they decided or sit because they it was
cool but the end they want to totally
give it away then you know stop
development on it completely so yeah and
you know my wish to be you know sticking
with it this is so as a half-assed oh
let's let's do this or is it let's go
all HP is really digging right now
because even in their home even in their
own territory on desktops companies like
Lenovo we're really just taking over
where they used to yeah they're hurting
bad oh yeah so it's it's a question
market they're probably just throwing
anything they can against the wall and
seeing what sticks yep so well they're
not bonus samsung in that regards so
minutes rumor here HP current devices
yeah HP you know the they made they made
the touchpad up it started out extremely
expensive came down price then went to
let's try to make a few bucks on it um
I'm build quality like something I think
they just try to get rid of them let's
lose a couple bucks yeah because it just
getting these things are so bad just get
them out of here I don't care you have
to give them away so do we want an H I
mean HP's making Chromebooks now you
know so do we want an HP android tablet
yes we do I mean it I mean do we know
that it's an android tablet or do we
know that it's in a Tegra 4 10 the rumor
was a Tegra for android tablet okay
let's assume it's gonna be an Android
tablet Tegra 4 do we want that I say yes
I want more device manufacturer oh sure
yeah yeah everybody but no is HP's have
still got a little bit of branding going
yeah AG haven't ran ain't going for them
they might be able to sell some and then
I look back at the dell streak and i
just say but that was a couple years ago
that was awhile ago you know android has
changed lot since then the tablet the
larger device market has changed a lot
since then so i'm curious to what
they're gonna bring to the table but i
just don't see it i don't know i don't
see them putting out something that is
going to all everyone yeah i don't think
so either look at HP put into an android
tablet that hasn't been done already
that is quintessential HP and i just
can't think of that future there has to
be a lot of RND and a lot of features
that are no specific to their tablets
which yeah and I and I'm sorry to say
this but immediately what I think is a
skinned themed custom UI troi device
with all sorts of bloatware yeah notice
I'm thinking to if if I turn on an
Android tablet and HP punches me in the
face through the screen by the time yeah
I will I wonder if boy customer support
yeah hey my tablet turned off oh I'm
scared to death I wonder if a lot of the
people just from the desktop market and
you know the laptop market are you know
pretty engraved with this notion of this
is what the experience is going to be
like I'm going to get a lot of bloatware
and this is an HP device to me I wonder
if they're gonna do that and not try out
the device clinically a lot of reason
that consumers have responded to these
desktop companies that are trying to put
tablets on the market like you've got
toshiba and you know lenovo a couple
other players but a lot of reason people
are buying tablets is because of the
perception that it's a simpler device to
use from a windows laptop or desktop or
whatever and that's the only bad thing
about them having their name on it is
there
associate that with what they've had in
the past from you know so it's so can
they do anything to take that negative
connotation with their name and no come
up with something that people will be
excited about do they have to start
another small company and just produce
the devices out of air or I mean what
can they do it is HP they need to
produce a extremely high quality build
quality device put your money where your
mouth is highly SPECT clean operating
system no hiccups no performances
release it without a hitch market the
crap out of it ensure they can bust
their way onto the scene I absolutely
believe that anybody can break into
Samsung's lead in the android market
it's totally open still it's just do it
right let's put CDN do you remember a
year ago when HP said we're done with
all desktop computers were not making
them anymore and then they're like wow
you know maybe not you know and then you
go all in that's why I don't think it's
gonna happen I think it could happen but
I don't think they'll pull it off this
makes me curious out of all of us here
does any of us do do any of us have a HP
device that we use regularly no no thank
you you know and even at work on modèle
shop I we don't have HP device
protection why do we not have any HP
devices w/e don't we don't trust it we
don't trust the brand it's it's gonna
break for me I owned an HP laptop a
17-inch oh you broke in six months yeah
I dramatically once but the you know I
mean the bloatware is not a big deal
because you can just you know take all
of it but you know not to get off on
this type of tangent but the way the pc
market is as soon as one of us has a bad
experience with any manufacturer device
the first thing we say is yep all these
are shit everything else is going to do
you know what and i will swear up and
down how amazing del juez because i
never had a problem with any any server
support with Dell but the first time I
have an issue I'm probably gonna be I
mean that that that's the way we are
that's the way Austin you know techies
are hard-coded that way I'm really kind
of
HP laptop that wasn't like falling apart
and totally jank my sister had one and
hers was crap and that is I mean they
kept late to anybody else you guys all
know I had a compact desktop is my first
desktop and it was oh man it was if it
was asked a good computer but what about
packard bell John you know like a Qi
good i had a packard bell that was my
first computer like my first computer
game on that girl is a 486 DX 250 i
remember that boy 4 Meg's are random
9600 baud modem no it was talking lie it
even had a tape backup drive that's
right yeah now I never used but hey I
had it give us still use tape yeah yeah
why I used tape for other things well
anyways so less tangents more Android um
let's talk about some Android updates
for devices the oh the droid DNA this
awesome little thing don't you dare lie
to our audience this thing is great oh
this awesome little thing that you hate
oh you know what it's so awesome I have
this update here pending that I'm just
not gonna click it you know it but i
have it i could get update i could get
it um so if you're rocking the droid DNA
and you like the phone that's cool you
want this update and why do you want
this update well you can do Hulu Plus a
hotspot connectivity has been fixed
right now tell you the droid dna's
hotspot the verizon hotspot app sucks
you more like a cold side it's horrible
you will get horrible download speeds
your connectivity will drop you'll get
dropped packets mean like webpages won't
load and then sometimes they will it
it's horrible I had to install Wi-Fi
tether for root users to even that
tether on my uh my DNA every single time
because the stock one sucks well verizon
/ HTC fixed it whoever was at fault ah
and that has been fixed on on the
updates you wanted for that and they
have
improvements for audio quality for wired
headsets as well as earpiece has been
made so that means Beats Audio
improvements that's what I'm hearing as
I said there's been some bluetooth
connectivity issues fixed for volume
levels of fixed so those of you they're
using bluetooth speakers such as this
little guy was talking about earlier
that should sound more awesome with the
update there's been enhanced reliability
and stability of the contacts list Wi-Fi
connectivity has been improved I heard a
lot of people actually talking about
that I personally haven't had any Wi-Fi
issues neither is one of my friends that
has the DNA that we talked about the
phone all the time he hasn't mentioned
any Wi-Fi issue so it might be
intermittent um there's been
improvements the default browser if you
use HTC's browser I use Chrome that I
don't care about that some people like
it and I'm curious to find out what the
enhanced recent apps functionality
improvement is HTC as you know has their
own customization for recents which is
horrible yeah I would show you but I
have jellybeans recent menu on here but
I'm curious as to what that improvement
is who yeah so I'm sure we'll start
seeing screenshot shots you in the near
future about the improvement no this is
just a regular recent apps you know
economic did you improve this like what
what is this well more than one would be
nice well you can't swipe down to kill
an app you can I swipe up I don't know I
don't know I don't know either way they
improved it somehow so I'm curious uh
Josh if you're gonna get the update I
don't know if your stock or not oh I'll
try it I mean I'd literally just got
this about a week or so ago and I like
it it made me understand why 1080p 1080p
screens are kind of cool but um I'm
interested in the audio quality
improvements because how do you improve
beats audio when essentially all it does
is make things louder do you make it
louder like makes it louder or a letter
on earth yeah pretty much the equalizer
because all it is is just a custom eq
school yeah just an equalizer turns your
EQ into a smiley face basically it's a
hard work ship and
no it's probably good I know all right
so I'm gonna land though I actually
think beats audio is pretty good but I'm
just curious what the improvements could
possibly yeah this thing that thing ISM
sounds amazing when you use a bluetooth
or a headset it really does so on the
routan in ramen those of you that rock
cyanogenmod on your android 4.1 or 4.2
point one device you're the first
question in your mind is what am I get
in for point-to-point too well earlier
tonight cyanogenmod on google+ shared a
screenshot showing the mako the nexus 4
running android 4.2 point2 interesting
so that means hey it's coming no ETA
shun oh we obviously knew it's coming I
mean that's what they do so yeah it'll
be around in the near future um fingers
crossed confident I uh they don't have a
lot of problems merging in all their
changes they made a post actually a
little bit talking about that some
things look like they're going to be a
pain some things uh look like they're
gonna be not too hard and it's obviously
some of the things like graphic stuff is
a device dependent so we'll see i'm sure
they'll do their best and we'll have
some CM 10.1 android 4.2 point2 roms
here in the the near future i'm assuming
i'm gonna update to a rom manager for
Delta from updates yeah yeah yeah it's a
delta realm update so that just means
you don't have to download a 200 mega
raw and 100 Meg rom if the rom only has
4 Meg's of changes that's all you have
to download which is all right I cannot
wait till that is the future it'll be
really nice it's almost like a well it's
a rom over-the-air update you know yeah
exactly yeah this is awesome but you
know what the way for it because it gets
pushed out before yeah everything if I
I'll try it definitely i haven't used
rom manager in a while but i'll
definitely try it out here once i have a
device that works with rom manager
because
you know this guy here doesn't really
have any roms for it does that do does
that make phone calls yes i'm just
wondering i'm just wondering yeah you
can you can make phone calls with this
device you can take pictures with it oh
i don't believe you but in terms of a
custom rom you know it's an ipod so can
a kid I've significant player and it's
an internet connectivity device does it
have access the itunes yeah perhaps yeah
you know i'm buying this iphone because
i want to remember that video cuz it's
got a retina let your head and for so
why are you waiting in line to buy the
iphone 5 what do you plan on doing with
it well it's an iphone 5 is it just a
wife finds i was my 503 has the wifis
and the jeebies is just a line for apps
yes miss the line for apps remark they
really hit the nail mad with that
marketing campaign yeah so i'm going
pirius all the other big kids on the
block we kind of got off on a tangent
there but the other big kids in block
paranoid android are there another AOSP
built rom i'm sure they'll be telling us
when for point-to-point to goodness be
coming to them they just push up kairos
actually so actually so if you're
followed our show a few weeks ago we
actually had one of their developers
aaron on the show to talk about the rom
and those guys are doing some really
cool stuff and he's a hell of a nice guy
I'm excited that to see them push out
the full version of paranoid android 3
with full working pie and everything on
their devices this past week also on the
galaxy s4 looks like Samsung's gonna be
ramped up for that release as well with
a lot of units ready oh I mean I assume
so they're gonna sell 100 million units
supposedly yeah I mean that'll be
interesting and it'll be interesting to
see if they can top it I'm I'm curious
there will be a 1080p to the screen so
that will be a push
really that's a document this is overdue
top-line advice well you know because
you're gonna have a 1.5 to 1.7 gigahertz
quad-core Qualcomm this oh my god how
did you know no trying to bake 20 let's
let's talk no nothing little flame on I
don't roll that would be an ddms MCM and
