Authority what's going on everybody and
what we're looking at here is the HP
slatebook x2 this is the new tablet
coming out of the same company that
brought you the slate 7 the very
affordable 7-inch tablet but this time
they're going a little bit more high-end
in terms of what they're looking at in
terms of a larger tablet and this is a
10 inch tablet capable of 1900 x 1200
resolution so you get the full HD
display there I apologize by the way for
the glare that you keep seeing here
that's the lighting here at have calm
digital focus at Aoife in Berlin but
with that in mind I'll just make sure we
have the screen on here for you and you
can see the screen in all of his glory
so we're looking at a pretty nice screen
with a very high resolution so it's
quite nice
so HP has been able to create tablets
and products that are all in affordable
price points and this is no exception
this comes in at four hundred ninety
nine dollars might seem like a little
much but the reason why it does is
because we have a peripheral that it
connects to
reaching right over and here it is we
have the we have the
the keyboard apparatus here
so when we have here is a keyboard
apparatus for the HP slatebook and
allows you it's a pretty simple keyboard
with the cursor right here that allows
you to type everything up using a
keyboard so you don't have to rely on
the on-screen keyboard there close it up
here and we'll take a look at a couple
of the other elements of course the
bottom is just pretty pretty standard
with a few rubber with a number of
rubberized corners right here here is
the front again it is a pretty
simplistic design very much like HP we
do have a 2 megapixel rear camera which
is the same as a toothache a pixel front
camera so as far as tablets go we know
that cameras on tattoos aren't always
that great and this is another example
of it but it is nice that there is a
camera there as well a couple things
about the keyboard here when it comes to
just the tablet you have an eight hour
battery life however one you connect the
keyboard it turns it to 12 and a half
one layout over on the sides we have the
volume rockers right over here with the
power button over on the back those are
flat buttons on the back and I make them
pretty easy to push we're looking at
here in terms of the processor is a
Tegra 4 processor so yes this is one of
the first tablets to come with invidious
new Tegra 4 from what we can tell in the
tablet the performance was quite good
the Tegra 4 definitely does perform as
well as it should so as we open up the
clamshell here after having the
apparatus on there
now we are so that is the HP slatebook
once again this is josh from android
authority here at Pep com digital focus
we're here at Aoife in Berlin so make
sure you stay tuned for all of the great
action because we are your source for
all things and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
