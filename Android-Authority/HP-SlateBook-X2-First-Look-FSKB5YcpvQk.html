what's going on everybody
and what we're looking at here is the HP
Slate book x2 this is the new tablet
coming out of the same company that
brought you the slate 7 the very
affordable 7-inch tablet but this time
they're going a little bit more high-end
in terms of what they're looking at in
terms of a larger tablet and this is a
10 inch tablet capable of 1,900 by 1200
resolution so you get the full HD
display there
I apologize by the way for the glare
that you keep seeing here that's the
lighting here I have common digital
focus at Aoife in Berlin but with that
in mind I'll just make sure we have the
screen on here for you and you can see
the screen in all of his glory so we're
looking at a pretty nice screen with a
very high resolution so it's quite nice
so HP has been able to create tablets
and products that are all in affordable
price points and this is no exception
this comes in at $499 which might seem
like a little much but the reason why it
does is because we have a peripheral
that it connects to
reaching right over and here it is we
have the we have the
the keyboard apparatus here
No
so what we have here is a keyboard
apparatus for the HP Slate look it
allows you it's a pretty simple keyboard
with the cursor right here that allows
you to type everything up using a
keyboard so you don't have to rely on
the on-screen keyboard there we close it
up here and we'll take a look at a
couple of the other elements of course
the bottom is just pretty pretty
standard with a few rubber with a number
of rubberized corners right here here is
the front again it is it's a pretty
simplistic design very much like HP we
do have a 2 megapixel rear camera which
is the same as a toothpick so front
camera so as far as tablets go we know
that cameras on Tabatha's aren't always
that great and this is another example
of it but it is nice ed there is a
camera there as well a couple things
about the keyboard here when it comes to
just the tablet you have an eight hour
battery life however one you connect the
keyboard it turns it to 12 and a half
button layout over on the sides we have
the volume rockers right over here with
the power button over on the back those
are the flat buttons on the back that I
make them pretty easy to push what we're
looking at here in terms of the
processor is a Tegra 4 processor so yes
this is one of the first tablets to come
with invidious new Tegra 4 from what we
can tell in the tablet the performance
was quite good the Tegra 4 definitely
does perform as well as it should so as
we open up the clamshell here after
having the apparatus on there
now we are so that is the HP slate book
once again this is Josh from Android
authority here at the epic on digital
focus we were here at Aoife in Berlin so
make sure you stay tuned for all of the
great action because we are your source
for all things and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
