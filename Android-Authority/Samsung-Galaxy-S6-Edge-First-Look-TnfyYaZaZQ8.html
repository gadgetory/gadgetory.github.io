Android authority and if you loved
everything about the Galaxy s6 edge but
wished it came in a much bigger size
well Samsung has your answer this is
your first look and hands-on of the
samsung galaxy s6 edge+
when it comes to design the plus moniker
always suggests one thing a bigger and
usually better version of a phone that
already currently exists and that's
exactly what you're getting here with
the s6 edge+ the essex edge plus is
practically identical to the s6 edge and
pretty much every way from the button
placement the glass on the front and
back and the solid metal frame that
bends out along the curved edges of the
glass but it's obviously a much bigger
phone the bigger size definitely makes
one-handed usability a little bit more
difficult than the normal s6 edge but if
you're used to and love smartphones of
this size then you'll already know
exactly what to expect on the front
you'll find a 5.7 inch Super AMOLED
panel which is a significant bump up
from the 5.1 inch screen on the s6 edge
but the resolution remains the same at
quad HD or 2560 by 1440 the pixel
density does take a small dip but it's
still well over 500 and if we're being
perfectly honest here you're most likely
not going to notice a difference the
screen is still extremely sharp vibrant
bright and colorful with very deep
blacks just as you would expect from a
typical Samsung made AMOLED panel with a
much larger screen the s6 edge+ should
provide for a much better media
experience when it comes to web browsing
videos and games and the two curved
edges along the sides are just as
aesthetically pleasing to look at as
they were before but Samsung is looking
to make them a lot more useful this time
around on the inside the s6 edge+
features the same Exynos 7420 from the
s6 edge with the biggest difference
being an additional 1 gig of ram for a
total of 4 gigabytes the extra gig of
ram certainly doesn't hurt and should
make jumping between a ton of
applications and even smoother
experience and so far the device has
been very responsive and snappy this
really isn't any surprise considering
we've already seen this processor in
action and Samsung's revamped and
slimmed down version of
touchwiz definitely makes a pretty big
impact on the overall performance other
Hardware on the s6 edge+ includes 32 and
64 gigs of internal storage but
unfortunately there's still no option
for microSD card expansion which I can
already tell is going to be somewhat of
a head-scratcher considering there's
only two storage options the fingerprint
scanner is still integrated directly
into the home button utilizing Samsung's
new touch type method that's much more
faster and accurate and the heart rate
monitor is still located on the backside
next to the camera for the battery the
s6 edge+ packs a three thousand milliamp
hour battery that's non removable and
three thousand milliamp hours is still a
fairly respectable size but the large
high-res 5.7 inch screen and powerful
processor inside is already raising some
concerns but hopefully it's more than
good enough for just a full day like
many other recent Samsung flagships you
also get fast charging capabilities and
compatibility with all forms of wireless
charging for faster and easier charging
on the rear is a 16 megapixel F 1.9
sensor just like the s6 edge but the
front camera has now been bumped up to a
5 megapixel sensor for some higher
resolution selfie shots considering the
s6 has one of the best smartphone
cameras of the year it probably won't be
too much of a surprise if the story is
the same with the s6 edge+ you can still
double tap the home button to quickly
launch the camera app from anywhere just
like before and the camera app for the
most part is still the same but Samsung
has now added the ability to create
video collages allowing you to record
for short clips and stitch them together
all into a single video you can also now
create live broadcasts similar to
something like periscope that can feed
directly to YouTube which can be pretty
useful when you want to share a moment
with your followers on the fly
the s6 edge+ is going to ship with
android 5.1.1 lollipop with Samsung's
latest version of TouchWiz just like the
s6 and s6 edge this is a much more toned
down version of TouchWiz with lesser
unnecessary features and bloat but one
minor aesthetic change is with the icons
they're now rounded off squares that
make the UI look a lot cleaner and more
uniform in comparison to the older
Samsung icons all of the features that
take advantage of the dual edged glass
like night clock information stream edge
lighting and people edge are all still
available but Samsung has made a few key
improvements that make the edge features
a little bit more useful than before
besides just contacts the people edge is
now capable of housing any of your
favorite applications and can easily be
accessed no matter where you are within
the phone and not tied down specifically
to just the home screen the pool tab can
also be relocated to anywhere along the
left and right edges to make it easier
to reach especially if you have smaller
hands because the s6 edge+ is a much
larger device Samsung has added a triple
tap shortcut of the home button that
shrinks the screen to a smaller size to
help with one-handed usability we've
seen this feature before on many other
large screen smartphones but the triple
tap of the home button is a unique touch
that makes the feature easy to get to
but there you have it for this quick
hands-on look of the galaxy s6 edge plus
hopefully you enjoyed this video and if
