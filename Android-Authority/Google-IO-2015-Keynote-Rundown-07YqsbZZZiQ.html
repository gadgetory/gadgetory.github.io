just a search box yeah me neither
it's Josh lugar from Andhra Authority
what's going on everybody and this is my
Google i/o keynote rundown this year at
Google i/o it's not really a focus on
product so much as the ecosystems and
the experiences that they will provide
but I think there's a really good reason
for that we already have so many great
products out in the market especially
ones from Google in the Nexus five six
nine seven and all of the different
access devices in Google's own camp that
perhaps they didn't feel the need to
create new products for this year's i/o
instead it's all about polish and it's
all about creating even better
experiences via all of these devices
that are even easier for all of you out
there and it starts off with Android ad
now in Android M we are going to get a
few very key enhancements in there that
will probably please a lot of you who
didn't really like what was in lollipop
starting off with permissions now
permissions are not going to be
available right away when you are
installing an application instead
permissions when they are triggered by a
particular let's say capabilities of an
application they will appear at that
time in order for you to know exactly
what the app is trying to access when it
is trying to access it and then of
course we talk about power and charging
which is probably the big part for me
that to really hear from them in the
power section basically we're looking at
a new functionality called doze now doze
will use all the different sensors that
are inside a device and be able to tell
if the device is actually being used by
the user when it's not being used by the
user you're basically going to just see
the device powered down to a very
low-power state and turn off all of the
applications in the background to a
low-power state so that when you pick up
the phone it will know that it's gotten
picked up and it will have the apps
available in the background but while
it's in the DOS state you're not going
to be losing much power up apparently
the Nexus 9 you get twice as much
battery life from it when using doze
frequently then of course USB type-c
which is something that I'm still a
little bit iffy on USB type-c definitely
will bring even better USB charging
maybe some better connectivity but it's
gonna be a new type of standard that
we're gonna have to adhere to in a lot
of devices in the coming years or so so
that might be a bit of a change that we
still need to get used to moving on to
Google now Google now since we're
talking about androids what I want to
move into because Google now has always
been really great and I've really
enjoyed Google now as a way of just kind
of consolidating search but it's
contextually based systems or what is
going to become the key focus of Google
now in the coming year basically we're
looking at now on tap now based on what
is on your actual screen you're going to
perform a search whether it's with your
voice or via holding the home button and
based upon what is on the screen you
will be able to get a very quick search
on what it thinks that you're going to
want to see we have some examples up
there already let's say if you're
looking at a particular actress page and
you wanted to take a look at their
Wikipedia page you can press and hold on
the home button they will know that
you're looking at a particular actor and
then do a search for it on their Android
wear on the other hand is getting some
updates to it that really feel like they
should have been there in the first
place first of all a new launcher that
will open up when you just tap the
screen and the thing that I think would
be really useful for a lot people out
there is the fact that you have the
always-on option let's say you have maps
open and this is probably the big use
case scenario that I would use with
Android where you need to get your
directions and be able to go everywhere
without the screen turning off and you
have to fiddle with the actual device
itself in order to get your direct
again instead the screen will actually
stay on when you're in the Maps
application and then you'll be able to
do everything from there without any
problems
project brillo was another announcement
that was made here at Google i/o project
brillo being basically Google's own
foray into the Internet of Things now
what we have in the Internet of Things
are basically all of the different parts
of a person's life being connected to a
smartphone but the problem as google
sigh is that there's really no one
ecosystem no one platform for all of
these devices and all of these items to
really communicate with one another that
is exactly what project brillo is it's
not only a user interface or a backends
for all of these particular things but
it's also a way for all of them to
communicate and it consolidates the
communication that all these items will
have together in order for really all
the manufacturers to be able to connect
not only to an Android device but also
to other devices in its own camp and
under the same umbrella for the IOT
Google Photos was a little bit confusing
because I said it was a brand new
product that may not necessarily be the
case what we're looking at is a brand
new ecosystem of Google Photos it's
essentially like Google is creating
their own version of Flickr and really
it's going to provide a platform for
people to upload all of their photos and
videos and using the contextual search
basis that Google is already using in
Google now and across Android it will be
able to look into the photos and you'll
be able to search them for particular
context not only based upon somebody's
face but also based upon the context of
the photo themselves if you have a bunch
of baseball photos for example you'll be
able to search baseball and it will be
able to recognize that you're at a
stadium or that you're actually playing
baseball with your kids but one of the
biggest parts of Google photos is the
fact that you'll be able to upload all
of your photos and videos to Google the
Google Photos ecosystem free of charge
unlimited that's a really big deal if
anybody out there who's used to Dropbox
for uploading photos and videos and then
you've run out of space or you just
don't want to pay for the Dropbox Pro
well Google is now pretty much
eliminating that problem with Google
Photos really from there we moved into
VR after a big developer section and VR
virtual reality is going to be a big
part of Google's presence and lead going
for
not only is VR going to be available in
YouTube but it's going to become a
platform by which content creators can
actually create experiences for
everybody
there's GoPro arrays and different
arrays that will be made available via
their geometry to a lot of developers
who can create their own camera arrays
and be able to get 360 panoramic views
of an area going in and out even walking
around with the camera to create an
experience that someone could actually
immersively get into now the reason why
I think this is great
VR itself is still something that's kind
of on the dock yet we're not necessary
too sure how we feel about it other than
certain iterations like the HTC vive but
Google's own way of presenting VR really
makes a lot of sense
because they're providing it as a way of
truly experiencing something through an
educational standpoint the jump program
and then after that the expedition's
program will allow people to take these
camera arrays and create experiences
that they can then send to people who
might want to learn about places that
they otherwise will never be able to get
to or even create experiences in which
they won't be able to educate kids or
educate people in a way that where they
are right now they might not be able to
have VR got a big portion of the last
part of this keynote and while cardboard
is still one of the easiest ways of
doing so it is also the one of the most
affordable and that's the reason why
going to education is a really good move
for cardboard because you can really
afford a bunch of cardboard for a bunch
of kids and then one tablet to control
the entire experience for the teacher
and then of course cardboard well that's
the thing that we're going to get as we
walk out of here so I just wanted to
bring you this little run down my little
bit of a reaction to being here at the
keynote obviously we have these screens
behind me that you're already seeing and
it's just this big spectacle and was
really fun to be here no we're not gonna
get any really big freebies or anything
like that but I do have still my wrist
bands for the after-hours party tonight
and I won't be sure to bring you a look
at what that is like
and I will give you an update on
cardboard as well you've probably seen
that video being uploaded at the same
time as this one so keep it tuned to
Android authority for all of the best
coverage including even more from here
at Google i/o 2015 here at the Moscone
Center in San Francisco California well
