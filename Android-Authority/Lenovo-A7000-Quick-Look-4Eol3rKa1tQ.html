ash here at MWC 2015 and Barcelona today
we met up with Lenovo and they showed
off a number of new devices here we have
the lenovo a7000 it's a mid-range device
with all the normal things you expect we
have a polycarbonate construction with a
removable back and battery it feels
solid in the hand very premium for a mid
tier device the device weighs in at 140
grams and is 7.9 millimeters thick it
has a 5.5 inch screen with a 720p
resolution which is a fairly large size
for its resolution we have a media tech
8 core processor 2 gigs of LP ddr3 RAM 8
gigabytes of internal storage with the
option to expand with another 32
we have Dolby Atmos channeling the sound
in fact it's the world's first
smartphone to feature this technology
generally speaking the audio experience
is widened and provides surround sound
but also from above and below there's
other features to augment the experience
such as adjustable EQ and also other
settings there's an 8 megapixel shooter
with the flash on the back and a 5
megapixel fixed-focus front-facing
camera like some of the other devices
we've seen today this phone features a
dual SIM layer which is a fantastic
choice for those juggling two phones all
those that just may have two different
data plans there's a 2900 milliamp
battery powering a device with Android
5.0 being the flavor of Android debuting
with the a 7000 this seems to be a
fairly competent mid-range device but
the best bit is the price this phone
will only be $169 yeah it'll be
available in March so there's not long
to wait
thanks guys and stay tuned for more
coverage from MWC 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
