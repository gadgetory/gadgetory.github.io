handy the Android authority app guy live
wallpapers aren't as popular as they
used to be but a lot of people still
enjoy them so for today's review we're
gonna take a look at a new and unique
wallpaper called gallery 3d okay so as
you can imagine this is a live wallpaper
thus it acts like your average live
wallpaper you set it up as you normally
wouldn't access the settings the exact
same way you can also double tap on the
screen once it's set to actually get
back into the settings the settings are
pretty comprehensive once you get used
to them a variety of them require in-app
purchases which we know you don't like
however there is a preview mode we can
at least see what it looks like before
you buy it from there it's simply mix
and match pick your animations pick your
background and what photos get shown on
the wallpaper and of course the
particles once done you created yourself
a live wallpaper so how can you use this
well it's a live wallpaper so the answer
to this is pretty simple you can use it
to have a nice looking wallpaper the
customization is pretty wide and you can
have pictures display anything your
family cars game pictures or whatever
your interest may be you can make it
work here and once you work your way
around the app and figure out how
everything works it's actually pretty
fun to use so here's what we liked about
gallery 3d it has a wide range of
customizations to deliver a really good
experience you can choose animation
speed what pictures show up the fact on
the particles and all sorts of other
things it's possible to make it look and
act pretty much how you want it to the
developers gave me a preview build four
days before the app came out and this
review took place three days later
during the course of that week there
were four updates
one of which added the preview feature
so developers seemed pretty on the ball
with fixing bugs and adding new stuff
and that's something we always like
lastly we enjoyed the performance during
use the battery didn't drain nearly as
much as expected and the battery strain
is barely noticeable at all also the
performance in general was quick and
smooth of course we did test this on a
nexus 4 so your mileage may vary but we
don't see this at performing poorly
unless it's a very old device so here's
what we didn't like we wish we had more
control over the animation speed and
type when swiping home screens the
setting may be too quick for some and
there isn't a way to turn it down the
auto animations do have this setting
though so there is something else to use
if the swiping is too fast
we know how people feel about in-app
purchases and this app has them nothing
is
overly expensive and you can preview
paid elements before you buy them
so at least there is that also as more
features get added expect the in-app
purchases list to grow again it's not a
bad thing but we know many people don't
like them overall this is a great live
wallpaper that can be pretty deeply
customized once you make your way around
the app you can have the pictures be
whatever you want or you can use the
stock offerings there are a few particle
options background options and other
things you can even use a custom
background but do note the best
backgrounds are ones that can be titled
it's free to use with some in-app
purchases that seems to be the way devs
are doing things these days All Things
Considered it's really nice that the
in-app purchases are cheap and it's
nicer that you can preview them first
there is room for improvement but isn't
there always and that shouldn't stop you
from giving this app a shot once again
