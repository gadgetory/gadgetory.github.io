Authority here to take a closer look at
what I think are the seven best features
of Android 7.0 despite some of those
other big features like split screen
mode and the 72 new emoji getting all of
the attention
I actually think some of the best
features are the ones that are a little
bit less obvious so without further ado
let's take a look at the seven best
features of Android 7.0 nuga and yes I
do say new ger recent apps quick
switcher is without a doubt my favorite
Android 7.0 feature surprisingly enough
in terms of raw awesomeness it's right
up there with the camera shortcut that
you get with the hardware button on
galaxy and Nexus phones once you use it
you'll wonder how you ever lived without
it and you may find yourself trying to
do it on phones that don't actually
support it quick switching is actually
really easy as well just double tap the
recent apps button to switch between
your two most recent apps it works in
split screen mode as well and it just
saves a ton of time for anyone that's
frequently hopping back and forth
between a couple of apps this is another
less than jaw-dropping feature but it's
probably the one that you're going to
get the most use out of in nuga
Samsung's TouchWiz and other
manufacturer skins have had a short list
of quick settings toggles at the top of
the notification shades for quite some
time but until Lugar this is the first
time we've had it in stock Android even
though you can easily pull that screen
up with a two finger swipe which you can
also do in nuga having them always at
the ready on top of your notifications
list is way better you can also
customize their order to meet your
specific needs as well bundle
notifications also make a whole lot of
sense I mean why would you want
individual notifications from the same
app when you can group them all together
this way you can expand them all for
individual attention or you can dismiss
them all at once or one at a time niggas
quick reply feature also means that you
can respond to select notifications
right from the notification shade
without having to open another app the
only problem with quick reply is that
it's not supported by every app just yet
another brilliant but rather obvious
nuga feature is putting all of the most
important information in the settings
menu right there on the front page so
you don't need to go into a submenu now
to see what Wi-Fi network you're
connected to or if bluetooth is
connected you can also see how much
internal storage is taken up how much of
your data allowance you've used your
average RAM usage how many apps you've
got installed and how much longer your
battery is expected to last all at a
casual glance whenever you open the
settings you may not hit you in the face
but it's actually a really great idea
oddly enough rebooting your phone is
also one of my favorite new Girt
features if you make the switch to file
encryption or pick up one of the new
nexuses which will have it by default
you can get all the way to your lock
screen with the still encrypted device
this means you can pick up incoming
notifications calls alarms and that kind
of thing but your private data is still
secure meanwhile by adding just-in-time
compilation to the new guys Android
runtime means your phone will reboot a
lot faster without that painfully slow
optimizing apps process you have to
suffer through with marshmallow
just-in-time compilation also means that
your apps can be updated faster they
require less storage and they use less
RAM that's not bad if you share anywhere
near as many links files and photos as I
do and you have your favorite apps for
doing that and being able to pin your
favorite apps to the top of the Android
share picker is a dream come true
again it's one of those features that
would never make it onto advertising if
Google were really advertised Android in
the first place but it's one of those
great little ideas that make a huge
difference on the daily for anyone that
uses them finally I wanted to give some
props to customization in nuga of course
Android has always been the most
customizable mobile OS but there's
always been more features available in
third-party skins custom roms and
third-party launches then there has been
in vanilla Android but over the last few
releases we've seen more and more of
those features getting baked into stock
Android following on from fingerprint
support battery savers and granular
permissions Mugen now adds a dpi changer
to switch up the size of on-screen
content lets you define how important
notifications from individual apps are
lets you whitelist apps even when in do
not disturb mode and even lets you cut
off internet access for apps running in
the background
plus you've got customizable quick
settings and a bunch of other little
tweaks and options in the system UI
tuner it's an awesome amount of fine
grained control and I absolutely love it
so there's my seven favorite Android 7.0
it features but what are yours hit those
