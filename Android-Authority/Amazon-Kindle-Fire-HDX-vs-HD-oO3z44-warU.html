thority what's going on everybody and
this is the Kindle Fire HDX versus the
Kindle Fire HD at first glance you may
or may not realize that the tablet I
have in my hand is actually the Kindle
Fire HD and that's because it shares a
lot of the same design philosophies of
the HDX however there are a couple key
differences that set apart the HD in the
HDX the HD despite having an IPS screen
just like the HDX has a clear marking of
where the screen is as opposed to the
HDX screen blending right in giving you
that black slave look also at the top of
the HD you don't see a 1.3 megapixel
front facing shooter on there there's no
front facing camera on the HD while the
HDX clearly has one in the front when
you come around the sides it's pretty
much the same story either way you have
that pretty angular curve that goes
upward if you're looking at its face
down that comes up to where the back is
with the Amazon logo covered in soft
touch plastic however the main change
here is that on the HDX
the speaker grilles or at the top when
you're looking at the Amazon logo and
landscape and on the HD they are lower
into the sides of the tablet so that's
the difference there when it comes to
the speaker grilles and then you get the
devices in your hands and though both of
these devices are actually very similar
there's actually a weight difference
between the two the Kindle Fire HD oddly
enough is the heavier of the two despite
the HDX presumably packing more inside
of its body for the most part when
you're using these tablets you're still
able to grip either of them easily and
be able to use them without much trouble
at all the resolution of the HDX is 1920
by 1200 and an IPS screen capable of 323
PPI like I said in the review this 323
PPI keeps text in your ebooks sharp but
also the high resolution makes details
inside of your videos and movies look
really great compare that to the Kindle
Fire HD screen which has a resolution
lower than that of the HDX at 1280 by
800 resolution with 216 pixels per inch
while it doesn't necessarily cause that
much of a pixelation in your text if you
look very very closely you might end up
seeing a difference all videos and
movies too
look good on it but I will say that the
HDX screen does have deeper blacks
allowing it to have better contrast on
the HD it's not quite as contrasting in
thus the colors seem to blend in just a
little bit more and there's not as much
of a darkness to the blacks inside of it
though I do prefer the HDX because of
that higher resolution that provides a
lot of great detail and it's higher
contrast I will say that I did use the
Kindle Fire HD with its lower resolution
screen for quite a while and it still
provided a very very good experience in
terms of performance it's still the same
story when it comes to the mid-range
versus the top-tier the HDX does come
with the Snapdragon 800 that is caught
in a 2.2 gigahertz and is backed by the
adrenal 330 now that's a very good spec
sheet and it allows the HDX to fly and
definitely be a part of the top-tier of
current devices now the Kindle Fire HD
comes with the dual core of 1.2
gigahertz cortex a9 and it's backed by
power VR graphics even though this might
not be a top-tier package it's still
respectable and actually it works quite
well for the very minimalistic fire OS
whereas the Kindle Fire HDX screams
through its elements loads media just
fine and can play plenty of games the HD
on the other hand does stutter through
the fire OS a little bit but it's
nothing that really breaks the
experience the main differences in the
hardware then are the camera and the
speakers in the case of the camera it's
just mainly that the HD doesn't have one
as far as the speakers go it's the
location of the speakers that are
different though I will say that the
Kindle Fire HD does not come with those
dolby enhancements that come with the
HDX the dimension that I mentioned in
the HDX as speakers is still here in the
HD it's kind of hard to argue with dual
speakers when they perform this well all
in all the sound quality is very nice
but there's only one caveat that I have
with the Kindle Fire HD when you're
holding the device with two hands in
landscape mode it is possible for you to
cover up those speakers and maybe lose
the sounds of fidelity a little bit and
finally we make it to software in which
it's kind of easy when it comes to these
two tablets it's because the fire OS the
newest version called mojito is the same
across both boards really there's only
one main difference between the two in
its that the Kindle Fire HD does not
come with the Mayday button so if you're
considering this as a gift for someone
who is
be technologically challenged or if you
feel like you will need a lot of help
with the tablet such as this then maybe
the HDX is a better choice because
whoever it is that's using that tablet
will be able to find their answers
themselves are getting connected
straight to an Amazon customer
representative using the Mayday it's
hard to argue with a tablet had $229
that offers as much as the Kindle Fire
HDX especially when you consider the
Mayday button which may be the make or
break for you for the people in your
life who absolutely need all of that
help however at $139 if you just need a
starter tablet the Kindle Fire HD is
probably the much better choice because
of that price range and also because
it's still a good portal into all of the
content that Amazon has to offer you'll
still have a great time watching movies
TV shows reading books listening to
music the whole nine when it comes to
the Kindle Fire HD so if the extras on
the HDX are what really sway you those
have to be the ones that definitely make
the difference thank you very much for
