enter to win one of these great flagship
phones by simply going to the link in
the description below and participating
in the poll at the bottom of the article
and one of those people will be chosen
to win one of those great flight ships
now no surprise here we're going to
start off with the granddaddy of Android
flagship phones the galaxy s7 and s7
edge and they fixed many of the problems
of the s6 line introduced last year
while they don't offer removable
batteries Samsung did include expandable
storage on both handsets in case the 32
gigabytes of on-board storage isn't
enough for you Samsung mostly stuck to
the same design this time around and
they did shrink down the camera bumps on
the back and made the devices a little
thicker to make room for larger
batteries in terms of specs these are
top-of-the-line smartphones they come
with quad HD Super AMOLED displays a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor 4
gigabytes of RAM a great 12 megapixel
rear facing cameras version of Android
instead of featuring the same screen
sizes this time around though
Samsung kept the s7 at a smaller 5.1
inch why the s7 has bumped up to 5.5
inches now let's talk the Nexus 6p as
the successor to last year's motorola
Nexus 6 Google unveiled the Huawei made
Nexus 6p this device is the higher end
of the two Nexus phones announced at
Google event last year and that's
incredibly apparent when looking at the
spec sheet now it comes with a big 5.7
inch quad HD AMOLED display a super-fast
snapdragon 820 processor a giant 3450
milliamp hour battery and an impressive
12 megapixel rear-facing camera you want
to get your hands on one well the Nexus
P is pretty cheap considering the specs
and build quality you can purchase it
directly from Google starting at just
$499 now let's talk the HTC 10 HTC
needed a saving grace this year and the
10 just may be yet the Taiwanese company
finally designed a phone that's
different enough from its predecessor
yet still sports a familiar design
language with an all metal chassis front
mounted fingerprint sensor and a new and
improved speaker setup the HTC easily
made its way onto our androids best
phone list
the hood the 10 comes with some killer
specs a 5.2 inch quad HD display a
Snapdragon 820 processor 4 gigabytes of
RAM and it's in line with most other
flagships this year and it also comes
with expandable storage up to 200
gigabytes and a 3000 milliamp hour
battery that will have no problems
lasting the entire day on a single
charge
HTC also improved the camera this time
around which was a big flaw in last
year's one m9 flagship now let's talk
about the ever-popular LG g5 the
distinctly different design of the LG g5
may not be for everyone but there's
little denying that LG went out of its
way to try and innovate in a market
where big changes like this aren't very
common anymore spec wise we're looking
at a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor
with 4 gigabytes of RAM a 5.3 inch
display and 32 gigabytes of on-board
storage with micro sd for expansion the
specs here are certainly impressive all
across the board
it's also worth mentioning that LG has
revamped its software making it faster
and less bloated one controversial move
with the software however is the removal
of the app drawer in favour of LG's
quote simplified experience now let's
talk Huawei's p9 Huawei's new p9
flagship certainly takes a lot of the
right boxes and it has a fast processor
plenty of on-board storage a big battery
and is very thin it also runs
marshmallow with Huawei's 4.1 software
overlay as noted by our very own tech
stud gary sims the huawei p9 is a great
smartphone for camera enthusiasts and a
good device for smartphone enthusiasts
it's not a complete overhaul from the
company's p8 flagship from last year but
it is a huge step up right now you can
purchase the p9 in Europe starting at
599 euros though we still haven't seen a
US release just yet now no best Android
list would be complete without the
galaxy note 5 it's hard to nying that
samsung has always been the king of
large screen smartphones and that still
holds true even today with a crystal
clear 5.7 inch display powerful Exynos
7420 cpu and a killer 16 megapixel rear
facing camera the galaxy note 5 is one
of the best Android phones available on
the market right now with all that being
said though this device doesn't come
without its compromises Samsung's
decision to omit the microSD card slot
and remove
battery has been a controversial one
over the past year especially among
Samsung diehard fans even with these
notable emissions though the note 5 can
still be considered one of the best out
there today nearly anything is possible
if you can dream it your team can build
it
makers of collaboration software that
helps your team work better together

results with the flexibility of

messaging and video chat with HipChat
