thinking who is Oppo well Adam China the
mostly known for their blu-ray players
but this time around
Oppo is looking to crack the smartphone
market especially in North America with
this their first entry now when you're
looking to break into a whole new market
sometimes you want to make a really big
entrance and I can assure you that this
is certainly a device that's deserving
of your attention a Georgia regard
Mandarin Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Oppo find five
perhaps on the heels of the philip
chinese manufacturers Huawei and ZTE
Apple wants in on the Western market and
they won't spare any expense the Apple
find five is one in what is expected to
be a long line of devices sporting five
inch screens if the find five is any
indication this is gonna be a really
good mobile year with a sleek white
profile define five definitely has style
when you're getting into a new market
you can start by imitating the best and
reminiscence of the great looking Sony
Xperia phones is definitely welcome here
the screen it's bezel and the area with
the three capacitive buttons are the
only black portions of this phone as the
rest of the body is made up of a clean
white plastic the button layout is
rather unique on this phone as it is
essentially made from devices we know
quite well when in the right hand the
power button is on the Left where your
index finger would land and the volume
rockers are on the opposite side with
your thumb the top of this smartphone
has the headphone jack while the bottom
has an off-center microUSB port the
white trimming then starts on the bottom
and goes around the back up oh those
sideways is in the center of the fine
fives back just don't get confused and
say it is made by auto just like with
various buttons the camera and flash
diode are lined with a very classy
looking silver trim and at the bottom is
the speaker grille this is most
definitely a great looking phone and it
uses simplicity to compensate for its
larger size because the find five sports
a five inch screen the entire form
factor is larger than our common devices
as a result working with one hand on
this phone is a little more difficult
than usual there's a little bit of a
learning curve here and those with small
hands might have to learn on you a few
new tricks like using your pinky to
support the bottom or
getting used to bringing your grip up
the phone away is in order to get a few
tasks done a pose find five is also a
little heavy but it helps the balance of
the phone when it's in your hand that
weight can be your undoing though if you
ever accidentally drop it
Construction is also of a pretty
top-notch quality there are no flimsy
parts and the smoothness across the
entire device as a really professional
and classy appeal to an already
good-looking phone the size might take
some getting used to but I'm certain
you'll get some compliments on the large
screen and the sleek looks speaking of
the screen it is certainly one of the
main attractions the IPS display is five
inches large and can display 16 million
colors at 1080p perhaps the best part
about this screen however is the pixel
density coming in at 441 PPI this is
probably the sharpest screen I have ever
had the pleasure of using text is
rendered incredibly well even when
zoomed all the way in and colors look so
nice on this display so anything with
massive amounts of detail will be done
more than enough justice the mark of a
great screen is clarity under pretty
much any other condition a very good
level of brightness allows the
incredible display to be seen under
direct sunlight but the real impressive
feat deals with the viewing angles
rotate the phone pretty much as far and
as many degrees as you can and the
screen will be visible and legible and
nonetheless you might mistake the
display for a sticker that's plastered
onto the glass my only real critique on
the display would be the color
temperature I kind of expected the white
and brighter colors to really pop out
and shine through the screen but by
putting an overall warmer tone over the
display things seem a little less
aggressive and a lot more laid back it
doesn't detract from the achievement
that is Oppo screen on the find 5 but I
just would have loved to see it fully
taken advantage of but you know what I
won't be too critical because it
certainly is being taken advantage of by
everything underneath the hood the find
5 being a post first foray into the
smartphone market needed to really make
its mark by appealing to pretty much any
kind of user so it is packing some
serious power with the fastest
processing package available on
smartphones today the fine 2/5 has the
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro processor
backed up by an Adreno 320
Graphics unit the icing on top of the
cake however is the two gigabytes of RAM
for multitasking boot up is pretty quick
and the simplistic UI flies through its
elements Gaming is incredible on the
find five as the powerful specs power
games through the incredible screen it's
perhaps the most enjoyable gaming
experience I've had on a phone even if
the larger form factor has its
disadvantages they are more than made up
by the enjoyment you'll have harnessing
all of this power benchmark tests have
put the processor and graphics
performances among the best performers
in the market today and tutu puts the
Oppo find 5 among top smartphones like
the lg optimus G and the Nexus 4 and to
further show the graphics prowess this
benchmark using Epic Citadel shows the
fine 5 just coasting through the Unreal
Engine if this is going to be the story
for the line of 5-inch screen phones
coming this year we may have to start
differentiating between the larger
devices and the current smaller ones 16
gigabytes of memory are what you get in
the base model of the fine 5 and this is
where the specifications take an
increasingly common turn you can notice
that the back cover is not removable and
thus there's no way of taking out the
battery or expanding the memory luckily
with the find 5 being a flagship device
Oppo did well to pump more than the
standard 8 gigabytes of space into this
wonderful phone moving further along
this line the battery has been given a
boost as well to compensate for the
larger screen and the great power
normally batteries have a fraction of
the capacity that the find 5s has saved
for maybe the Motorola RAZR MAXX
nonetheless the 2500 mAh battery is able
to keep the find v running for really
quite a long time even though I wasn't
using a mobile network the find 5 uses
HSPA+ connectivity which is less battery
intensive than LTE so a 16 hour day over
viewing this phone was never interrupted
by the need to charge that kind of
battery life especially for a larger
phone rivals some of the best that
current regular sized devices have so
this is very impressive indeed the lack
of LTE is probably the only real gap in
the connectivity that the find v is
capable of while it is geared for all 3G
networks
Ches PA plus is this GSM phones networks
of choice and it is unknown if there
will ever be any LTE variants otherwise
we have Wi-Fi Bluetooth and the standard
fare of extra capabilities NFC does
become more useful for the find v due to
the inclusion of some NFC tags that you
can use for quick changes of your
settings and then we come to the
software which gets some credit off the
bat because it is already at least the
first iteration of jellybean 4.1 it has
heavily changed from stock however due
to a bose custom UI and if you think it
looks familiar
you would be right many of the elements
found in the Oppo UI are like that found
in the custom Romney UI unlike me UI
however there is a dedicated app drawer
shown after hitting the icon for it and
I like how it just fades into what seems
like the original home screens but is in
reality a list of all of your installed
applications this seamless and
simplistic interface is helped by the
ubiquitously we used round square icons
another quality taken from me UI these
icons are all high resolution too in
order to take advantage of the 1080p
screen
I prefer stock Android but I can't deny
how clean things look on the Oppo UI
even if things seem just a little bit
bloated and space could have been
populated a little bit better
it still looks quite neat menus have a
categorical design as headers on the top
house various related settings swipe
left and right to look at them there is
a level of customization involved though
this test unit did not give me too many
options at the moment finally we have
the lockscreen which is like a simple
glass panel that you rotate with a quick
flick revealing your home screens
thereafter so the UI further shows some
of the appeal defined 5 has simplicity
cleanly hiding a plethora of features
and a lot of power underneath it's a
motif that works and I'm certainly a fan
the only part about the software that I
find weird
besides the usage or lack thereof of the
screen real estate which really isn't a
huge problem is the included widgets
they are functional but they have an odd
blob design as the backgrounds that
seemed like a little bit of a departure
from the motifs we were seeing here but
that's just my thought
and finally we have the camera this
phone has gone big in a number of key
ways and the 13 megapixel optics are
another example of this however as we
have learned with other high-end phones
high megapixel count doesn't necessarily
mean higher quality it is a good camera
but it is just as good as others and not
really much better pictures taken in
good lighting as is typical yield nice
usable pictures with well rendered
colors and good detail as you take away
the lighting the grain appears the flash
diode does help in these situations but
the camera doesn't always do well with
highlights the shutter to picture speed
is quite good making this camera a
capable companion for you when you need
to snap that quick pic extra features
include HDR and a couple of interesting
frame rate manipulations for video
though only at a 480p the camera is able
to record at 120 frames per second which
is either used for fast motion or
conformed to 30fps for slow motion
here's me doing some awesome pen tricks
yeah it is a nice feature to have fun
with but obviously it's not the most
practical and so there you have it Oppo
has gotten a lot of things right with
its first foray into the android market
with incredible power underneath one of
the best screens on a mobile device
today this is a phone that should
definitely have your attention it is
unknown if the find 5 will make it to
any specific carriers especially in
North America but for now the website is
where you can get the smartphone at
$4.99 it is cheaper than a lot of other
16 gigabyte smartphones out there but it
is still a hefty tag after that however
you do get one of the best unlocked
phones in existence right now if 2013 is
going to be the year of the 5-inch
screen then we have right here the
year's first blockbuster for all of the
Oppo find 5 news stay tuned to android
