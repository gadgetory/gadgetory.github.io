plus 6 is a pretty serious security flaw
that allows anyone to bypass it's locked
bootloader but a fix is on the way a
security researcher named Donna Feld has
discovered a vulnerability on the 1 plus
6 that lets you bypass the phones locked
bootloader with any modified boot image
you do need physical access to the phone
to take advantage of the vulnerability
but oneplus has said they are aware of
it and will soon be pushing out a
software update to fix the issue now if
you remember a week or so ago I was
talking about how some Google employees
have quit their jobs in protest over
Google's involvement in military-grade
artificial intelligence for the US
government well Google has responded
with their AI principles it's titled AI
at Google our principles and they are
made up of seven AI objectives and a
section about AI applications that the
company will not pursue in the post
Google also acknowledges the significant
impact
AI will have on society and said that it
feels a deep responsibility to get AI
right now here are those principles be
socially beneficial avoid creating or
reinforcing unfair bias be built and
tested for safety be accountable to
people incorporate privacy design
principles uphold high standards of
scientific excellence be made available
for uses that accord with these
principles so what do you think of
Google's principles what do I think
well the older I get the more cautious
and suspicious I become you see Google
doesn't have to be accountable to anyone
except for their shareholders and their
shareholders don't want principles they
want bank so when they say things like
be accountable to the people what people
and and how does that accountability
manifest itself by writing letters is
they just relying on journalists tech
tech media how does that actually work
Google doesn't have to actually answer
to anyone except their shareholders
they're their actual real-life
accountability does not a core
with exercising or implementing these
principles
call me jaded that's just what I think
it's good PR and it placates those who
don't really want to press them too hard
what do you think let me know right
there but let's talk Oppo remember Oppo
well Oppo seems to be coming out with a
new flagship that's very similar to
another one a Weibo tipster published
what seems to be an official Oppo find
teaser image complete with a few specs
scattered at the bottom of the image
these specs specifically mentioned they
snap shark an 845 chipset 8 gigabytes of
RAM 256 gigabytes of storage this would
make the find XA match for the top-end 1
plus 6 which offers the same chipset RAM
and storage capacity but that isn't the
only speculate tena listing that since
been deleted was spotted by playful drew
in a few days ago and it gives us a
stack of potential details the outlet
noted a 2.8 gigahertz octa-core chipset
the same clock speed as the 845
Snapdragon 800 bytes of RAM 128
gigabytes of storage and a 16 and 20
megapixel dual camera pairing other
specs include a twenty five megapixel
selfie camera 25 megapixels and a 3645
milliamp hour battery we can only wait
for the official reveal to find out if
these specs are the real deal so what do
you guys think of that there's also some
rumors that the Oppo find X will have
some sort of fast charging capability
also a five time optical zoom do those
things excite you let me know in the
