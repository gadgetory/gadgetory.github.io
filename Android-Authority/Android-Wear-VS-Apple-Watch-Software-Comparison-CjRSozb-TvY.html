Android authority and apples take on
what a SmartWatch should be is finally
here but how does it stack up to
Google's Android wear well let's go
ahead and compare the two and see what's
similar what's different and find out so
just as a quick disclaimer this is going
to be more or less a software comparison
because the hardware will vary based on
which Andrew where SmartWatch you have
before the sake of this video we'll be
using the LG watch urbane because it's
currently the only Android wear
SmartWatch to be running the latest
5.1.1 update with the 5.1 update both
Android wear and Apple's watch OS 1.0
could it be more similar to one another
aesthetically they may look very
different but when you boil it all down
these wearable os's do practically the
same thing
both send and receive notifications
answer phone calls track fitness data
and have customizable watch faces on top
of a laundry list of other things and
most importantly they still tell the
time that isn't to say that there aren't
any differences there definitely are and
even their similarities have differences
like James Franco said in the movie the
interview there same same but different
let's start with how each OS handles
notifications with Android wear
notifications show up in a card style
format that pile up in a vertical list
as more and more notifications are
received all of them can easily be
dismissed with a simple swipe and many
of them are actionable like sending a
reply to a text message or email
deleting them or opening the respective
application on the phone directly from
the watch with apples watch OS anytime a
notification arrives it'll briefly pop
up on the display and disappear if you
happen to miss the notification or want
to see all of your notifications at a
single glance you can swipe down from
the top of the display to reveal the
notification shade and also dismiss them
from here
unlike Android wear only certain
notifications can be responded to from
the watch making notifications on the
Apple watch feels slightly less robust
apps like hangouts and Gmail will
require you to open them on the phone
notifications from apps like Apple zone
iMessage can be responded to what they
can message or voice dictation speaking
of voice dictation just like their phone
OS counterparts on Android where you're
dealing with Google now and Siri on the
Apple watch as to which one you'd prefer
that'll be purely up to you but with
Google now integration on Android wear
this means any cards that you normally
get on your phone or tablet like sports
scores stocks and weather will also show
up on your watch
Siri doesn't necessarily offer that for
the Apple watch but swiping up from the
bottom of the display will reveal what
Apple calls glances which can offer a
lot of the same type of information that
one might get from Google now glance is
also a hub for a bunch of other things
like MIDI controls navigation and even
Instagram and Twitter if you'd like for
fitness junkies both os's are capable of
tracking calories burned exercise
heartrate and the Apple watch will even
remind you to stand if it thinks you've
been sitting idle for too long there's
possibly a third party Android wear app
that does the same thing but the
out-of-the-box experience doesn't offer
this feature watch faces are also highly
customizable on either OS but as of
right now there's many more options on
Android wear which is most likely due to
the open nature of the platform and it's
third-party support but along with the
appearance watch faces on both can be
customized to show pertinent information
like battery life current date and
weather among many other things with the
5.1 update Google added some new
features to Android wear like Wi-Fi
support to allow the watch to sync
without a Bluetooth connection risk
gestures to scroll through notifications
by flicking the wrist screen lock a
dedicated app and contact screen and the
ability to send emojis with the
exception of Wi-Fi support and wrist
gestures all of these features are also
available on the Apple watch but again
both OS is handled them differently for
example screen lock on Android wear is a
pattern whereas on the Apple watch it's
a pin and the apps on Android wear is a
simple vertical scrolling list versus a
series of floating circles on a black
background on the Apple watch which may
look confusing at first but it's
actually a lot easier to navigate than
you might
these differences are rather negligible
but their differences nonetheless the
biggest difference between these two
wearable platforms is how they both feel
Android wear feels like a companion to
your smartphone by only giving you the
essentials without being a full-on
distraction while the Apple watch feels
like it's trying to be a miniaturized
version of your phone because it
practically does everything your phone
can do including taking phone calls
directly from the watch and making
purchases with Apple pay most of the
disparity really has to do with the app
selection even though the Apple watch is
still very new there's already a wide
selection of applications available that
you won't find on Android wear at least
not right now while you may receive
notifications from Instagram and Twitter
on your wrist with Android wear you
still have to pull out your phone to
access the application with the Apple
watch you can actually scroll through
Instagram or Twitter and like comment
favorite and retweet just like you would
on the full-blown app and even uber a
car ride all without taking your phone
out of your pocket
surely this could all change in the
future as these two wearable operating
systems go head-to-head and evolve the
same way their mobile operating system
counterparts have evolved both have
their advantages and disadvantages and
while they share a lot in common the
experiences are very different and it's
going to come down to personal
preference just like it always has in
this never-ending war of mobile
operating systems or I guess in this
case wearable operating systems as
