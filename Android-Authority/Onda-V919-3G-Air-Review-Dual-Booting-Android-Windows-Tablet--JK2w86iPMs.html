new tablet are you confused don't know
whether to buy one with Windows or with
Android what about a tablet that can run
both ok then hi there everybody my name
is Gary Sims manager authority and today
we're going to be looking at the under
v9 1-9 3g air an intel-based nine point
seven inch tablet the dual boots into
both Android and Windows 8.1 like many
Chinese OEM tablets that on the v9 1-9
air is clearly trying to mimic the iPad
air the dimensions are almost exactly
the same as the iPad air and its overall
look is very similar to the iPad air
even down to the bottom speaker grilles
that flank the microUSB port the power
button and the volume rocker are on the
right-hand side just like the iPad air
on the front panel there is a circular
home button again just like the iPad on
the back there is a plastic cover which
when opened reveals slots for the SIM
card and the SD card and some metal
strips presumably for the antennae again
the placement of the cover on the top
edge next to the rear-facing camera is
very similar to the iPad of course there
are some significant differences first
the on d'ervy nine one nine shell is
made of plastic second the device is
slightly thicker than the iPad air and
third the processor in the V nine one
nine air isn't an ARM based process I
like the iPad or even the Nexus 9 it is
an Intel chip the result is that the
under v nine one nine can run Android
and Windows 8.1 but I'll talk more about
that later one problem I did find with
the design is that the circular home
button is very sensitive it only
requires a slightest of touches for it
to activate what this means is when
holding the tablet in a landscape
my thumb kept touching the button and
taking me to the home screen this can be
very annoying at first I thought that
the tablet software was unstable and the
apps kept crashing and dumping me back
into the home screen however I
eventually worked out my thumb was to
blame adjusting how I held the tablet
finally solve the problem
ever even though I'm conscious of how I
need to hold the tablet I still find
that my thumb gets too close to that
very sensitive home button this tablet
has a nine point seven inch display with
a qxga resolution in other words 2048 by
1536 this means it has a four by three
screen ratio just like the iPad and also
like the Nexus 9 this translates into a
pixel density of 264 PPI now some people
prefer tablets with a 16 by 10 screen
ratio because more the display is used
when watching widescreen movies however
the four by three display ratio is
certainly a popular alternative the on
that uses an IPS display which yields
good viewing angles the color
reproduction is good and the screenings
are bright however one disappointment is
the tablet doesn't have a light sensor
which means there is no automatic
brightness option available as I
mentioned earlier at the heart of the
onder v9 193 GA is an Intel processor
not an ARM based processor as found in
the majority of Android devices in this
particular case it is an intel atom
z3580 in terms of usability the
performance of the v9 193 GA was good
the UI always directed quickly in games
like Epic Citadel were able to achieve
at least 50 frames per second video
playback is smooth and I didn't
experience any lags or annoying pauses
while using the device if you want more
details on specific benchmarks then
please check out the written review this
tablet comes with a 6200 milliamp hour
battery it's hard to theorize about the
battery life from just the raw milliamp
hour number unfortunately the battery
life wasn't as good as I had hoped for
example if I charge up the battery fully
to 100% rebooted the tablet to make sure
there were no programs running and then
left it for repair of about 10 or 11
hours over 30% of the battery was used
when the tablet was sleeping according
to the battery diagrams but 51% of this
was taken up by the Android system this
certainly indicated there is some
optimization that needs to happen
I ran some tests to see how the device
would do on a different loads and my
tests showed that you get 4.1 hours of
YouTube streaming 2.7 hours of playing a
3d game like Epic Citadel and 3.7 hours
of playing simpler 2d games the speaker
on the v9 190 nothing special it does
its job in that it produces sound
however don't expect anything amazing
also the speaker grills don't seem to
have any relation to the actual speaker
covering both grills only reduces the
sound marginally here is a sample so you
can judge for yourself
the tablet has built-in support for 3G
for details about the frequencies and
for various compatibility with carries
around the world please check out the
written review as you'd expect the
device also has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0
the v9 1:9 comes with 2 gigabytes of RAM
which the most supported by this
particular Intel processor and either 32
or 64 gigabytes of storage depending on
which model you buy my test unit has 32
gigabytes of storage the thing to
remember is that the device comes
pre-installed with two operating systems
Android and Windows 8.1 the internal
storage is split between Android and
Windows with some space being used for
the actual operating systems themselves
and the remaining being divided up as
usable storage between the two
environments under Android this 32 gig
model has around 6 gigabytes of space
for installing apps and for storing your
own files under Windows the free space
for drive C was around 8 point 5
gigabytes this means that the rest is
you to hold the 2 oasis however the
numbers don't seem to add up quite right
I'm left with a feeling there is a large
chunk of flash memory somewhere that is
not being utilized correctly in terms of
what is missing this tablet is very
short on sensors of any kind it has an
accelerometer and that's about it
there's no GPS no NFC and no compass for
most people is probably isn't a problem
however many 3G Nabal tablets that are
on the market today come with at least
GPS so that would have been a nice
addition the cameras on the v9 when on
are very basic the rear facing camera
has a 5 megapixel sensor and the front
facing camera has a 2 megapixel sensor
personally I find the front-facing
camera the most important on a tablet as
it's useful for video conferencing with
applications like Skype the rear camera
is good considering that this is a
tablet and it only has a 5 megapixel
sensor the color reproduction is fairly
faithful and the camera works well
indoors and outdoors having said that
you aren't going to win any photo
competitions with this
unfortunately the front-facing camera is
very bad as you can see by these sample
photos the colors blur easily there
seems to be lots of distortion and
particularly low-light there's lots and
lots of noise the bundled camera app is
very very simple and offers little more
than the very basic operations if you do
use the camera more than occasionally
then you'll probably want to store a
third-party app if you want to see more
sample shots from the camera then please
check out the written review the link is
in the description below the key selling
point of the under v9 1:9 3g air it is
dual blue to bility the device comes
pre-installed with Android 4.4 KitKat
and Windows 8.1 with Bing
each OS has a way to cause the device to
reboot into the other operating system
under Android there is a OS switch icon
on the notification blind and on Windows
there is the dual OS switcher program
which is on the toolbar by default the
supplied version of Android is failing
vanilla except for the launcher on there
has included its own launcher which
doesn't include an app straw-like the
iPad all the icons are on the screen and
you need to organize everything into
folders the under launcher also includes
a theme switcher which allows you to
pick one of five pre-installed themes
including funny board and childhood
dream if you don't like the launcher
then the good news is that this is
Android and you can easily replace it
with one of your choice there are also a
few included apps including a neat Wi-Fi
configuration program and the LPA L
configurator for Intel's always listing
technology you are meant to be able to
set a voice trigger that allows you to
wake your tablet using your voice
however I could get it to work
as for Windows the installed version
runs as expected I won't talk too much
about how hard Windows 8.1 is to use
without a mouse and a keyboard but that
isn't the fault of onda I was able to
install programs like chrome and VLC
without any problem and the default
window camera app worked reasonably well
with the rear facing camera there wasn't
a toggle to switch the front-facing
camera however programs like Skype found
the front-facing camera without any
problems
unfortunately some bits of the UI keep
appearing in Chinese having fiddled with
the regional settings etc I thought I'd
set everything to English but still from
time to time I get a window with Chinese
writing in it the tablet comes with a
micro SD card slot and the card is
shared between Windows and Android this
means that files copied into the card in
one OS are available under the other I
was able to install Windows programs on
the micro SD card by installing them
under D :
however there was no option under this
build of Android to move apps to the SD
card you can get it on there v9 193 G
err from geek buying for just 225
dollars that's for the 32 gig model the
64 gig model will cost you 240 dollars
but it's currently only on presale but
it will be available from February the
25th the 32 gig model is available now
well there it is a dual booting Android
and Windows tablet I'd love to know we
think about the concept I'd love to know
