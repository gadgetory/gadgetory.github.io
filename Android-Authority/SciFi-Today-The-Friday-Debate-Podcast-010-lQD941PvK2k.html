Friday debate podcast episode number ten
now when I told myself that I was going
to do a podcast for android authority I
knew that there were going to be some
challenges and that was what i was going
to really be excited about sure enough
i've had a great time already with the
challenges I has presented I've learned
a new form of editing with the audio and
everything but scheduling has obviously
been one of the more difficult aspects
of the Friday debate podcast that being
said I ran into some technical
difficulties last week when I thought
that I had the scheduling down on Pat I
ran into some syncing issues with my own
personal audio so what you're hearing
now and I will apologize ahead of time
for the quality of this particular
podcast what you're hearing is the rock
capture using the program that I used to
record our skype calls so you're going
to hear maybe not necessarily the
quality that is up to my standard for
the podcast but also some of the little
sounds that skype does when we're
messaging each other side of the chat
but nonetheless I just wanted to go
ahead and give you that small little
warning about what you're about to hear
actually to me it sounds quite fine but
you know I just kind of hold myself to a
particular standard when it comes to the
quality of everything I put out but
nonetheless it is nice to have a nice
little back-up plan when it comes to
getting the audio out for you guys and
after trying to figure it out and kind
of coming to the solution i am bringing
you a double feature this week with the
episode 10 of the friday debate that was
recorded last week along with this
week's friday debate as you're going to
hear it either at the same time as i'm
releasing this or a little bit later
today or at the latest tomorrow on
saturday we talked about sci-fi
technology that we may have grown up
with and how technology has kind of
evolved over time and whether or not to
the technology that we grew up with has
finally made it to our hands and let's
say to our eyes and ears has made it to
our day today I am joined by our usual
panel we have andrew grush who created
this topic or rather got the inspiration
from one of our fellow riders as you'll
hear in the podcast and we also hear
from Jonathan Feist and Joe Hindy as
always keep it tuned to android
authority across all social media
networks and make sure that you are on
the friday debate podcast on your
podcasting programs but you can always
go to the youtube version
of it of course if you don't happen to
use podcast programs and if you are
there thank you so much for watching but
make sure you try to get us in a even
more easily digestible format which is
of course the audio version on podcast
networks we are going to move into
getting some of your user feedback from
us not just feedback but questions and
different topics you might want us to
talk about now that we are in double
digits for the episodes of the fdp
without any further ado once again this
is the friday debate podcast episode
number ten sci-fi today as I called it
hope you guys enjoy I don't know if
anyone any of you guys saw my tweet from
a couple days ago but I am I'm doing
something that I've always dreamed of
doing but I didn't realize it until very
recently guys ago is that well I
don't know um so I'm so on Sunday on a
whim originally created by my girlfriend
thank god bless her and thank God for
her it was her idea and I had never even
thought of it up until she said it but
on Sunday I'm driving up to San Jose
with my girlfriend and we're going to
Wrestlemania oh it's awesome yeah people
I've never been to a wrestling event and
suddenly I'm going to Wrestlemania is
the first 1i max you picking like so we
just went online and we found tickets
for not too much we're obviously not
gonna be like close to the ring or
anything like that but I'm super stoked
and I'm i remember i tweeted out guys
i'm going to Wrestlemania and like a
bunch of my twitter follower just kind
of went nuts because people know from my
videos and I'm a wrestling fan I think I
went to a Smackdown when I was a kid and
they're pretty fun life because you'll
get the censorship or like the cuts or
anything like that well of course it is
WrestleMania it's a pay-per-view event
so you're not gonna get the cuts anyway
even if when you watch it but when you
do when you go to like the televised
ones you don't have to deal with like
the commercials and they swear a whole
lot more than they do on television
that's for sure well give your not down
dusan given how many kids are in the
audience nowadays and it's like they had
to PG era for a while but what year did
you go to smackdown this is my curiosity
oh man see 1996
1997 I think yeah during the added 20 i
think is right before the attitude era
during it or something it was pretty you
know it was a not exactly kid-friendly
back then yeah exactly but that's the
area that we all miss and adore um but
yeah that's just like what's gonna
happen and then a couple weeks from now
I'm actually gonna pop up to Seattle for
for a four-day weekend so um but until
then I got a lot of work to end up doing
I haven't heard from feisty over their
houses how are things going on your end
then as well just enjoying the warm
weather it's been rainy this week but we
woke up this morn crazy crazy fog almost
like I've never seen around here before
and then the skies cleared in a
beautiful day so other than that you
know things have been great though
you've been focusing more and more of my
time on the tab Times website that's a
lot of fun you guys if you don't know by
now I love my tablet so this is a great
fit I'm loving it I come to you now from
a tablet already humming oh sorry about
that yeah feisty over there the one who
like goes into the great unknown and
does our podcast from a tablet like well
he doesn't even own a computer yes
doesn't he is a typewriter is what
deptford much now he has a Chromebook
that's not it i mean it's a computer but
it's not like a traditional computer hmm
i would say yet i have it booting over
into the bun to operating system sure
sure i would debate that that makes it a
computer yeah but you can't do video
editing or anything that you're gonna
need to be doing eventually it it's not
powerful enough to do so but it is a
pible I've done you out I've done video
editing before on an ubuntu laptop and
it's not easy at all well i'm assuming
that was probably eight you know
decently expect a bungee laptop where is
it is really for the time this was
probably like six years ago or something
but I just remember finding the video
editing software in it and it was so
what would be what are they even i would
say what even programs do they use local
Tino is k Ino
pokeno and if there are people out there
who are thinking like I was about to put
the question out there what's the worst
video editing software and a lot of
people probably say something like
Windows Movie Maker this was worse than
this is worse than Windows Movie Maker
sonos Sony Vegas Pro is pretty bad
really I use that yeah I used to firm up
my first few videos of an android
authority it's just it's one of those it
there's not a lot of structure to it
it's very just like here's your timeline
do stuff there you know like no
sequences no or other I think there were
presets but I'd never figured out how to
use them but it just it didn't seem like
very strong software to me like when I
moved to premier pros like this is what
I've been missing yeah hard to be
premiere pro so she after um I mean I
mean I know everyone still like there
are a lot of people Mac users to still
use like Final Cut Pro and stuff and to
be honest I want to see what all the
fuss is about because every like the
people who use that swear by it
meanwhile they're the rest of us who
swore by Adobe but yeah I mean we were
mentioning feisty being a Chromebook guy
then do it do do you Joe or Andrew do
you guys have Chromebooks no I have no
reason to buy one hmm I I've considered
them I mean just as like a backup device
cuz you know I like new shiny things but
you know hon but not for any practical
reason I mean because I have you know
tons of I have my laptop I have a
desktop computer i have several laptops
that are within you know anywhere from
one to four years old that are just
laying around that can pretty much do
the same thing so it'd be kind of a
waste of money for me but i do believe i
used to not like them at all i was to
think they're pointless i'm not gonna
lie but I've seen that change I think
they do have a place so you didn't do a
pointless because I don't know long idea
was that also what is it or is it a
worthy worthy let's say evolution of the
laptop that we were expecting because
I'm I wasn't too sure about it either a
fully cloud-based computer it makes
sense where we are in technology right
now but I wasn't sure myself either well
yes and no I mean some of the reasons
why i am now more interested in chrome
books
past is that they've I don't want to say
they moved away from that vision but
they have relented a little you know now
they're starting to have you know
android apps and so I think even Google
realizes that pure cloud isn't there yet
I think it could be some day but I you
know it's just it's a bold vision and I
you know I applauded google even when
they were even when I'm not wasn't a fan
of Chromebooks i still have plotted the
idea that they were trying something
different and I'd you know I always
believed they had potential to do well
they just aren't necessarily what I need
but for someone who wants a worry-free
computer experience and it's just
looking up internet and stuff but wants
to display bigger than you know they're
gonna find on a tablet or a phone or
they need a keyboard it's great i think
you know and a cheap i mean you know try
to get something for that price in the
windows world yes you can but try to get
one that doesn't suck yeah the
performance of a you know 200 ish dollar
Chromebook is generally better you know
i have used them i just don't own one
they're generally better performance
than what you're going to pay even three
or four hundred dollars for in the
windows world yeah and the uh it's it
may not be something that we thought
growing out that we would see that you
know because you know we growing up
we've talked about this before we know
we've had our computers growing up that
are huge and that the big loggers the
compacts of the world and everything and
who knew where technology was going to
go but it looks like we are still going
to have moments like that where
technology will go places that we're not
too sure like if it's going to continue
in that trajectory or maybe we're super
excited by what comes out and that's
sort of the topic that we have for here
so Andrew at once again thank you for
putting together the topic for this week
I want to give credit by real quick on I
did refine it a bit but way it was
worded whatnot but actually a one of our
writers Matthew Benson was the one who
actually suggested this to me oh right
well thanks nice to met um for sure so
we're talking about I'm that the title
as our as our listeners and viewers on
the YouTube section are going to see i
called it sci-fi today and i couldn't
think of a better title so if it's super
cheesy i go oh I like it okay well there
you go
we have a lot of technologies coming out
right now that seem to be not
impossibility but it's not really stuff
that we thought we would see in the
consumer space so so early or even you
know for a little while everything from
virtual reality experiences that's
really becoming a thing for sure
augmented reality and foldable displays
or curved displays in the case of a
couple of phones that we've had so what
sci-fi technology were most excited to
see and how it might be applied to
Android in specific or even just mobile
devices in the future so that's pretty
much our topic I wanted to start off our
discussion on this on this particular
topic by asking all of you guys and
anyone can chime in whenever growing up
were there any pieces of technology from
shows like all throg examples like the
Jetsons for example or even like Iron
Man were there anything is growing up
that you really wish that we had that we
would have today but for some reason we
don't get paired stones but the
Flintstones had that dinosaur at the
sink was cleaning dishes lets you there
buddy Pisces like is that not enjoy the
opposite direction you know these
lessons had all kinds of those really
awesome dinosaurs like I when I was a
kid I saw the Jetsons meet the
flintstones and like there's there's
like there's like a bird that like you
smack the bird upside the head and it
breaks coconuts for you like no I'm
totally with feisty on this and I will
defend it to the grave I would love to
have dinosaurs and prehistoric birds
like open coconuts did dishes and stuff
that'd be awesome so what Feist is
getting at is he wants genetic
engineering oh yes you are here so we
can genetically engineer a dinosaur
wonderheart everyone yeah but the wants
of genetically engineered to help us
apparently docile with uh with the
inhibitor chip in the brain or something
okay that's that's some that's some
awkward territory I'm sorry I didn't
mean to throw us off course yeah did say
I did say in the original when we talked
about this that we should stay semi
grounded reality but also Flintstones
thank you well
i'm feisty did you have a I know Joe
blurted it out jet packs but we'll get
to that in a second feisty did you have
a tech based one from from from growing
up you prefer childhood that you wish we
had today um you know there was a lot of
James Bond tech that really appealed to
me to be honest that you know invisible
cars that sort of stuff okay so Joe it's
uh it's jet packs for you man yeah man
because like that's one of those things
that it's been in the news like every
other year for my entire life like oh
yeah we're this close to jet packs we're
this close to jet packs and jetpacks
don't frickin exist yet like what's the
holdup at this point you know like I
remember like both oh yeah really I
remember like being like 15 years old
surfing the web it like the library at
my school and like seeing a news article
that was like there is a guy who has a
jetpack that works it just weighs as
much as a car and I figured you know
like you know week we had a you know we
have mobile processors now or you know
system-on-a-chip that are like you know
less than the size of a fingernail and
we haven't figured out a way to condense
jetpack technology to make it actually
work I'm disappointed in science well if
I could if I could be letting me down if
I could put out one thing that I think
that we're comparing apples to oranges
there I know that we have processing
that is incredible now and our computing
skills are through the roof these days
but you know that doesn't quite equate
to jet propulsion which is I know I know
I know I know it's the whole Moore's Law
thing I get that but you know it's just
it just doesn't seem like there's enough
people working on jetpacks I think more
people should be a should be working it
really seems like a cool thing to me
right like I feel fueling things still
hasn't evolved I mean and we've had this
discussion already when it comes like
batteries in mobile devices if we're
gonna bring it back to mobile but in
general fueling things seems to be one
way or no way you know it's gonna be gas
which we're running out of if it's a
like if it's electric then the gas
companies will just come in and say no
we own everything um but yeah to me it
feels like fueling something like that
that's where the hiccup is and and also
the whole idea that I could blow
it does yeah kill the person's risk
wheel that is a risk all of us jetpack
aficionados will take gladly JEP extra
nuts they doing this to the form you
just have to have money right lots and
lots and lots pay but you know like you
know I was for me remember being 15 and
being like man when I'm 30 years old I'm
gonna jet pack to the grocery store it's
gonna be me and what's sad is the only
when I was 15 it was like 2002 and I my
current Lee drive a car that's older
than I was you know but I Drive a 97 you
know free and Mercury I don't have a jet
pack if it makes me sad I'm sad panda
and now I'm imagining a sad panda with a
jetpack that's sputtering it won't turn
on a rock and I was an old flash game a
rocket panda look it up it's terrible
it's a classic game you guys should
check it out it's just shitty but it you
should take it the song is catchy the
song is very kitchen oh ok i will you
grow see how uh where do you land on all
of these technologies that we don't have
yet I'm telling you he's not landing
there on a jet pack sorry sorry all
right things that from my childhood
you're talking about that about shows
and whatnot I actually Jetsons was a big
one for me and particularly some of the
stuff that I was fascinated by have
actually happened um you know like Rudy
I thought Rudy you know the talking
computer I thought the idea of a
computer that could actually interact
with you and you know did be an
assistant to help you the things was
really cool and yeah we're not really
there yet but we're starting to be there
you know artificial intelligence has
come a long way you know digital
assistants yeah it's kind of you know
Google now and stuff is primitive
compared to something like in the
Jetsons but it's it's a start you know
and then actually another one that we at
the time wasn't possible was that I add
the idea of like video conferencing you
know they saw him Jetsons where the TV
would show up and it would you know and
they would talk I thought that was
really cool little did I know that
wasn't that far away you don't want it's
a kid but you know it was still not
feasible back then you know back when
you had you know slow dial-up internet
you weren't going to have a video
hunting situation yeah right and until
it's actually some of stuff I wanted has
happened you know I'm not saying there
isn't there's tons of things I want now
but you know as far as some childhood I
don't know maybe I wasn't thinking big
enough I mean yeah there were little
things like flying car and stuff yes it
does what I was thinking was flying cars
like I ok so perhaps in Joe's case he
wants to be the thing that flies but but
I would be I would be good with a flying
car and I don't know it we have this we
have this this this inclination in the
tech world to have things that we desire
having and it's only an idea but the
moment you ask somebody like oh well how
do you do that no one knows how to
answer that question um and flying cars
i think falls under that category which
which is the reason why I'm disappointed
that no one has really thought about
that yet well I mean there has been I
mean like when i was a teen I was really
into the idea flying cars because it
seemed like they were not that far off I
mean there's been so many prototypes uh
there's a guy in particular I think his
name was John Muller and he had like
three or four different designs that he
showed off like didn't go very high or
whatever but they did work to an extent
but he kept saying oh it's gonna be sold
this year and then it then the next year
the oh it's gonna be on the market this
year and it basically became vaporware
you know no and so there are people
working on it but I mean honestly now
that I'm older even though I think it's
cool I think I realized that it's kind
of in a practical thing you know I think
that the idea of self-driving cars and
stuff is actually more plausible at this
stage and probably safer then you know
having us all in a bunch of airplanes
yeah which is which is an interesting
topic to bring up in terms of I I did a
I did a talk with a few few buddies in
the tech space just a quick shout out to
trisha hershberger who who was the one
who invited me to come out for a video
that she was doing and no judge I think
she also just got engaged so
congratulations Trisha but we had a
discussion about how stuff like
autonomous cars as nvidia calls it or
self-driving cars which is how everyone
else will call it they they could put
people out of jobs they could they know
this kind of technology could eventually
make it a lot harder for people to just
be people and it's interesting topic I
think we would we would revisit that may
be a little bit later i'm not too sure
but you know just I mean anything I have
to say though that pretty much that that
sentiment can be applied to almost every
technology that's ever happened oh yeah
you know I mean even going back to like
you know textile mills and stuff from
the you know they put people out of jobs
that you know I don't know I think
sometimes you have to take a few you
know you have to take some of those
sacrifices i'm not saying that all of
them are good i'm still a little leery i
am both excited and terrified actually I
was talking to Derek of our
administrator for the android authority
and co-founder anyway I was talking
about earlier today about that actually
how I'm both terrified and excited at
the same time I put the futures gonna
bring us yeah exactly um and well you
know where we're at the forefront I've
seen where it goes in this particular
part of our industry which is of course
mobile so you know just just looking at
the things that we wish we had let's
take a look at what we do have and um I
kind of wanted to see you know what
you're excited about coming out these
days in the in the mobile space whether
it's what are we the mobile space I say
the consumer space I'll put it that way
now it doesn't have to be like just
mobile like smartphones and stuff but
you know if we have things like virtual
reality I know that I am super excited
about the HTC vive and yet I'm the only
one that's been able to try it out of
the four of us um how was it I mean not
to get to what to derail but I how was
it like compared to like OCR you know
gear VR now this was a better similar
it's not that it's not a huge deer
ailing at all because it is HTC so it's
perfectly fine and I'm going to try my
best not to just gush for the next like
10 minutes because I've done it maybe
four times ever since I'm wz but
essentially it's not anything like the
gear VR because it doesn't rely on a
smartphone it's it's a completely
immersive experience with headphones and
controllers and laser sensors that are
put on different parts of a room in
order to create a space that you will
actually walk around it and that's the
virtual reality world that you're in
it's not just you sitting there and
everything's coming at you you're
actually a part of the world and because
of that it is connected to a computer
so it's awful you got wires coming out
and everything it really does look kind
of sci-fi steampunk in a way and if you
it's someone who is never someone who's
never touched technology before we'll
look at something like that and imagine
having it on and be terrified
I'm pretty sure of it and you know just
having all those wires coming out it's
like I don't know what's that one what
was the one you're a bunch of them but I
the first one that came to mind was like
Star Trek insurrection when the when the
the villain has like this helmet on
trying to like heal and there's all
these wires coming out of the helmet
it's something like that but it won't it
won't fully be like that because it's
supposed to be a wireless thing but
anyway you get it all on and the room
that you're in disappears it absolutely
disappears and then suddenly when the
just heads up display comes on when you
look around the way that the headset
communicates with the lasers and then
finally back to the computer it's able
to really see in real time where you are
in this virtual space that's creating
for you and then your controllers are
basically your hands in that world and I
so like there's no other way to put it
the whole world becomes your oyster like
when you load up like the demos that
they had were really really spot-on and
showing what you can do one world was
like under under water under water um
sunken ship and you're there and then
this whale like comes out of nowhere and
starts like starts getting a ball close
to you and you're freaking terrified and
there is even an artistry one where
you're in a cube of virtual cube and
then your hands become brushes and you
can just start like doing art everywhere
and then finally they had a portal world
where you had to it was like basically
the game portal except you were playing
a a robot repairman trying to repair one
of the portal robots it was freaking
amazing oh um how like realistic is like
what you're seeing I mean it'll Italy
it's a thing or the Eddie it's
absolutely is absolutely immersive
because you have the you have the
displace and you know the huge thing in
front near on your face you also have
the headphone so you don't hear a thing
all you hear is the world around you so
literally you are a part of this world
if you're in a sterile room and it's all
white and you take
this is what Michael Fisher said child
am here this is what he said but it's
absolutely true he said they have that
room really really sterile for that for
that demo it's white everywhere you only
see one desk where the wires are coming
from with the computer and then the guys
they're kind of guiding you through the
simulations but when you take it off and
you just see the white world around you
the white walls and everything yes she
gets sad because because it's like you
you you left this world and you just
want to go back and yes it is very
convincing mostly because that that's
just how well these these let's say
games but experiences have to be created
um where you could hear GLaDOS coming
from behind you and then you turn around
and there's glad I was in the Peter of
hands and then I think that's how good
the immersion is is the floor starts to
give out from under you because GLaDOS
is filtering you out because you failed
in that game and then when the floor
gives out you actually step away like
whoa am i next and like you do stuff
like that you know and and I was I was
an idiot in the first demo where there
are buttons on the controller and one of
them inflates a balloon and then when
you move the controllers around you can
hear like this audible book and and
you're you're like you're like bouncing
balloons up and down like a kid would
I'm gonna board at school and he was the
guy who giving the demo was like oh when
you inflate the balloon you can actually
touch it and he had to use the word
touch which made me look like a dumbass
when I held one of the controllers in my
other hand and tried swatting at nothing
tried to swat at avalyn that's not
existing in actual real meat space and
yet heard him laughing I was like oh
snap yeah if that's the thing I mean I I
haven't used you know I have you
actually tried out the gear VR and it
was not that it was okay um but I guess
to me virtual reality still a long ways
off from being you know Leah mostly I
mean you're like you said it looks good
and stuff but like I don't know to me I
want to see a world where I can actually
use my hands and feel like I'm feel like
I'm walking and Stefano that's probably
way far off but you know that's what I'm
kind of curious about its virtual
reality here to stay or is it just going
another version of the nineties well
that's this kind of all there's probably
the closest thing that you're going to
get to that and um there's I people get
to what I saw the bunch of a butcher
Calder talking i'll probably be like 90
and because it's HTC and valve you know
in particular i I'm fully convinced that
the reason why we haven't had half life
3 is because they want it on the HTC
vive they want it on their and this is
how they want the masses to to play it
and this is what's going to sell the
vibe everyone's got a feeling probably
going to be pretty expensive why don't
haven't set a price but yeah exactly I
heard you could be talking in all
thousand boxes today it was speculation
yeah but yeah yeah but it's I'm curious
I mean cuz I've heard from some people
say that the vibe is more impressive
than out the rift oh yeah that's right
but I'm curious about the Bobby you used
the woofed I did but I had to take it
off after like five minutes because I
got a little nauseous um I don't know
why because i didn't get nauseous with
the vibe but um I didn't have the same
thought I used I've AF a friend actually
who has won the developer kit once one
older version of the thing but anyway
yeah I got sick from it and I think yeah
I think I don't want to say like sick
sick but I just felt like crap yep think
that you know dizzy and what the Virgo
knows i forget where i saw the other day
but they were saying that by adding in a
fake nose you know your own nose so to
speak from a first-person point of view
it helps alleviate a lot of that
especially if you're like on a roller
coaster in your VR hmm really I know
there's like it radio that you guys eat
room is it may encourage you yeah yeah
well just like you see a little bit of
your faith you know when you're looking
you know you don't you don't think about
if you do see that was what the reality
you wouldn't so so many so many racist
comments could be made aside from the
racist comas this is where I want to
jump into VR yeah especially with the
the nose aspect of it where you know of
course putting a digital nose is kind of
virtually turning this virtual reality
into an augmented reality and I I
personally
I swear I'm more excited I mean VR it
seems awesome especially like in a
gaming sense that complete immersion
that that would be great but you know
kind of what everybody dreams that
Google class is all about or you know
that the iron man jarvis computer you
know where you can walk around you're
seeing your actual own nose but you're
also seeing that you know the digital
stuff superimposed over the real world
so you don't have to be in a secure room
so you don't hurt yourself you can be
out in the real world enjoying this
digital I know but then it breaks away
from i mean i think i think AR is great
for like you know information and i even
some gaming but like for information
like you know you're walking by you know
something it gives you you know pop up
points about what you're seeing etc like
tour guides and things but i don't i
think AR is more informational than
gaining to me well I think we've seen a
couple iterations of a are like you know
this is an old feature that used to be
on samsung phones and not samsung phones
sony phones and you know imposing like
dinosaurs and dwarves on your floor and
stuff like that you know so far like has
anyone put the DS to add the little AR
cards and you you know you took oh yeah
look at the car to make ya ya maya my
first experience with that was with a
bravely default on the 3ds and i came
with a bunch of cars and i was like what
the hell did these do and you know like
but when i first started the thing they
were like put the card on a table and
point your d3d at it and I was like no
no I was out and then it did it and like
you know like it it's it's better than I
thought it was gonna be cuz i thought
was just gonna show me like a nice
little seen those superimposed over my
living room but like I had to like spin
in circles to follow the characters and
stuff like oh my god where they go
what's gonna happen next and like my
roommate was looking at me like what the
hell are you doing right cuz I'm like
because I'm standing in the middle of
the living room block in the view of the
TV like spinning in circles and walking
around like oh my god where are they
gonna go next and the ending was even
better because that one was like almost
ten minutes long and I was at my
girlfriend's house and I was just like I
just wandering around the bedroom like
I'm looking at the end of the game like
did he say that one thing about AR
as far as gaming and immersive
activities go is that because you still
are grounded in reality because you're
seeing the world around you too it's
probably less dangerous I mean as far as
like I'm not I'm I like stumbling around
but I'm I like addiction lies you know
because people get addicted like World
of Warcraft as it is but you know a
super realistic virtual world like a
sequel spending you know 20 hours a day
in it okay yeah i actually had that
thought during our post mwc podcast and
i just put it out there and I I was I
was I wanted to find a channel to be
able to talk about it with people I
length but I you know I don't think that
maybe a little bit later on this podcast
we could but I want to make sure we
don't step over vice a whole whole idea
there so what ya um if augmented reality
is is where you want things to go well
what is it what is it what is an ideal a
are set up look like to you then feisty
now we're really getting into the sci-fi
stuff oh yeah Jory look gorgeous mask or
but the glasses that's what it's got it
right well you know there's two things I
would reference one sorry there's more
than two things out of reference first
of all modern J modern-day occurs US Air
Force fighter jet pilots their helmets
they're equipped with I think the
company's name is Loomis is one of them
and they create all of that so to speak
augmented reality you know Google glass
competitor type stuff I think they're
working on a retail unit as well but you
know just taking it to the next level
kind of google glass type of thing but
but jumping off into that sci-fi no i
mentioned a few episodes back at a
television show called continuum and
then there was a web series called but I
think what's called h+ was that one of
the episodes I was gone by the way cuz I
love that show in verse I don't know if
you don't remember lest of that effort
at all so I'm without someone of episode
that's gone that's a great show Canadian
we don't about wearables and I wanted
implants so yeah continuum I mean that's
total you know sci-fi stuff at this
point implants and whatnot but you know
the idea that you know your AR isn't
you know a game that you play at a
specific time or a small window that
shows you navigation or the weather but
like a serious user interface that takes
your whole visual range so if you want
to pull up so to speak YouTube videos
and watch them at a you know super low
transparency level just on a blank white
wall there go society we're all going to
be out of shape and crazy but you know
the white paint I'll be in very very low
supply be very don't have to be white
just just as yeah room okay you know
what and that's what is it I swear to
god there's gonna be have audio files
now we're gonna have visual files if if
I steez vision of the future becomes a
reality where people are like testing
various shades of color and coming up
with the most optimum colors four walls
if you want to experience certain things
like well you know this YouTube videos a
little cool so you kind of want like a
mango colored wall that a little bit of
warmth to the video nice I never thought
about all this but yeah I need to get
into the paint industry apparently oh
yeah right leastwise I heart and you're
gonna see those things on Amazon like
the super expensive $10,000 you know
being a painted apparently ads like
definition to whatever you're doing in
the augment you know kind of like those
like those gold plated doohickeys that
you plug in the headphones and they cost
a bunch of money for no reason and no
one buys them anyway so you know what
would be easier than painting your wall
or looking at different colored walls
maybe if there was this device that you
could just stick to your head covered
your eyes oh wait that's just virtual
reality and to the to that point so it
sounds like a heads-up display of sorts
um yes a heads-up display thank you that
is the word I was looking for over the
last five minutes HUD yeah I like a hide
um maybe like I know I want useful
information but I also I don't just want
useful information I also wanted to
entertain for those few times where it's
a pro
to do so well here's here's the question
that I had with that because I've tried
like cabos the name of that it was a
field trip that you can you can you can
go to like a historical landmark or a
museum or some place that's like well
known and then the camera turns on and
you pointed at various landmarks and
things will pop up to show that you know
oh there's more information here's some
more information about what you're doing
it as a google goggles and field trip oh
yeah goggles there's the other one yeah
um I I see where the value is in it I'd
be super excited if there would be there
could be something that you could wear
that gives you a HUD of sorts that
allows you to do that but how would what
would implementation sound look like
there because for for something like
Google glass it's obviously like a small
display that just sort of gives you to
contextual cards when they see fit um
based on context obviously yeah but if
it's going to be things that pop up in
the world that you're seeing do we not
have to install things in the real world
that will communicate with the AR set um
that's what I'm thinking Gary sim sands
late sorry go on Gary Sims did a really
awesome video on the Internet of Things
which essentially answers that exact
question because I guess according to
Gary anyway you know that the way the
Internet of Things is going to work is
you know their sensors and all that jazz
it gives data and that data sent up to
the cloud and then the cloud decisions
are made yeah and uh so I assume it
would be something like that where like
you know you have the sensors on you
know that the headset and when you look
at something that you know that visual
data is you know process to set up to
the cloud and then the cloud it's like
oh that's a donut shop and then it
shoots it right back down and then once
it figures out what it is it picks a
point of reference it just pops a card
out at least that's how I assume it
would work given today's you know
technology but that you know you know
that it's a really awesome video
everyone should watch it generates on
android authority YouTube channels
called what is the Internet of Things
and Gary Sims does it yeah i OT the the
the term that is the bane of many
people's existence these days because
it's me it's everyone loves using it
it's really dumb but anyway the but it
is it is a it is the liquidus term now
and that's what we think of when we
think about that but the yeah I I
imagined that the answer was going to be
yes to my question and it's good that
Gary made that video with that with that
in mind because when we went on a media
tour a couple a couple a few months back
um the these companies is these mobile
companies and I won't say which ones in
particular they have this idea in mind
and they already have mock-ups of what a
let's use the term tech city would look
like and yeah there are sensors
everywhere there are literally things
all over there mock-up of a city that
will communicate with everything and if
you're walking outside and there's like
weather conditions and whatnot it will
it will change how certain buildings
like like how they shade themselves or
something like that or in your heads up
display you'd be able to see like oh the
weather has the weather has this going
on and you look at a whit at a building
it's like all this these are the things
that they have that I could buy if
they're on my list like it's kind of
crazy it's litterally tapping into all
the information that's out there in the
world and among people and making it a
thing like the IOT that's this the
internet of things as they say that's
that's the kind of scares me a
little bit i mean i'm both excited and
terrified by that cause stuff I'm not in
our zone like um yeah you you did remind
me though I I don't remember this was
awhile ago but I'm reading that some
company or city like I said this is it's
been months but anyway um they were
talking about installing technology in
their downtown I think what's the city
but on the broom anyway we're like the
parking spots would be equipped with a
sensor that could communicate with the
cars and so like you would you know your
car would tell you where the nearest
parking spot that's vacant is for like a
you know for like a meter you know and
so those kind of things like you talk
about the city I think those are the
things that are kind of cool is the
ability like you know no longer have to
go around the block a hundred times to
find a parking spot your car will tell
you where the nearest parking spot is
and navigate you to it or drive it
dry or drive it yeah that's true or
drive itself there for that matter I
think that's the stuff that really you
know excites me about about Internet of
Things it's just the idea of you know
that contextual everything building upon
each other and you know yeah did you
have more on the topic of a are feisty
before we move on to job not so much AR
but in in regard to the Internet of
Things I think there needs to be a lot
of clients side as well where a lot of
these devices need to be able to make
decisions and do their thing without
having to hit the internet ooh great
example is I think it was originally
called word lens and a google bought
them and roll them into their translate
app where you know it augmented reality
again you you point your device your you
know your phone's camera at a sign
that's in another language and it
automatically and visually translates
that for your real time and so that's
sort of client-side stuff I think will
be extremely valuable as well I think
that stuff is nice I've used google
translate in that sense before mostly in
China and it mostly works you get I mean
obviously the translations you know come
back not necessarily perfectly gramatica
grandma chromatic eyes if I that's a
word in proper grammar and let me say
that and um but enough to get you around
and that's I know what I said for ya oh
the four bedroom I mean because I I
guess to be whining below skeptical is
because it was in that situation that I
thought I would be able to find my way
somewhere but what worked a lot better
was for me to use translate as an actual
translator talked into it and then it
would show up the Chinese characters for
someone to read and then they would be
able to direct me that's what was farm
far more effective in that situation for
me okay you think that's just a
limitation of you know the people behind
the translation and you know programming
if you will well also i was just kind of
slow like I didn't have I was using like
my tmobile world like global data there
and it's always slow when it's outside
the US so having a fascinator net
connection probably would have helped me
out so it was better to transmit a very
tiny day
file of me asking a question that could
then be translated properly instead of
trying to stream in real time these
letters on that wall you know perfect
and I guess that's what I was getting at
here without trying to veer off too far
was the Internet of Things is awesome
I'm very excited but client-side all
those translations and you needed to be
client-side for you so you didn't have
to rely on a slow internet connection
yeah yeah for sure all right so Joe what
what that we have right now is exciting
you about the hours I were somewhat
sci-fi future of tag if we ever get to
that true sci-fi point um see the thing
is is it when Qureshi sent the question
all of us earlier he said and I quote
let's try to keep ourselves at least
semi grounded in reality and that like
like all Ted all 10 of my top 10 things
that I really want egg just kind of
shattered like glass and fell away um so
like I've been trying to think of like
all day and I didn't mean that it had to
be stuff that's happening right this
second but meaning I know like not
something that's 700 years away well
okay i know i saw an article hard it's
on order go somewhere real is totally
real how do people not know the Jurassic
Park is real I when I was a kid I was so
scared of velociraptors I didn't walk
right on my house unless a light was on
I was like that anyway it wasn't enough
it wasn't velociraptors it was I just
didn't like the dark no one's as bad as
I'm not to completely here off but I am
uh-huh not to hear off subject but that
the no one's as bad as my old is one of
my older sisters she would get so scared
and lights weren't on that like she
would push like myself and my youngest
sister in front of her and like make us
search the house when she thought like
someone was breaking him like if we were
left alone she was like you know three
years older than me and we should make
us walk around and look for you know
ever one time she got spooked so she ran
out into the dark onto the curve and
waited till people got home is running
outside on a curve would be the safest
place as opposed to staying walked in
your room somebody watch for my he said
they're scared of the dark
don't mind me oh that's okay but um
actually if I was thinking and the I was
also trying to think of what my answer
would be for this but I got distracted
thinking about feisty segmented reality
world and I imagine imagine a game like
ingress we're like you have a bunch of
players in like you know the in our
actual world and being able to like
drive into a city like you know like
every city has its where you're driving
down the highway and you can look over
and see the entire city like off to your
right a little bit like just slightly in
the distance and being like little like
columns of light popping up showing you
where the other players are in the city
and just being able to see something
like that would be really cool and like
you know such portal's because showing
the other players that you might have
some privacy violation stuff that right
well you know I was I got you so you can
opt into an opt-out o but yeah you like
being able to see like yeah portals also
would be like you know you portals like
Grizz green columns of light like all
get really close to this portal in like
you see like you know an enlightened
light pop up you're like oh crap
someone's trying to hack it I better
hurry you know get a speeding ticket and
get angry and quit ingress but um uh but
the thing that I really want is smart
homes I liked in and like and not just
like smart homes like in the classic
sense i mean like smart everything I
mean obviously within reason and totally
controllable by human beings but like
you know I've always wanted to be able
to pick up my cell phone and like adjust
the temperature turn on the washer in
the dryer and all that jazz turn on my
car outside in uh it's something that
we're really really close to because we
do have like smart appliances and there
is you know there are ways to start your
car from your cell phone but you know
the proliferation of something that's
mainstream and every no connects
everything together like I want my
refrigerator be able to talk to my dryer
not that it needs to say anything to it
but I still want it to you know you
never know ya never know who's gonna be
friends in in the appliance world maybe
my lights and you know my toaster become
best friends I don't know I would like
to see if that's true but you know have
like
people put like it you know two pieces
of bread the toaster then like start the
oven and then like when the oven reaches
a certain point like you know saying
like baking bacon and I want toast with
it you know what to a certain point
automatically pops the toast down and
then everything finishes at once like
stuff like that where it's you know you
know that we can I sort of have that
kind of stuff now but it's really for
lack of a better word janky like it's
really boxed in its really Jenky you
know if it does work on your smartphone
everything has to be connected to your
home router pretty much like there's not
a lot of ways to access that from
outside the home and if you should
really you know kind of nice to be able
to do stuff like that and be able to
manage my entire home from my couch what
about the security aspect is that some
do you have you ever used one of those
things i actually have one in my home um
the while you were talking about it i
was actually opening up my app it's and
it's called Vivint that's the name of
the company at least and yeah you could
like unlock the doors or you could see
if you know the doors are opened or
closed for too long or actually opened
for too long I should say and actually
have cameras in like we have cameras in
this house or we can see what's going on
in the house if anything is for the
month like the applications for like say
the security stuff they don't really
make any sense until something actually
happens but you never want something to
happen you know like there's a lot of
common sense that comes into that like
obviously if you have like a locking
mechanism you know you're not going to
have you know a password that's you're
gonna have a good password for it and
you know wherever that password is
stored it's not going to be in plain
text you know it's a it's one of those
things where it's common sense and
experience just kept well you know will
alleviate most of those problems and
then you know there's always the option
to you know take your house offline if
you're not feeling happy about it and
you just have it connected to you know
the the Wi-Fi in your house you just
connected to the router not connected to
the actual internet or something like
that you know i mean it's it seems like
a lot of the stuff is just it seems like
it would be common sense to me yeah you
know yeah first
okay so like so a smart home and and you
bring up an interesting point that
everything still has to be connected to
like your router for example and that is
the case with us we still need an
internet connection for it to work so if
if a burglar were to like cut the power
lines it probably wouldn't work very
well but the thing is we have this issue
and I think everyone here would agree
with me that the the thing that is
supposed to power all of this sci-fi
tech that I think that's what needs to
be improved 1st right because imagine
imagine a home where the router is not
really working very well troubleshooting
routers and internet connections via
routers is still one of the most
convoluted things out there and could
not possibly have worded that any better
well that's how convoluted it's like pub
and no one knows to go egg no no regular
consumer knows to open up a browser and
go like one dot 192 168 and all that
stuff you know so I think we do need to
get to a place first where where the
data comes from what funnels the data
into what uses the data needs to be
perfected first and in the case of like
virtual reality will never arrive but I
augmented reality if we're out in the
open it's gonna be you need a great
wireless internet ecosystem in a city
for example or even anywhere else you'll
imagine twice to imagine if you had
augmented reality but then you had no
connection out in like the Amazon you
know sure enough I just imagine like a
little I harp on client-side stuff
having all those databases stored
locally and then that speaks exactly
what you're talking about where where we
need to get this stuff solidified before
the rest of its gonna work yeah you can
say Joe I was going to say like you know
having no connection there and you know
it's just someone's like oh man you know
my AR thing lost casing the internet and
there's just like an L LOL just bouncing
around like a screensaver it's got a
laugh actually like that is the Jackass
like yo face yeah
trophies so here I thought Joe was going
to go with you know is that a real
alligator is that augmented reality
alligator oh man I can't wait for those
to happen sorry I know I took it back I
can't wait for those to happen it's yeah
that was more of a caustic statement
than a literal one because you know
someone is going to be like oh that's
just enough you know a virtual reality
car flying towards me on you know and
then they end up getting hit by the car
and like you know you know it's gonna
happen someday and it sucks because
people are gonna get injured but then
you on the other hand you know you know
that we will have a whole new category
for the Darwin Awards every year because
you know people are gonna it there are
gonna be those people who get too drunk
or too stoned or something like that
they're gonna be like oh LOL that's not
real it's the augmented reality boom and
then something bad happens to it sucks
like what it's true that's gonna be the
22nd century's most famous last words
that's not real its augmented reality oh
look at this cute kitten yes it's it
sucks but it's very true remember when
GPS versa navigation first became a huge
thing people would were driving off of
bridges because their car told them to
take a right or something I don't forget
always I just kept thinking about I was
like okay these are the people who just
can't make decisions for themselves
they're not even looking at the road if
that's the case oh man um the
implications behind all this technology
that you know may or may not be coming
down the pipeline you know that that's
that's a discussion I really really want
us to have one day it may not even
really fit in the in the scope of an
android authority podcast but this whole
idea that if we keep coming back to
virtual reality and I don't know this is
a very passionate about this topic
because I you know it might emotion and
and mental mental health are very
important to me in particular I'm the
kind of guy that meditates every day and
tries to keep myself you know Zen but we
might have this thing in the future
where the people who hate their lives
would prefer to just remain in the
virtual world and
depression could become a huge huge
thing given the kind of technology we
might have that can augment or
completely replace reality and if krushi
is terrified of the IOT I'm more
terrified of just where our species
would go if technology somehow replaces
what is supposed to be a wonderful life
you do realize that if every single one
of our ideas come to fruition including
my jet packs you know what that equates
to those fat people chairs from Wally
yeah I was a new set up yeah and I gotta
fight it is terrifyingly I don't want to
be a super fat pro I mean it's I can
happen in my lifetime obviously but I
don't want my descendants to be super
fat people who can't walk anywhere like
that's that's not any good way to live
but no you're absolutely right man like
and that's gonna be one of those hurdles
I think people are gonna cross when they
actually get to it cuz I mean like if
there are people who are actually
literally like psychologically addicted
to social media mm-hmm and uh like in
not using social media actually gives
them like withdrawal symptoms and that
is terrifying already like yeah i
uninstalled facebook for like a week on
my phone just to make sure i wasn't like
addicted to it but then i tried to
install like Google+ for like a day and
I had to I mean yeah I had to reinstall
it cuz i was sharing stuff from you know
i'm andrew authority post but it was
just like like you know i don't think i
am but like i might be and then it's
like you know it's kind of scary to
think about being addicted to looking at
a screen yeah and it's like if it's
already happening now do you know you're
right like when this stuff actually does
come to fruition like vr and a are
especially vr you know there are gonna
be people who get lost in that and you
know all the health problems and mental
problems that are associated i mean
never mind like you know the mental
health like depression and stuff like
that but you know sitting for 18 hours
without moving like you say hello to
deep vein thrombosis and you know
obesity and you know early onset heart
disease and all that you know horrible
stuff that happens to people who live
sedentary lifestyles we're getting this
guys on such a high note right now if
these things happen people are gonna die
well it's important on the scope of
sci-fi just realize you know that's
that's the kind of stuff you don't even
get to see you know just how many how
many how many horrible things had to
happen before so I these sci-fi world's
got to where they are now where things
are all hunky-dory you know and that's
uh that's really what my thought is you
know I really do feel like we're gonna
have a transitionary period that's gonna
be oh man it's gonna be a really odd
part in time it's gonna be really weird
era it's gonna be up I think me one of
those things that gets phased out like
phased out of humanity um I'm trying to
think of like a relevant example but I
um I hate to go like political or
anything but it's like with a people who
don't like gay people eventually all
those people are going to die and what
are going to be left or the people who
you know except you know the gay people
lifestyle and you know gay marriage not
like there's gonna be a time in a place
where is your tattoos and piercings like
most the people who don't like that kind
of stuff are old you know they're older
like 40 50 60 70 and like you know a
good you know 50 60 years down the line
all those people are going to be you
know gone and then the people are gonna
be left for people like us who don't
care like my colleague a with piercings
whatever I don't care as long as you do
your job and our good person that's very
true you know I don't think it's I think
is gonna be the same way with VR and AR
tech where you know the people who abuse
that too and the people who get really
really terrible we know into that kind
of stuff like you're talking about I
mean it sucks but those people are
eventually gonna get phased out and the
people you know it's evolution
essentially you know the the people who
are able to keep going just will be the
only ones left yeah I mean well
regardless of how you feel about any one
thing um you know the generations that
that follow it if they are into that
thing then that's what's going to happen
and yeah regardless of how you feel one
way or another on a topic it's a
eventually the people who
who have this antiquated view on
something well soon become extinct it's
kind of it's kind of a crass thing to
say what's true you know what we're not
going to be around once all of these
technologies come out and who knows how
they're being applied in the future and
exactly precisely mm-hmm so who knows
who knows what's going to happen I just
I just yeah there's just a thought that
came to mind you know I I mentioned
Michael Fisher earlier who said that
piece that once he took off the vibe he
was like oh I want to go back and I
thought and I thought that's the saddest
thing I've heard this whole show like
and he was it was a he was i he was
laughing what I said that because he was
like you know it's kind of true because
imagine you know if I'm just one person
who had that experience in a demo
imagine what the life would be like
would imagine how this this entity would
be this thing will become you know an
entity in and of itself that people
become addicted to I love it we didn't
even we didn't even talk about like
phones at all yeah well doctors displays
or anything like that we did mention the
processing stuff that's what you said
Joe that was the topic I was gonna talk
about but we never got to it but the
whole Moore's Law thing more processors
kaldi uh uh as far as you know the
technology that I'm excited for foldable
technology and stuff okay well go ahead
go for it like a good working well I was
just gonna you know that was kind of
what I was gonna talk about is that I
personally think there's a lot of
potential there and right now yeah
everything we're seeing at this point
you know like is pretty much just for
aesthetic or you know novelty reasons
but there are devices the note edge in
the s6 edge they attempt to bring new
features but what we really what I'm
really looking forward to is the ability
for like you know devices that can truly
like transform like their size the shape
you know go from being a phone to a
tablet to you know basically right now
you want your evidence well no I'm
talking more like on the lines it like
I've always been I've always liked the
idea of one device that can do
everything but unfortunately right now
any device on the market attempts to do
everything they make compromises you
know whether it's a tablet that's also
converts to a laptop or a phone that's
you know you know you you have to make a
compromise but if you could actually
take your phone and fold it down
multiple times or stretch it out or you
know I think that that would solve some
of that I think it would a lot pave the
way for truly all-in-one devices you
know and I think that's what I'm excited
about because that's something that's
we're pretty close to I mean yes right
now we have a lot there's obstacles in
the way such as like finding a bendable
twistable battery technology but
Samsung's working on it I know the korea
korea advanced institute of science
technology is working on it so i guess
to me one of the biggest technologies
that's coming right around the corner
that i'm excited about is useful
technology that's foldable instead of
like right now flexible tech is you know
it's cool but is it really like
game-changing now no but I think Michael
is what it is yeah it is but I mean the
idea of a device that could fold down
and you know pack away I think that
could change things you know hmm you
know I think it could be you know the
you know the idea of tablets going
extinct because you have a device that's
13 inches when he needs to be or it's
five inches what he did to be that that
would be really cool yeah you know and I
don't think whatever sorry that I was
gonna say crush you you're a hardcore
multitasker I have one device that could
do it that can do it all don't you think
you get stuck with only being able to do
one thing at a time because you only
have one device you know yeah that's
probably a possibility I guess I I just
think it's cool for consumers not
necessarily for myself just to see where
it goes for consumers in general you
know I mean but yeah I get what you're
saying I mean yes I'm multitasker that's
true but smart flip phones just saying
yeah or they're not happening I should
move to korea or japan place she's just
scared of a future where he might only
need one device cuz yeah I think that's
ugly he's all like no I don't want a DC
really he likes having like 60 or 70
different like really cheap devices
around them link them all up create a
supercomputer one day and they're all
out of all the innovations in the last
several years probably the most exciting
to me isn't really that big of a deal is
like having my google login because if I
change out a laptop or whatever
everything just follows me when I when I
turn on Chrome you know all my settings
all my savings I love that you know I
love the idea of everything following
you to new devices and i think that's
that's something i want to see actually
it's just you know information in the
cloud that follows you wherever you go
on whatever device you have and that's
kind of what Google's been pushing you
know yeah dude I was thinking about your
bowl double your bendable foldable
flexible displays yeah and uh I I just
got this like mental image of like a kid
like you know video chatting with like
one of their parents who are like
overseas you know in the military or
something and like them like grabbing
the phone on top of the bottom just
stretching it out and like the parents
face starts to look like that guy from
the screen painting oh god yes just like
being your parent looking at the packet
like no no no we went from depressing
our audience to getting back on topic so
now we're scaring the crap out of is
there any technologies like like outside
of the mobile escape that you guys are
really looking forward to that may not
be there now like for me I want to see
continued improved you know aii like the
idea of like you know assistance it
around that pop up out of here like
house and stuff that follow you around
that will i provide you know information
for you a genetic engineering i think is
really cool scary but cool um cures to
diseases i mean cancer anyone okay
that's Rob you know cleaner energy
sources uh you know that's the stuff
that really excites me I mean you know
mobile school but you know the stuff
that like really will change the world
you know I read an article last year and
I think I might have written about it I
can't remember but it was about um like
it isn't google working on like a
quantum computer right now or something
something someone I'm gonna look that up
really quick but i'm pretty sure they're
working on something like he's like a
quantum cpu or quantum computer or
something like that and that was really
exciting when I was looking at cuz like
the processing power is supposedly like
ridiculous supposedly
diculous um I think it would be why you
wanted or checking that out I think it
would be honestly I am kind of excited
for autonomous cars but but caveat here
I completely understand all the concerns
about how that would change the economy
for example the workforce what I would
want out of these autonomous cars is
still the ability to turn it off and be
able to drive the car myself because I I
want to be able to drive my car still
it's still a fun experience and
everything you know even on just that
basic level so if it's like I Robot you
know it can't look like that on us
honestly I don't want cars that look too
futuristic I well what was up with all
those hybrids that were coming out and
they all had to look so stupid like with
the way no way you know I really hated
that you know like if you want a card to
feel futuristic you don't need it to
look like tacky and that's what I felt
like they were so yeah you know you need
to do to make a car look futuristic it's
just put lights on the bottom of it so
it looks like it's floating we're using
like a hover like thing and just make a
room like it's good you can that point
where is my hoverboard from freaking
back to the future that's what I want
same place is my jet packs not enough
people are freaking working on it yeah I
found it it's a crap all right since
2009 google has been working with
controversial startup d-wave system
which claims to make the first
commercial quantum computer and last
this was written in 2014 by the way and
last year google purchased one of d
waves machines but independent tests
published earlier this year found
evidence that d waves computer use
quantum physics to solve problems more
adventure than controversial machine our
conventional machine sorry and like it's
a wire technology review article that
goes on for like another five thousand
words but they I guess they're launching
an effort to build their own quantum
computer and I think if they succeed
with that that could get really
interesting and really fun I also read
somewhere that they were like using some
dare they were building some sort of
like nitrogen cooling room for it like a
whole room it was cool or like a whole
chamber just to cool the thing that
they're building that's terrifying to me
yeah a little bit a quantum computer
that runs the internet it's freak
they're building freaking Skynet guys I
think we've established by now that
google is guy no just is well just
remember this because like you know in a
good 20 years and we're all fighting the
robots for our lives we have to go to
Mountain View to that super cool room
that's where we got to go to fix
everything everyone make a google pin oh
wait that's episode you gotta log in the
Google pin moves you really want to go
to John Pisces residents in Portland
Oregon no Hades residents columbus oh I
you do not want to go to Mountain View
California i'm definitely not there
given given what I just just a very
maybe maybe we'll look at week we got
out we gotta wrap it up after this by
the way like this um the oh this is the
podcast at other end well there's so
many things we could talk about in this
topic this is what's when I came up with
it I kind of went with a broad topic on
purpose but then the same time is like
this could get really like go crazy and
it kind of did tangela that's okay
that's a bit simple for you with one
last thing for me I would like a new
input technique I mean like the for
typing accorded keyboard is great and
you know there's voice dictation and all
that kind of stuff but i think i'm due
for a new input technique that's a
little bit easier to work with right now
i don't know what that is but right
there's think any what i really want
yeah this is exactly that's all you need
no I Salty's like these gaming gloves
that people use for gaming and I thought
how cool would be to be able to like
wear like half a keyboard on each hand
and be able to just huh I thought they
had something like that baby you know
that they have something like that for
games like it's one-handed yeah it's
like one hand it only has like you know
as like the WASD and like the
surrounding ten keys but like I'm like
you know figure out a way to like have a
keyboard on each hand so you don't even
need a keyboard anymore you just kind of
like sit back in your chair and just
kind of you know type with your fingers
no matter what they're doing doesn't
leave till you look you look you look
like a very docile human being just like
the only your fingers are
moving your aren't you look like Houdini
like cast a spell or something like Jim
Jim Shella been all the fish I came to
mind was freaking Freddy Krueger's glove
like that's my thought there you go a
qwerty keyboard gloves with Wolverine
claws that come out of it you know the
funny thing I think you know about
technology is the stuff that really like
makes a difference and changes like the
way our world is are the things that we
didn't even think about and they're
usually stuff that like existed like 10
years or so before but they weren't
they'd be either failed or they just
didn't get enough attention you know
like smartphones for example you know
you could have seen that trend coming I
guess in a way because smartphones
existed even in that you know eight late
80s it's just that they they sucked
virtual reality you know you had the 90s
was full of virtual reality devices I
mean even like you know Tendo had
Nintendo had various things like power
mats and power gloves and you know a lot
of these texts have made their you know
things have made their way now and so
really I'm sure the next big thing is
already here now we just we don't
recognize it well you know we're living
in the thick of it right so you know
years years ago the stuff that has
coming out right now that those are the
things that everyone if we went if we
got a time machine and we went back to
activate what no way that's it that's a
whole computer in your hand and like um
you imagine going back in time and you
show Steve Jobs the freaking iphone like
he is my nephew don't know I bet 1970s
steve jobs would be like that thing's
freaking ugly get it the hell out of my
office we're trying to build actual
computers here was his handheld crab no
one's gonna want this 20 years later i
am so sorry i know you're still crying
like I brought you you back your
invention you idiot see guys were on the
right track with tabtimes tablets will
be cool again well I was thinking of a
girl she was saying how it goes when we
have technology that sort of circumvents
a form factor or something that we've
had before you know it repurposes it and
then all of a sudden it's amazing I in
my mind I know like okay
this might be a little bit harsh but
smartwatches just don't fall under that
category yet and I uh I you know I've
you guys all know i have i have a moto
360 and I praised it I liked it a lot
but ultimately do i use it now i will be
the first to admit my wife's using it
right now um will I use it again
sometimes I like it for going out but
like right now I have a Fitbit and yeah
I know but anyway um the main thing that
I missed from ironically the thing that
really I liked about my SmartWatch was
that it could tell ty I realized all
this time I just missed a watch yeah I
realized you know I would have been just
fine with just a watch gesture after it
now I'm the first smart watches and
thank God for their existence because
they give us it's almost like the Joe
Biden of tag like that there's always
something funny you can say about
smartwatches right now because they just
don't quite get it yet you know they
just don't quite get there yeah they're
they're they're they're they're fumbling
through their their their existence at
the moment I always think SmartWatch has
a compromise exactly and um yeah I
reviewed the first few and then I
realized i was looking at one of my like
AG men's men's lifestyle / fashion
websites and there was like a sub 100
dollar watch that was very minimalistic
it looked a really awesome house like
man that looks good and I realized yeah
I just like good nice looking things on
my wrist I don't care what it does if
I'd if I do care what it does it has to
be in that moment it's not going to be
something that's gonna be on my wrist
all the time that that needs to have a
certain functionality you know and even
then smartwatches have that problem
because they are not able to stay on
your risk-free for a long time they have
to get off eventually that's the biggest
thing is I think smart watches smart
watches are never going to be big in my
opinion because they don't solve any
problems well enough even if battery
life gets although smartwatches can do
is potentially someday replace regular
watches you know that's still a long
ways off because before they can replace
regular watches will need to have at
least month long battery life you know
and we're a long way from that and but
the idea of
I just don't think that there's anything
a SmartWatch could do that could be
compelling enough to get someone who
never liked wearing a watch to wear one
you know I mean yeah the only thing
smartwatches did for me is that I
realized I kind of missed having a watch
because I was a watch where for a long
time but then what I got us you know
when I got my first step flip phone
again I don't really need to watch
anymore and so I stopped having one and
so the only thing smartwatches really
did is remind me that I kind of like
having a lot John you know smart homes
man that's what I was talking about
earlier having everything connected
together you know being able to look at
your watch you know tap a little icon
and start your car tapping a little icon
and swipe a little bit to turn the
temperature down like that's that that's
where I see SmartWatch like for
smartwatches to be mainstream relevant
for everybody to want one I think that
you know they would have to be able to
control something that would be too
tedious to control with your smartphone
I greasy but but dealing it I mean first
smart home I guess to me if I wanted the
truly smart smart home I wouldn't need
to push our moat or push a button I
would be able to talk to it and it would
be able to you know recognize the
command you know yes that was true
enough to chase her bones everywhere but
that would be what would really be cool
I don't know it feels a lot cool shake
it to me if there's a lot cooler to like
swype on a wrist and then be like bunk
and then everything turns on in the
house or something like that exactly yes
you would want to be able to be like
computer turn on fridge or weight-wise a
frig off computer to computer why Josh
spends five hundred dollars a month on
groceries a day I'm trying to save money
man my electric bill was so high the
first time I saw it I wanted to turn it
off the fridge revision day um but no
like it wouldn't be yes it would be
really cool to say computer turn on my
car computer turn on the air
conditioning and stuff like that but I
don't know if again like feisty said
client side you need to have the
commands be very natural because now
that really can't like even Google now
right now I use it all the time in order
to do searches and stuff but you got to
talk like a robot basically and you got
it oh yeah you know it's not going to
have to have the technology get better
right now voice recognition is still you
have to talk a certain way yeah but I
guess
for me the idea is that how smart your
home when you have to reach for remote
of each for your phone to do something
you know I think that those should be
options but i would want good voice
technology too because what if you're
lazy as hell because you live in the
future and you don't want to move off
your couch and your phone requires you
to extend your arm all the way out if
you want going to do that I want to
tense the whole that's quite well what
about in the future when people are lazy
do people have been not getting up off
the couch to change the channel on the
television 5 40 years find it is it's in
half so it's 40 years ago did they know
they might have how the hell are we
supposed to know we've never seen anyone
use one I can't wait to use that on you
game rushing like the next time I go to
CES and I'm like chillin trying to like
rest because the video is really
stressful you're like dude are you lazy
I'm like dude I'm living in the future
maybe yeah I thought that was a good
quote it's true we're entitled to be
lazy now it's the future okay I love it
it really does sound like it's been if
I'm not mistaken it's probably been a
long day for all of us and slaw I can
tell because we're all kind of rambling
we all got loopy yeah exactly and at
least for me in my case I'm just slap
happy I mean it's it's it's a good night
then Jin Joos defense he's just always
this way no I really am exactly like
this all the time but um there was one
quick little tiny thing I wanted to
bring up and that's you know perspective
on our part um cuz you likey you know
Josh you've tried the HTC vive you're
one of like what a few hundred maybe a
thousand people that have ever used it
right yeah you know and we are tech
bloggers we see this stuff like the
moment it happens you know and we know
about all the stuff the moment it
happens and you know the people who
listen to this podcast or likely tech
nerds like we are and you know they
likely read about this stuff 45 minutes
after it happens when we write about it
and publish it um and it makes me wonder
a little bit like you know we're talking
about AR and VR and smart homes and you
know and all this stuff everything that
we've talked about has products out
there
are you know that they can do that stuff
you know like I you know the google
translate with the you know changing
stuff in real time on the walls you know
the translating and you know the gear VR
the and in my case you know there are
smart appliances out there but you know
people just don't really know about him
yet yeah and because you know gresham
make it a sin something really funny
earlier about how smartphones been
around since the 80s and they're only
popular now and it's you know like maybe
these things are all going to be popular
in the future and we only know about
them now because of our job because we
have to know about them why sure I mean
I'll talk about things like with family
members in our techies it like really
that's possible like when we Josh
remember of course the energies demo
that we went to at CES and I was talking
about that with that was one my sisters
like while you can do that you know for
those who don't know it better just
accompany they do wha wireless beaming
of electricity it was about 15 feet
range or something like that um and I
was talking about that and I like that
exists you know they thought this was
like a super you know a lot of stuff
i'll talk to because i'm a soup entered
to my family most of the time they don't
listen but when they do listen to what
I'm talking about it they're like that's
possible you'll step ya know is anyone i
saw that you just feel like I know well
they're not really listening but they're
like oh huh yeah my girlfriend does it
to me all the time and I actually like a
pop quiz her later I'm like hey remember
when I was talking about that thing and
she was like yeah you know is this other
thing and that's totally wrong yeah
they're like yeah he's talking to the
dryer that was like that and I tell her
Mike that's one and then when she yells
at me for not listening i bring it back
up again i do feel like though that
probably divided against technology
though that we're missing I mean that
that's gonna change the world is
something that we didn't even talk about
tonight you know and yet it probably
exists now you know which makes me I'm
sorry what's up well no that's exactly
the thing I was talking like it probably
is something that we've talked about
tonight because I'm sure that there were
for nerds in the 80s who SAT around
talking about smartphones like man we
computers get better and they can make
smaller more awesome processors this is
gonna be huge there was like saved it on
a mixtape yep definitely if only
we're here right now before track
reporter like you know can't used to do
exactly it's a key there were people
talking about smartphones back and they
just report on the tape and then handed
or Apple what was that old Fingal thing
that people used to use the radio right
thank you you didn't like 3am like
college radio shores of that your people
were talking about like man these
smartphone things it can be big someday
and like you know now we're sitting
you're talkin to the same thing like man
vr it could be big someday and it's like
you know I think it's because we you
know we are such ace you know I don't
want to say we're such a small there are
a lot of tech nerds out there but
comparatively speaking you know we are
not a very large group of people that
know all the stuff right off the top of
our heads like we do yeah and like an
example of that and I swear to god it's
the last thing I'm gonna say then you
guys can can wrap it up but um when the
galaxy s6 edge was announced my facebook
feed went freaking nuts and I had people
messaging me because I'm the guy that
they message when they want to buy a new
phone ask me about it like man that
galaxy set 6 or at galaxy s6 edge is
amazing I've never seen curved displays
like that and I'm like what the hell are
you talking about they did it with the
note for like six months ago and LG has
two of them they this is technology
that's been around for longer than a
year and a half now they're like are you
serious like yeah like there are already
smart phones out there with with this
technology and more specifically there's
already a phone out that slopes like the
s6 edge does and they're baffled like
this is something that it's in the
verizon store or may not in the verizon
store but it's in stores and people
still don't know about it so you know
it's one of those things were like you
know it you know did we not know that
smartphones were gonna be big back in
the eighties or did the people who knew
were just people like us and you know
the the norms didn't pay any attention
to it until it became a mainstream thing
you know that's kind of the point I'm
trying to make is you know maybe we have
talked about it and just given our
situation and given our experience and
what we do maybe the mainstream
publishers isn't ready to talk about the
stuff we're talking about right now yet
or is that I hate to say I hate to put
this out there and
it's just a thought that I had I had a
very specific type of studies back in
college but it makes me think this way
perhaps the people who are who are
creating these things were perhaps the
people who are able to control the way
that this information gets out or or how
people learn about it then maybe they
don't want to empower the masses just
yet you know maybe they don't want to
empower them with all of this stuff that
could empower you know even even the
basis person yeah is recalling noise it
do you have a tin foil hat there's a
facial we re can we have worked into a
conspiracy theory podcast Nordic
conspiracy podcast now recording out of
an RV in the middle of the desert
because UFOs exist damn it I'm in a van
down by the river I'm sort of a closing
though I'm just curious unless you have
something else do you want to say
closing wise josh is there any
technology like that's become big in the
last few years that any of us had
underestimated that we were like oh I
wouldn't be a big deal not really I mean
I didn't know again we're reporters so
of course we have to stop dogs are like
even before like we were in this field
like even like 10 years ago or like for
me or I'll be the first a minute and you
can all laugh at me um when I first
heard about the ipad is like could one a
large smartphone basically with no with
no cellular connectivity that idea is
stupid yeah no girl being sassy who
woulda thunk it I know but I be not but
as far as you know me thinking iPad I
mean I you know tablets turned though to
be fair tablets are starting to decline
a little so maybe I was right just just
took a little while for me to be right
oh well I know a lot of potential on
tablets which you know dude for me
that's the Chromebook nothing I did not
think that many people could go to a
straight to a browser only with
extensions experience as many because I
mean those are like top selling things
on amazon i know i mean i i i thought i
would do well one among you know casuals
but it's done better than I thought
Ethan and I think well this 80 well this
thing I had a conversation with a with
somebody on google+ about it and it's
like you know most people can put most
of their experience and that's the thing
oh that the thing that all of the
Chromebook fanboys town is it like oh
yeah you know most of the things that
people do can be done on a Chromebook
and the way I think about it is like
well you know like most people have like
nine things out of ten that they could
do on a Chromebook but like almost
everybody I've ever met or have ever
talked to have that one thing that they
need to have a computer for well up
windows or a magazine you know like
adobe photoshop or hardcore gaming or
video editing or something itunes
something like that where they
absolutely have to have something
outside of the browser experience and
you know it's you know I the idea that i
know that a lot of these people are
probably giving up something by going to
a Chromebook and that the fact that
they're okay with that is something I
didn't see coming a mile away yeah I
think I would agree with that to be
honest that that cloud computing has
become so ubiquitous already you know
there's there's two ways for it to go
but for it to have have the staying
power and the influence that it has
already that's something that I didn't
think was gonna happen right away that
the people were going to be so willing
to have all of their data up in this
space that could easily be pilfered nice
especially in the Edward Snowden era
right yeah oh well yeah yeah I agree
that's a good point I'm even like like
Google Drive and things like that I
didn't think it'd you know sorts a cloud
storage I don't think it'd be as big as
it was you know I do be big but I guess
I thought there'd be more people that
were paranoid by it but a lot of people
even businesses are you know relying on
how yeah how about you John then is
there any tech but you didn't
necessarily think would be that big of a
deal that is proven wrong yes and it's
almost insignificant to mention but
small portable Bluetooth speakers those
have meant crazy that's a good point i
guess i don't even think about it but
yeah everyone has a Bluetooth speaker
make more yeah and I get like you know
the big sonos machines where you can
really hook in I guess that's Wi-Fi but
you can still do bluetooth you know I
get a hardcore home theater system i get
the car stereo i get headphones but a
little tiny
speaker that really you know a lot of
them aren't very good best you can do is
listen to this great podcast on it a man
I listen to this great podcast in the
shower with my waterproof tiny bluetooth
speaker water / not is a big deal that's
not the only thing that's tiny in this
shower sorry I couldn't help sir you
have some balls that need kicked right
now I'm sorry it's time for bed grouchy
it's time oh come on you're always
thinking it I wasn't thinking it none of
you else tonight were mean enough to say
it that's all so bluetooth speakers
feisty yeah far edge you know the
conversation was even bigger than I
expected so I keep under estimating
those things oh yeah it's a wall
especially i would i would definitely
agree with you especially when you
consider the people who actually buy the
ones that are near the checkout counter
yes exactly exactly those small ones at
$16 bluetooth speaker great sounds like
it's the size of a penny like what what
is good to me if we were already super
over our time i would actually ask the
opposite as far as is there any
technology we thought was gonna be big
but that could just answer SmartWatch
isn't be done with it I think that was
gonna be big bow yeah I thought it was
gonna be that big I've always done got a
little speaking on the sci-fi topic
everyone wanted to be Dick Tracy I mean
come on now so the UH it's just like a
swine cars probably as one that many
people thought would be here by now well
true yeah but yeah reliable high-speed
internet that I know God forbid god
forbid one day fiber fibers gotta happen
one day I swear hahaha I heard of Hopsin
around 45 years from now josh is gonna
be an old guy sitting out front of his
disconnected house with his
grandchildren I swear to God fiber still
gonna happen
my lifetime a regular day after he
passes away that's why i know i can
google is like oh we want to bring
Google ya ever to you that's right there
I'm standing by the time we're all that
old they will be in seven or eight
cities I swear and moving faster yeah
it's that is that me more the guys like
any minute now and then the next slide
in the comic is then like a skeleton oh
man alright well we've had one lively
show today and it's it's been a good one
you know we were able I like these
lighter topics as we were able to go in
so many different directions but we know
maybe next week we will have a little
bit of a more we mean we'll have some
sort of reactions because now just
