handy from Android Authority comm and in
this video we're going to take a tour of
Android 6.0 marshmallow let's start with
the UI because not a lot has changed
over lollipop but home screens are set
up the same way with new screens being
added at your request with Google now
off to the left side the quick settings
are still just a swipe away and even the
settings menu is set up pretty much like
it was before if you're coming from
stock lollipop you should have no
trouble finding your way around there
are a few changes that are more notable
than others the applications section in
the settings menu has been changed to
accommodate the new permission system
which we'll talk about more here in a
minute the priority notification
settings that caused quite the stir in
lollipop have been relegated to the
quick settings other minor changes
include a more colorful Google search
bar a new app drawer which we'll talk
about in a moment and dragging apps
around on the home screen now provides a
shortcut to uninstall them there are
also a host of new animations that are
too numerous to list here some of the
more notable ones include the new Google
search animations and a more streamlined
set of animations for opening and
closing the app drawer and applications
text selection also got a slight revamp
with a little box that pops open with
the usual set of controls one of the
bigger changes in lollipop is the new
app drawer the horizontal app drawer
which is ruled today since the good old
days of jelly bean is now gone replaced
with a vertical app drawer this allows
for much faster browsing of your
applications and puts an end to
scrolling many pages horizontally to
find the application that you want in
addition you can now grab the scroll bar
on the right side and scroll quickly
through the applications with a letter
popping up to denote where you are in
the list we found this helpful if you're
looking for something quickly and it
matches the kind of mechanics found in
the contacts application most music apps
and any other application with a long
list of items perhaps the most prominent
change is the addition of an app search
bar at the top using this you can
quickly tap in a few letters and find
the application that you're looking for
this is the quickest way yet to find
something buried in the app drawer and
it's definitely a welcome addition
Google now on tap is the latest big
feature to hit Google now the premise of
now on tap is to give you information
far more quickly than if you were to
search for it in a web browser for
instance if someone mentions a place you
don't have to leave the messaging app
travel to the browser and then look it
up instead you long press the home
button and now on tap will pop up to
tell you all about that place for now
it's a hit
miss service this is expected because it
is brand-new and Google is still adding
things to the already impressive list of
recognizable keywords that now on tap
can utilize we expect this to become
better over time or at least much better
by the time non Nexus devices start
picking up marshmallow you'll have to
browse through the Google now settings
to enable it but otherwise it's very
easy to use we did a quick look video on
Google now on tap and if you want to
check that out that link is in the video
description below
chrome custom tabs is something we've
not heard a lot about since it was
announced at Google i/o earlier this
year the premise for chrome custom tabs
as simple as it provides developers with
a way to build an in-app browser without
having to do it themselves
it essentially opens a Chrome browser
tab inside of the application that
developers can control and customize to
suit their applications needs and thus
eliminate the half-baked usually slow
built in browsers like you see in
Pinterest Facebook Twitter and others
unfortunately there aren't a lot of
examples available
Ars Technica had to build an application
using an open source demo in order to
preview it but we managed to find at
least one application that uses it right
now it's not altogether different from
most in-app browsers except you'll have
features from Chrome baked in such as
autocomplete various web cookies and of
course the login history so you don't
have to do that over again it is
definitely better than custom built in
browsers and we hope it gets a higher
adoption rate you can easily identify
applications using the chrome custom
tabs by looking in the overflow menu
where you'll see a small banner that
says powered by Chrome having more
control over app permissions has been a
longtime request of many power users in
marshmallow those wishes have been
granted and the new permission system
has been released in marshmallow in full
force you now have more control over
application permissions than you've ever
had before if you use the gear icon in
the top right corner of the apps section
in the settings you can see which
applications use certain permissions on
your device in the settings menu you can
access application permissions and opt
to turn certain ones on or off as needed
to avoid any potential conflicts with
turning off a permission google has a
built-in system that feeds fake data to
the application so it keeps chugging
along as expected that means you
shouldn't have to worry about legacy
applications crashing when you disable
permissions that said we still don't
recommend you turn off the vital ones
like the camera permission for the
camera app another edition includes
pop-up boxes that will show up whenever
an application wants to access a
permission for the first time the most
frequent example is the location
permission as applications all over
Android seem to love asking for this one
at various times you can confirm or deny
missions when they pop up this is an
amazing addition because it allows even
the less tech-savvy to engage with
application permissions regularly and
they can prevent apps from having those
permissions if needed likely for the
first time those mode is a new addition
to marshmallow that's supposed to help
improve standby time the idea is that
once the phone has been off for a little
while it'll enter into doze mode in this
mode it will ignore pretty much
everything and just kind of exist in a
state of stasis screenshots and reports
have shown that this can keep the Nexus
5 alive for days sometimes weeks at a
time unfortunately there are a few
issues with this one the device has to
be off long enough to engage in doze
mode which really only happens if you're
a sleeper if you're one of those few
people who are honest about not checking
their phones at work the other is that
doze mode can be ignored by applications
if the application is set to priority
since developers choose whether or not
their application qualifies as a
priority in doze mode we expect most
applications to simply bypass this
battery saving function almost entirely
still it's a nice addition overall and
we hope to see it expanded and maybe
improved in future iterations of Android
one of the less important complaints
about lollipop was this newfangled
volume slider system instead of the
customary way this used to work with a
silent mode Google added a priority mode
for only certain applications mostly
alarms could send you notifications and
it do not disturb mode which silenced
everything including the alarms the
problem was this was way too much
information to deal with in a volume
slider and some people miss their alarms
in the Do Not Disturb mode in
marshmallow however the volume slider
returns to its old-school way is
lowering the volume all the way puts you
in vibrate mode with one more lowering
bringing you to the modify do not
disturb mode that only lets in alarms
the affirmation priority mode has been
sent to the quick settings where you can
tweak it there this is in my opinion the
perfect compromise between the way
things used to be and the way things
were in lollipop it's a subtle change
but a welcome one for what it's worth
tapping the icon on the right side of
the volume slider bar still lets you
change the system volume and media
volume which was in addition an android
5.1 lollipop one of the more exciting
api's that should make its way across
the Android ecosystem sometime soon is
the new fingerprint API there aren't a
lot of uses for this one yet but that's
going to change very soon the new Nexus
devices both have fingerprint scanners
they can be used to turn on the device
and bypass the lock screen you can also
use the fingerprint scanner and Android
pay this one is going to take a while to
shine because it's so very new the API
itself gives developers the capacity to
integrate fingerprint scanning into
their application and a variety
of ways you'll be able to unlock apps
like Android pay pay for items and a
whole lot more really the sky's the
limit here and it'll be fun to see the
creative ways this gets implemented in
the future
Apple Inc says another feature announced
back at Google i/o and this one is
pretty simple to explain remember all
those times a box popped up asking which
application you'd like to use for a link
that you clicked on well Apple Inc's
aims to remove that as much as possible
by giving the applications the ability
to take ownership of their own links for
instance if you click on a Twitter link
the Twitter application will just
automatically open instead of asking you
first
this will save some time in the long run
and help applications keep control over
their own content the box will still pop
up from time to time like if you have
two browsers installed in most cases
though the application that owns the
link should automatically grab it up and
open the application itself it's a small
thing but it contributes to a more
seamless experience between Android and
it's applications there were plenty of
other smaller changes in additions that
are worth noting even if they are minor
in terms of scope and day-to-day use
there is a new API that lets other
assistant applications do what Google
now on tap does thus you could use
something like hound and it could read
the text on your screen just like now on
tap this gives you the option to choose
your personal assistant as long as you
don't mind it reading what's on your
screen Auto Backup is a new addition to
marshmallow that improves over the
previous backup and restore functions in
Android with auto backup it will back up
the majority of your app data along with
the application that means when you
restore it you'll be able to continue
more or less where you left off before
it's better than it was before and a
welcome change adoptable storage allows
you to insert an SD card into your
device that make it work like your
internal storage that means if you have
32 gigabytes of on-board storage within
a 32 gigabyte SD card you can use
adoptable storage to essentially give
you 64 gigabytes of on-board storage
there are some caveats and bad things
will happen if the SD card dies or gets
removed but it's definitely something to
consider if you have a device with an SD
card slot app standby is a feature that
hasn't gotten a whole lot of press this
feature essentially takes applications
you don't use and puts them in a sort of
standby mode rendering them unable to
stay open while sucking down processor
power data and memory do note that this
feature only occurs on battery power and
when you're plugged in these
applications can more or less roam free
again direct share is a new sharing
feature enabled in marshmallow what it
does is remembers who you share things
with and with what applications you do
your
barring overtime it will begin
recommending people you can directly
share to over the application you
generally use to communicate with them
it's a small thing but it can save a lot
of time if you always share to the same
people some devices now have native
Android supports including many devices
and the Bluetooth stylus we imagine the
Galaxy Note series will take advantage
of the latter sometime next year lastly
there is now a system UI tuner you can
access this by long pressing the gear
icon in the quick settings this allows
you to organize your quick settings
remove buttons from the quick settings
and enable a battery percentage readout
on your status bar it's not overly
useful but it is there and it's fun to
play with just be warned that it can
break stuff of course there were tons
upon tons of other smaller improvements
including bug fixes security patches and
a whole lot more overall marshmallow is
a big step forward over lollipop there
isn't much of a change in the UI but we
can't expect a design overhaul every
year because that's unreasonable under
the hood Google has shored up a lot of
the weaknesses and complaints of
lollipop while adding some truly unique
useful and functional new features is it
perfect of course not but it's a lot
closer than lollipop was if you agree or
disagree you can go and tell us why in
the comments and that about does it for
this video folks if you like this video
give us a thumbs up and if not let me
know why in the comments while you're
