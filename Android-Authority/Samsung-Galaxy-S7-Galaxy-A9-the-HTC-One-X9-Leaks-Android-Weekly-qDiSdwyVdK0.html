domain.com well you'd think the leaks
would have slowed down over the holiday
season but they haven't it turns out
that a certain flagship may indeed have
a microSD card slot according to The
Wall Street Journal the galaxy s7 will
indeed have microSD card support and
according to the same source the biggest
new feature of the galaxy s7 and s7 edge
will be a pressure-sensitive display
that will work a lot like the 3d touch
feature available on the iphone 6s and
6s plus the galaxy s7 is reported to
also come with a type C port as seen in
the latest Nexus generation reportedly
the device will draw a full day's charge
in under 30 minutes and in some cases
significantly faster than that for
comparison the Nexus 5x requires about
1.5 hours to charge up to a hundred
percent now before you get too excited
it should be noted that the same source
indicated that the micro SD card support
would be included on the flat s7 but not
the edge variant so take it for what
it's worth and we found more leaks
surrounding the Samsung Galaxy a nine
confirming what we already know it is a
boat of a phone according to the promo
pictures the galaxy and nine will
feature a six inch Super AMOLED display
with 1920 by 1080 resolution at 1.8
gigahertz Snapdragon 620 processor 3
gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage microSD expansion and
support for Samsung pay it will also
sport a massive 4000 milliamp hour
battery with Qualcomm's quick charge 2.0
technology allowing you to top-up your
battery in a fraction of the time it
also comes with a 13 megapixel rear
camera and o is and F point 1 9 aperture
as well as an 8 megapixel front camera
unfortunately folks waiting to get their
hands on the smartphone won't even get a
chance to use the latest version of
Android according to the leaked
materials it will launch with android
5.1.1 that is lollipop the device will
come with a fingerprint scanner mounted
on the home button below the display now
last week you guys heard me talk about
the leaked images of the HTC One X 9 but
now we found a video as a quick
refresher we believe that the HTC One X
9 will come with a 5.5 inch
1080p display at 3000 milliamp hour
battery 16 gigabytes of internal memory
and microSD card support and 2 or 3
gigabytes of RAM as there appear to be
two models available the x9 is powered
by an octa-core MediaTek Helio x10
processor which features eight little
cortex 853 CPU cores clocked at 2.2
gigahertz and a power VR GPU the rear
camera is a 13 megapixel sensor complete
with optical image stabilization the
camera can capture a 4k video and also
supports RAW format image files there's
a five megapixel camera on the front and
HTC's dual boomsound speakers so we're
looking at a mid-range performer with
some higher-end features now we don't
have an official release date or price
tag for the HTC One X 9 just yet but
speculation is that it will sell for
around 2001 or $308 us if true this
would make it cheaper than the HTC One
a9 and the hence that would certainly
offer some compelling hardware at that
price we also found a leaked image of a
new Motorola handset the source here is
CN beta and they suggest it might be the
Moto X 2016 however it is just a
production prototype and therefore very
much subject to change if you look near
the bottom of the device you can see 16
small round holes these are believed to
be for the speakers which would imply
the Motorola might be interested in
creating a more premium audio experience
the design seen in this leaked image
would theoretically make it much more
difficult to customize such a product in
moto maker we could easily imagine
several different colors of metal but
due to the total redesign of the phone
itself there doesn't seem to be ample
locations where different color schemes
could be applied now I'd like to hear
from you guys how much do you really
love moto maker does it really matter to
you do you really care about being able
to customize your colors and materials
of your device perhaps not perhaps this
means that Motorola is doing away with
that and just gonna go with one premium
design what are you guys thinking and
this week's t-shirt winner is addy
who on Twitter came up with Yoda Android
calm love not only the Star Wars
reference but the double meaning because
it could be Yoda Android as in do not
there is no try
or it could be instead of Yoda man it
