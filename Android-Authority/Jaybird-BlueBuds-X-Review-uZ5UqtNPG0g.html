a bit of a confession to make I'm kind
of tough on ear buds I've gone through
as many as a few pairs in a month before
mainly because I keep breaking them
because of snags it happens to all of us
right now there is a solution in
Bluetooth earbuds but a lot of those
sound like junk not these the jaybird
blue buds ex sound great plus they're
light and comfortable there's got to be
a downside right let's find out opening
up the box the first thing you see is
the earbuds themselves surrounding the
handi included carrying case this is
where you're going to find everything
else the charging cable and a bag
labeled accessories this holds three
pairs of rubber tips small medium and
large that's normal what isn't normal is
the little wing looking pins these are
the ear cushions also available in small
medium and large finally there are a few
cable clips we'll get to what they're
for in a little bit the ear cushions are
a major feature of the jaybird blue buds
ex they fit into your outer ear and keep
the ear buds in place this not only
keeps you from dropping them in the sink
but it provides better sound quality
since they're not constantly slipping
out of your ear
the j-bird blew buds ex come with a few
special features that make them a lot
more user friendly than your average
pair of Bluetooth earbuds the ear
cushions are one of those features and
so is Jenna the friendly voice that
tells you when you're powering the blue
buds up or down when you're searching
for your audio device and other cool
stuff like that
unlike most ear buds the blue buds can
be worn in two different ways the normal
method has the cable going under your
ear while the advanced method has the
cable going over your ear
this also means you don't need as long a
cable which is where the cable clips
come into play on the other hand it is a
little harder to hit the buttons when
you're using the advanced method jaybird
claims a battery life of about eight
hours in my testing they definitely got
very close to that clocking in at around
seven and a half hours they also charge
fairly quickly reaching a full charge in
two hours if you only need a quick music
fix a thirty minute charge will get you
ninety minutes of playtime and as long
as you're carrying the charging cable
with you in the carrying case charging
the blue buds whenever you're not using
them can keep you going all day no
matter what you're doing
finally we're talking about the most
important factor the sound quality
subpar sound quality can ruin what would
otherwise be a great pair of earbuds
luckily that's not the case here the one
thing that everyone is going to wonder
about and they always do is the bass and
yes the blue buds get low indeed but the
bass is more than that a lot of ear buds
can push out low rumbling bass these
days but the bass definition in the blue
buds is impressive you can hear a lot
more than you would in lower end
earphone the low mid definition is also
surprisingly good considering that even
a lot of expensive over the ear
headphones can have trouble with the low
mids going up the frequencies it stays
the same at the highs it's clear and
crisp but not overly hyped sounding in
that way that can hurt your ears after a
while
even as I cranked up the volume I didn't
hear any noticeable distortion from the
blue buds it might be present at the
absolute highest volume levels but I
wasn't willing to subject my ears to
that stereo width was another aspect of
the blue buds that really surprised me
since that's something that suffered
big-time and older Bluetooth audio
devices these aren't the highest
absolute audiophile studio-quality
headphones you could ever use but hey
you're not going to be looking for that
in earbud anyway and B you're definitely
not going to be looking for it in
something that's Bluetooth based on
features alone we're looking at a great
pair of earbuds here even after trying
there's not much bad I can say about
them aside from that there's a bit of an
adjustment period because of the way
they can be worn and the ear cushions
one thing that might put people off
though
is the price I'm not saying they're not
worth it they absolutely are worth the
money it's just that a lot of people
might not be used to paying over $100
for earbuds if you're like me and tend
to be rough on them you might want to be
a little more careful with these or just
use the included carrying case to
protect your investment and that wraps
it up if you want some more details make
sure to check out the accompanying
article you can find the link in the

you're there you can also find links to
