on everybody and this is a look at a
brand new version of the LGV 30 now if
you were looking for something that was
truly revolutionary from LG you may not
be finding it here this is basically the
LG v 30 basically all of the same
specifications with a couple of changes
now the six gigabytes of RAM is a nice
welcome addition and the one that we are
using in this video is the new Moroccan
blue we won for the blue one over the
Platinum gray one which looks just like
a darker version of the silver that we
had in our review already on top of they
bump up in RAM you also get a huge bump
up in storage 128 gigabytes or 256
gigabytes of on-board storage are
available in this version as well
everything is the same here right down
to the materials the feel and also the
cameras you still get the wide-angle
lens on the rear and you get the front
facing camera that admittedly is not the
best one of the bunch but what LG is
trying to introduce at least in the LGV
30s thinkyou edition yes that is the
full name of this phone the LG v 30s as
we'll call it here is the one that is
supposed to bring more artificial
intelligence features and it mainly has
to do with a couple of camera modes
going to the camera and there are a
couple of buttons there that allow you
to do a few different functions one of
them in particular is an AI lens which
uses some machine learning in order to
figure out what kind of subject is in
the frame in a lot of cases is going to
be pretty obvious you're probably
pointing it at a person and it will
change the settings to a better suit the
kind of photo you would want of a
portrait for example or if you have a
piece of fruit in front of it then it'll
say that it's food we did do a somewhat
unscientific test where we had a person
and the camera did denote that it is a
person in front of the camera hold up a
piece of fruit to cover their face and
see if it was going to change it up well
we think that because it kept seeing the
hands that it kept seeing a person which
is kind of fair once we put this orange
down on a table and pointed the camera
at it it was like okay this is
definitely food I did use it for a
couple of other situations as well it
did find that this was a flower even
though it is a fake set of points EDIUS
and then from there we were able to go
to the cue lens the cue lens is the
other option here that is supposed to
marry not only user input but also some
artificial intelligence features you
might see on other phones
it's going to search or do a reverse
image search on in this case Amazon
Pinterest or you might just want to scan
a QR code all three of those options are
available on the bottom and if you get
your subject into frame and then select
which network you want to search it will
figure out what that item is now
obviously systems like this even ones
we've seen on bixby and on google lens
aren't always perfect we did scan a book
and it did find it on Amazon but the
other items are just vague enough that
it wasn't really looking for the
specific bottle of wine in this case
instead it just found bottles of wine
LG has also changed up the camera a
little bit to provide what is called a
bright mode where they take four groups
of the megapixels the 16 megapixels in
the camera groups them together to flood
more light into the sensor but you get a
4 megapixel picture now inside of the
camera it will just automatically figure
out that you need the bright mode on and
there's an icon to turn it on and off so
if you are looking for a huge in ocean
from LG here at MWC 2018 you might be a
bit disappointed just like we were now
we're always going to enjoy some
different design choices but other than
the color and the 6000 bytes of ram
there's really not much differentiating
this phone from the LGV 30s that already
exist out there in the world LG was
pretty quick to say that they do have
some huge announcements coming a little
bit later this year but right now they
are sticking to this new idea that
they're going to do incremental
improvements onto the phones that
already exist that they know already
successful now though we are going to do
a full review on this phone mainly over
the AI features we can say right now
that if you already have an LG V 30 then
maybe this upgrade is not something you
would want to consider but if you've
been holding out until now you might
already be missing out on a great video
camera on the LG v 30 and now it comes
with a new color in any case keep it
tuned to android authority for all of
the best including more on this the LG v
30s think you and you can stay tuned for
all of the great announcements that
we're seeing here at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona Spain remember to
head over to Andrew authority calm for
even more of all of that coverage and

haven't already because we are your
