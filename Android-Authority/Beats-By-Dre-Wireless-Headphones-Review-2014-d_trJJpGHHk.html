name is Kevin detect India and today I
have a review for you of the most highly
anticipated most talked-about headphones
the wireless beats by dre 2014 the beats
by dre headphones were released in late
2008 these were created by monster with
a collaboration with dr. Dre his primary
source of advertisement was from hip hop
producers celebrities and product
placement over the years these
headphones are known as becoming a
fashion statement rather than a premium
audio setup i'm previously owned the
beats by dre headphones and let me tell
you people comment ask to listen and
even give me awkward fist pumps because
I'm wearing beats it seems like there's
just a silent camaraderie when
purchasing Beats headphones with the
other owners and just people who envy
you the beats by dre wireless headphones
come in and rather large box the box
hits tall and bold with the dr. dre red
and black color scheme once you cut
through the plastic wrapping pull off
the red lid up front and center you will
see the beats logo on top of the
headphone carrying show the headphone
carrying show is made of hard rubber and
has a black and red zipper and inside
you'll find the headphones all the
cables are cased in thick red rubber
although I did not pull and tug on the
cabling they appear to be extremely
durable the wireless beats by dre s are
a Bluetooth headset like many other
Bluetooth headsets battery life is one
of the most important features there's a
battery built into the headphones this
time around and allows for charging via
microUSB also requested feature that was
granted was Auto wall and this
eliminates the need for two triple A
batteries by including a rechargeable 20
hour lithium-ion battery inside the
headphones these headphones also allow
for a wired listening experience as well
this makes it easy to listen to music on
a computer that may not have Bluetooth
and comes with two cables one that is a
regular 3.5 millimeter cable with a
right angle tip and also a 3.5
millimeter cable with audio controls and
a mic and to answer your question
the headphones need to be charged to
listen to music these headphones are
smaller sleeker and less squeaky
comparing these headphones to the first
generation there is a significant amount
of aesthetic chain
the beats bring back the folding design
instead of having the visible screws
this time around the screws are covered
which gives it a more sleek appearance a
lot of the beats by dre branding have
either change or been removed completely
the cups on the ear are soft buttery
leather that gently covers your ears the
stitching is visible and adds a subtle
design element previous iterations of
the beat by Dre's there was some major
sound leakage you can easily hear the
music lyrics included within 5 feet as
you can hear sound leakage is still an
issue one of the new studio feature is a
dual mode noise cancelling circuit one
setting is set to be customized for
music listening and the other setting is
created for shutting out sounds around
you this is called the Beats acoustic
engine the sound cancellation method
that the Beats uses works as expected if
you have used other headphones that uses
a similar method to keep the outside
sounds out then you should really know
what to expect it does not make the
world around you silent but it does a
good job of cutting out sound also with
music playing plus the noise
cancellation going at the same time it
will be hard-pressed to find a better
solution if you want to hear your
surroundings you can press on the beats
button on the right ear cup and this
will fade the music and then a
deactivates the noise cancellation in a
very slick way the lightweight
construction of the beats allows for an
easy we're the ear cup that grips your
ears are soft and feels nice as well
their cushions or as I call them ear
pillows are the best I've ever owned the
headband has a large cushion wrapped
around it and all three of these things
combined creates an enjoyable experience
there's one thing in the comfort
department that stops these from
achieving perfection the ear cups get
hot easily and they may cause discomfort
if you are doing any activity that
generates any heat I'm not speaking
about a full workout but a brisk walk
around the mall can heat these things up
overall I have no problems wearing these
headphones for several hours even out
and about there's no getting around this
the beats Wireless are made for bass
heads when putting on the beats by dre
headphones you instantly feel the music
you can feel the thump of the bass and
also hear every note although the beats
do not produce an accurate sound
signature
still provides an enjoyable experience
most music listeners may not understand
the difference between mids and highs
when referencing their favorite song and
honestly most don't care during an audio
test on audio check net using a standard
laptop with a real tech audio card wired
the bass extension goes down to 20 Hertz
the treble extension was able to come in
at 17 kilo Hertz dynamic range which is
the ratio between the loudest signal you
can hear and the Quietus this comes in
at 115 DB which is a respectable amount
all the other tests are quality control
tests and they all pass with no issues
this test confirms what I actually was
hearing listening to my favorite songs
extremely heavy on the bass but the
treble at times has issues reaching the
higher levels the bass is smooth and
only pumps when appropriate and just
like many other headphones it always
depends on what you are listening to and
how you truly feel about the pair of
headphones it feels like these
headphones are optimized to make you
feel like you're at a live show not a
mix down recording session this would
explain while many people enjoy the
sound of these headphones produce the
wireless component works as described
with little impact to battery the
headset provides you controls that you
can adjust the volume strictly for the
headset if you long press the same
buttons that allows you to skip tracks
and go back a track even before this
review started you had an opinion on the
headphones or they're shaped by the
media or your own personal experiences
these headphones are what I thought they
were they're an upgrade to a headphone
known for their bass and live
performance type of sound these
headphones do not skimp when it comes to
accessories the appearance and the
overall feel and you don't feel cheated
after spending some extra money for the
name and that's the thing you are
spinning some extra money for the name
and just like other major products out
there you end up paying more because it
has the logo on it Point Blank period
within this price range you are able to
find other headphones that achieve the
same result and yet provide a more
balanced sound this may not matter and
some people just want a concert type of
sound which is fine there are other
times that I prefer to hear music in
this fashion working out and look at a
zone out in some
the Bluetooth wireless connectivity z'
makes it incredibly convenient to use
mount about and the headphones are
easily charged via microUSB everything
that you loved about the beats or hate
it they became better or worse
ultimately is your decision if these
headphones are good for you when she
already had your mind made up right
there you have it folks this was the
review of the wireless beats by dre
