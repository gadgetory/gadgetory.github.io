to you by domain.com so you won't you
some galaxy s6 rumors well we're going
to take all those rumors from around the
web and give them a thumbs up thumbs
down or just uh sort of start off let's
jump in the time machine and go way back
to over a year ago when there were
rumors surrounding the galaxy s5 and
what are we here a samsung VP said the
galaxy s5 will be a quote very different
design now if you want to really pack on
the irony when the president of Samsung
Electronics said at the design
automation conference the smartphone of
the future is going to require a quote
revolution in thinking about technical
design and not enough people are
prepared for it and then of course the
galaxy s5 was launched and we saw not a
very different design and certainly no
technical design revolution yeah I was
burned and you guys have heard me
complain about it before because I was
really hyped about the s5 I mean I guess
I lived in a little bit of a bubble
because I had been covering rumors
tracking at the weeks before the launch
and then it came out and it was like
anticlimactic so I am taking everything
with a big grain of salt and I suggest
that you do too but let's start with
design one of the top rumors is that the
s6 could have that metal chassis how
believable is this though we've heard
this many times before but it could
happen because Samsung has been actively
experimenting with full metal designs on
some of its lower and mid range devices
and even the note 4 had a metallic frame
the problem here is that we've also
heard reports that Samsung is having
quality control issues with the
production of its unibody cases which
makes us question whether or not samsung
could really pull off a unibody case for
one of its core flagship devices alright
guys no remember we're dealing in the
realm of probabilities but i am going to
give the rumor surrounding the metal
chassis a thumbs up i think it's
something that Samsung would want to do
to kind of overcome the reputation they
have for lower quality plastic he feels
especially on the cover of their devices
we can hope all right next up is the
rumors surrounding the duel
display while some publications suggest
the rumor has no real basis others
claimed that the phone will not only
feature dual edges that are less
dramatic and angle and easier to grip
than the Galaxy Note edge but that this
design will apply to all galaxy s6
devices and that it will not have a
special variant alright so we're going
to break this rumor up yes I think the
s6 will have a dual edged variant but
all Essex's have dual edges no and
here's why making curved displays as
well as the curved glass covering them
is more difficult than making
conventional displays which is a mature
technology and given that the galaxy s6
will sell in the tens of millions
samsung may have a lot of trouble
manufacturing enough displays if they're
all dual edged so yes I think it's
highly probable there'll be two versions
of the s6 a dual edged version and a
regular display version now let's move
on to rumors surrounding the display
itself we still don't know much about
the display for the galaxy s6 but at
least one rumor claims that will have a
5.5 inch 1080p AMOLED display and will
not make the jump to qhd that means this
display won't be nearly as impressive as
what's found on the note 4 but it still
should provide more than good enough of
a viewing experience now let's get to
the engine and talk about this specs
most rumors suggest the note 4 will ship
with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 and 3
gigabytes of RAM and given the existence
of a note for variant with a Snapdragon
810 we think this is pretty much a safe
bet however one publication does dispute
this idea and that is phone arena
according to phone Arena the Snapdragon
810 will in fact ship inside the galaxy
s6 edge like model but a lower end based
version will offer up 1080p display and
just a Snapdragon 801 now unless Samsung
is calling the galaxy x 6 neo or
something similar we find this hard to
believe considering even the note 4
offered up a Snapdragon 805 so I got to
give a probable thumbs up to the
Snapdragon 810 now let's talk about the
all-important camera now last November
there was a rumor that surfaced
suggesting that the phone would not see
Samsung's iso cell technology but
instead offer up the IMX to
forty sensor like on the note 4 and with
the likely inclusion of OAS technology
at the same time it was also rumored
that we'd see a 5-megapixel front-facing
camera now because there's so little
information about the s6 is camera we
got to give the rumour up man now next
up let's talk software features probably
the two biggest complaints we hear about
Samsung phones is the lack of premium
design and over cluttered software we
already know the rumor mill suggesting
that Samsung is introducing a unibody
design that should help fight some of
the design criticism but now we've also
started to hear rumors that Samsung is
also making some massive changes to the
software I know please let it be a
revamped TouchWiz according to business
Korea Samsung aims to simplify the
software features of the galaxy s6
creating a lighter weight custom UI that
puts less stress on the s6 as hardware
the end result would be that the much
complained about lag from TouchWiz would
be a thing of the past how far Samsung
plays to take this makeover remains
unseen so one would hope that Samsung
would learn from other manufacturers
like Sony that have had noticeable
success with creating near Android stock
like experiences for their custom skins
but we can hope but i gotta tell you i
give this a probably not true rumor the
same rumor was bandied about regarding
the samsung galaxy s6 just before that
launch and of course that never came to
light now let's talk release dates
unless falling sales for Samsung's hand
it's likely we won't see the galaxy s6
and tell sometime around the Mobile
World Congress whether that's a few
weeks before or after or perhaps right
during the Congress now it should be fun
to find out what you guys thought and if
you look at the bottom of the companion
article to this show you'll see where
people voted for the number one feature
that they want to find in the galaxy s6
now for those of you who are old enough
to remember you can go and think back 15
20 years ago and recall what it would
have been like to own a domain name with
a dot-com extension I mean a good one
Mark Cuban became a billionaire
overnight pretty much because he sold
business news com or something similar
to that
and it was a life changer well
extensions and domain names have changed
now they have great ones it's not just
about comm net org anymore you now have
the opportunity to name your site and
build your brand like never before
choose from a growing list of more than
200 domain name extensions like NYC
