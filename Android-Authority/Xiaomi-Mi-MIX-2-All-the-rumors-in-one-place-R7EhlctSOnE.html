started this whole bezel Estus play
trend yes I know some of you were
thinking Jace sharp did something
earlier but come on Xiaomi really gave
it steam so the question is with the
Xiaomi me mix - are they gonna give us
something that starts a new trend just
like his predecessor the me mix - is
expected to be a high-end device rumors
regarding its specs vary from source to
source with each one telling a slightly
different story the smartphone was
listed on benchmarking website GFX bench
back in July revealing a few details
about it it should come with a
snapdragon 835 chipset 8 gigabytes of
RAM and a 5-megapixel selfie snapper
that will be positioned in the bottom
bezel of the smartphone that's
definitely not the best location but
it's probably the only option as there
just won't be enough room on top more on
that in a minute the listing also
reveals that the smartphone will sport a
six point four inch IPS LCD display
although some rumors claim that shell me
will actually opt for an AMOLED panel
the resolution is said to be 25 40 by
1440 pixels but there's still a chance
that Xiaomi will stick with the 20 40 by
1080 just like the original me mix
according to the website my drivers the
Xiaomi me mix 2 will be available in two
variants the already mentioned model
with 8 gigabytes of RAM will offer 256
gigabytes of storage well the second
option will feature 6 gigabytes of RAM
and 128 gigabytes of storage
unfortunately the smartphone isn't
expected to sport a microSD card slot
when it comes to camera rumors things
get a bit confusing some claimed that
the device will have a 12 megapixel
shooter on the back while others believe
the smartphone will have a 19 megapixel
sensor once more some also claimed the
device will feature a dual camera setup
just like a lot of other flagships these
days rumors also point to an rear
mounted fingerprint scanner at facial
recognition feature and Android 7.1.1
nougat with Xiaomi's me u9 on top my
drivers reports that you'll have to dish
out three thousand 999 RMB or
$600 us to get the entry-level model the
second model is around $750 us or 4999
RMB now the original me mix was largely
not available in the West some believe
that the me mix 2 will change that but
if it's true it's gonna be quite a bit
more expensive here in the West I would
not hold your breath I doubt it's
actually gonna happen Samsung has done a
really good job of keeping Xiaomi out of
the West at least through distribution
deals let me know what you think in the
comments below about this device I think
it looks pretty fantastic especially if
they give us a smaller version that'd be
great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
