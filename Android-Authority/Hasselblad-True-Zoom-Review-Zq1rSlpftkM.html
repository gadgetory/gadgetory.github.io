to happen especially when you have moto
mods that offer a speaker a battery pack
and yes even a projector hey guys John
be here with Android authority and this
is the latest modal mod accessory the
Hasselblad
true zoom the standout feature here of
course is the 10 times optical zoom
which I'll talk about first
now people and offer any sort of optical
zoom their cameras however there are
phones out there that also achieve a 10
times zoom range take for example the
samsung galaxy k zoom from 2014 which -
also has a 10 times zoom anyways the 10
times optical range here with the
Hasselblad true zoom is so useful you
can take a snapshot of something far
away in distance so for sporting events
and other things where you're way back
out there it's neat how it makes it seem
like you're right up there in the action
it's nice that the design follows a
typical camera you have a rubbery grip
your zoom controls and even a dedicated
shutter key since this is a motor mod I
do like how it offers the same seamless
integration with the Moto Z lineup the
magnetic connection that's established
is tight so you won't need to worry
about it coming apart it's a bit on the
hefty side almost tripling the thickness
of the phone in the process so yeah it's
not something that you'll want to keep
tucked away in your pocket for long
periods of time while we do like the
design it's missing some characteristics
that would please enthusiasts for
example there's no way to properly mount
this to a tripod or even a ring around
the lens to adjust the focus manually so
the 10 times optical zoom is its most
notable feature but when you look at
some of the specs it's the same caliber
as other camera phones and that's shame
it features a 12 megapixel one over 2.3
inches backside illuminated CMOS sensor
that alone is pretty much in line to the
same sensors in most phones the aperture
ranges from F 3.5 all the way to 6.5 at
the longest zoom range and rounding
things off it has optical image
stabilization for still shots but you
only get electronic image stabilization
for vide
you also have two microphones a xenon
flash and up to 1080p video recording
that last part is a disappointment given
that 4k is found in many mid-range errs
nowadays when it comes to the software
you can snap standard photos you could
also address the controls using the
manual mode and there's also panoramic
shot as well but we were expecting more
like a lot more to be exact
instead it's lacking in this area for
photos it's nice see that the OIS kicks
in when the shutter key is pressed
halfway and its usefulness is most
prevalent when the zooms at its maximum
mainly because it manages to do nicely
with keeping the shot stable when it
comes to video there's an electronic
image stabilization system in place
sadly though this stabilization is a bit
delayed you can easily see how it slower
to react to the movements of us panning
while walking with some of the footage
you could say we're a bit concerned when
the quality of the Moto Z play droid is
better than that of the Hasselblad true
zoom yes there's the optical zoom that's
there to get closer but if we're talking
purely about quality here the Moto G
play droid dishes up more details and
better colors in comparison the hospital
at true zoom has a tendency to be
software with washed out colors at the
end of the day you can say that the
Hasselblad true zoom is there for the
convenience of zooming beyond that
however we really can't recommend it to
replace the cameras in the Moto Z line
given the steep cost of this accessory
250 bucks if you're buying through
Verizon or even a crazier $300 from
Motorola directly it's not something for
impulse buyers the expense is really
steep making it hard for even the
average Joe to even think about buying
just to get that one piece oom and
forget about trying to sell this to the
enthusiast honestly this thing had a lot
of potential but it fails in many
regards with the exception of course
zooming so if you guys want to learn
more about this you could check out our
