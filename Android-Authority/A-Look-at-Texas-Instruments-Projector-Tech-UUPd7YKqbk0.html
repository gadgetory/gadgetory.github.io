subscribe to our YouTube channel for a
while
then we have Frank Boise at each foot
Berlin talking about the DLP
technologies and how projectors are
eventually going to be making it and
every single mobile device we know and
love in the near future and now we have
some exciting new technologies now since
we're live on the ground here at CES
2013 what do you have for us ranked we
have several things that are really cool
here today let me take you through them
the first one is this kodak product it's
basically a cell phone accessory product
and it's talking to this Android phone
right here and so this is wirelessly
streaming through Wi-Fi to this device a
great companion for taking taking with
you on your cell phone so if you want to
do business presentations if you want
play games you want to have sharing
experiences great little product we
expect it'll be on sale for $199
moving over here this is a product from
smart devices it's it's basically about
a 7 inch tablet but it has Pico
projection inside of it very cool the
first one first one first tablet in the
world and weird what we're showing here
is just simply Angry Birds how cool is
that rather than watching it on a 7-inch
screen being able to protected to
something 3040 inches in size so whether
again when you want to play games
whether you want to share experiences
with your consumer related experiences
about design do business presentations
this is a great application of Pico
technology the first tablet and then
right here it's another we've shown you
of course the great galaxy being which
is a personal phone that I carry this is
a new phone from a company called Q know
if you can see that the image is very
very bright and this is basically
Android running the latest Android Ice
Cream Sandwich and it's also it's also
giving you probably about 30 lumens and
brightness on the output so this is
shipping in Japan shortly and the season
shipping in China
shortly and so we're going to continue
to see Pico technology rollout in all of
these small types of devices all these
mobile devices in the world
have we put that back on here
like I don't have the specifics on the
size of the battery we just we just got
the sequence seem so yeah a lot of these
a lot of these are new to us
you mentioned that you have a more
advanced yes
so we put this down oh crap that again
here but there's yeah there's a new
announcement and it's basically a new
pixel called TRP or tilt and roll pixel
off tilt and roll Basin self-enroll
pixel so what it does is it it creates
more efficiency it packs about about
twice as many pixels in the face so in
the future we're gonna see brighter pico
projectors we're going to see them with
higher resolution and with lower power
consumption X and so it just extends the
value of getting to a big picture from
one of these very small devices for all
constrained by the screen size this
allows us to get our digital content
unleash the power of getting that visual
content anywhere anytime and so we're
really excited about that we're working
with companies right now to get those
products into production and so expect
to see them over time in the marketplace
so if you see we're looking at 50% more
pixels ideally 50% more brightness in
terms of lumens more battery efficiency
but what's the resolution of the
projector on this one right now is this
one ago this one is is NH thing so in HD
640 by 360 that's right this one for
example is 854 by 480 that's a fifty
four by four I guess so there's excuse
me I'm sorry this one is six 640 by 480
okay right and then there but there
the kodak product is 854x480 and this is
a 54 bucket rolling this this being
control over what interface is this
bluetooth or Wi-Fi it's Wi-Fi so it
communicates through Wi-Fi from the
smartphone to the projector
yes and the delta battery as well yes
correct
resolution this looks to be a quite a
short picture X 854 by 480 sets DVD DVD
quality so realistically there's Tilton
role projection technology they're
referring to when can we expect to see
it at least a demonstration or a sample
of it what do you think's realistic well
we're we're actually showing private
demos of it here at the show but but
we'll probably see it come out and we're
working with manufacturers now and then
we'll see them rollout products over
time so are a lot of the analysts like
Gardner and others are they correct is
it realistic that we're going to see
micro projectors in our tablets and our
smartphones
you know you can look at a lot of
different analysts around and there's
all these different forecasts of the
millions of units you know I believe
that there's I believe the market will
be in 2013 believe it'll be about five
million units okay four to five million
units in that in that range there and we
expect it to continue to grow because
the value proposition is so compelling
it is if you've used one of these phones
and I carry what beats us my personal
phone yeah it is really comes in handy
we're gonna do it when you're trying to
share experiences whether it's just a
photo a video or whether it's a
presentation there's just so many
different applications that you start to
become aware of when you finally use the
product really so yeah getting to much
bigger pictures getting getting away
from the constraints of the screen
that's gonna that's going to happen and
so we're really excited to be a part of
it and we're excited to follow you you
know and I'm really really happy to hear
that you guys have figured out a way to
pack more pixels into a smaller profile
save more power we're happy that we're
happy to hear it - are we going to get a
demonstration of this in our meeting
or do we need to be able meeting
scheduled for Thursday the likely both
books to class I'm really excited about
obviously you guys like you said can you
imagine going to Grandma's house and you
want to show pictures on a five inch or
4 inch screen versus being able to
project a 40 inch or 50 inch image onto
the wall what's preferable it's only a
matter of time and it's going to be a
game-changing thing you know our kids
from now they're gonna have projectors
and infrared and also the futuristic
interfaces so teait DLP is a leader in
the space and so I wanted to thank Frank
first time thank you very much for
shedding some light thank you so much
appreciate finally back yeah thanks
thanks all right take care under
authority from CS Capcom thanks very
much everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
