Authority and today I want to talk a
little bit about the Galaxy watch this
was announced alongside the galaxy note
9 and the galaxy watch is basically the
successor to the gear s3 but they're
sort of ditching the gear branding and
just calling it the galaxy watch which I
felt like was just a matter of time
because the phones are called galaxies
the tablets are called galaxies so it
sort of made sense that the watch was
going to be using the galaxy branding
but full disclosure before we dive into
the review I'm not typically a
SmartWatch or wearables person I don't
really wear fitness trackers even though
I go to the gym pretty regularly and I
haven't worn a SmartWatch since like the
original LG G watch so I won't be able
to really draw very many comparisons
with this watch to another SmartWatch or
wearable and tell you if this does
anything better or worse than another
product but what I will be able to tell
you is my experiences with this watch
and all of the things that it can do and
whether I think it does those things
well because this watch can do a ton of
different things so I kind of consider
the galaxy watch the Swiss Army knife of
smartwatches it's a watch that tries to
do a little bit of everything it tries
to be a smart watch and it also tries to
be a fitness / health tracker and it
also tries to look good while doing it
and I would say that 90% of the
execution is done extremely well and
then the other 10% is not so good but
we'll get to that 10% a little bit later
one of the things I think Samsung has
done really well with over the last
couple of years is the design of their
smartwatches
the Galaxy watch looks like a normal
watch and even saw this from a distance
you probably wouldn't assume that it was
a SmartWatch and it's also very elegant
and classy it's made of metal so it
feels very high-quality like a watch
should and I have the larger 46
millimeter version in silver but there
is a smaller 42 millimeter version that
comes in rose gold and midnight black if
you want a couple extra color options
and you want a watch that isn't quite so
big but I don't have the
largest risks in the world but I don't
mind the 46 millimeter version at all
actually like this size better I think
it fits me pretty well and the watch
bands that come on the galaxy watch are
made of silicon which are very durable
and sweat resistant and water resistant
but obviously it's not gonna fit every
single outfit that you wear it's
definitely not gonna fit very well with
formal attire but it does take a
standard 22 millimeter watch strap so
it's pretty easy to swap out with any
band of your choice there's also two
buttons on the side the top button
functions as your back button and the
bottom button functions as your home
button the rotating bezel of course is
the signature feature of a Samsung Smart
Watch and it's just as intuitive as ever
on the Galaxy watch it's a lot of fun to
play with the metal clicks that you get
when you rotate the bezel around are
extremely satisfying and obviously it's
a very intuitive and natural feeling way
of navigating the interface if you opt
for the larger 46 millimeter version you
have a 1.3 inch AMOLED display and the
smaller 42 millimeter version has a
slightly smaller screen at one point two
inches but they both have the same 360
by 360 resolution and the screen looks
great it's very vibrant very colourful
as you expect from an AMOLED display and
you get those inky deep blacks as well
and personally I think every SmartWatch
should have an AMOLED display not only
just for its battery saving properties
but also because it makes watch faces
that have black backgrounds look a lot
cleaner if you care about specs the
Galaxy watch comes with an Exynos
processor inside and 768 megabytes of
RAM on the Bluetooth version and 1.5
gigabytes of RAM on the LTE Edition all
the models have 4 gigabytes of internal
storage about roughly half of that is
actually usable space which isn't a ton
but it's enough for applications and
maybe a few songs and photos if you want
to put those on your watch there's also
a built-in altimeter and barometer for
gauging atmospheric pressure and
altitude the watch also has the heart
rate sensor underneath and new to the
Galaxy watch is the ability to monitor
your stress levels with the heart rate
sensor and if the watch senses that you
are stressed out it'll actually have you
do breathing exercises which hasn't
happened to me because I don't really
get stressed out all that often but it's
kind of a nice feature to have and you
can actually manually trigger the
breathing exercises if you want the
watch is also ip68 water-resistant which
is great so you can take it in the pool
you can take it in the shower and it'll
be perfectly fine just make sure you use
these silicone watch bands if you're
gonna do that and it's also military
810g certified which basically means
it's extremely durable against things
like drops high temperatures and other
elements one of the things I think
people might be disappointed about is
the Galaxy watch doesn't have MST which
was a feature that was available on the
gear s3 and MST was a method where you
could make mobile payment transactions
and you can still make mobile payments
through the galaxy watch with samsung
pay but it only doesn't now with NFC
which means the galaxy watch is not
gonna be able to be used at every single
payment terminal that you go to which is
a little bit disappointing because that
was one of the main benefits of using
samsung pay is that you had that MST
functionality and you're able to use
your device at pretty much any terminal
but that's not gonna be the case with
the galaxy watch the galaxy watch is
running on Tizen 4.0 and if you've used
Tizen on like the gear 3 or the gear
Sport it's a very familiar experience
that hasn't really changed all that much
and I like Tizen a lot it's very
colorful it's very fluid the animations
all look really nice it's a very clean
interface for a SmartWatch and it works
extremely well here on the Galaxy watch
one of the newest additions though to
Tizen is the addition of bixby which
basically replaces s-voice but if you
didn't like bixby on samsung smartphones
you're gonna like it
even less on the Galaxy watch it's been
completely unreliable 90% of the time
majority the time it doesn't even answer
the question that I asked it even simple
questions like what's the weather it
fails to answer those and even a lot of
the recommended questions that it tells
you to ask it wouldn't even answer the
questions either so I don't know what's
wrong with Vic's behind the galaxy watch
hopefully Samsung can address it with a
software update but for right now it
just does not really work at all my
favorite thing about the galaxy watch is
probably its health and fitness tracking
capabilities it can track a total of 39
different workouts and six of those can
be done automatically like walking
cycling and running it can also track
your sleep automatically as well and I
felt like the sleep tracking on here was
actually pretty accurate I felt like the
numbers were spot-on and I liked that it
told me how efficient my sleep actually
was now you're probably wondering if
this watch is even comfortable to wear
to bed and in comparison to like a
fitness band it's definitely a lot
bigger and a lot heavier but I was
pleasantly surprised that this wasn't a
problem to sleep with once I was asleep
I didn't really notice it but I will say
that if you're wearing this watch for
pretty much the entire day you're
probably not gonna want to wear it to
bed because it does start to weigh you
down after a while so that's just
something to keep in mind with this
watch when I go to the gym I prefer to
mostly lift weights so I liked a lot of
the weight lifting exercises that are on
this watch but it does track a bunch of
cardio workouts as well but it can't
track every single type of weight
lifting exercise obviously but it does
track a lot of the main ones like
benchpress
shoulder press lateral raises arm curls
etc all of that is available on the
watch and it'll actually track your sets
and also your reps and it will count the
reps out loud for you so you don't have
to count them yourself with everything
that the galaxy watch can do it's very
important that this watch lasts a long
time on a single charge especially if
you plan on wearing this watch to sleep
and the 46 millimeter version has a 472
million four hour battery which Samsung
quotes will last the watch up to seven
days and I haven't exactly gotten seven
days I've been getting more along the
lines of four days but that really isn't
that bad especially for a watch that can
do so much and that pretty much equates
to charging the watch twice a week and
the charging process is really simple
you just slap it on the wireless charger
that comes in the box and you are good
to go so if you want to pick up the
Galaxy watch it's going to start
at three 49.99 40 46 millimeter and
three $29.99 for the 42 millimeter this
is the pricing for the Bluetooth only
model the LTE versions are gonna be a
little bit more expensive and the price
is gonna vary from carrier to carrier
but this is pretty fair pricing it's
also very competitive to the Apple watch
which is probably Samsung's biggest
competition and overall I think this is
a really solid SmartWatch its functions
really well as a SmartWatch and it also
functions extremely well as a fitness
tracker so if you're looking for a
all-in-one SmartWatch if you will I
think the Galaxy watch is a very good
option I would highly recommend it so
check it out and that's pretty much
gonna do it for this review I hope you
