Authority what's going on everybody I'm
here taking a look at the Samsung Galaxy
alpha now we know that the Galaxy Note 4
is what everyone's talking about right
now but the reason why I really wanted
to take a look at this phone is that
well if you're talking about the Galaxy
Note 4 I'm saying wow that's great that
they have a metal construction finally
well the note 4 was not the first one to
have it it was this one right here and
this was announced and released fairly
recently like very recently and we
weren't able to take a very close look
at it during the pre briefings and
whatnot
because it wasn't the main focus of the
release obviously but here I am with it
they were gracious enough to have me
come up to the smart lounge at Samsung's
booth and take a look at it hands-on so
right here I'm just give me a quick look
at it we're obviously gonna be getting
our review unit pretty soon on it but I
wanted to make sure to give you a nice
look before we actually put our hands on
with it but here we have the actual
display available and this is a 4.7 inch
display which is an awesome
it's an awesome size for this particular
phone and with the metal sides that have
a very similar look to the Galaxy Note 4
afterall it's the first place that have
happened it is a very flat profile easy
to use in the hand 4.7 inches is a
refreshing size to have in order to
really kind of have a change of pace
from the much larger phones out there
especially ones like the Galaxy Note 4
the buttons feel nice and meaty
especially with the metal construction
and from there we have the button here
on the bottom with the recent and back
buttons flanking it you see the
construction over on the sides you have
the speaker on the bottom with a micro
USB charging port the buttons on the
side and of course the headphone jack
at the top now this screen is 4.7 inches
as I said already and it comes in at a
720p resolution but it still is that
AMOLED screen that brings a lot of great
color contrasts and color reproduction
to the smartphone game and it's a really
lovely one to look at the viewing angles
are all quite great and everything looks
really good on this display underneath
the hood what we have is an exceed knows
octa-core processor on here which is
great that you have all of that power
underneath but also what we'll have is
32 gigabytes of storage and 2 gigabytes
of RAM now as far as the camera goes
I'll rather let's take a look at the
back first now
I'm talking about the camera now we do
have that dimple design that is on the
back right here and I'm gonna go ahead
and zoom in just a little bit here so
you can really see what I'm talking
about
this is the dimple design that was
originally introduced in the Samsung
Galaxy s5 but it has a different feel
and as you can see here all of the
different designs and the dimples are a
lot closer together and as you can see
in the shine right there it actually has
a bit of a leathery look and I actually
has a bit of a leathery feel it's very
soft and it has a bit of grip on it
which is awesome because when you have
it in your actual hangar it really sits
nicely and is it feels very secure in
the hands if we look at the back right
here you'll see the optics here at the
top this is a 12 megapixel camera that
comes with a 2.1 megapixel front-facing
camera to be able to get you all of the
selfies that you need going through some
of the interface right here we're just
kind of going through and looking at
some of the icons and whatnot that are
here of course we have the notification
drop-down right here as well but
ultimately you're going to get the same
experience that you are used to when it
comes to Samsung just in a smaller body
there's a lot more accessible it's
actually really like considering the
metal construction and really this is
the experience that you would expect
from Samsung that is very much like the
Galaxy Note 4 especially in terms of its
metal construction but it obviously does
not have the s-pen so if you're looking
for a smaller more accessible version of
Samsung's big flagship then you pretty
much have it right here because they
share a lot of similarities but at the
same time while this is a smaller
version probably this is a the best type
of smaller phone that Samsung has put
out in a little bit of time then you're
also going to get the kind of power that
you need underneath in order to perform
all of your tasks very well so that was
the Samsung Galaxy alpha we're just
taking a nice look at it is going to be
available in many of the markets but if
you were getting sort of caught up in
the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 hype here is
your look at the Galaxy alpha which is
another phone the original metal
construction phone with actually a very
nice design of its own Samsung is
definitely starting to get it right when
it comes to their designs and these two
phones this and the Galaxy Note 4
definitely exude that so keep it tuned
here to Android authority for even more
coverage of the Galaxy alpha and the
Galaxy Note 4 and beyond
we're here at you for 2014 things are
kind of winding down but that's because
we are able to but but it's because of
that that we are able to take a look at
these other phones that you may or may
not have heard of as much here at the
tradeshow and I want to make sure to
bring all that footage for you so keep
it tuned here for that drop with some
likes and subscribe
you haven't already because we are your
source for all things IVA 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
