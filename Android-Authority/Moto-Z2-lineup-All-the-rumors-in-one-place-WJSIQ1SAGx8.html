about the moto z2 lineup you've come to
the right place
Lenovo is expected to announce the next
moto Z generation very soon and we've
come across a bunch of rumors regarding
the Moto z2 the Moto z2 force and the
Moto Z to play which is all rounded up
in one show now for you spec hungry
geeks out there as a flagship the Moto
z2 will obviously sport high-end specs
just like its predecessor it is expected
to feature a 5.5 inch display with qHD
resolution we doubt that the smartphone
will have a screen smaller than last
year's modesty while increasing its size
probably isn't a great option as it
would push into the phablet category the
Moto Z 2 will be powered by the latest
Snapdragon 835 chipset and will have
four gigabytes or maybe even six
gigabytes of RAM you'll find a
fingerprint scanner below the screen
with support for various swiping
gestures like the ones already seen on
the Moto G 5 series we expect to see big
changes in the camera department as the
device will have a dual camera setup on
the back according to well-known leaker
Richie Yolo Lenovo will opt for a lower
megapixel count and larger pixels this
year which means that the camera should
perform better in low light conditions
no word on the front facing camera so
far aside from the fact that it will
have LED flash when it comes to software
the moto z2 will ship with Android 7.1.1
nougat as usual the company will add its
own user interface on top that doesn't
change the look and feel of the OS too
much it's pretty close to stock Android
which is something a lot of users have
come to welcome from Motorola as
expected the Moto z2 force will be quite
similar to the Z 2 in terms of specs
like last year we expect to see three
differences the first is the camera
which might offer more megapixels and
should perform a little bit better the
second change is a larger battery while
the third is the shatter shield display
which shouldn't crack easily when you
drop the phone on the ground for example
the Moto Z to play on the other hand
will offer mid-range specs
according to Evan Blass the smartphone
will have a 5.5 inch display with full
HD resolution and will be powered by the
Snapdragon
6:26 chipset running at 2.2 gigahertz
other sects include 4 gigabytes of RAM
32 gigabytes of on-board storage a
fingerprint scanner and a 12 megapixel
primary camera with dual autofocus and a
selfie snapper with 5 megapixel sensor
sadly the easy to play will pack a
smaller battery than its predecessor
lenovo has confirmed that the device
will feature a 3000 milliamp hour
battery whereas the one found on the z
play the original had a capacity of 3500
+ 10 milli amp hours this means that the
upcoming smartphone will be likely
thinner as well as lighter back in April
we obtained renders of a 360-degree
video of the upcoming moto z2 force in
collaboration with on lakes the
smartphone looks quite similar to its
predecessor with a few minor exceptions
these include the dual camera setup on
the back more rounded edges and if
redesigned a fingerprint scanner below
the screen yeah I know what you're
thinking come on Jase talk to me about
price and release gates now there's no
official word on the price yet but if we
look to history when launched Verizon
sold the Moto z4 6:24 while the Moto
z-force was available for 7:20 the
unlocked version of the Moto Z which was
released on a later date was initially
priced at $6.99 the Moto Z play was
obviously more affordable as you only
had to dish out for 49 to get it now our
educated guess is that prices will
either be the same or maybe even a
little bit less now when it comes to
release dates our best guess is that it
will be sometime in July with unlock
versions coming at a later date just
like last year what we do know is that
unlike its predecessor the Moto z2 force
won't be exclusive to Verizon according
to having blast you'll be able to get
the smart phone from t-mobile and maybe
even sprint and other carriers at launch
if true this means that other two smart
phones the z2 and the z2 play will also
likely be available from multiple
carriers I gotta tell you if these
renders are accurate they look pretty
good
I like them a lot what do you think let
me know in the comments below or on
Twitter verse now if you are a developer
