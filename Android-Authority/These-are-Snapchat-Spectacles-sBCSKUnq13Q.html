thority what's going on buddy and these
all right so here we are with these
snapchat spectacles now if you don't
know what these are these are
camera-equipped
sunglasses that Snap Inc formerly known
as snapchat put together to provide an
even different experience of sharing a
story on snapchat now a lot of you out
there really enjoy snapchat this is a
new way to be able to share in quite
literally your perspective your story on
the app you can record them in 10 second
snaps off of the glasses which will then
send the video to the phone and then you
can send that video to anybody on
snapchat or just post it to your my
story now if you don't know already
these are actually really hard to get
I have tried three times to find the
snap bot which they give you a 24 hour
countdown and once that countdown goes
all the way to zero it will appear in a
very random place I've tried three times
to get to the vending machine and I've
waited in line for hours on end trying
to get these snapchat spectacles only to
come up short each time but I'm lucky
enough to actually have a pair of them
now so we're going to do an unboxing
right now the snapchat spectacles first
come in a yellow case which also doubles
as a charging dock so you'll be able to
use the glasses for 10 seconds snaps
throughout the day but if you run out of
battery the case which has connector
pins on the very corner will be able to
charge the glasses for total times
included with it are these short
instructions which basically say that
you have to hit the button on the
glasses and then open up the snapchat
app in order to connect to it using a
snap code that it generates to start the
pairing process it connects via
bluetooth and Wi-Fi to an iOS or Android
device and from there you can just start
hitting the button on the side and be
able to record 10-second snaps now
included in the package is a cleaning
cloth in the shape of the snapchat ghost
which was interesting and then a
proprietary cable which looks a little
bit interesting
something snapchat would definitely do
and it connects to the case which you
then charged up so you can charge the
glasses once the glasses are paired to
the
and then just head out and start taking
snaps ten-second snaps using the button
on the top left side but even then they
pinch a little bit on the sides they
don't really make different sizes of
these spectacles it's kind of a
one-size-fits-all situation and then
when it comes to peripheral vision there
are these two barrels that are just on
the corners of your periphery that
they're not really distracting but
something that you do definitely notice
now these glasses do work on iOS and
Android and when you get them connected
via Android you just open up the
snapchat app after you do some snaps and
they're all found in the memories area
there's going to be a section just for
specs and you'll be able to select what
specs to send out to or rather what
shots to send out to your my story or to
other users so when you're using the
snapchat app you'll be going to the
specs section of the memories now this
is a little bit convoluted because when
you take a look at the video in this
particular section it shows you a
full-screen traditional-looking snap but
if you were to save it to your camera
roll end or send it to your my story or
to anybody else it's going to put this
circular crop on the videos which is a
little bit distracting I personally wish
that you could just take the full video
off of the off of the specs and not have
that circular crop maybe that's a
feature that they'll put into the
software later on because obviously the
camera takes a full video and then the
app is what puts the crop on it what's
nice is that on the right side of the
spectacles there's a little indicator
that tells people when you're actually
recording something so that way no one
really gets all that freaked out that
you're just recording things incessantly
and then there's this button on the left
side that will trigger the recording and
it's a 10-second recording and a light
pops up that will allow for people to
know when you're recording and you get
to see the light yourself so you know
when it stops recording the camera of
course is on this side and one other
control that you have is by tapping the
side twice it will show the indicator to
tell you how much battery is left after
using the snapchat spectacles for most
of the day I have heard from other
people that the battery life is actually
really good now the sun's going down
right now so I would obviously recommend
that people don't necessarily use these
glasses when the Sun is completely down
mainly because it can obscure your
vision in the dark but a lot of people
will probably want to use these glasses
they are out in the nightlife or
anything like that but at least at that
point you can just hold the glasses hit
the button and you'll be able to record
it that way also not necessarily ideal
but at least you'll have all of your
vision for the times that you really
need it
so that's just a quick look at the
snapchat spectacles you get a few
examples of what the video looks like
here in this video and Android aura tea
but of course I'm going to be using
these over the weekends and I'll bring
you my full review on them when I get
back from my trip this weekend until
then you can actually follow me on
snapchat and you'll be able to see what
kind of video comes out of this and you
might be able to keep up with me also as
to what I'm up to while wearing these
over the weekend keep it tuned to
Android Authority and remember CES is
coming up very soon so you'll be able to
see probably our snapchat spectacle
stories from CES as we were these in Las
Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show
of 2017 keep it tuned for that and even
more because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
