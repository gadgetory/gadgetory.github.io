authority and HCC's newest smartphone is
the phone that you can squeeze but
should you squeeze the money out of your
wallet to buy one let's find out with
the HTC u 11 did you really just have me
say that so I've had my hands on the HTC
u 11 ever since it got announced in
Taipei and I started out using a
Taiwanese version of the U 11 and then
later switched to a US model running on
Sprint so I've had quite a bit of time
using the U 11 as my main device and
with the U ultra ultimately turning out
to be a flop
HTC really needed to deliver and I can
wholeheartedly say that it certainly
does do that in pretty much every aspect
in terms of overall specs the U 11 ticks
all the right boxes the phone comes with
64 gigabytes of internal storage and you
can add additional storage via microSD
with the latest Snapdragon 835 and four
gigabytes of RAM the phone is just as
fast and as fluid as you would expect
touch response and scrolling is
excellent and it runs apps and high-end
games with no issues at all multitasking
is also nice and quick but I do notice
that it's quite aggressive with closing
apps after only opening around five or
six not a big deal for me personally but
it is something worth noting build
quality of course is nothing less than
what you expect from HTC it's a solid
slab of two pieces of glass with an
aluminum frame sandwiched in between
rounded corners and curved edges along
both the front and rear panels for a
very seamless and comfortable design
it's a formula that we've seen many
times before but what really makes the U
11 standout is the liquid glass service
on the rear panel it's very unique in
eye catching and the way some of the
colors can shift and change depending on
the angle and how the light hits it is a
very cool effect the only downside is
that it gets mucked up by fingerprints
pretty easily and because of how
reflective and mirror-like the finish is
it's a lot more noticeable over a more
traditional piece of glass the U 11
features the same woofer and tweeter
speaker combo that we first saw on last
year's HTC 10 but this year it's been
improved significantly it's much louder
with better clarity and HTC is
leveraging the entire phone as an
acoustic
chamber to make this happen you can
literally feel the audio resonate
throughout the entire phone when holding
it in your hand and there's a huge
difference when listening to the U 11
and the HTTP 10 side-by-side
[Laughter]
Oh
for internal audio the u11 doesn't have
a headphone jack but I think it's
completely forgivable considering how
good the audio sounds through the USB
type-c port the use sonic earbuds are
some of the best sounding pair of
earbuds I've ever listened to they're
able to analyze and tune audio
specifically for your ear structure and
they also feature active noise
cancellation
there is a three-and-a-half millimeter
to USB type-c adapter included with the
u 11 to let you plug in any headphones
of your choice but this will also give
you much better audio quality because it
has a DAC built inside of it and should
allow you to drive higher impedance
headphones another improvement that HTC
has made on the U 11 over previous HTC
phones is the IP rating the u 11 is ip67
certified which is a huge step up from
the IP 53 that's on the HTC 10 or the
pixel this means the phone is completely
dust tight and can survive being
submerged in water with so many high-end
phones having either IP 67 or IP 68 this
was definitely a smart move for HTC to
make if they want the U 11 to compete
taking a look at the U 11 from the front
you have the standard array of
capacitive keys and home button that
also doubles as a fingerprint sensor and
it works quite well at unlocking the
phone with accuracy reliability and
speed above that of course is the
display and instead of jumping on the
bandwagon and doing a tall and narrow
screen with super thin bezels like LG or
Samsung HTC has gone the more
traditional route it's a 5.5 inch quad
HD display with 16 by 9 aspect ratio and
it's surrounded by pretty thick bezel
it's not going to turn any heads like a
g6 or s8 but the quality of the screen
itself is fantastic it's very sharp and
crisp with excellent viewing angles
contrast and vibrant colors it's plenty
bright so outdoor visibility is also
quite good but I do wish that it got
much dimmer it feels a little too bright
when using the phone at night or in the
dark but that's really a minor complaint
for what is otherwise a great-looking
screen
not a whole lot has changed with the
software on the U 11 when compared to
the U ultra or even last year's HTTP 10
it's running on Android 7.1.1
with HTC Sense and you have all the
familiar features
like blinkfeed the vertical scrolling
app drawer and HTC's custom themes since
it's still one of the cleanest takes on
android but it is starting to feel like
it needs a refresh and the u11 could
have been that perfect opportunity for
HTC to do that I do appreciate that the
U 11 doesn't come pre-installed with a
whole lot of bloatware even on the
Sprint version there's only a couple of
apps installed by the carrier but
obviously if you want the least amount
of pre-installed apps the unlocked
version would be the way to go the big
standout feature is the new edged Sense
technology which is basically HTC
shortcut for accessing different
functions or apps on your phone you can
literally make it do anything you can
have it open up the camera take a selfie
turn on the flash launch Google
assistant or open up any one of your
favorite apps some companies like to add
an additional button
HTC said no no no no we're going to make
the phone squeeze a hole I know it
sounds like a really weird thing to do
but it does work quite well and it's
actually pretty intuitive and I would
say it's probably the most intuitive
gesture that we've seen since Motorola's
risk twist of the phone to launch the
camera ai assistants are a big part of
smartphones right now and aside from
Google assistant you also have HTC sense
companion this will give you suggestions
based on your location or time of day
and learn your usage habits over time so
it can provide you with information that
it thinks you would like to know for
example it can randomly update you with
the weather provide restaurant
recommendations when it's time for lunch
or dinner remind you to charge your
phone or give you traffic updates based
on your commute and all these will show
up in a card style layout if any of this
sounds familiar that's because Google
already does a lot of this for you so
there's no real surprises here but it
does work fairly well if you choose to
use it the big difference is it doesn't
have a voice component so you'll still
be relying on Google assistant for any
voice dictation the u11 does a lot of
things well but none of that really
matters if the phone can't laugh all day
thankfully battery life on the u 11 is
extremely good I know the 3000 milliamp
hour battery may sound fairly average by
today's standards but it's never
struggled to get me through a full day
with heavy use I've never had to charge
this phone in the middle of the day but
it does have quick charge 3.0 to make
the charging process easy and quick and
I think it's very impressive that HCC
has been able to extend this phone's
battery life without resorting to
shoving in the largest battery they can
find the last big piece of the puzzle is
the camera and there's a lot of
expectations with this camera
considering it currently holds the
highest rating for a smartphone camera
by DX Oh mark the main camera on the
back is an all new 12 megapixel sensor
that HTC is dubbing the ultra pixel
three and it's optically stabilized with
a bright F 1.7 aperture it's also
leveraging a new feature called HDR
boost that will auto process every photo
as HDR to give you the clearest and most
well balanced photo possible it's very
similar to what Google has done with the
pixel the front-facing camera no longer
has optical image stabilization like the
HTC 10 did but in return you're getting
a much higher resolution 16 megapixel
camera for capturing sharper and better
looking selfies and it's also capable of
capturing photos using the HDR boost the
good news is the camera does live up to
the hype it takes impressively
good-looking photos there's plenty of
detail and colors are more on the
natural side and not overly vibrant like
what you would get on a Galaxy s8
low-light photos are still incredibly
sharp and well detailed noise levels are
kept very well under control and the
noise that you do see is very fine and
compact it's not splotchy or filled with
artifacts so it doesn't make much of an
impact to the overall quality of photos
that are taken in low-light although
this is a completely new sensor it has
one issue in low-light that the u ultra
also had highlights are very heavily
overblown and snapping photos of light
sources such as street lamps or traffic
lights caused a lot of streaking lens
flares and floating light particles
because it happened on the u ultra and
now the u 11 I firmly believe that this
is possibly being caused by the phone's
reflective back I have my doubts on
whether this is something HTC can
actually fix but it's probably not an
issue that very many people are going to
be bothered by the biggest hurdle for
HTC is will they be able to get this
phone to sell it's only being sold
directly by one US carrier that carrier
being Sprint
and unlocked it cost six hundred and
fifty dollars which is certainly cheaper
than the you ultra and other competing
flagships like the galaxy s 8 but it's
still not exactly impulse by territory
I'm not necessarily suggesting that the
phone is overpriced but most people
still aren't comfortable with dropping
that much money on a smartphone right on
the spot especially if they've never
seen it before
HTC has also put themselves at a huge
disadvantage by only being able to get
this phone on one carrier while phones
like the g6 and the FA are on all major
US carriers that means that mostly sales
will probably coming through online
channels let's just hope that more
consumers are comfortable with buying
phones outside of carrier stores because
if you're looking for a new smartphone
the U 11 is a phone that you definitely
shouldn't overlook as always thank you
