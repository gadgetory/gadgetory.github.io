handy the Android authority app guy
Riptide CG was an awesome game and even
made our list of the top racing games
for Android now Riptide gp2 is out and
we're gonna take a closer look to see if
it's as awesome as its predecessor let's
start again with the gameplay if you
played the first Riptide then most of
this will feel familiar you race around
a track and a jetski tilting your phone
to steer and tapping the boost to get
some extra speed in that respect not
much has changed you can change from
tilt to touch controls if you so choose
but otherwise everything remains pretty
much the same what has changed is the
trick system before there a predefined
number of tricks in Riptide gp2 you can
now unlock new tricks and set which
motions do which tricks so there's a
nifty new feature also there are a lot
more tricks available than the prior
game there is also now a much more
in-depth gaming experience with GP 2
there is a career mode and an online
multiplayer mode the career mode has
over 30 races and a total of 102 stars
to earn before you're done during races
you earn XP to upgrade tricks and money
to upgrade your jetski that brings us to
the last thing we want to talk about the
depth not only can you buy new jet skis
to race but you can upgrade existing
ones so there is that element to pair
that with the play games integration and
the online multiplayer and this is a
game that you can easily immerse
yourself in for hours like the first
game the graphics and gp2 are phenomenal
everything looks good and sharp and they
even brought back that water on the
camera thing that we liked oh so much
from the first one it's not all that
different from the first game but if it
ain't broke don't fix it right they've
even integrated a settings menu for
graphics so those with older devices can
tweak their graphics to get better
performance usually the default settings
work pretty well but if you need to turn
them down to remove the lag there is
that option it should be mentioned that
this game is specifically geared for a
project shield so it'll probably look a
lot better on that the sound was good
enough the sound effects were accurate
and the racing noises sounded good
the music was not intrusive it did
really well in setting a mood without
taking the forefront the only sound
effect that didn't sound quite right was
the broken glass noise when you wiped
out no game so here's what we liked
about Riptide gp2 first and foremost is
the gameplay improvements while the game
controls on physics haven't changed too
much the game's depth is a phenomenal
improvement over the first game
especially the Play Store games
integration there is the longer career
the ability to upgrade jetski is the
online multiplayer and with all the new
settings menu items it really does feel
more like a console game than most
android games this is something we've
all been waiting for out of the gaming
industry finally the last thing we want
to mention is the new trick system the
ability to unlock tricks and control
which ones your writers can do gives the
game something more than just grinding
wins for money if you add the ability to
customize your jetski and uniform colors
it just adds more personality which is
always a good thing no game is perfect
and that includes this one the first
thing we didn't like was that awful
broken glass sound you hear when you
wipe out a splash would have sufficed
for the crowd booing or gasping it's
nitpicking for sure but glass breaking
just sounded so out of place that it's
actually noticeable like all games these
days there is a store to buy in game
money to spend which is pretty much an
automatic con they don't give a lot of
options it starts out at $2 for 50,000
coins there are $5 $10 $20 $50 and $100
options we would have liked to have seen
a few more options or at least more
options for us penny-pinchers like a
dollar or something overall there isn't
a lot wrong with this game and pretty
much all of our issues were little
nitpicks rather than serious issues
during our testing there was no real
deal-breakers in other words we couldn't
find anything seriously wrong with this
game except that glass breaking noise it
really is horrible before the final
thoughts we'll start by saying that this
game was genuinely impressive when first
starting there is just so much to do and
it's not every day that you get that
feeling from a mobile game vector unit
was going for a console level game here
it's no Skyrim but it beats the tar out
of Duke Nukem Forever so would we
recommend this game of course we would I
bought a cup of coffee today that wasn't
nearly as satisfying as this game so the
$2.99 they're asking is definitely
reasonable it's arguably one of the best
jet ski racing games ever released and
since it's better than the first one and
the first one made our best racing games
for Androids List
well you can put two and two together
