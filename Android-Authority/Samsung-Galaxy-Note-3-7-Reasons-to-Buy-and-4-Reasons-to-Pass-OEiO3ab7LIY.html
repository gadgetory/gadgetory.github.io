hey what's going on everybody and we're
moving right along with the reasons to
buy or pass this time in regards to the
Galaxy Note 3 and of course when we're
talking about the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
we have to start off with its size 5.7
inches is the screen you get on here and
obviously that makes for what is
categorically a large device large
devices were a big thing in 2013 but the
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 seems to head the
pack because we have to give it a lot of
credit because after sometime with the
phone this starts to feel normal and
then once you turn the phone around you
find a new material choice new horizons
for Samsung as glossy plastic has
finally been put aside for what is now
textured plastic yes it mimics leather
and in the end it is just plastic still
but it's just such a refreshing change
and then yet we have another Snapdragon
800 power at handset that runs it very
well and it is backed by three gigabytes
of RAM for good multitasking which was a
first in the Android space battery life
also gets a very good not because of its
high capacity battery in the galaxy note
3 that works a treat for longevity this
is a phone that can definitely get you
from day one to almost day three
especially if you have some frugal usage
and of course with the plastic that
Samsung likes to employ that means the
removable back cover is available here
and under that cover is also an
expandable storage slot when we talk
about software multitasking has always
been TouchWiz is Forte as it provides
many tools for multitasking especially
the multi window which is very popular
and all of the s-pen functions and of
course the s-pen especially with all of
the new features that have been put into
the Galaxy Note 3 the s-pen stands alone
as a peripheral that comes with your
phone and I bet you even if you have
never used the s-pen while using your
Galaxy Note 3 I bet you the few times
that you have they were probably all
good times and when we started talking
about the reasons to pass on the Galaxy
Note 3 we also have to talk about its
size now the Galaxy Note 3 is basically
the most comfortable large device that
you'll probably ever use however some
people just don't like large phones and
if that's you then this phone is left
for you and then we move on to TouchWiz
on the software side because plenty of
people who used to dislike the
aging look of TouchWiz did so as much as
they hated the glossy plastic after all
TouchWiz is just something that we've
seen for years now and it is in need of
a very big refresh in terms of the
general features that it has those do
continue to grow especially in number
but the hair comes another issue for the
TouchWiz in the galaxy note 3 and that's
whether or not all of these features
might be wasted for all that you may pay
for the galaxy note 3 you may never use
the err views the air gestures s-health
or even watch on not to mention gasp the
s-pen so in a growing market of large
phones out there perhaps looking
elsewhere it might be a little bit more
useful for you if you are afraid that
you're paying for so much in a phone
that you may never use and as I keep
harping on it the last reason to pass on
this phone is probably the price as
Samsung's unabashed flagship of
flagships you may not see its price go
down until probably the next Note
iteration comes out in the end if you
are able to afford the Galaxy Note 3 we
say go for it but that is a pretty steep
price to pay in order to get one of the
best phones of 2013 and so there you
have it for these reasons to buy or pass
on the Galaxy Note 3 as always you can
check out our full review and our full
comparison coverage on the Galaxy Note 3
including future focus videos if you
need more information than just a
quick-fire reasons we've given you in
this video and as always thank you very
much for watching and stay tuned to
