you for watching our CES coverage and we
are looking at what is essentially the
first day for us even though the
convention itself actually has not
started now the reason why is because a
lot of the stuff for press like
ourselves actually happens before the
show starts that way we get early access
we get to see previews of all of the
products that all of you if you happen
to come to the show are able to see and
this is one of the newer events is
called CES unveiled and it is actually
quite a nice venue a quite a nice little
show for all of the vendors to really
just line up all of the hallways and
just show everybody you know what they
got for this show behind us is a display
of awards that certain vendors have
gotten and that's just nice a nice
backdrop for us I think to think about
our first maybe day or two for this CES
experience so I'm going to hand it over
to Darcy and he'll give us sort of a
little bit of his thoughts about what
the first couple days were like being
here in las vegas for CES 2014 which
actually hasn't even started yet so here
we are well to be honest there really
isn't that much very specific Android
technology here a lot of bluetooth
speakers a lot of wearable technology
that's sort of odd you know toothbrush
with bluetooth body tracking
technologies we have other things
designed for healthcare and healthcare
fitness you know there's a large focus
towards that but really there's nothing
truly innovative we did see an awesome
phone from my zoo yes I was a MX three
sub four hundred dollar price point
better specs than the Motorola X doing
it right definitely doing it right right
and arguably as the no bezel as the
g-tube probably thin bezel addicts out
there absolutely yeah um one thing that
won't want one type of sort of idea that
I have for the CES was it kind of looks
like this EES isn't necessarily where
all of the really big first announcers
are going to come but that's perfectly
fine because what we're going to see is
like me zoo or my zoo we haven't figured
that out yet
is like my zoo where they're they're
creating a phone that yes it doesn't
necessarily innovate but they're doing
it correctly and that is valuable in and
of itself and that's a lot of what we're
gonna see SE es but you know we're also
showing you giving you a glimpse of the
things that we do outside of just the
show itself I mean we were a lot more
organized this year you know this is our
third time at the rodeo yes we traveled
the world for you guys no matter where
it is a Hong Kong or mobile world
congress in barcelona or Aoife and
Berlin at Las Vegas we travel all around
and for Android and for mobile
technology in general for those that
study the industry you'll know that the
biggest release has happened in
Barcelona and in Germany there's such a
European focus even though most devices
all manufacturers they consider the
United States to be the biggest market
it just so happens that the biggest
releases are all international yes but
increasingly we're seeing a lot of
pressure from the bottom end or the top
end from China essentially no sub 400
sub 300 all our smartphones that are
really great but they have a hard time
getting approved by the FCC and getting
into the States but for those that want
to buy unlock they can get a really
great deal so tomorrow we have Huawei
we're going to see some cool stuff in
them we have sony we have a la we've
already done lenovo we're going to be
uploading those videos tonight we also
have aces and we have samsung so
tomorrow's the biggest day we're gonna
be working 24 hours straight for you
guys to go to all the best videos on all
the latest phones all latest tech and
we're gonna focus a lot more on wearable
technology and other stuff that has to
do with the integration of life the
living room and mobile absolutely yeah
really making that's that's that's
really what CES is about while you have
something like mobile world congress
where it is all about mobile tech
android has a huge presence there
obviously CES is definitely a show
showing you what consumers can can get
out of technology that enhances your
life so it might not be the biggest show
for people like us but at the same time
it's still a great place to see where
technology is headed and where it is now
so stay tuned android authority we have
a lot of great content coming for you
again we're here at CES 2014 standing at
CES unveiled this is just the start we
have a lot more for you so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
