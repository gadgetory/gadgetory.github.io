sold on the Samsung Galaxy s4 some of
you may either need some help making up
your mind or just want to know a little
more about the features so what we are
going to do is show you some of our
favorite features on the Samsung Galaxy
s4 hi everybody I'm Chris book now a lot
of our favorite features have to do with
the camera so we're going to kick things
off with a look at dual shop dual shot
uses both the rear and front facing
camera at the same time allowing you to
place yourself anywhere in a photo or
video without having to hold the phone
some awkward angle well this is cool by
itself the ability to use dual shot and
video chat is much cooler allowing you
to remain on screen while showing what
you're pointing the phone at to somebody
else now we've all been there you're
trying to take a photo at a super busy
location but people keep walking through
your shot at exactly the wrong time the
s4 is a racer mode aims to fix this
instead of simply taking a photo
this mode records for a few seconds and
analyzes the result
hopefully removing any stray passers-by
from the photo
the animated photo mode essentially
allows you to create an animated gif
like eraser mode animated photo records
for a few seconds once it's finished
recording it processes the results that
allows you to choose only certain parts
of an image that you would like to be
animated it is a little on the gimmicky
side but it's still a cool feature
drama shop produces photos showing the
track of a subject in the foreground
while the background remains static now
it can be a little tricky to use since
you have to remain pretty still while
the subject moves and if the subject is
too close it just plain won't work for
my example I just set down the camera
and enlisted my good friend Ted the
plastic dinosaur to be my subject
luckily he was fairly cooperative sound
and shot does exactly what you would
imagine it adds audio narration to an
image simply switch to sound and Shop
mode take a photo and start talking this
can be useful if you want to share a
photo with a friend and explain a little
about where you were or what you were
doing or why you decided to take a
picture of your salad again if you've
ever used the Samsung device that had an
S Pen airView is going to feel very
familiar as it does the same thing when
you hover over the screen except now
it's your finger instead of a piece of
plastic or gesture allows you to scroll
webpages switch between photos skip
songs and more all with a simple wave of
your hand this is useful if you don't
want to touch your device maybe you're
reading hot wings but it's not something
you'll likely be using all of the time
smart scroll is a little similar to air
gesture and then it allows you to scroll
through web pages without touching your
screen but you still will want to hold
on the S for basically it uses the
front-facing camera to track your eyes
then you can tilt the phone toward or
away from you to scroll up and down
maybe you'll have better luck than I did
but while this worked fine for me
sometimes at others I found it pretty
tricky to use the camera can also track
your eyes while you're watching a video
and pause it if you look away but you
might want to turn this off if you find
it's pausing too often one of my
personal favorite features is s-health
which offers a ton of features to track
your health habits first put in your
gender age height and weight and now as
health can track when and how you
exercise how many steps you take in a
day what you eat and more if you're
looking to make some health
changes or just keep up what you're
already doing and track it s health is a
super useful tool watchon uses the
galaxy s4's built-in IR blaster to turn
the phone into an all-in-one remote and
media guide simply tell the phone your
location and provider then set up your
devices and you never have to worry
about losing your remote in the couch
cushions or wonder what's on this is
neat but I couldn't get watch on to
control my TV even though the TV was
among the listed devices we'll likely
see support for more devices down the
road but I was still a little
disappointed s translator
well translates things it's an awful lot
like Google Translate except for the
name but it's still pretty handy you can
either type or say the phrase you want
to translate and it will translate it to
and from a variety of different
languages and even read the translation
to you out loud and then we have a ton
of other features like optical reader
which can scan QR codes and even
recognize and translate text for you a
few other features I couldn't really use
at all group play a feature that lets
you share files watch the same movie or
even play games with other people
sounds really cool but there was nobody
around so that was kind of out of the
question the updates to chat on had me
in the same boat as I couldn't find
anyone to actually connect to now
obviously there are a bunch of other
little tweaks and some features we left
out but what we just showed you are some
of our very favorites we have a written
companion to this video so if you want
to know more head over to android

videos going up all the time so if you
