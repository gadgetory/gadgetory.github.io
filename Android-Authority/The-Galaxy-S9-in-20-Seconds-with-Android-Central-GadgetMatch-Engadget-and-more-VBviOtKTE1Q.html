everybody and we're here talking about
the Galaxy S nine and I'm sure you've
seen a lot of our coverage already on
Samsung's newest flagship but we wanted
to get some of our friends together and
ask them their thoughts on it and let's
say 20 seconds or less so why don't we
go ahead and get started
hi Amy so gadget match I've always liked
the idea of an emojis and I feel like a
are emojis are also a great idea I feel
like this the direction that all phones
should go I love that they have a very
very detailed makeup and beauty mode and
also the fact that there's a lavender
phone I feel like Samsung is going into
the whole market where hey it's David
Emmel I am not particularly happy with
the Samsung Galaxy S 9 because it just
feels like it's a rehash of the Galaxy S
a with new software features and new
software features could always be added
via update so I'm you know I kind of
wish that they went for a new body
design but I understand that they want
to wait for the 10th iteration to make
that huge huge huge design change but
you're gonna ask the question hyuh metal
rivera was pocket now I love the
conservative design I feel that that as
I needed to stick a little longer I
loved dual cameras I wish they did
wide-angle but the mechanical aperture
is great software seems good I feel that
it's promising I like that Samsung is
not copying another company to get its
way that's me
I think we can reduce yourself
hey guys it's John Bosco here with bone
area formerly of pain for me it's more
of an SMS device and nothing else an
emojis kind of novel messing me up I did
both man female and male I messed up my
hair both times so it is what it is to
me it's just an incremental upgrade but
I pass on it
probably so alright perfect
alright on to the next one nobody
understands what variable aperture even
is photographers when they want to have
different apertures because they're
really good at photography they're not
gonna go 1.5 to 2.4 they're gonna go
like 1 point 5 to 8 ring if you really
care about photography that's too small
of a gap I don't even understand what
the point of that variable aperture even
is hi I'm Michael Josh from gadget
matcom it's iterative but that's okay
it's still one of the best looking
phones out there the camera technology
many people might not appreciate but
it's actually been improved and emojis
or AR emojis not so good not so nice I
like the new color and I only my only
problem is that it's so expensive
I'm Daniel beta I'm managing editor of
Android central more of the same it's
still gonna be one of the best and most
popular phones of the year Samsung knows
what it's doing and there's absolutely
nothing wrong with that camera needs to
be the best if it's not not gonna fly
for the majority of people who want that
feature and for me that's my my biggest
and most important compromise
hey I'm Chris Velasco from Engadget and
Josh I guess you want to ask me a
question or something that's a
relatively innovative like the dual
camera idea in theory at least in terms
of the aperture I'm not super sold on it
frankly I'd rather have 10 Nokia ones
boom done I don't even need the rest of
the time 10 no Kia woods man think about
it that's a combined total of 15
megapixels 50 megapixels 10 Nokia ones
actually that's less than what you pay
for a galaxy s 9 God fine hey guys david
from the unlocker i think it's a nice
little upgrade over the essence and the
SI plus it feels a little more solid
there's something bout the design it
feels a little heavier and more dense
which I like the intelligent unlock
actually works really well which I'm
surprised by the camera has a nice bump
in spec it does really well low-light
shots so long as things aren't moving
there's by hello I'm sure Lynn reviews
editor at ain't gadget we're talking in
the press room right now so we've got
very quiet okay it looks exactly the
same
and the selfie camera has not changed
all that much I don't really like that I
need better selfies of all ways and all
the time the makeup thing is not the
best I've tried other apps and they're a
lot better I do love me some they are
emojis because it looks more like me
then people of other ethnic types have
tried the air in you dude
all right now the Samsung booth is
behind me and I'm walking away from it
right now
but I'm gonna go ahead and do my twenty
seconds right and now the best part
about the Galaxy S nine is definitely
all in the camera especially the
mechanical aperture now this is a
factual hardware physical feature that
DSLRs have that now is on a smartphone
and I think that's incredible and the
only reason why I love that is because
more smart phones of the future are
going to be able to implement that and
it's something that we can see improve
over time and that's 20 seconds already
you got to get the gist of it anyway in
any case keep it tuned to Android or e
for all of the best from MWC 2018
including all of our coverage on the
samsung galaxy s 9 from there you can
just stay tuned because we are of course
your source for all things Android at
MWC 2018 oh yeah I'm Nicole Scott for
mobile geeks I don't want to sound like
you're aces bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
