phones that were just launched is kind
of thin but looks really nice feels very
nice in the hand and comes with a pretty
affordable price point this is Josh of
gar from Android Authority what's going
on everybody and this is the Oppo r7 at
first glance we wouldn't fault you for
thinking that the r7 looks and feels
like a real high-end top-tier device not
to say that it really doesn't get up
there but the specifications underneath
the surface do actually make this more
of a mid-range phone but let's start off
with the design where you'll probably
seeing some great profile here we have a
metal frame that sticks out just a
little bit from the two panels that also
have some subtle curves to them 2.5 D
glasses up front they're covering the 5
inch 1080p display and on the back you
also have the same types of curves that
come down into the frame itself now the
same curve on the back is this time
called the violin arc as oppo took
inspiration from the simplicity yet
elegant violins
the bezels are pretty respectable on the
display up front but with a 5-inch
display you shouldn't have too much
trouble handling this particular device
and it feels really nice in the hand it
does have a little bit of heft to it at
147 grams but 6.3 millimeters in the
thickness really make this a very thin
device with a very nice profile the
volume rocker is where your thumb would
probably lay on your right hand and then
the power button is opposite on the left
side and on the bottom there on the
front you'll have capacitive keys rather
than soft keys which is a change when
compared to the r7 plus head on over to
the back and we do have the 13 megapixel
optics up on the top left with the Oppo
logo very squarely put on the upper
third Opel went with AMOLED displays in
these two particular devices and they
look quite nice and our very short
testing actually the AMOLED display
really makes the color OS 2.1 edition
this time around really pop out and
really with a operating system called
color OS you would really hope that it
looks this great and it truly does as we
said before 1080p resolutions which are
getting here in this 5-inch display that
pops out 449 pixels per inch and that
2.5 d glass is a nice subtle touch to
the display as we get underneath the
surface that's where you're going to
find
has the Snapdragon 615 with three
gigabytes of RAM
now the 615 has already been proven in a
couple other mid-range devices as being
a very reliable processor and that
certainly feels like it will be the case
for the r7 and the r7 plus both of which
have this particular processor color OS
2.1 has been given the optimizations I
have has been needing in previous
editions and now it really just trucks
along very smoothly very snappily and
really we're pretty happy with what we
see here especially since our experience
with color OS in the past hasn't been
quite this smooth it is worth mentioning
however that the Android back-end is
Android KitKat 4.4 but we're sure that
there's going to be an update to it
because color OS 2.1 is still the
overlay for this version of android when
compared to the lollipop edition of the
r7 plus now with the storage you do get
a micro SD card slot here in the sim
tray that also doubles as a dual nano
SIM tray so you'll get all of the
connectivity that you're probably going
to need and with a 13 megapixel camera
on the back that expandable storage is
probably something you're going to want
23 20 milliamp hours non removable of
course with this unibody design is what
you get in the r7 and it might not sound
like much but at least you're going to
get the boost of the voc fast charging
which in our testing with the find seven
and the other phones in Oppo scamp Luke
fast charging is actually really
reliable and is one of the best points
in the power charging for the Oppo
phones of course we'll be able to put
the camera through its paces when we get
our hands on a review unit but as for
right now we do like what we see in the
13 megapixel optics and in the camera
app of the Oppo r7 and r7 + the
interface is actually pretty simplistic
not too many elements on the viewfinder
and is pretty easy to get to the
different modes all of which are ones
you may have seen in previous Oppo
devices like the Ultra HD photo HDR of
course and even more you'll be able to
download even more in what is called
their camera shop so you'll have a lot
of fun with this particular device in
its camera being able to change up the
way that you do your smartphone
photography phase detection autofocus
will help you get a clear shot and with
F 2.2 in the lens of this and also the
r7 plus you should get some pretty
decent low-light shots as
and the front-facing camera is of course
very important for a lot of people
especially out here in Asia and you're
going to have a great time taking
selfies with a 8 megapixel front facing
shooter that does look like it takes
some pretty nice photos already now bear
in mind that these photos on the back
and the front will have a little bit of
a punch to them but that is also because
we're taking a look at them on these
AMOLED displays and finally in software
we do feel that color OS is finally
coming of age and a year that we're
finding a lot of very snappy and smooth
and speedy versions of Android that
looks like Oppo has put their name in
that hat with a very nice feeling color
OS 2.1 this time around despite being
powered by android kitkat in our unit
that you're seeing right now it still
moves along with the kind of speed and
smoothness that we would want our
Android devices to feel like getting
through the menus and going to the
recent apps screen despite having to
hold the home button down in order to
access it still feels pretty nice and
getting through all the different
applications everything has nice
transitions going in and out of the
different elements you still have all of
the different gestures that are
available especially from those of you
who have used color OS in the past and
you even have the media pages that are
on the very far left if you so wish to
use them for your local music and
whatnot
but from their color OS seems to have
been getting the types of optimizations
that it's been needing and in the Oppo
r7 and r7 plus you're going to feel the
best that Oppo has to offer in its
operating system Opel has come a long
way in a decade and it's a great example
in the r7 and r7 plus that they are
continuing to really push the envelope
when it comes to their devices and we're
looking forward to what we have next in
the r7 r7 + when we get our review units
and we'll bring you our full reviews at
that time so until then keep it tuned to
