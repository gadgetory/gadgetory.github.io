is Jace and this past week was a slow
news week in the world of Android that's
why I thought I would come out here in
this glorious day and talk to you about
what is wrong with Samsung I didn't
swear there I just like to go makes me
feel better well that didn't work out
too well because the bugs were eating me
alive
but that won't stop me from sharing with
you what I think Samsung needs to do
right right now how many people do you
know that have the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
and don't love it I don't know anyone
that's right they pioneered the phablet
market as we know it they know how to
create sexy products that market
themselves that get people talking about
them they can do it but they're
inconsistent
Samsung who designed this who thought
this would look good on my wrist
we need a consistent design language
that is distinctly Samsung do you
remember that ad from a couple years ago
where Samsung called it the next best
thing when they were referring to the
Samsung Galaxy s3 and they created this
great ad where they were suggesting that
the iPhone was your parents phone and
the new hit phone was the Galaxy series
phones that's right but you know what
those marketing executives executives
that produce that are now gone to
Motorola yeah so they're gone and we're
not getting a consistent message anymore
I mean with the release of the Samsung
Galaxy s5 there was a whole bunch of
conflicting leaks proving that Samsung
is not managing their message and then
three months later they come up with
another so called s5 flagship phone that
is not a consistent message that just
pisses people off
we need a consistent message from you
Samsung number three I think Samsung
should release Tison that's right set it
free let it fly now for those of you
don't know Tizen is Samsung's
alternative mobile operating system that
could one day compete with Android I'm
not suggesting that Samsung should do
away with Android altogether possibly
release Tizen on a select number of
phones in a select particular market
let's
Japan or Korea for example which have
very strong mobile cultures and
potentially build up a marketplace
around those phones and see how it goes
putting all your eggs in one basket for
Android could be a bad choice in the
long term Samsung has the manufacturing
power to do that
release it now in a small market see how
it goes number four and by far the most
important is all about why that's right
there is a fantastic book called start
with y that deals with this very topic
it's by author simon Sinek and you can
search on YouTube for some fantastic
talks to you gives you a summary of its
book but it's all about how individuals
families and businesses if they want to
be successful they have to start with
why why do they do what they do some of
you're gonna say well chase Samsung does
what it does to make money that's what
all companies do no no no that is a
result that is not a lie that's not why
Samsung executives and designers and
engineers get up in the morning no why
do they do what they do what is their
reason for being in business so for
example Steve Jobs is very good at this
and it has infiltrated the Apple culture
if you asked Steve Jobs why do you do
what you do without missing a beat he
would say I want to change the world by
creating a bicycle for the mind he meant
it in his mind and heart and you knew it
he lived it and that showed in the
products that he created not all of you
like Apple products but you can't deny
that Steve Jobs knew his why and he
became one of the most successful
business technologists ever because of
it thanks for watching and were tardy my
name is Jace loved are connected to here
on Google+ or Twitter I read all your
comments out replies and I will answer
the ones that I ten I would love for you
to put your questions if you have any
Android questions over in the Android of
30 forums I'm much more likely to use
them in Android Q&amp;amp;A show you don't wanna
forget about my brothers and Angela Josh
Joe and the tech ninja Kevin Chris and
lon yes we're working for you to try and
get the create the best Android content
we can and should see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
