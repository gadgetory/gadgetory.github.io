is Jace and this past week was a slow
news week in the world of Android that's
why I thought I would come out here in
this glorious day and talk to you about
what the is wrong with Samsung I didn't
swear there I just like to go makes me
feel better well that didn't work out
too well because the bugs were eating me
alive but that won't stop me from
sharing with you what I think Samsung
needs to do right right now how many
people do you know that have the samsung
galaxy note 3 and don't love it I don't
know anyone that's right they pioneered
the phablet market as we know it they
know how to create sexy products that
market themselves that get people
talking about them they can do it but
they're inconsistent samsung who
designed this who thought this will look
good on my wrist we need a consistent
design language that is distinctly
Samsung do you remember that ad from a
couple years ago where Samsung called it
the next best thing when they were
referring to the samsung galaxy s3 and
they created this great ad where they
were suggesting that the iphone was your
parents phone and the new hip phone was
the galaxy series phones that's right
but you know what those marketing
executives executives that produce that
are now gone to motorola yeah so they're
gone and we're not getting a consistent
message anymore I mean with the release
of the Samsung Galaxy s5 there was a
whole bunch of conflicting leaks proving
that Samsung's not managing their
message and then three months later they
come up with another so-called s5
flagship phone that is not a consistent
message that just pisses people off we
need a consistent message from you
samsung number three I think Samsung
should release Tyson that's right set it
free let it fly now for those of you
don't know Tizen is Samsung's
alternative mobile operating system that
could one day compete with Android I'm
not suggesting that Samsung should do
away with Android altogether possibly
release Tizen on a select number of
phones in a select particular market
let's
japan or korea for example which have
very strong mobile cultures and
potentially build up a marketplace
around those phones and see how it goes
putting all your eggs in one basket for
android could be a bad choice in the
long term Samsung has the manufacturing
power to do that release it now in a
small market see how it goes number four
and by far the most important is all
about why that's right there is a
fantastic book called start with why
that deals with this very topic it's by
author simon Sinek and you can search on
youtube for some fantastic talks to you
gives you a summary of his book but it's
all about how individuals families and
businesses if they want to be successful
they have to start with why why do they
do what they do some of your gonna say
well Jase Samsung does what it does to
make money that's what all companies do
no no no that is a result that is not a
why that's not why Samsung executives
and designers and engineers get up in
the morning no why do they do what they
do what is their reason for being in
business so for example Steve Jobs is
very good at this and it has infiltrated
the Apple culture if you asked Steve
Jobs why do you do what you do without
missing a beat he would say I want to
change the world by creating a bicycle
for the mind he meant it in his mind and
heart and you knew it he lived it and
that showed in the products that he
created not all of you like Apple
products but you can't deny that Steve
Jobs knew his why and became one of the
most successful business technologists
ever because of it thanks for watching
edward army my name is Jace love to
connect you to hear on google+ or
twitter i read all your comments at
