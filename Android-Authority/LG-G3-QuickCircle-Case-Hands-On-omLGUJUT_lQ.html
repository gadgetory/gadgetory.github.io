flagship and I have to admit it is
pretty cool age strata regard from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the quick circle
case for the LG g3
and so here it is the quick circle case
as being presented at the LG g3 launch
event here in San Francisco essentially
what you get here is a backing that it
replaces the backing of the original LG
g3 and then has a flap that goes right
over the screen and has smart
capabilities in that when you close it
it will turn off the screen except for
that circle up there at the top half and
then when you open it up it will turn
the screen back on in order for you to
be able to use the phone to its full
capacity as far as the field goes for
this case it is plastic all around which
is to be expected but it does take on
that brushed feel that the back of the
original LG g3 cover has that kind of
feels matted to the touch but in reality
it has this brushed feel to it they're
trying to go for more of a metallic type
of field despite everything still being
somewhat plastic or at least a hybrid of
plastic and that's what you get in the
quick circle case as well but of course
the entire story has to do with the
circle that is on that top third or top
half rather of this case where all of
the action happens you'll be able to
have a watch face on there there are a
bunch of different watch faces that are
available for you to cater the
experience to what you want it to look
like one even has a mechanical look to
it which is kind of cool but then after
that when you swipe over you'll have a
circular grid of six applications now
the applications that you are able to
put on here may expand a little bit
later but from what I saw there was only
these six and maybe one or two after
that but these six applications allow
you to get into some functions that you
can use through the circle without
having to open the case to get to the
phone one in particular was the phone
application which I thought was cool
where you can actually scroll through
recent recent calls and you'll be able
to call people via just that portion and
then you are even able to take pictures
using the camera application through the
circle itself as I said this is
basically LG's take on the smart cover
and it does look pretty cool but adds
further functionality even when the
cover is down given that circle up top
which takes advantage of the screen zone
sensitivity and is a display for some
applications
you can use and there are a lot of watch
faces so you can really make this thing
look the way you want it to so keep it
tuned to enter authority for further
coverage on the LG g3 including this
particular quick circle case which will
be excited to use when we get the LG g3
in our own review unit so keep it tuned
