whole curved displays thing here we have
two phones that are trying to go against
the curve in this quick look we have
phones that try to bend the rules LG is
flexing its muscle to create a
smartphone that is pretty unique
maybe Samsung is trying to make a phone
that is all around a good device if you
put the LG G flex on top of the galaxy
round does it make a perfect circle it's
Josh regard from Android 30 what's going
on everybody and today we're taking a
look at this curve display trend in a
comparison between the Samsung Galaxy
round and the LG G flex now if there's
one thing we have to talk about before
we even get to the curves themselves
it's the sizes of these two phones Oh
something that you may not notice right
off the bat or may not have really been
put out there is the fact that the LG G
flex is quite simply larger than the
galaxy round that might sway you a
little bit because if you're not used to
very large displays or handling them for
that matter the LG G flex might be a
little bit steeper in its learning curve
but then that's where the curves
actually come into play now like I said
in the LG G flex unboxing and first
impressions I began to sort of realize
how these curves are supposed to make
sense now in the galaxy rounds to begin
with what I did notice is that the
distance that you have to reach to the
other side of the screen in order to
sort of perform tasks has been
minimalized at least a little bit it's a
very subtle change the fact that the
curve comes upward and you are able to
get to it a little bit easier makes this
also pretty accessible phones to use
it's actually pretty nice however on the
LG G flex the curve also does the same
thing except since the curve goes from
top to bottom it allows you to get to
the top of the phone a little bit easier
and on top of all of that you do have
this curve that allows the phone to lean
towards where your hand is trying to
reach and that also allows for the
notification drop down too big to be a
little bit easier to reach as well so
overall these curves do allow for a
little bit easier hand
now that brings us to the display is on
these two phones now the reason why this
is a pretty important aspect is because
you have a different resolution for both
the Samsung Galaxy round does take on
the pretty similar display of the Galaxy
Note 3 in that it has a 1080p display
now we know that Samsung is good with
their AMOLED displays and it could be
your favorite or not however what's
important here is that the LG G flex
does not come with a 1080p display it is
720p and for that matter you do see a
little bit of that curve when you're
using those displays which is actually
really really cool especially on the LG
G flex you when you're scrolling up and
down let's say on a website you do get
that sense that it's actually coming
around like this it's actually bending
to the curve the actual elements on the
screen and that's really really nice on
that plastic oh le D in the case of the
Samsung Galaxy round it's not really the
same thing just by having that
left-to-right curve you don't get the
sense that it's actually moving across
that curve however I will say that
Samsung did put some transitions inside
of the UI especially in the home screens
where the elements actually push back a
little and then move over so it does
provide a little bit of that illusion
now that's another aspect on these that
might sway you one way or the other if
you really want your high resolution
screens then you might have to go with
the galaxy round however the LG G flex
is still no slouch just because it's
720p doesn't mean you won't have a lot
of fun watching anything on this screen
and then finally this software for the
most part you're getting very familiar
versions of TouchWiz and then the
optimist UI here on the LG G flex and of
course TouchWiz is pretty much the same
type of UI that we've known for years
now however in terms of the
functionality of the software in these
Samsung Galaxy round it does take
advantage of the curve a little bit like
I was saying before now whether or not
those particular functions will be
useful to you is really kind of up to
you personally if you are able to tilt
the phone a little bit in order to look
at your notifications that's cool
however it does have a bit of a delay
you might have a better time just doing
the air gesture that allows you to just
wave your hand over the phone and then
you'll get your notifications that way
in terms of its functionality the G flex
focuses on being a sturdy and durable
phone and that flex allows it to sort of
do that so it really comes down to
hardware versus software in this
particular sense because in terms of
software you kind of get what you expect
when it comes to the LG G flex as far as
we can tell there really aren't that
many functions inside of the software
that take advantage of that curve so
that begs the question of whether or not
this is just a big phone with a curve
for the sake of a curve
well LG made sure that the curb made
sense and the reason why is because well
it is called the flex so the phone is
actually able to bend it does take a lot
of force in order to make the curve
become flat but that's the point of the
phone is that you are able to flatten
the device if if it so happens that a
sort of some sort of force makes it well
on the galaxy run you get a couple new
features it really is up to you whether
or not those are important and will make
you want more than the sturdy or durable
phone that LG has attempted to make and
so there you have it for this comparison
this quick look at the LG G flex and the
Samsung Galaxy rounds now obviously in
this one we were just taking a look at
their form factors and what those
implications were but we will have a
much more substantial comparison
available for you soon especially after
the full reviews are out looking at even
more aspects of it in depth like for
