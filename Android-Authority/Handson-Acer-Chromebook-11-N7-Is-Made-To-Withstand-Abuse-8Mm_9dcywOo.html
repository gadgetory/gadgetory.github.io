authority and we're here with a sir at
CES 2017 taking a look at their newest
Chromebook the Chromebook 11 and 7 the
software is pretty much everything you
would expect from a Chromebook
but the n7 offers a few key features
that make it a little bit different from
your average Chromebook you'll notice
that it has a soft and somewhat rugged
looking exterior and that's because the
n7 is military 810g compliant against
drops and is able to tolerate drops up
to 48 inches in height this is great
protection to have especially if you're
very accident-prone and there's also an
anti slip pattern on the outer casing
that gives the n7 a lot of grip and
should prevent it from slipping out of
your hands the entire chassis has also
been reinforced from the inside to
reduce flex to give the Chromebook much
greater resistance from twisting and
stress that can happen in daily use
another really cool feature about the n7
is the protection that you get with the
keyboard the keyboard has been designed
with recessed keys that are flush with
the rest of the laptop to prevent the
keys from being removed and there's a
gutter system built underneath the
keyboard and trackpad that keeps liquids
away from the components so if you were
to spill something on this keyboard it
would drain right out of the bottom of
the Chromebook on the inside it's got an
Intel Celeron dual-core processor 4 gigs
of RAM and comes in either 16 or 32 gigs
of storage and the 4090 milliamp hour
battery is quoted lasts up to 12 hours
as far as ports go you've got a USB 3.0
port HDMI SD card reader and a 3.5
millimeter jack on the left side and on
the right side you'll find an additional
USB 3.0 port the display is an IPS
screen measuring in eleven point six
inches with a resolution of 1366 by 768
and it'll come in both a touchscreen and
non touchscreen version but the coolest
thing about this display is that it
rotates 180 degrees on its hinge
allowing to lay the Chromebook
completely flat to make it easier to
share content to the people around you
it'll be available in North America
starting this month for 230 dollars so
if you're looking for an affordable
Chromebook that is built with durability
in mind this is definitely a solid
option for more on the Chromebook 11 and
7 keep it tuned here to Android thority
and don't forget to check out the
website Android Thor calm for the rest
of our CES 2017 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
