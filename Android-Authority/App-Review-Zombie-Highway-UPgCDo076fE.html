Android authority comm and today we're
gonna be taking a look at Sambi Highway
it's a game in the Google Play Store
that's available right now for just $1
you control the game by holding the
phone in landscape mode and tilting it
to steer the goal is to drive down the
highway and kill all the zombies before
they have a chance to kill you there are
three ways to kill zombies you can shoot
them by tapping the red spots that show
up on the left or right side of the
screen you can also run them over if you
get lucky but the very best way is to
pull up next to the obstacles and just
scrape them off that is essentially the
whole game in a nutshell running zombies
down shooting them or scraping them off
your car while there are sound effects
for the car movement in the zombies
grunting there is no music to assist in
keeping players immersed if you run into
an obstacle or get flipped over you'll
lose the game its simplicity is
fantastic for mobile gamers who just
want to pick it up and play however that
simplicity also limits the game is you
really are just driving down a highway
and killing zombies given the simplistic
nature of the game we decided to give it
a 3.5 out of 5 stars
the graphics won't win any awards but
considering the scope of the game they
really aren't that bad the zombies look
like zombies the cars look like cars and
the roads look like roads there is no
pixelation when playing and everything
is very smooth organized and thought-out
when everything is added up
we gave the graphics to 3 out of 5 stars
strictly because the graphics look very
good and everything is implemented well
but there's always room for improvement
the replay value is very high with this
game players are challenged to get a
little further with each try and after a
point it does get a lot harder the
experiences further refreshed as players
unlock new roads and weapons which adds
features to the game since a round lasts
all of a few minutes and running down
zombies is well fun players can delight
themselves in undead slaughter whenever
they have time to kill without worrying
about being dragged in for hours even
that it's designed for short-term play
sessions we gave this a replay value of
4 out of 5 stars the menu of the game is
very well organized and that makes it
easy to navigate under the main menu you
can look at your weapon car and level
selections as well as a news box to push
out news from the developers in the
level selection screen you can choose
which road you want to drive down you
unlock them by accumulating so many
levels in the game or by earning medals
which you earn by doing well a few
levels offer unique challenges like
slippery roads
the car selection screen is very similar
you can choose your car based on its
attributes as you may have guessed
attributes affect things like handling
and how well zombies can flip you that
are unlocked by killing zombies and by
accumulating miles in-game and the gun
selection screen gamers can choose their
tools of destruction available are an
assortment of weapons like pistols
shotguns and flamethrowers you can have
up to three weapons equipped at once
which should help for at least a little
while like levels of vehicles these are
unlocked after driving so many miles or
by killing so many zombies if you are
feeling particularly lazy there is a gun
shop where you can buy these weapons as
in-app purchases zombie highway packs
quite a bit of fun for such a simple
game while you won't get any storyline
or campaign mode you will have all sorts
of fun mowing down the undead there are
some pitfalls and it's by no means the
perfect game but you can find way worse
ways to spend a buck so our overall
value for the game is four out of five
stars once again on Joe handy from
