authority and last year blackberry
released their very first Android
smartphone ever with the BlackBerry
Prive and it had some good things going
for it but it wasn't exactly a smash hit
now they're back at it again with what
they claim to be the world's most secure
smartphone but what else does this phone
offer and is security alone a big enough
selling point to make this phone worth
buying this is the BlackBerry detect 50
when looking at the D Tech 50 you might
be thinking that this phone looks eerily
familiar to another phone that you may
have already seen and that's because the
design of the D Tech 50 is actually
based off of the same TCL reference
design that Alcatel used for the idol 4
it's pretty much identical to the idol 4
in almost every way from the curves on
the top and bottom rounded corners and
flat sides it even carries the same dual
front-facing speakers and dual rear
facing speakers as the idol for my only
anoints with these speakers is because
of the tiny machine holes they're very
prone to getting dirty and trapping dust
but the sound quality of the speakers is
actually quite good they're loud and
don't get distorted or tinny at all even
at max volume and because the speakers
are also mirrored on the back you can
put this phone face up or face down
without any deterioration in these sound
quality the most distinguishable design
Q on the B Tech 50 that makes it
different from the auto 4 is on the back
instead of a glass back that detect 50
has this textured back made of a
silicone like material that feels really
nice doesn't attract fingerprints and
gives the phone a lot of grip the
general shape of the D Tech 50 reminds
me of the Nexus 4 from back in the day
especially when looking at it from the
front so I'm definitely a fan of the
design it's simple clean and comfortable
to hold and use in one hand thanks to
the thin side bezels and small top and
bottom chin on the top of the phone
you'll find the headphone jack the
microUSB port on the bottom and on the
right side is the SIM slash micro SD
card slot for extra storage the volume
rocker and what appears to be the power
key but instead this is what blackberry
calls the convenience key it's a 100%
completely programmable button that can
be assigned to a variety of different
shortcuts
composing a text toggling on Wi-Fi
controlling the LED flash or opening a
application of your choice including
third-party ones the power button is
located on the upper left side of the
phone and this is actually my biggest
gripe with the D Tech 50 if you use your
phone in your left hand that I suppose
it may not be that big of a deal but for
most people it's going to feel really
awkward and pretty tough to get used to
I like to call it the inconvenience key
thankfully it does have double tap to
wake and double tap to sleep so you can
avoid using the poorly placed power
button altogether I will admit that the
double tap to wake is a little bit slow
and sometimes doesn't always respond on
the first try but I still personally
prefer this over using the power button
to make your life easier you can also
reprogram the convenience key to lock
the device but unfortunately it can't be
used to wake it the screen measures in
at 5.2 inches which is an average size
for a smart phone in 2016 and it's an
IPS LCD with a resolution of 1080p it's
not a display that's going to knock your
socks off but I have no complaints with
it it gets bright enough to see outdoors
has decent viewing angles and a good
amount of color and contrast without
being oversaturated the 1080p resolution
also works perfectly fine for the screen
size there's plenty of sharpness that
graphics and text are easy to read and
watching videos web browsing and playing
games is still an enjoyable experience
inside it's being powered by a
Snapdragon 617 Adreno 405 and 3
gigabytes of RAM which are pretty
run-of-the-mill specs for a mid-range
phone and performance is a little bit of
a mixed bag in normal everyday use it
runs perfectly fine touch responsiveness
is good
it opens apps quickly and multitask
without much of a problem there is the
occasional stutter from time to time but
it's really not that big of a deal
gaming on the other hand is where you'll
notice a lot of hiccups games are still
certainly very playable but game low
times can be pretty long and there tends
to be a lot of choppiness and lag even
on a game as basic as Pokemon go this
happens especially if there's a lot of
graphical elements on the screen at one
time games like CSR racing 2 also have
to render graphics at a much lower
resolution and limit some in-game
functionality and
order to run smoothly which is a little
disappointing so if you're a big mobile
gamer this phone isn't really going to
do you justice but for everything else I
don't think you'll have too much of a
problem with only a 16 gigabyte option
you also won't have a lot of storage to
store bear minigames or much of anything
for that matter so it's probably a good
idea to pick up a micro SD card and the
detect 50 is capable of supporting cards
up to 256 gigs battery life I would say
is another weak point on the D Tech 50
it has a two thousand six hundred and
ten milliamp hour battery which I guess
you could say is pretty small when
compared to a lot of other smart phones
on the market and you can probably eke
out a full day if you stick to the basic
texting and checking emails but for me
personally I like to use my phone for
gaming watching YouTube and checking
social media pretty frequently and if
your usage is anything like mine you're
going to have a pretty tough time
getting to the full day it's not really
even going to come close the most I was
able to get was around 7 to 8 hours off
the charger it does have quick charge
2.0 which is nice so it's really easy to
fill up but I'd still recommend getting
a battery pack especially if you like
playing Pokemon go on the rear there's a
13 megapixel camera with f 2.0 aperture
phase detection autofocus and a dual
tone LED flash as far as the camera app
goes it's pretty basic it doesn't offer
any extra shooting modes beyond the
standard video photo and panorama and it
also has a bunch of live filters built
in it does have HDR auto and a built in
manual mode for controlling focus white
balance shutter speed ISO and exposure
but beyond that it doesn't offer a whole
lot of bells and whistles to get a great
looking photo with this camera you
really need to have good lighting but
even then there's a noticeable lack of
sharpness and detail when zooming in it
does have good color reproduction if
you're shooting outdoors or in a
well-lit area but in low-light is where
it really begins to break down the
camera constantly hunts for focus making
it very difficult to take a photo and
when you finally do take a photo they're
usually very noisy with a lot of
artifacts and the images just look very
soft and muddy the front camera isn't
really all that notable it's 8
megapixels and can take some decent
selfies and the notification LED light
also functions as a front-facing flash
to help you get some slightly
better-looking shots in low light but
the results still typically aren't that
great the big story here with the D Tech
50 isn't about the design the camera or
the specs it's about the software and
the security that comes along with it
the majority of the security comes from
the detect application which is where
the phone got its name D Tech will show
you your device's security status and
this can change over time the more you
use your phone what D Tech all of your
data is encrypted and you control the
permissions of individual apps and what
they're allowed to access so you never
have to worry about apps having access
and things that you don't want it to
there's also a factory reset protection
which in the event that someone steals
your phone and factory resets it they
still won't be able to use it without
knowing your Google account info whether
it really is the most secure smartphone
in the world is pretty tough to say but
blackberry is promising that they will
be very quick to release security patch
updates as soon as they are available
the rest of the software is a very stock
like Android marshmallow experience with
a lot of blackberry software
enhancements on top many of which we saw
on the prayer from last year it comes
with bbm installed by default and
personally I don't use it but it's there
for the few of you who still love
communicating five bbm I do hover like a
lot of the features from blackberry and
many of them are actually pretty useful
you have the productivity tab which you
can access by swiping in from the right
to see your current calendar events
emails tasks and your most recent
contacts my favorite feature definitely
has to be the BlackBerry hub if you
aren't familiar with it the BlackBerry
hub is your one-stop shop for virtually
all three notifications aggregates your
bbm text messages emails phone calls and
social media all into one place making
them very easy to check it does have
some issues like Gmail for example
doesn't render properly through the hub
but for the most part it does what it's
supposed to do extremely well you can
also swipe up from the bottom
I love old-school Google now style to
access three app shortcuts and by
default these are set to blackberry
search the dialer and blackberry hub but
you can set these to be any apps that
you want like that BlackBerry gives you
a lot of room for tweaking and
customization and something that I
really enjoy is that you use third-party
icon packs to customize the default
launcher if you're a fan of widgets the
pop-up widgets is a very useful feature
basically any app that you have that
supports a widget will display three
dots beneath it and all you have to do
is swipe up to open the widget it's a
really elegant solution to using widgets
without having them take up any space on
your home screen of course you can't
talk about blackberry without talking
about keyboards the DTEC 50 is an all
touchscreen device so it doesn't have a
physical keyboard obviously but it does
come with BlackBerry's own software
keyboard it's accurate easy to type on
and I like that BlackBerry's predictive
text allows you to swipe up on a letter
to quickly complete a word blackberry
software isn't perfect and does have
some minor quirks like the way the app
drawer looks when the apps are sorted
alphabetically they're not only sorted
alphabetically but it's also sectioned
out by the letter and visually it just
doesn't look very appealing overall
though I'm a fan of blackberry software
and their features add a lot of value
without feeling bloated or taken away
from the stock Android experience the
BlackBerry G tech 50 is being priced at
$300 here in the US and it's completely
GSM unlocked so it's plug-and-play for
carriers like AT&amp;amp;T Mobile 300 bucks is
rather inexpensive especially if you
want a phone that prioritizes security
in that case you're probably not going
to find a better deal but as a phone
there's a few better options out there
they offer a lot more for similar prices
like the oneplus 3 the Moto G 4 plus and
even the axon 7 if you store a lot of
sensitive information on your phone the
detect fifties top-notch security will
be well worth the investment but if this
phone had one major flaw it's that
Blackberry didn't make it a better phone
all around as always thank you guys so
