selling point whether it be price camera
battery life or in this case water
resistance when smartphone producers
choose to focus on a single element of
the overall experience other corners can
be consequently cut the Sony Xperia m4
aqua focuses on being waterproof but how
will does it perform overall this is
Bailey Stein with Android authority and
this is my full review of the Sony
Xperia m4 aqua the m4 aquas design is
very similar to those of other Sony
smartphones and that shouldn't come as a
surprise Sony smartphone iterations are
largely incremental when it comes to
design and the m4 aqua is no exception
the two glass panel certainly look nice
although both are fingerprint magnets
the devices plastic frame is kind of
disconcerting and to me the O's out of
place when combined with the glass
construction the mix of premium peel and
glass and cheaper feeling plastic is
unsettling and makes the phone feel
awkward in the hand
the circular power button is positioned
nicely although the volume buttons and
SIM door flap leave little room to rest
your thumb on the side of the phone the
amount of ports camera buttons speaker
grille and separate sim and microSD card
flats all place on the frame is
overwhelming there's a lot going on for
a single frame and it's honestly kind of
off-putting and takes away from the
minimalism established with the glass
panels on the positive side of things
the phone is pretty thin and light at
7.3 millimeters and 136 grams the 2400
milliamp battery is not user replaceable
and there is a notification LED to the
left of the Sony branding on the front
of the device in addition to that
there's also a five megapixel front
facing camera of course the m4 aqua is
waterproof with IP 65 and ip68
certification sony says that the phone
should not be underwater for more than
30 minutes nor should it be under a
depth of one and a half meters the
physical camera button also enables
underwater pictures since you can't
really use the touchscreen when it's
exposed to water as long as you follow
the instructions you can expose the
phone to water without having to worry
about damaging
the five inch 720p display looks good
with great viewing angles it is
noticeably warm however and colors just
aren't as vivid as they are on other
devices in the same price category
overall the display is good but not
great day to day performance on the m4
aqua was pretty good and the two
gigabytes of RAM was enough to run more
than a couple of apps at once the phone
is powered by Qualcomm's mid-range
octa-core 64-bit Snapdragon 615 with
four cores clocked at 1.5 gigahertz and
the other four cores clocked at 1
gigahertz it's not as fast as flagship
devices but it's certainly more than
usable
one area of concern is the devices heat
output it's not as bad as the Snapdragon
a 15
but the m4 aqua gets very hot when doing
simple tasks like using the camera or
downloading apps
luckily the processor does slow down
significantly before overheating but it
still indicates a problem that Qualcomm
has kind of just swept under the rug the
Adreno 405 GPU handled gaming well and I
didn't run into any issues with the
exception of a surprisingly warm phone
in addition to supporting cellular
networks the m4 aqua also works with GPS
802 11 and Wi-Fi DLNA and Bluetooth 4.1
carrier compatibility varies from each
model so be sure to check the frequency
bands before purchasing for example my
model only supports up to HSPA+ an AT&amp;amp;T
although I was hoping for front-facing
speakers given the devices dual front
grills the m4 aqua has side firing audio
it turns out that the bottom grille is
just a microphone and the top grille is
only used as an earpiece the audio
output on the import equi is okay but
the volume is on the quieter side and it
just sounds tinny and distorted
otherwise called partially hydrogenated
oils on labels
trans fats are used by companies because
they give fruit a longer shelf-life
enhance texture and stay solid at room
temperature the 13 megapixel camera
which I'm assuming is a Sony sensor took
some nice-looking images
it's a capable camera but I did notice
that some images lacked punchiness the
pictures were quite sharp and detailed
however the camera app has a few modes
one being manual which allows you to
select the scene or adjust white balance
Sony does offer additional camera modes
which are available for download sony
claims that the m4 aquas 2400 milliamp
battery will last 2 days but that's not
what I found in my testing when I ran my
daily usage tests the phone lasted from
about 7 a.m. to about 10:30 p.m. with
just over 2 and a half hours of screen
on time I cut the phone and standby for
most of the day and telling the evening
when I started to watch youtube videos
and scroll through Twitter there are a
few power saving modes in the settings
which you'll likely end up using to
extend the phone's battery life the
software on the sony m4 aqua is a
slightly skinned version of android 5.0
lollipop there are some great things
about it like the ability to customize
the quick toggles record a video of the
screen something that usually requires
routing and a small apps menu the UI for
the small apps does feel a tad
unpolished for some reason but the
functionality can definitely be useful
on the downside the default launcher
does have a few issues and the phone
does ship with some blow wear for
example the hamburger icon in the app
drawer is poorly placed it can sometimes
get in the way when swiping right which
is incredibly annoying and frustrating
another negative point is the amount of
blow wear on the m4 aqua haystacks avg
protection and news from social life are
only a few of the many mostly useless
pre-installed apps luckily most of them
can be uninstalled the Sony m4 aqua is
available in black white or pink with 8
or 16 gigabytes of storage the 8
gigabyte model only has less than one
and a half gigabytes of usable storage
out of the box so you should really opt
for the 16 gigabyte model if you plan on
buying this phone
although the phone isn't officially
available within the US just the
it can be purchased for around 350 from
third-party resellers for that price the
Sony Xperia m4 aqua is a tough sell well
it does have a good display capable
camera and water resistance there's just
too much about the m4 aqua that prevents
me from recommending it the design is
inconsistent the processor has heating
issues and the battery life just isn't
as good as so many claims and while
those compromises may have been
acceptable two years or even a year ago
the competition today is much bolder
with options like the ACS zenfone 2 and
Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 the m4 aqua is
not only mediocre at best but also
overpriced thank you for watching this
