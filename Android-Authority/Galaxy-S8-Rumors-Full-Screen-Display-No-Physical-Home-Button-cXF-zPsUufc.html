when you receive a leak of a device that
is an almost bezel Estus play it is
almost certainly false until the near
future of course because it looks like
the galaxy s 8 will undergo a pretty
major transformation the respective ET
news at publication with good
connections in the Korean tech industry
reports that Samsung plans to ditch the
physical home button and opt for a
full-screen display that would virtually
eliminate the top and bottom bezels of
the galaxy s 8 the phone will reportedly
be equipped with dual cameras and be
powered by both Qualcomm and Samsung
chips but built with a new 10 nanometer
process now when we start to talk about
leaks and rumors this early before a
major flagship launch I got to remind
you guys that most of the time in the
past two years leaks and rumors have
been pretty accurate here at under
authority we've been very careful about
that the biggest blunder was the Galaxy
s5 and it wasn't a blunder as it was a
timing issue we had been building up for
three or four months about all the leaks
and rumors of the Galaxy s5 and when it
came out it looked like a band-aid quite
a bit different than the edged display
that we were expecting of course later
on we all learned that those leaks and
rumors were actually accurate but there
were more prototypes of the galaxy s6
not the s5 so we got to remember here
that it's still pretty early and what
we're seeing may be the s8 or maybe
something they have planned later in the
future keep that in mind
sources told ichi news that samsung
wants to ditch the iconic home button
it's not clear what the alternative
solution would be the home button
incorporates the fingerprint sensor so
samsung will need to come up with a new
way to embed the sensor in or under the
glass or on the back of the device
perhaps there are tech solutions out
there that allow phone makers to embed
fingerprint sensors under the glass so
it's not like the Galaxy s8 has to have
a physical home button Xiaomi just
recently unveiled the mi 5s which
features Qualcomm's ultrasonic
fingerprint reader
fingerprint cards and other suppliers
have launched their own under glass
solutions now when it comes to the top
and bottom bezels I think this is the
next logical step now it may not be for
the s8 but I think this is a clear
indication that Samsung has in their
sights
a truely bezel list display that could
be cool because it's very much more an
immersive experience now let's talk
about the dual camera rumor it said that
Samsung has already made up its mind to
use a dual camera on the back of the s8
the question is whether Samsung will use
a 2 lens of one module design or a 2
lens 2 module arrangement according to
the report Samsung could opt for a 16
megapixel and 8 megapixel setup now
there should be no reason to doubt this
Samsung's competitors have already
started to do the same good on Samsung
using two lenses allows for a few neat
tricks like post shot refocusing but it
also makes it possible to improve the
overall quality of each shot Samsung
simply has to get in on that action now
let's talk about the rumored
system-on-a-chip
Samsung will reportedly use a mix of the
snapdragon 830 from Qualcomm and an ex
nose chip developed by its subsidiary
Samsung SDI both chips will be built on
the 10 nanometer process enabling higher
performance and lower battery
consumption now again no surprise here
in recent history Samsung has always
gone with a combination of its own
Exynos chip and with Qualcomm now some
of you may be thinking chase come on my
Snapdragon 800 system on a chip is still
doing really well on my phone for the
past two or three years what do I care
if I have the latest and greatest chip
well you may care if you really get into
augmented and virtual reality where I
expect that's gonna play a bigger role
so what are you hoping for in the Galaxy
s8 let me know in the comments below
what one feature would be the most
important for you I'll be reading them
