name is Kevin the tech ninja this is an
ugly sweater and these are the official
Nexus 5 accessories first up is the
official wireless charger now to say
last year's wireless charging Orbital's
a disappointment would be an
understatement
last year's version was at a 45 degree
angle with no possible way to keep the
device connected to the orb which will
often in your device sliding off and
leaving you frustrated
well our cries of anger and frustration
was heard the new wireless charging
device is a small platform and also has
a built-in magnet where the charged
mechanism is located simply slide your
device on it and it pretty much locks
into place and let the magnets do the
rest jesse pinkman would enjoy this
feature the surface of the unit is a
glossy plastic and the rest of the unit
has pretty much a matte finish the
bottom of the charger has an anti slip
rubber grip that keeps it into place
it's a sleek looking accessory that does
one thing and it does it well it charges
just like with all wireless chargers it
may not be as quick as a standard
charger but it still provides a quick
enough charge to allow you to set it
down for 20 minutes and get around 15%
worth of charge the overall build feel
and construction of this fills
well-thought-out and in place this is a
functional tool and has really worth the
price at $50 the Nexus 5 is a moderate
sized device compared to other androids
on the market but the Nexus 5 packs a
big punch despite its small footprint
this white or black case utilizes one of
the most underrated features on this
phone this quick cover allows you to
turn on your screen when opening it and
turn off the screen and closing just a
simple feature but it really adds to the
experience of the phone it makes it
especially easy and convenient when
checking your notifications quickly you
no longer need to just feel for the
button the case itself is a soft touch
rubber feel just like the back of a
nexus 5 or the second gen Nexus 7 the
inside of the case is a soft velvet
material that keeps the screen scratch
and scuff free all the cutouts on the
case are precise and stitching is solid
with every phone or case that uses this
type of material it's a fingerprint
magnet in this case is no exception to
that it tracks fingerprints like no
other but they can be simply
the way rubbing against your shirt or
your sweet holiday sweater on all this
case has a solid build quality and it's
something I'll continue to use on my
Nexus 5 ultimately it's your decision in
a 50 dollar price tag it's worth it to
you this is the bumper case these bumper
cases come in a variety of colors and
provide protection all around the device
it's really a no frills type of case and
it just gets the job done there are no
gaps or moving pieces with this case at
all so it should last a while if there's
one issue that I have with this case is
that pressing the buttons require a
break-in period sometimes you press the
volume up or volume down it doesn't go
through if they actually press it down
with some force after a few days this
pretty much clears herself up it may
look like a soft rubber case but it's
pretty tough I wouldn't say it will
withstand a drop but it's actually not a
type of case that that bends or folds
easily it's closer to a hardshell case
than it is to one of these
run-of-the-mill
eBay silicone cases you're paying a
premium for a case that's $35 but
overall I'd really feel confident having
my Nexus in this type of case it does
not add much bulk and the unique bold
colors can really make your next two
stand out
what knock on Google is that they take
way too long to bring out these
accessories when the device comes to
market so often the device will hit the
Play Store and weeks will go by before
something comes out and by then there
has been three or four generic cases
that come out at the fraction of a cause
and sometimes almost the same quality
some people like myself may order a
starter case just to hold me over until
the official cases come out whatever the
case may be you do have options so I
pose this question to you my Nexus 5
users do you have a quick cover case do
you have a bumper case or do you have a
wireless charger if so leave which one
you have below and let me know how you
feel about it my name is Kevin the tech
ninja this is my ugly sweater and vest
you can find me on youtube with Twitter
and on Google+ and this is Android
Authority your source for all things
Android take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
