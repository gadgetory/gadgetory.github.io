the authority we like Android and why
wouldn't we after all it's a highly
versatile operating system it's got a
very intuitive UI it's highly
customizable there's tons of great games
and great apps in other words it's just
a joy to use and with that in mind you
might find yourself wanting to use it on
something other than a smartphone or a
tablet how about a nice big PC for
instance so you can get it up and
running on a wide screen monitor whilst
you lean back in your swivel chair you
can get Android running on watches you
can get it running on televisions on
devices that fall in half
probably on washing machines so surely
it can't be that hard to get Android up
and running on a PC and in fact you're
right there's tons of ways you can get
Android running on a desktop so in this
video we're going to look at seven
different ways and which one might be
the best for you okay so option number
one is going to be to run BlueStacks on
your PC BlueStacks is an Android
emulator and of course an emulator is a
piece of software designed to help your
PC or whatever is running it to mimic
another system in this case Android
BlueStacks is one of the most popular
and one of the oldest Android emulators
one of the first to work well it's
completely free and that's allowed it to
get a big following and a lot of support
BlueStacks works well for running games
it's fairly quick it's not perfect it's
better for something like a strategy
game or for a puzzle game there's a lot
of those on Android if you're gonna run
an action game you might find that a
like it becomes a bit of a problem it's
also far from a stock Android experience
in the past there's been a bit of
feature bloat it's kind of slowed it
down made it sluggish and big they've
scaled that back down lately but it's
still far from a stock Android
experience you'll run your games from a
kind of menu and you'll find that not
everything is supported you can run the
Play Store you can open the Play Store
if you want to install games that way
the ones you've already bought but not
everything will be supported in there
certain things crash it's not perfect
but if you can find a game that's
supported by BlueStacks that you want to
play it's easy to install it's free you
might as well give it a go it's a good
enough experience option number two is
to run another emulator called Andy and
these a competitor to BlueStacks and it
works very similarly performance is on
par so it's not perfect but it's okay
but if a puzzlin is for action games but
it has some features that BlueStacks
doesn't have such as the ability to
change the launcher as you like you can
even
route your Andy emulator meaning can run
certain applications that need root
access in order to operate there are
some problems with Andy though the
reason I'm not showing any clips of it
running on the screen right now is
because every time I try to install it
it's frozen at 94% and that's on two
different machines and I'm not alone in
that experience at the same time when I
tried to install it it kept encouraging
me to install a whole ton of bloatware
search tools Chrome extensions antivirus
stuff and that leaves a really bad taste
in the mouth so some people have a good
experience with it but be careful with
this one and seeing as BlueStacks gives
you a comparable experience I think that
edges it out for me there are actually
tons of other Android emulators of
course and if you check out the link in
the description down below you'll be
taken to an article where we compare
lots of different options
some of them free some of them paid one
of them even runs in Chrome browser so
you can find which one is the best
option for you there but they're all
fairly comparable an Android emulator is
decent it normally comes with some stuff
padded in or you have to pay for it
because of course these people want to
make money and the performance is good
but not great on the whole as a rule so
option number three then is going to be
something a bit different this is to run
Android via the AVD manager that comes
with Android studio and the Android SDK
so AVD manager stands for Android
virtual device a virtual device is a
kind of emulator this aimed at
developers so people who want to test
the apps and the programs that they've
made because it get this up and running
you need to go to Android developers and
download Android studio as though you
would developer them this will also come
with the Android SDK and tons of other
stuff and it takes up a lot of space on
your computer that's one downside of
using this you'll then need to install
the Android studio ide and this can take
a while
but once it's all set up you'll be able
to use the AVD manager in order to
create your own virtual device so you
get to pick the size of the screen you
want to emulate you get to pick how much
space you want to give it how much power
you get to pick which version of Android
you want to install onto it and of
course because this is the official
option from Google that means you can
download the latest version of Android
and it's going to be available very
quickly as soon as it rolls out of
course developers need to be able to
test their apps on the latest version
before even the general public get their
hands on it
it used to be that these virtual devices
didn't support the Play Store but the
that's no longer the case as long as you
pick the right hardware set up in the
right version of the operating system
has a little icon next to it then you
could install the version of Android
with the Google Play Store already set
up so you can download all the games
you've already downloaded or then once
you've already paid for without them to
pay for them again and play them on your
PC now the best part is that if you
choose an x86 image for your Android
installation you can run it in an
accelerated mode and it'll run almost as
fast as it would do on a smartphone or a
tablet and you can play games in this
way and they'll run almost as quickly as
they would do on any other device i
played something the hedgehog no problem
other twitch games are just fine and you
can even get some 3d games working it's
not perfect of course not every game and
apps going to work I had difficulties
trying to get asphalt 8 to work for
instance because of course these games
aren't used to running in this kind of
environment but on the whole this is the
smoothest and the most versatile Android
experience I think you're gonna get on a
PC the only downside of course is that
you've got to take up lots of space on
the computer and go through that
installation process and if that puts
you off then you might be more
interested in option 4 which is to run
genymotion so genymotion
is an alternative to the AVD manager
it's another virtual device aimed at
developers but not from Google this time
this once again lets you create a
virtual device and then test your games
and apps on your computer and it runs
pretty quickly you can also access the
Play Store through something called G
apps now so that's great
genymotion isn't perfect compared to the
virtual device I find that it runs a
little bit more slowly a lot of people
say they find it's faster but I think
that might have changed because in my
experience games judder they're much
slower and they're more likely to crash
on me compared with using Google's
option at the same time you're not going
to get the very latest version of
Android rollout straight away because
you need to wait for genymotion to roll
out their update but other than that
it's another good option and it means
you don't have to install the whole of
the Android studio and the SDK on your
computer if you've got less space or if
you just don't want to go through that
rather lengthy installation process then
this is a quicker way to get it up and
running it'll like - way to get it up
and running but I mean it's negligible
for most people put in the next one 10
minutes use up a couple more gigabytes
and have a better experience running on
your PC that's my take option number
five is going to be a little bit
different this one is installing android
x86 through a virtual machine so
you're going to download virtualbox set
up a new virtual environment and then
you can install the android x86 image
straight onto there this image is
created by coders by hackers it's an
open-source project to make Android
available on x86 architecture so you can
download that free from their website
then go through the process of creating
a virtual machine then install it on
there and then you want to save the
state so that every time you load it
back up you don't need to install it
again otherwise you do for some reason
it's not a perfect experience and your
mileage may vary in terms of performance
I find it runs quickly on one of my
machines and slowly on another but it is
essentially a native Android experience
on the PC which is cool and if you stick
it on a USB stick then you can actually
boot from it without having to create a
virtual machine so if you have an old
computer sitting around in the corner of
your room gathering dust then this is
something can do with it and you can
turn it into an Android device there's
instructions in that link that I've
talked about in the description down
below and that'll show you how to go
through this whole process for option
number 6 we've got another image that
you can install onto a virtual machine
or onto a USB stick and this one's
called remix OS remix OS is interesting
because it's not aiming to bring a stock
Android rather it's aiming to bring us a
version of Android that has been desktop
e5 that's definitely a word so in other
words it has a taskbar it has a kind of
Start menu type thing where you can
select your apps and has better Mouse
support and things open up in Windows
sometimes so it's a bit more like using
a Windows PC I personally find it runs a
bit faster than the x86 option as well
you'll still have to go through the
lengthy process of setting up a virtual
machine and then installing it on there
and for some people that's going to be a
plus if they enjoy that kind of thing
but for other people who just want a
quick way to experience Android that's
gonna be a barrier to entry and it's
still not perfect it's still slower than
using the Android virtual device that
comes with Android studio remix OS also
comes with a tool that's specifically
designed to help you set it up very USB
stick for booting from so if that's
something that appeals to you then that
makes it nice and easy and maybe a
little bit more tempting than using the
x86 option finally option 7
to use remix OS player so if you like
the sounds of remix OS if you want to
try out a version of Android designed
for a desktop environment but you don't
want to go through the process of
installing a virtual machine and setting
up like that then you can find this
remix OS player which is basically like
an emulator it's a one-click
installation or you know a regular exe
installation will install a virtual
device etc on your machine but you won't
need to worry about it and you can run
it that way I find it's a bit slower
than installing it onto a virtual
machine or onto a USB stick but other
than that it's a great way to experience
it I'd say it's more well suited to
using productivity tools rather than
games it's certainly something a bit
different and interesting and it's easy
to set up there's no reason not to give
it a try so there you have it that's
seven different ways to get Android up
and running on your PC unfortunately
none of them are perfect they've all got
their perks and some of them are quite
interesting to play around with my
recommendation is for most people
download Android studio it's a bit of a
pain it's a bit of a laborious process
we'll want to set up it does give you
the best experience as long as you've
got the space on your PC a second best
option might be genymotion or perhaps
one of those commercial emulators
there's many more options of course
though and you might find that one of
the options in the link in the
description down below is better suited
to your needs let me know in the
comments down below if there's anything
I missed if you'd like to go over
anything else if you want me to talk
through how to set up Android on a
virtual machine then that's something I
could do in the future let me know if
that's something you'd like to see I
