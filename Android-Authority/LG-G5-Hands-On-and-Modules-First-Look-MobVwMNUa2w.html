to move on from the philosophies of the
past in order to piece together a new
future it's Josh of a guard from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the LG g5 a radically different
design is what you see first in the g5
as many of the design aspects from
previous iterations are no longer here
and that includes the back button layout
as well as the curved bodies and curve
displays but we have this all-metal body
that has a modular design to it and
we'll get into that more when we talk
about the battery but we do see some new
design cues here as the power button is
still on the back but now has the
fingerprint reader embedded inside and
the volume rocker has been moved to the
side now this as LG told us is so that
they were able to keep the phone as
sleek as possible now this phone comes
in at 159 grams in terms of heaviness so
it is actually pretty easy to use still
and with a 5.3 inch display up front it
is a little bit easier to use in one
hand speaking of that display though it
is a IPS screen that comes in a quad HD
resolution and as we were able to spend
some quality time with the g5 we found
the display to actually kind of give a
really good experience it is quite
bright especially in broad daylight and
it manages to be very legible even under
the highest of glare and the always-on
display lights up only a certain portion
of the display in order to show the time
or a signature as you can see in the
settings that you can customize however
it only shows so many characters so the
Freys might actually be cut off and if
you're wondering the always-on display
only will take a point eight percent of
the battery every hour the last thing
that's really noticeable on the front of
the g5 is a 3d art glass design which
provides that little bit of a curve on
the top which LG told us is really just
for looks but also makes it a little bit
more comfortable to use on the ear when
talking underneath the surface is a
Snapdragon 820 one of the first to come
out with this new powerful Snapdragon
processor and has the Adreno 530 and 4
gigabytes of RAM to help with all of the
multitasking but all of these
specifications are going to help power
what will be a brand new ecosystem for
the G
line that said however we do have a good
time with this phone thus far as we have
had no issues with the way that it moves
along very smoothly and very nicely
let's return to the backing and you can
see above the power button that there is
a new dual lens setup now this camera
which is taking a lot of inspiration
from the successes of the g4 and to the
v10 is taking the dual lens setup and
putting it on the back in order to bring
a wide-angle view alongside all of the
other bits that you will probably expect
from a high-end camera like this getting
into the actual interface what we have
here is the manual mode that was already
pretty great in the g4 it has only
gotten better you still have the
granular controls that include manual
focusing Kelvin readings in the white
balance but now when you're zooming in
and out it'll actually seamlessly change
between the two lenses so that you can
go from a more conventional narrow view
and then go to a hundred and thirty-five
degree wide angle view as well the
lenses come in at 8 megapixels for the
wide-angle lens on the back 16
megapixels for the more conventional
narrow lens and then up front you have
an 8 megapixel shooter it is a pretty
drastic change going to the wide-angle
view when compared to the regular more
narrow view and you're able to fit in a
lot more as far as the picture quality
goes we are going to reserve our
judgment on this because the software
for the camera we were told is still not
fully final and we do think that there
might be some improvements when the
phone actually goes on sale so we give
you these examples more as a preview of
what you can expect the quality to be
like if it's anything like the g4 in the
v10 we think it's going to be pretty
great but until then you can see what
you might be able to look forward to in
the g5 when it finally comes out the
software is also a very radical change
for the g5 as the GUI has been changed
to remove a lot of the different
features that we probably saw in the g4
and thought we're over saturating the
overall suite not only are features like
the Q slide ABS Q memo and even the dual
window seem to be missing here we also
have a missing app drawer now what we
were told by LG is that after a lot of
market research this change was made to
reflect the fact that people are looking
for even easier experiences in their
operating systems but overall the
experience is quite snappy and even if
the app drawer might take some getting
used to not being there we did find that
the interface has gotten a little
sleeker a little bit easier to look at
and a lot easier on the eyes because
it's not overly bloated with a lot of
features we would never use and finally
we can talk about the hardware what we
have is a 2800 milliamp hour battery
here that's charged by USB type-c and
supports quick charge 3.0 when you need
to get that extra juice you can actually
replace it and that's where the fun
really begins this little area on the
bottom left actually has to be pushed in
quite hard in order to remove the bottom
panel by removing the bottom panel you
actually slide out the battery itself
and this battery can be snapped off of
that particular panel by pulling it at
an angle this is something that you
probably will have to learn first in
order to really take advantage of what
will become the modular design of the g5
that battery which does have a
proprietary connector to get into all of
the different modules will be made
available for third-party vendors in
order for them to create their own
accessories and even third-party
batteries that can be used with the g5
but it's when you connect this battery
to different new bits and pieces that
will connect to the g5 that things
really get interesting the first one
that we'll show you is the camera module
called the LG cam plus now this is
basically a battery grip that you put on
to the g5 which will then give you
manual and hardware controls in order to
take pictures zoom in and outs start
videos and also launch the actual camera
from any place on the phone the grip is
quite media as well and it adds 1,200
more milliamp hours to the battery
overall giving you four thousand
milliamp hours so you can use the camera
in particular for longer amounts of time
already the phone may be a great
companion to have as a daily shooter and
by adding in an extra module that not
only gives more battery life but gives
even better Hardware control over the
camera it might just make this one of
the best travel companions when it comes
to taking pictures and memories further
modules will be created but the only
other one that we did see was the hi-fi
bye bang and all sim
now this hi-fi module comes with a DAC a
dec rather installed inside for 32 bits
audio and we were able to listen to it
for a little while and all of the audio
did sound really great coming from the
headphone jack inside of this actual
module
and of course with VR and 360 photos and
video becoming the thing in the mobile
space the 360 cam is a separate module a
separate peripheral rather that can be
used in order to take 360 photos and
video and it's quite easy to use just
snap on the actual camera into the cover
so it will be able to stand on its own
or you can just carry it around and take
pictures using the buttons installed and
all of the photos and videos that are
taking can be enjoyed on YouTube 360 and
Google Street View to further enjoy all
of those photos and video however you
can use the LG 360 VR headset now this
is unconventional compared to other
headsets because it connects via the USB
type-c ports to the actual phone itself
instead of putting the phone into a
large installation and because it is
doing all of the processing via the
phone and is able to process a little
bit inside of the glasses themselves
they are not only streamlining the VR
process but also streamlining its form
unfortunately LG because the g5 and its
new eco system are still due to be out
in the next couple of months
had no information for us when it came
to pricing but we imagined the g5 will
come in at the usual price for a
flagship device though we have been told
that there are going to be bundles with
the various modules which should provide
a little bit more of a deal the g5 is
definitely LG's way of moving forward in
the smartphone space where they think
that there is some stagnation and by
creating one of the first modular phones
that can actually be expanded with a
number of different peripherals this
might be one of those really
customizable and also very versatile
systems that are out there the design
might be radically changed and a lot of
LG fans might find that a little bit
tough to swallow but overall the moves
that LG is making in the g5 really make
us excited to really put it through its
paces when we get a full review unit so
keep it tuned to Android Authority for
even more about the LG g5 including all
of our coverage on it we have a couple
of future focuses and some verses to
show you so keep it tuned here for that
and even more from MWC 2016 because we
are your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
