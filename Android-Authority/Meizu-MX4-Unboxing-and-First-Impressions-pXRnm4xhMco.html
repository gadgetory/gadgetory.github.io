lot of growth out of in 2014 it's
definitely the Chinese portion of the
smartphone market we've seen
announcement after announcement and even
more our to come later this year before
the end of 2014 but one just came to my
doorstep and it is the latest flagship
by Mazur so it's Josh Bogart from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and it's time to unbox and
give my first impressions on the meizu
mx4 all right here we are with the meizu
mx4 this is the brand new flagship by
meizu whose mx3 from much earlier this
year was actually one of the
better-looking phones that I had used at
the beginning of this year I did really
like its design and if I'm not mistaken
we should be getting a very similar
design in this one as well along with a
few very key enhancements but without
any further ado I'm just going to go
ahead and jump right into it the major
logos right there on the bottom but here
we are with the MX 4 we do have a plug
adapter here made for European plugs and
from there we're just going to jump
right into the actual phone itself which
I believe should be in this booklet
right here which has been the case for a
couple of other unboxings in the past
but before I open that up I will jump
into this area down here which actually
doesn't seem to have anything perhaps I
don't get any headphones in my demo unit
right now and then obviously we have the
micro USB charging cable so we'll go
ahead and just throw all of that aside
and jump right into the actual phone
itself now we do have some documentation
here basically just telling us exactly
what to expect when it comes to this
particular phone we do have a larger
screen with supposedly a better
resolution on involve take a look at
that a little bit later and also a
camera here that as the documentation
says has a twenty point seven megapixel
power so that's actually pretty nice we
have a very powerful camera on this
particular phone itself and then from
there the fly me 4.0 which we will take
a look at more in depth in our full
review obviously but then again here we
are with the actual phone itself meizu
right here on the front with the plastic
and it looks like it does retain a very
similar design from the MX 3 it looks
like that's pretty much everything that
we're going to be getting as far as the
unboxing goes aside from some
documentation here and of course a
little bit there that I can't read
because it's in Chinese
and from there it looks like we have
everything from this particular unit
that I will be reviewing the meizu mx4
now as far as the display goes we do
have a five point three six inch display
right here which is a little bit unusual
it's not necessarily one of the more
conventional sizes that we see when it
comes to our phones but as far as the
resolution goes we do have a 1920 by
1152 resolution screen which does bring
a little bit more resolution than proper
1080p but for the most part you'll still
be getting Full HD quality and
experiences from here the home button
down here on the bottom is what you will
use for pretty much all of your
interactions with the fly me 4.0 in this
case and of course we have a nice
brushed feel on the back now what we'll
do here is actually what we see here is
that has the sample down here so this is
squarely a demo unit volume rocker over
here on the sides and of course we have
the volume at the power button which is
actually up top yes the inspiration
comes from an earlier version of an
iPhone which a lot of people are going
to notice when it comes to this phone
but that doesn't mean it isn't
attractive and it doesn't have some
function to it so after some set up we
are finally into the fly me UI this is
4.0 and the thing you'll notice about
fly me and it actually is the case for a
lot of Chinese or rather aged in
operating systems when it comes to
androids the fact that it does not come
with a app drawer for the most part
you're going to be setting up all of
your applications on the home screens to
be organized into things like folders or
just in particular grids however which
way that you feel you should be able to
put them together to make things look
very organized nonetheless that might
pose a little bit of a problem for a
number of people out there who prefer to
have their app drawers but that is the
case when it comes to the fly me 4.0 now
going into some of the apps so you what
you'll notice is we only really have the
button here at the bottom much like the
mx3 where basically you'll be swiping up
from the bottom of the screen in order
to open up the recent tasks and I have
opened up a few already so it's an easy
way for you to just multitask between a
number of different places there you go
and you'll see that there's a menu bar
down here that will contextually come up
with a number of buttons depending on
where you are if you hit the back button
you'll just go back in other cases
you'll have the menu bar only used for
the actual app you're in and if you want
to get to the
homescreen or rather hit the back button
in a different way you can always swipe
up from the actual button on the bottom
and it will bring you back home go to
the messaging maybe open up a message if
I want to go back I swipe up goes back
swipe up again goes back to the home
screen the notification drop-down is
pretty standard it has your quick
toggles up on the top and if you can
always expand them right here in order
to get to even more and then hit that
just to go back home
swiping up from there as you can see the
little light on the bottom means that
you're going to go back however my
impressions first impressions are still
pretty much the same as they were when
it came to the mx3 it's a nice design it
does take inspiration from a pretty
obvious place but from there we still
have a very nice looking phone with a
nice-looking operating system and I'm
looking forward to putting it through
its paces for a full review so make sure
you stay tuned for that and even more
coverage on the mx4 make sure you take a
look at the content from my colleagues
in Android Joe J's Kevin the tech ninja
and lawn and from there drop us some
