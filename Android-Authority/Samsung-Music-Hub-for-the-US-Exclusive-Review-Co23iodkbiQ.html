clayton young bear coming at you from
android authority calm your number one
source for all things android now today
we've got an exclusive look at Samsung
and M spots brand new music hub
application now this is actually pending
a US release date but I attended the US
release webinar yesterday gotta press
code and now I have access to 90 days of
the premium account so we're going to be
able to show you everything that this
app does and you know get you hyped and
excited for the brand new features
included so anyways let's open it up the
basic rundown on this app it's basically
a cloud music service you can serve
store all of your music in the cloud you
can also stream and play your music
right from your device but you have up
to 100 gigabytes of cloud storage for
your music when you have the 1099 a
month premium account now anyways this
is a really great deal it just kicks the
hell out of the pandora services the
slacker radio and all that it's got a
lot of great feature so let's just get
into them now anyways you can see we
have our nice user interface all of our
different colors on all of our different
tabs here we've got our settings our
help and about at the very bottom and
then as we go up we get the more
functional sort of tabs we've got our my
music the catalog and then the radio
which is great but anyways let's get
into the my music first off I'll say
none of these songs these artists or
anything are actually on my device
they're not on my SD card and they're
not on the internal storage these are
also stored in real time in the cloud
and including all the albums all the
songs and everything and then I also
have a very few number of songs that are
just on the device now in conjunction
with the Music Hub application is a
desktop program that you can get for mac
or windows that you need to install in
order to put your songs on the cloud you
do it from your PC now you can export
them to the cloud from iTunes Windows
Media Player or just folders on your
computer so that's really great it does
it instantly and you have access to them
at the snap of a finger you have also
got access to the music that's on your
device so let's begin streaming a song
from the cloud as you can see we can
simply click a song and it will buffer
for
few minutes I'll turn this down actually
and we have our now playing bar here
this is our actual player and within the
player we can tap and bring the album
artwork up or we have all of our options
up here such as shuffle repeat this is
more of an iTunes esque genius feature
which where we actually select a little
light bulb to get suggestions and
recommendations to a similar artists or
similar songs albums even that we might
like so we'll click that similar to the
song tessitore out by animals as leaders
we have all of these different songs
that come up as suggestions now these
are this is a great feature because you
can simply press one of these these are
all in Samsung's cloud they have
millions upon millions of songs and you
can simply stream them and listen to
them in real time as you want to so
we'll just click a random song here to
demo that out and it's instantly streams
you can see our progress bar instantly
went all the way up i have a pretty fast
internet connection here i'm not using
data but uh that was our preloaded
buffer as you can see and then now that
we're in this menu we can simply swipe
right and left to get the rest of the
songs that it's suggested anyways i'll
hide the player and we can go back
another great feature as you can see you
can tap and hold the songs here you can
add it to the queue you can add to a
playlist find similar music and then you
can download it right from the cloud
where it is stored because it's not on
the device as of now and also remove it
from my music so we'll add to the queue
and we'll add this song to the queue as
well that's easily accessed from right
here you just click the queue letter
right there and we have our queue here
so once we're in the queue we can click
play queue and then we can also clear it
anyways let's just go all the way back
to our original menu here we also have
access to millions of songs just on
Samsung's servers right here we have our
top hits pop hip hop all of our
different genre stations here so we'll
just click one here the soul R&amp;amp;B and
then we'll click this once again it will
stream from the cloud and instantly
begin playing
and if we like this we can go ahead and
click the light bulb there get similar
artists songs and then we can also
create a radio station from that now
that's something I'm going to hold off
doing for just a second go ahead and go
back to our main menu now and that's
where we'll go to our radio as you can
see we have our favorites that we can
add to base radio stations off of we
have recommended which actually the
device and the program suggests for us
as we get a bigger library we've also
got John our radio stations and personal
radio stations now I made one for Faith
No More and we can listen to that you
can have suggestions in the radio
station as to whether or not you like or
dislike the song so I will dislike and
once you dislike it instantly goes to
the next song you have unlimited
skipping extremely fast buffering so you
can see our progress bar goes and then
we can star for favorites and also find
these similar artists songs and albums
right from the light bulb here now
another cool thing is that on these
genre radio stations after you've
listened to one you can actually see
what is being played on that station at
that particular moment because they are
kind of across-the-board stations so
you're able to see what is playing and
you can judge for yourself whether or
not you want to listen to them you can
see here on dance in the air is playing
the album version so there's all of your
run down on the music that's playing if
you don't like something you don't
listen to that um anyways we'll go back
you can see in our downloads would be a
list of everything that we've downloaded
from the cloud that wasn't on our device
and we have our purchases as well go
back this is our account settings I do
have the 90-day subscription and we have
all of our statistics we can view our
purchases here change our account
information and we can do as the device
now for right now android is the only
operating system that's going to have
this service but they are working on
bringing it to Windows Phone
and iTunes brew so now that we've gone
through a few of things regarding the
music we can go to the recent see what
we've been listening to we've got all of
our different albums artists here that
we've have been listening to and like if
you do click on something it instantly
plays like everything is basically uh
cached so you have instant playability
and great response time we can also tag
songs search for artists and see I have
never searched for women tisdale before
but it instantly came up very responsive
a very good catalog of music here this
actually oh well it came up in my own
artists so we'll have to bring up a
radio station we can create a personal
radio for Wayman Tisdale here see if it
plays things that are similar it's
getting some jazz nice great awesome and
then we can you know hide the player go
back to our main menu and stuff and we
can view our cue if we add anything to
the queue and then play that now some of
the other settings that we have our
equalizer we can choose our you can
enable it and then have our base control
mid treble and volume as well as custom
presets there's only a few as of now
anyways um in our settings we can also
hear choose whether or not we just want
to stream songs only instead of playing
um and he saw I storing any songs on the
device to take up your space you can
also choose your storage limit being the
max 12 gigabytes and the minimum 2
gigabytes now so we also have our
storage device with USB storage we can
show the SD card songs and then just a
few more other download settings
equalizer settings and audio quality we
can choose high quality Wi-Fi and
cellular network or Wi-Fi only go back
under our help it basically shows us all
of the different things on all the
different you know features about the
music hub application and then in the
about just basically the patents privacy
policy and then a little bit more info
and so hold tight for this guy's it's a
great release I love this product
got the premium version and I've been
loving it it's just really great easy to
use Samsung has really hit the nail on
the head with this music service and
they're only going to improve as the you

going to release but I'm sure they're
going to add a few bug tweaks bug fixes
