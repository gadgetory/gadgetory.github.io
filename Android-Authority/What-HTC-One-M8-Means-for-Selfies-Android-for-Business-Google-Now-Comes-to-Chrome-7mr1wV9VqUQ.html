brought to you by lynda.com go to
lynda.com forward slash Android to learn
more welcome back to Android weekly my
name is Jason this past week you likely
heard about the official launch of the
new HTC One with its sleek design and
the fastest chipset currently available
but it also has a 4 megapixel rear
facing camera but a 5 megapixel front
facing camera proving that the age of
the selfie has reached narcissistic
levels get the nose get the small so
what is really going on with a 4
megapixel camera on a flagship device in
2014 the Nexus 5 has an 8 megapixel
camera what was HTC thinking well HTC
has done a lot to tote their so called
ultra pixel technology which is really
just a fancy word for the choice and
compromise they've made to keep the cost
of manufacturing the phone down you see
for those of you don't know about
megapixels I mean the average user
assumes that the higher the megapixel
count the better quality the camera but
that's not necessarily so you see a
megapixel is like a peephole so to speak
that allows light into the camera's lens
so the more the megapixels the greater
detail that camera can produce in its
photographs but it if it has a lower
megapixel count those megapixels are
larger allowing in more light so a lower
megapixel camera has a slight advantage
when it comes to low-light photography
now if you look at the article on
Android Authority linked up below where
they compare all the most recent
flagship Android phones you'll see that
although the HTC m8 does edged up the
competition when it comes to low-light
photography when it comes to overall
general photo quality the HTC m8 is
really at the bottom of the heap be sure
to check out Joshua's videos I've linked
up below he has the phone and he's
running it through its paces I talked to
him last night in a Google hangout at
length about the phone and about the
camera I am really looking forward to
his full review moving on to news about
Android for business updates and
enhancements to Android could include
stronger data encryption and storage of
sensitive data directly on
chips both of which prevent unauthorized
users from breaking into sensitive data
stored on the device you see that news
just came days after the White House
announced that they were reeling the use
of blackberry further mobile security
needs now in the end they did decide to
go with blackberry yet again but you've
got a guess that BlackBerry's days are
numbered
and if Android or an Android
manufacturer had won that contract or
when they do it will mean a huge coup
and a sea change for how enterprises use
mobile technology so as the case for
businesses using Android heats up so
will the demand for developers and IT
pros who can support it if you look at
the US Department of Labor Statistics
just for the US alone you'll see that
skilled people in this area get paid
well above average I mean you guys do
realize that we are still in the infancy
stages of an exploding mobile technology
industry for those of you have the
skills you'll be able to reap the
harvest there is a way to find high
quality instruction that is affordable I
use lynda.com myself to learn what I
needed to learn for this job you can
find easy to follow video tutorials that
help you learn software business and
creative skills go to lynda.com forward
slash Android and get started now moving
on to news about Google now coming to
the desktop certain elements of Google
now have existed on the desktop for
about a year but more recently Google
has been working to bring the full card
experience over to desktop first with
Chrome Canary this brings us weather
event reminders sports scores and all
the cards that were used to seeing on
our Android devices so how do you get in
on the Google now action cards well you
just got to make sure that you are
properly signed in and that you have the
latest version of Chrome you'll be happy
to know that office for Android is now
free Microsoft just made Office Mobile
for Android free for home use the app
itself has been available since July of
2013 and always free but it previously
required a subscription to Microsoft
Office at 360 Suite now Microsoft has
waived that requirement bringing its
powerful tools to mobile workers both on
Android and the iPhone office for
Android lets you edit and create
documents spreadsheets and presentations
from smart phones without any
restrictions at the announcement event
Microsoft's new CEO Satya Nadella
the company is committed to making its
cloud services available across all
platforms
you got a wonder though about the timing
I mean me I use Google Docs for almost
everything the only time I use Windows
Office is when I need a proper Excel
worksheet sort of seems like too little
too late thanks for watching Android R
me my name is JC I'd love to connect
with you here on Google+ or Twitter
I read all the comments below I can't
respond to them all but I do read them
even the ones that are not so clever you
don't wanna forget about my brothers in
andra Josh Joe in the tech ninja Kevin
and Chris is back doing good things yet
