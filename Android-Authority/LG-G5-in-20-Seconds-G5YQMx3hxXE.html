everyone has a lot of thoughts on the
Galaxy s7 and the LG g5 but instead of
making them talk for a long long time
about it i'm going to give everybody 20
seconds to tell me what they think about
the s7 and the g5 ok so i love it i love
the underdog I love what else does I
love that they take risks and the
modular thing is it's it's brilliant
it's adventurous I don't actually know
if it's gonna fly I think the majority
people aren't really going ever use the
modules but if it takes off it's
absolutely a revolution in how we
understand smullins time mmm-hmm all
right same question except g5 go if I
love it or hate it uh I don't like it
because it doesn't I don't know the
designs on all that great I like the
modular part but the designs not that
flattering and it doesn't feel very
comfortable your hand weights right but
what's the questions love the G fives
concept of modular design you know they
haven't to LG the removable battery the
expandable storage it's perfect is what
they you know they've stuck to their
guns about this the g5 itself it's an
interesting phone but I think with the
g6 of ever going to see really see
modular take off nice the g5 up close
isn't the most good-looking phone out
there quite disappointed but I do like
the fact that they're innovating I do
like the idea of modules and being able
to expand your phone and if you like the
removable battery then it's a good thing
I think it's I like that they're pushing
the boundaries of what's possible hey
you're hitting the swing tomorrow's
perfect alright awesome I was really
smitten with the Jeep I when I first
signed in SF
for the Congress and I'm still smitten
because it's modular and I think LG is
taking risk and I like the underdog but
more importantly that camera grip adds
battery capacity the dual camera setup
it's a good camera to start with I'm
really excited looking forward to taking
on trips with me good bro the g5 is
phenomenal mostly because LG stop giving
in hand right so g4 fine g5 they
completely decided to rewrite the
formula from scratch I have more time
going on yeah yeah are you good I
perfect I like the modularity of the g5
I don't know if I'm actually going to
use it it's my pic over the s7
absolutely
good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
