brought to you by atlassian build what's
next alright we got lots of good news
about the new version of Android called
Android n or as I'm affectionately
calling it until we know the official
name Android Nutella but before we get
to Nutella let's talk about the new HTC
10 leaks this week's leaks come from a
twitter user called Tana libera and it
looks like HTC took the one m7 s camera
module and paste it on the back of the
10 there's a slightly bigger flash to
the right of the sensor as well
according to previous rumors though the
device will sport a 12 megapixel rear
camera with laser autofocus as well as a
5 megapixel ultrapixel shooter for the
front as far as the design goes HTC
doesn't seem to be staying too far away
from past one flagships the HTC 10
appears to have a pretty sizeable
chamfer that extends around the entire
device moving to the front we're not
seeing anything too surprising a
supposed 5.2 inch AMOLED display with an
earpiece above a big front camera sensor
to the right down below the display sits
a Samsung like style physical home
button flanked by capacitive back and
recent app buttons we're not entirely
sure why HTC is switching back to
capacitive buttons from an on-screen key
but the decision probably won't be taken
lightly by HTC hardcore fans well for
the hardest core android fans out there
you'll be happy to know about androids
beta program the android beta program
will allow users who are interested in
trying out the android and preview to
receive over-the-air updates for every
preview release just like they would on
any other update up until now users who
wanted to test varies preview releases
had to flash each image separately the
new beta eliminates this friction to be
clear the android program is meant for
developers only in fact google warned
that the beta program is meant for quote
adventurous developers and that it
recommends testers to install the beta
on a secondary device no daily drivers
here people that means that should you
take the plunge you should expect a fair
share of bugs and other issues
potentially including some that could
render your device
usable but for those of you who do want
to take that plunge all you have to do
is go to google com for which / android
/b de and enroll but what does Android n
going to look like well there are a lot
of changes that we expect far too many
for me to talk about in today's single
show we'll probably devote a whole other
show just to Android n features but I
did want to talk about one that many of
you will find interesting the recent App
menus in Android n has also been revised
and improved with larger cards and the
recent apps stack as usual tapping the
square button will bring up a cascade of
your most recently used apps but if you
double tap the square button instead
you'll quickly switch between your
current app and the one you last used
while you're in the recent app list
tapping the recent apps button again
will cycle you through the most recently
used apps one by one as opposed to
swiping through the whole list and if
you let the small countdown slider
beneath the app bar expire the app will
go into full screen long pressing the
recent App buttons will launch a multi
window mode as you can see in the video
here now there's been lots of concern
from many of you about whether or not
Android end will have an app drawer and
there's been confusing reports some
indication saying that it's gone in some
indications that it will still be there
and the news we have today is clear as
mud prior to the Mobile World Congress
2016 we were told that the Android n
would ditch the app drawer one of
androids most iconic features then
during the show the evidence started
piling up with the LG g5 and the HTC one
x 9 arriving without an app drawer and
the galaxy s7 having an option to remove
it while the new xperia x range does
have an app drawer Sony's marshmallow
concept provides a classic and modern
view with and without an app drawer my
educated guess though the app drawer is
probably on its way out let me know what
you think in the comments below would
you miss the app drawer unleash your
team's potential with atlassian
collaboration software so you can work
and communicate better together you can
assign track manage tasks for any
project no matter how complex create and
share content organized results and
bring team members up to speed now two
reasons i like it lassie and so much is
that it allows me to communicate in a
way that i feel most comfortable i can
type it out and chat
or I can do one on one video and
communicate verbally I like that a lot
the second thing is that it's a great
tool for collaborating and managing code
in real time regardless of where you are
in the world go to atlassian calm to
learn more and see how JIRA confluence
HipChat and bitbucket give your team
everything you need to organize discuss
and complete shared work that's
atlassian calm unleash the potential of
your team build what's next thanks for
watching guys but I did need to take a
quick moment and apologize to all of you
and especially to an app developer named
francisco franco and francisco is the
app developer behind the focus app that
I talked about two days ago in the
privacy show I said that his appt was or
the premium version of his appt was
thirty dollars it's not that much not
anywhere near that he has in-app
purchases for his focus app for anywhere
from just over a buck to just over $13
so there's a free version but there are
premium in-app options if you want to
purchase those so again I apologize will
not happen again let me know what you
guys think of today's show in the
comments below talk to you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
