now feature you finding the camera of
many high-end smartphones is optical
image stabilization but the question is
what is it and how does it work
well let me explain normally when you
take a photograph you maybe sort of line
up the shot with you your subject and
you maybe you'll play with the some of
the controls you'll do the focusing and
then at some point you'll hit the button
to take the photo now when you do that
what happens is a shutter opens
particularly traditional camera and
light will come in and it will hit the
sensor in the old days I hit a film and
the exposure would occur during that
moment now if you move the camera even
because your hands are slightly shaking
because you can't keep your hand it's
rock solid still all the time even if
you move the camera a little bit
you get blurriness now blurriness of
course is the enemy of a good photo and
therefore there's a system called
optical image stabilization and what
that does is this is whenever you move
in one direction little mechanism works
inside to bring the lens in the other
direction therefore compensate for the
movement this normally happens on two
axes in fact what happens is there are
cup of gyroscopes that actually measure
the velocity and the angle of which way
the phone is moving and as you take the
picture the little microcontroller that
moves are floating lens with some motors
attached to it in the other other
direction to compensate for that
movement now obviously it can't
compensate for huge movement because you
only got a little lens or a little bit
of movement however it can compensate
for camera shake
now it's also worth mentioning at this
point that OAS can't stop the blurriness
in a moving target for trying to
photograph a pet or a child or a moving
car that's going past you at speed if
you're not paling correctly with it then
OAS cannot compensate for the blurriness
that will come from a moving object it
can only compensate for what happening
in your hand where you're taking the
photo now of course in good light
situations with a traditional camera and
with a smartphone camera what happens is
that shutter speed that shutter speed is
very quick the time it takes to open and
close that shutter to take the picture
to make the exposure is very quick and
therefore the amount of time which you
can move is also very small however it
in lower light situations maybe you're
out for an evening and you're trying to
take some photographs then because it's
lower light you actually find the
exposure time is longer and the longer
it is therefore your hand can move now
another type of image stabilization is
called digital image stabilization and
it's often used when you're recording
video and sometimes it's called a video
distort image stabilization and you'll
find that one certain smartphone for
example on the galaxy note5
now when you start videoing what happens
is another computer on board shifts the
picture around digitally inside of its
memory to compensate for the movements
that are happening with the hand and as
a result you get a much more steady
picture so I'd like to show you the
difference between a phone that has
image stabilization and a phone that
doesn't and this isn't meant to be a
head-to-head between two particular
devices but rather just a demonstration
of the quality of pictures taken with
one and with the other now to do this
I've got two phones with me one is the
Nexus 6p and the other is the note 5 now
the note 5 has optical image
stabilization and the Nexus 6p does not
now trying to find a way that was
consistent in terms of the movement of
the phone was actually quite difficult
and after a lot of experimentation I
found that the way that gives the most
consistent results is for me to jump up
in the air
take a photo while I'm in the air but of
course moving and then land again then
do it again and do it several times and
I took a whole series of photos to make
sure it wasn't maybe a fluke or just the
you know the very arc of my jumping like
that to try and get the best comparison
between those two devices so first of
all here are some photos I took with the
Nexus 6p which does not have image
stabilization
- still smokin and now here are the
photos I took with a note 5 which does
have image stabilization
isn't you wanna stay allowed
now first of all I want to say that both
phones actually have very good cameras
however in this situation where I'm
actually jumping in the air and then
taking the photo I'm actually moving
while I'm taking the photo we can
clearly see a difference some of the
Nexus 6p photos are actually quite good
and actually are pretty reasonably sharp
however the majority of them are blurred
on the other hand the Nick note 5
pictures one or two of them are blurred
but the majority of them are quite clear
and here we can see the difference
between the image stabilization at work
and a phone without the image
stabilization what my name is Gary Sims
from Andhra Authority and I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please do
give it a thumbs up also please use the
comments below to tell me what you think
about optical image stabilization and it
successes or failures you've had with it
is it something you look for when you
buy your next smartphone also don't
forget to subscribe to Andrew or ities
YouTube channel you can also follow me
on social media and also if you use this
link here you can talk to me in the
Andhra thority forums there's a place
there where you can ask me questions
about optical image stabilization or
about any of the topics that I cover and
I will check that regularly and get back
to you to see if I can help
and also let's forget to stay tuned to
Andrew or thority calm because we are
