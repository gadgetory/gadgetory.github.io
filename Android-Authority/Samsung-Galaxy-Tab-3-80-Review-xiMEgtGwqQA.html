which isn't necessarily a bad thing see
what it basically means is that we are
probably already familiar with the
general design and the user experience
but Samsung did want to update their
Galaxy Tab line with a new 8 inch tablet
that is supposed to be lighter nimbler
and a lot easier to handle
does it provide a worthy enough refresh
the answer is sort of hey it's Josh of
Agartha mantra' authority what's going
on everybody and this is the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 3 8
first impressions are about what you
would expect this is yet another Samsung
product that employs the plastic and
rounded look that the vast majority of
their devices sport while this might be
you tried-and-true design plenty of
people are wishing for a change in these
aesthetic choices unfortunately you
won't be getting that here the tap three
does sports some enhancements that
supplement what we've come to expect you
still get the rather slippery plastic
feel with the 8-inch screen up front
atop the usual line of buttons there is
a significantly thinner bezel now which
helps make the screen handling a little
better around the back of the
unremovable cover also houses a 5
megapixel camera in the very corner and
along the somewhat golden sides are the
power button and volume rockers on the
same plane as the built-in IR blaster
opposite this is a very welcome micro SD
card slot so that's all good and
unsurprising until you hold it in your
hand the after mentioned thinner bezels
do a nice job of improving the handling
of this 8 inch tablet but a lighter
weight very much helps as well
weighing in at 314 grams the Tab 3 is
pretty easy to maneuver and throw around
as you need while it is just outside the
comfort of a one hand grip you can
pretty comfortably rest the entire
device on your fingers and reach what
you can with your thumb in the end this
is a no frills design that actually
somewhat surprises with its ease of
handling you would hope for a good
display on an 18 inch tablet well this
isn't a 1080p display like we're getting
accustomed to these days the Tab 3 still
sports a nice TFT capacitive screen
capable of 1280 by 800 resolution and an
understandable 189 PPI density it's
understandable because with this larger
screen the device will be far enough
away from your face that pixelation in
text and whatnot won't be as bad and it
isn't though some software enhancements
for text certainly help nonetheless
you're not going to be getting the
sharpest or most crisp experience here
however colors are quite vibrant and
viewing angles are very good the more
bloated TouchWiz elements work on a
screen of this size and keeps things
very easy on the eyes overall I did have
an enjoyable time with this display
in the performance aspect Samsung went
with their in-house processing package
with an X eNOS 42:12 dual-core clocked
in at 1.5 gigahertz it is backed by the
Mali 400 MP and 1.5 gigabytes of RAM it
isn't a high-end package by any means
and benchmark scores support this but in
practice the tablet does manage to
perform quite well
it loads apps pretty smoothly but as you
load more and more apps on top of all of
that it does end up stuttering a little
bit as resources aren't continuously
used in the background for the power
user this might not be the best
performer but I will say that the
general user will find web browsing the
occasional game and YouTube viewing easy
enough with the tab 3 if you are
expecting the tab 3 to feature many of
the same extra bits and pieces as
Samsung's Galaxy s4 then stop Samsung's
tablets don't often get the same
flagship treatment the way their phones
do nonetheless with the absence of any
extra sensors aside from just the
typical accelerometer you do get the IR
blaster for watch on capabilities are
generally sought after feature of
expandable memory is here though with a
micro SD card slot thankfully found on
the side NFC for sbeam though is not
available it is worth mentioning that a
version of the Tab 3 capable of phone
network connectivity is available but
such things seldom ever come to the
states there are thus 3G GSM and LTE
capable versions overseas but this one
is simply made for Wi-Fi which goes
along with the usual Bluetooth and GPS
and as I said before the back cover is
not removable but the 44 50 milliamp
hour battery found underneath provides a
pretty good level of juice straight
usage either through web browsing or
just a marathon a video watching gets
the battery drained in up to 8 hours I
got around 6 to 7 for the general user
who doesn't have their eyes glued to the
screen all day though you can eke out a
few days of usage especially with the
power saving features enabled we never
really ever expect cameras on tablets to
be exceptionally good 5 megapixels is
what you get here and in the camera app
a startling lack of modes when compared
to many of Samsung's other newer
products you get a few modes to play
with here and picture quality is decent
enough for a tablet it's become a
necessity to put cameras on
just about anything now but that doesn't
mean they'll blow you away those quite
familiar with Samsung products will
likely be familiar with the general user
experience
TouchWiz powered by Android 4.2.2 makes
a return with little changes aside from
becoming a little bit more tablet
friendly watch on and group play are the
only app inclusions and as far as
navigation goes you do get a couple
motion capabilities but not much after
that Google now and s-voice are both
available for your voice commands all in
all this is TouchWiz as we have come to
know it for so long now and it works
about as well as expected this 8-inch
tablet by Samsung comes in at 299
dollars a pretty middle price range for
a device that is well very middle and so
there you have it I know that my tone
here might seem a little drab but I will
say this the tab 3 is still an enjoyable
device the lighter form and thinner
bezels make for a much easier to handle
tablet and that's always a plus the
screen is actually quite good and is as
easy on the eyes as it can get but these
enhancements all just feel like ways of
trying to detract from the truth the
truth that we've seen this all before
the plastic body the all-too-familiar
TouchWiz and these middle-of-the-road
specifications can all be had in plenty
of other devices
not to mention ones that are cheaper
than the tap three if you do think that
what the Tab 3 offers will please you
then I'm sure it will but this is just
an experience that I feel like I've had
all too many times before and not to
mention and a bunch of other Samsung
products too boo and in the end it
ultimately just all feels far from
unforgettable as always stay tuned to
