I feel you I really do and so does
YouTube because now they want to give
you a YouTube ad free option for $9.99 a
month sort of Google has just announced
YouTube red a new video service that
will offer completely ad free videos and
more for just $9.99 per month not only
will the videos the ad free and YouTube
red
they will also allow users to save
videos and songs to their mobile devices
for offline viewing as well as the
ability to keep videos playing in the
background when you're using other
applications the $9.99 monthly fee also
includes a free subscription to Google
Play Music which is a steal considering
the music service normally cost 99 per
month on its own
additionally Google Play Music
subscribers will also get free
subscription to YouTube red YouTube red
is launching on Wednesday October 28th
and will include a free 30 day free
trial for all us users Google says that
in the next year YouTube red subscribers
will get member only access to new
original shows and movies from popular
content creators now this is also not to
be confused with another new YouTube app
called YouTube music YouTube Music is a
specialized experience for YouTube fans
that are specifically looking for music
related content these apps help bring
Contin to the forefront that matters to
their respective target audiences while
blocking out content that isn't relevant
the YouTube Music app will be totally
free to use though it will have certain
special features that can be unlocked
with a paid subscription to YouTube read
such as ad free listening viewing
background play offline access and more
an extra incentive to give YouTube music
a try anyone who downloads the app will
get a free 14-day trial to YouTube red
no credit card information needed at
launch the app will only be available
for us users though more countries will
gain capability starting in the new year
now this is pretty big news for both you
the viewer and us the content creators
and there's very little news or
information about what that's going to
mean for content creators income we
going to get a slice of that $9.99 per
month we don't know there's no
information or very little information
on that just yet but even the $9.99 per
month does not stop people like us from
supplementing our income with in video
ads like you've seen here many times and
because the ad revenue that we get from
YouTube is so minuscule
we have to supplement with other ads to
make this all possible so what that's
going to mean for YouTube only time will
tell
now for those of you lusting after more
news about the Droid turbo we got this
as we near the devices October 27th
unveiling Verizon and Motorola have
released a new teaser showing off the
unannounced to droid handset the Verizon
exclusive droid turbo 2 is expected to
feature quote the world's first
shatterproof display and support from
moto maker it's also rumored to come
with a snapdragon 810 processor a 5.4
inch quad HD display 3 gigabytes of ram
32 and 64 gigabytes storage options and
a big 30 760 million power battery now
let's talk budget handsets with Samsung
Samsung has just announced two new
devices destined for the budget
smartphone market the galaxy on five and
the galaxy on seven despite some
compromises in the hardware department
these new Galaxy handsets do have their
merits the galaxy on five is the smaller
of the two handsets coming in at 5
inches while the galaxy on 7 has a 5.5
inch screen both smartphones feature TFT
display and an acceptable 720p
resolution there are some differences
when it comes to the cameras the galaxy
on 7 features a 13 megapixel rear camera
and a 5 megapixel front facing sensor
while the on5 has to make do with an 8
megapixel rear camera there's a large
3000 milliamp hour battery on the galaxy
on 7 while the on 5 has a similar
suitable 2600 milliamp hour battery
