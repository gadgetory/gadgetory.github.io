handy the Android authority app guy and
in this review we're going to take a
look at transformers battle tactics the
Transformers battle tactics is a PvP
battle game where you assemble a group
of transformers and Duke it out against
other people live to see who has the
better team this title is unique because
you can use both Autobots and
Decepticons together in your team and
the entire game takes place online in
PvP battles here's how the game works
there are various parts of the menu that
do various things using the menu you can
manage abilities your team enter into
the chat room obtain out of battle drops
the settings and once you join one you
can check out your League there and have
a dedicated League chat should you want
to use it this is also how you engage in
battles which we'll get to in a second
during battles you earn resources that
you can use to repair upgrade and
recruit other characters that you
gradually unlock as you level up if you
want to go a bit faster you can use
coins that you gradually earn or you can
buy them using real-world money I know
not a lot of people like this paradigm
but take it from me you can still enjoy
the game without them
everything else is frosting on the cake
the global chat lets you talk to people
and leagues allow you to join up with
friends or strangers on the web to gain
additional advantages there is also a
section where you can get free resources
through drops the game gives you two
different ones that you can use at
various time intervals or you can buy
more with coins okay folks let's get
into the meat and potatoes of this game
which are the battles of the characters
and the abilities to engage in battle
you have to use Energon which is the
game's energy counter if you have no
Energon you can't battle and you must
wait for some to be replenished all
battles are played against real-life
opponents with no exceptions
truth be told some battles you'll
absolutely dominate and others you'll be
totally dominated but in the battles I
took part in the vast majority were
decided on tactics with a little bit of
luck thrown in every round a coin flip
decides who gets to go first as far as I
can tell it is totally randomized and
you can increase your chances with buffs
although the advantages really aren't
that big there were rounds where I got
first strike every round and there were
rounds where I got none at all so at
least it's mostly fair from there your
team attacks the opposing team and vice
versa and this continues however long it
takes before someone wins opponents can
also back out resulting in an instant
victory for you when you defeat bad guys
individually you get a few resources and
when you
you get additional bonuses if you lose
you still walk away with something but
it's not totally worthless you can also
obtain various buffs depending on a
number of factors most playable
characters have passive abilities that
grants individual buffs you can also
assemble teams of certain playable
characters and earn team bonuses that
way in battle you can combine the powers
of certain transformers to create much
more powerful attacks as you progress
you'll level up your profile as you
level up your profile you'll have the
ability to recruit new playable
characters unlock new abilities and
otherwise progress through the game the
last thing I'll talk about are the
abilities they can range from reroll in
your damage to targeting a specific
opponents and there are abilities that
add buffs damage opponents directly and
do all kinds of other stuff you can
equip for at once and every round in
battle gives you three ability points
that you can dump into these abilities
to try to earn an advantage in battle ok
so here's what we liked about the game
it's a really good mixture of a serious
game and a time waster battles are only
about 5 minutes each so it doesn't
require a huge time commitment to play
on the flipside the leveling up
unlockable content and leagues offer a
surprisingly good depth that gives the
game longevity you have access to
literally all of your favorite autobot
and decepticon characters you can mix
and match or form teams based on who you
like and I thought it was nice you don't
have to pick sides this time just
assemble a team of your favorites and go
nuts the game is very liberal with
bonuses you get at least two free prize
drops per day and you get Energon points
for doing practically anything within my
first hour I was able to recruit Optimus
Prime twice and unlock four other
additional characters along with three
additional abilities yes there are a few
walls like running out of energy and
there's no getting around that fact but
it definitely handles these walls far
better than most the gameplay mechanics
menus and general game actions are
simple to understand there isn't much of
a learning curve to do anything here and
that makes the game very accessible for
casual gamers kids and pretty much
everyone else transformers battle
tactics encourages people to play in
leagues by throwing large league events
unlike most games where only the top 10
or so guilds actually win anything this
game gives rewards to the top 30,000
leagues which means practically everyone
in the league gets something like I said
earlier this game is very gratuitous
with stuff
there aren't any Google Play game
services which sucks but you can still
manage to have a cloud save it's not
super flexible but if you're upgrading
your device or you want to play on your
tab
also there is a built-in way to do that
and we appreciate it
lastly the game currently has over a
million downloads tens of thousands of
leagues and hundreds of thousands of
active players that means battles are
generally easy to find and there is for
now at least a healthy player base to
enjoy it with and here are a few things
that we didn't like so much yes there
could have been a short campaign mode
the tutorial was good enough to learn
the basics but it would have been nice
to go on a few missions to earn a little
bit of resources before being thrown
into the wolves it's not that big of a
deal because the matchmaking isn't bad
by any means but still more content is
better the game did experience some
early release issues most notably there
were some connection problems that many
people experienced over the course of my
review I did about 45 battles in total
and I was never disconnected so I think
they've pretty much fixed all of it if
you pick it up and you experience the
issue rest assured that they're most
likely working on fixing it overall this
is a solid game the mixture of quick
playing with the deep level growth as a
paradigm I wish more simple games to
pursue and this one did it about as well
as you can do it there is a surprising
amount of content for a game that touts
only live PvP battles and fans of the
Transformers will most likely have a
positive experience there are a few
issues here and there but these are
minor details and most of them have
already been fixed the game is free with
in-app purchases and it's less than 50
megabytes so you won't lose anything by
trying it out we'll have the download
link in the video description below so
you can give it a shot and that about
does it for this video folks don't
forget to subscribe to the YouTube
channel if you haven't already and
really check out the game because it is
pretty good as always thanks for
watching everybody and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
