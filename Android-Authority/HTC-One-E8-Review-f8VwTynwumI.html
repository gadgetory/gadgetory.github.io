phones of 2014 because it aspects the
great screen and also the metallic build
what if I took this metallic build and
put it into something plastic to make it
cheaper and to make it more affordable
for everyone around the world well
that's what HTC did with the HTC 8 I'm
Kevin the tech ninja and this is my
review if you're expecting an overhaul
and design with the e 8 versus the m8
then you'd be disappointed the EA
retains most other qualities that may
the m8 such a well designed device the
first thing you notice is that the
device is not aluminium it's using a
polycarbonate material instead there's a
gloss version and also a matte version
my review model is of the matte variety
with gold trimming the material is
smooth but yet grippy although many will
welcome this change the one drawback is
that the material attracts fingerprints
you spend a lot of your time wiping the
back of the device if fingerprints
bother you the back is where you'll find
the exit colors this device has gold
trim around the camera flash and also
the HTC logo it's a subtle hints of
color that works really well we're the
bottom of the eh you'd find the
headphone jack and also the USB charging
port the stealthy designed volume rocker
is located on the right bezel and also
we have the dual SIM slot to the left
bezel you'll find the micro SD card slot
and just like to do a sim slot this
blends into the device and is very
unobtrusive HTC is known for their boom
sound speakers and the e8 does not
disappoint the dual speakers on the
front are still the best on mobile they
are loud clear and even basic HTC heard
our complaints about the location of the
power button although I'm not really
sure they understood our complaints
since this time with the EA they made it
even harder to reach it's still located
on the top bezel but now it's moved
towards
middle get into the power button becomes
a frustrating process and it requires
precise hand adjustments to even reach
it thankfully HTC kept the gestures from
the inmate to leave some of his pain the
e8 packs a 5 inch IPS LCD the 1080p
display is bright crisp and vivid the
saturation levels to me seem a bit
overkill for example sometimes Reds can
look a bit orange the blacks are very
deep in color and unlike other devices
using LCD technology gray and black are
visibly
two separate colors the 441 PPI makes
the text pop and it's very easy to read
when it comes to the spec department the
ei8 is no slouch just like it's a
bloomin twin it has the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 801 now depending on your
region it could clock in at 2.3 or 2.5
gigahertz multitasking shouldn't be an
issue with the included 2 gigabytes of
RAM 16 gigabytes of on-board storage
plus it's expandable with a micro SD
card the battery is a 2600 milliamp
which is smaller than a lot of other
newer flagship devices but as we all are
starting to learn that milliamps isn't
the end-all be-all for battery longevity
in my normal day usage with a little
less than 2 hours of screen on time
Bluetooth connected to Android wear and
also between 4G and Wi-Fi I get around
16 hours the software is unchanged from
the m8 it's running Android KitKat 4.2.2
and also since 6 since has been covered
in our m8 coverage but I'll touch on a
few features here my favourite feature
is just one swipe from the homescreen
it's called blinkfeed this is a social
aggregator that grabs an information
from accounts you've connected the usual
suspects like Google Plus Facebook and
Twitter can all be connected this is
HTC's take on Flipboard with a metro
esque design angle and it actually works
pretty good for your camera lovers out
there Zoe is HTC's picture software this
allows you to get pretty creative with
your photos by adding effects filters
and even animation you can then easily
send these creations to other people to
view or show them around the world
looking at the specs the performance
section will pretty much create its own
dialogue
the Snapdragon 801 processor is a
fantastic chip it handles the day-to-day
tasks with relative ease the two
gigabytes of RAM lets you multitask
quickly and gives your device a sense of
fluidity the GPU gives the e8 a nice
boost when it comes to game the e8 has
the adrenal 330 installed every game
I've thrown it thus far runs just fine
now compared to other flagship devices
performance does not vary you get
consistent FPS and also fast load times
I'm not a big fan of benchmarks as they
do not provide a true insight for
day-to-day use however I did run a
benchmark just to see its core and it
comes in at 37,000 461 on antutu
benchmark software reception and call
quality was pretty good my signal
strength was exactly the same compared
to other phones that I have one of the
most requested changes from the m8 and
even the m7 was the camera
HTC took the old camera and gave it a
megapixel boost from 4 to 13 I wish I
could tell you that it makes the images
look better but the images come out
pretty much the same the images have a
washed out and hazy look to them and
low-light images are grainy and lack
detail it takes three to four shots
while angling your camera to find some
decent light to take some good images
the front-facing camera is a selling
point of the EA but still provides a
lackluster performance the best way to
get an image is sadly throwing a filter
over to hide its imperfections there you
