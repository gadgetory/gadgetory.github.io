authority this is the Moto e 4 it's
available right now with Verizon
Wireless and you might call me crazy but
this is a $70 smart phone so yeah we're
talking about a brand new phone that's
priced at $70 right out of the gate and
you guys are familiar with the Moto e
line they've always been known for being
very aggressive in terms of pricing so
there's not really a whole lot surprise
here but what's more important is that
it passed that $100 threshold so now
it's below that at 70 bucks when your
price is low you really can't expect
much with the design it's kind of
typical the other handsets in Moto's
lineup like the Moto G series so it's
made of all plastic and you have this
textured pattern on the back it feels
lightweight and it doesn't scream
premium or style in any way but of
course that's not the intent but what
I'd like to note here that it does
feature a 13 1/2 millimeter headset jack
it has expandable storage there's even a
front-facing LED flash and yes a
fingerprint sensor and that's especially
noteworthy because at this price point
it's very unheard of to find the 5 inch
720p display it looks decent when you
look at it straight on the resolution is
ample enough to read fine text and
whatnot but the colors do seem a little
bit washed out and the viewing angles
are kind of poor especially at wide
angles it tends to distort a lot but
again that's what you kind of expect
it's running Android 7.1 nougat and it's
nice that they've thrown in some of the
typical moto experiences like moto
display so when the phone's off it'll
breathe some useful information like the
time date and battery level so you're
not constantly turning on the phone and
it's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon
425 chip with 2 gigabytes of RAM nothing
to gloat about but at least they'll
handle some basic operations with no
issues whatsoever just don't expect to
be playing a lot of games with this one
and finally the camera in the backs an 8
megapixel camera it has an LED flash it
uses a four piece composite lens and it
tops out at 1080p with its video capture
so it's there for the convenience
I'm not expecting it to take the best
shots but if you need to take something
it's there for you seriously if you're
looking for a temporary phone this is a
good thing to think about because you're
not going to spend a whole lot of money
70 bucks is nothing compared to two
hundred four hundred or even five
hundred dollars and honestly it can
still do the same things as most
high-end smartphones but probably at a
slower pace the design is not all that
appealing but again that's what you get
for $70 so if you guys want to learn
