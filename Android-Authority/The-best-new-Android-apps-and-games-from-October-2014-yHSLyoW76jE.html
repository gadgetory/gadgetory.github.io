Hindy the android authority app guy
we're into November now and it's time to
wrap up the best applications that were
released in october of 2014 first up is
camera 51 this unique camera application
is for those out there who may not be
the best photographers it uses a
built-in algorithm that helps people
take pictures better by suggesting where
they should hold the camera when they
hit the shutter button it does use quite
a bit of CPU because it is making a lot
of computations and it's not recommended
if you have an older or lower end device
it is free with no in-app purchases and
that's always good news too dj2 is
already intensely popular on iOS and
it's finally been released on Android as
well it comes with a lot of features and
it's actually quite a bit of fun to use
there is also Spotify support if you use
that and it's 299 with no in-app
purchases some reviewers have commented
that they wish there were more features
so it may not be the best tool for
professionals but for average people
it's more than they had before Square
Enix has been borderline ferocious when
it comes to be releasing their old
library on Android one such example is
Dragon Quest 2 which was released
earlier this month it's a JRPG
originally released by enochs back
before they merged with Squaresoft it
has charming retro graphics and one of
the more reasonable price tags for a
square enix title on Android if you're a
fan of old-school JRPGs then you'll
definitely want to check this one out
and possibly even their other Dragon
Quest re-releases EES chromecast plugin
is a free plugin in the Google Play
Store that grants chromecast supports to
the venerable ES file explorer it's a
very simple process you just download
and install the plug-in through the
google play store and you'll magically
have chromecast supports in the regular
ES File Explorer app if you use ES and
you have a chromecast you should
definitely have this one installed it's
true that inbox by Gmail is still invite
only but invites seem to be getting
handed out at an ever increasing rate so
it won't be long before everyone who
wants one has one Google's latest take
on email is definitely unique and so far
has had polarizing reviews some think
it's too cluttered and busy while others
love the redesign and functionality is
too soon to tell if it's going to be
awesome or a bust but for right now it's
pretty awesome journey and notes is one
of two applications released by
Microsoft this last month this one is a
social media application that's kind of
like Foursquare but focuses on the
journey instead of the destined
pation like if you were going from the
store to the post office you could check
in that you're making that trip with
your preferred mode of transportation
then other people who take that same
trip can see any tips or comments that
you've made it's not all that much yet
but it looks like it could be a lot of
fun some day and it's free so it doesn't
hurt to check it out material wallpapers
is a simple little application that
gives you material design inspired
wallpapers and a few official wallpapers
from lollipop and the nexus 6 it's free
with no in-app purchases so the lack of
content shouldn't make anyone too mad
there isn't much else to say about it if
you're looking for some material
inspired wallpapers then give this one a
download the other Microsoft Application
released this month is next lockscreen
it appears over the stock android lock
screen and it's kind of like microsoft
take on the dash clock widget it's
fairly functional but there are a few
things missing here and there that will
probably be fixed and improved in future
updates it is free with no in-app
purchases so it doesn't cost you
anything to check it out don't forget
that microsoft also did an Android wear
app this month called torque and that
was also pretty fun maybe hl2 k was
released by 2k games this last month and
it's probably the most complete hockey
game available right now it's a little
expensive and there are n app purchases
but hockey fans don't really have any
other solid options when it comes to a
hockey experience on Android there are
several game modes including a couple of
fast play arcade modes and a career mode
it also features updated rosters which
is a must for a sports game nudie widget
is a fun application that helps you use
notifications on virtually any screen on
your device there is a widget that can
be placed on any home screen as well as
the lock screen which helps mimic
android lollipop functionality there is
also a daydream mode so you can check
notifications there as well the
developer has been quite active in
fixing bugs and making it more solid and
so far the general consensus is that
this app is pretty awesome also a dollar
26 isn't that bad of a price brady
contact list is an attempted free design
of the contacts app and dialer app it
features some pleasant visuals some
interesting features and even themes if
you get the pro version through in-app
purchases you can even do things like
check your email between you and one of
your contacts while you wait for them to
pick up the phone and you have options
to further engage with contacts after
you hang up the phone it's free to use
so there's no harm in checking it out
Republic is a new game out this month
and it's probably the best one on this
list it features very impressive
graphics and gameplay mechanics as well
as a genuinely interesting storyline it
uses the walking dead style episodes so
you'll get the first episode when you
download the app and then you'll have to
buy episode 2 2 and 3 as in-app
purchases so far people seem to really
like it and it's made by the same people
who worked on titles like Metal Gear
Solid halo and fear it looks very
impressive and it's worth a second look
some sad news earlier this month was
that talent for Twitter reached its
token limit and that no new people could
get it some good news is that the
developers have released a sequel to
talent for Twitter and it's called a
talent for Twitter Plus this version is
for devices running lollipop only
because it has a lot of material design
and android 5.0 that isn't backwards
compatible once you get android lollipop
and you start looking for our twitter
client keep talent for twitter plus in
mind because it's pretty good once again
