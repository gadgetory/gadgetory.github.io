andrew authority Here I am
at CES 2019 and I wanted to give you a
brief overview of what I've seen in
terms of televisions here at the world's
largest consumer show so if you want to
find out more please let me explain
there are several different keywords
that have popped up here at CES 2019 the
first of those is 8k and the upcoming
Olympics we're going to have
broadcasting in 8k and here I've seen
several different manufacturers
producing 8k televisions or they're
showing prototypes of 8k televisions and
if you were following me on Instagram
you would have seen that actually I had
a quick picture there of Samsung's 8k
television which you can buy for just
fifteen thousand dollars now obviously
in years to come the price is going to
come down just like it did with 4k just
like anything with HD but we really are
now on the edge of 8k and 8k is here by
all of the major manufacturers and the
other big key word of course is AI
everyone seems to be building either
Google assistant or Alexa into their
televisions the idea being it becomes
the home hub you can talk to the
television you can take to play movies
you can take the play things like on
Netflix you can connect to control the
lights and it's all built into your
television and it can actually enhance
the smart home experience because often
the television is in the center of a
house maybe in the lounge and of course
it's there ready to receive all of your
commands of course AI isn't only limited
to voice assistance they're also using
AI in both sound processing and audio
processing to give you the best picture
for example you can use tone mapping I
saw that on one of the televisions by LG
that takes in to account the ambient
light in the room that you're in and
then changes the picture so that you can
see the details in areas that maybe
would seem too dark in the ambient light
that you are watching the the program or
the film and then a couple other things
to mention are refresh rates lots lots
of changes around refresh rate
particularly when it comes to laptops
and gaming so in those curved displays
people are wanting to bump up the
refresh rate so that you can get better
gaming experiences and that also folds
in to HDMI 2.1 which gives
that extra level of control between the
displaying device and the display so
they can negotiate the best refresh rate
for the experience that you are having
and for me the most interesting thing
that I saw was LG's transparent OLED
display so here is a short video I did
it on my phone so the quality's not that
good
but as you can see here the actual
display can be made transparent and that
chip that you're seeing that picture of
the tribulation behind the display and
when it can show a picture and then it
can go transparent to think about the
future where we can actually have TVs in
our windows we can display either films
or programs but also just nature scenes
and then you can change it and make the
display go transparent so you can see
outside there are also other
applications heads-up displays cars when
we've got all self-driving cars then
actually have the windows act also as
displays but also have them transparent
there's so many different possibilities
that was a prototype they were showing
there and I thought that was really
interesting and of course while we're
talking about LG one of the big things
here of course has been their rollable
TV that can roll right back down into a
small box at the bottom and then you can
kind of press a button and bring it back
up and there you have a rollable TV in
your lounge very very cool stuff okay my
name is Gary Sims this is Andrew
authority I really hope you enjoyed this
video please subscribe please like and
well that's it I'll see the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
