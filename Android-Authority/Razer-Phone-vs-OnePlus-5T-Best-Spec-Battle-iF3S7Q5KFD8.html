game putting some of the best
combinations of specs and features
together in this incredibly busy
smartphone year but only a few
smartphones in 2017 actually went above
and beyond in terms of their spec sheets
two of them are what we're looking at
right now and they're both available in
the West a is jaja Vergara what's going
on everybody and this is the razor phone
versus the 1 + 5 t both phones take very
different approaches to design with the
razor phone basically resurrecting the
aesthetic of the next bit Robin and then
putting a coat of razor paint on top the
result is a matte black slate with sharp
corners and flat sides all around aside
from the sheer size of the phone which
doesn't really lend itself to the best
one-handed usage it's hard not to like
the blocky form factor that we don't
really see a whole lot of these days but
that is where the 1 + 5 t comes in the
middle slab that updates the continued
design language started in the 1 + 3
smooth metals what you get here but with
a smaller and more accessible size than
its competitor oneplus continues to put
as much as it can including a headphone
jack in a phone that is delightfully
thin other features like the alert
slider return though the fingerprint
reader has been moved to the back for a
more accessible reach it's kind of funny
to see these two phones go head-to-head
in terms of design because they're so
different the 1 + 5 t feels familiar and
now is even more familiar because of the
position of the fingerprint reader the
razor phone is also familiar because of
an old design that we did like from the
next bit Robin but aside from the
handling the phone is really
eye-catching especially because of that
Razer logo prominently shown on the back
part of the handling experiences due to
the screens and the 1 plus 5t rocks an
18 by 9 Full HD AMOLED screen across its
entire front 1 + did well to remove the
front-facing home button and fingerprint
reader and move it to the back
effectively making the entire front
basically all screen all the time there
are a few extra display features that
really add to this appeal one feature
being the reading mode which allows for
an almost Kindle like experience when
reading things like websites and even
Kindle e-books none of those extra
features make it onto the razor phone's
IPS quad HD 16 by 9 display but razor
was not to be outdone taking inspiration
from their laptop screens they put on a
ultra motion capable display that
provides 120 Hertz refresh rates that
are synced up with the GPU what that
means is no matter what
content you're viewing on this phone it
will always be performing in its
smoothest and most beautiful fashion
it's easy to see the enhancements when
this phone is put up against another
phone screen and in this comparison the
razor phone just feels and looks
smoother there are some qualms to the
razor phone's display it doesn't get as
bright as we feel it should at 100%
brightness and its color reproduction is
lacking compared to the AMOLED screen of
the 1+5 teeth but ultra motion is
something that we're hoping to see in
more phones moving forward and we think
razor may have started a trend here so
up until this point you have some very
different features between these two
devices but once you get down to the
spec sheet and you get underneath the
surface these phones show that they are
the most powerful ones in the game right
now you have the Snapdragon 835 and
eight gigabytes of RAM on both of these
devices and it is really only the
storage that is different between the
two because the razor phone rocking 64
gigabytes of on-board storage can use a
micro SD card this is contrary to the 1
plus 5 T which can come in a 128
gigabyte configuration if you pay a
little bit of extra money so there
really isn't a lack of power or
performance in either of these devices
as a matter of fact the razor phone
actually gives you the power to dial it
down a little bit in the game booster
you can change the clock speed of the
processor and even show what the frame
rate will be when you're playing
particular games that way you can get
more battery life out of the razor phone
then if you are just going at a full
clip all the time and razor also tried
really hard in the hardware front when
it comes to sound sound is a bit of a
give-and-take between these two phones
however as the 1 + 5 t does keep a
headphone jack while the razor phone
puts it in an adapter but that adapter
has a 24 bit DAC installed that makes
good headphones sound awesome
and then the front-facing speakers of
the razor phone are heads and shoulders
better than the one found on the 1 + 5 t
they get incredibly loud are certified
by dolby atmos and it actually can
replace small bluetooth speakers that
you might already have by having the
razor phone you can actually leave that
Bluetooth speaker behind so finally we
can talk about cameras and the razor
phone has been well-documented to have
some issues when it comes to its cameras
you have dual 12 megapixel cameras here
on the rear where one of them is a
telephoto lens at F 2.6 and the regular
lens is at F 1.8 now the razor phone did
get an update since our review and it
mainly added
an indicator to show which lens you are
using as far as picture quality goes
which we'll get to in a second there
have been a few improvements but without
adding actual features to the software
Suites it still pales in comparison to
what is provided in the 1 plus 5t the 1
plus 5t went a different route it still
has dual cameras on the back but one is
a 16 megapixel lens and the other is 20
megapixels and together they are
supposed to provide sharp photos and
good low-light performance one feather
in the cap of the 1 + 5 T is at 16
megapixel front-facing camera which is a
lot more powerful than the one found on
the razor phone it also provides face on
lock which is a new method of unlocking
the phone by which you can just turn on
the device by pressing the power button
and if it recognizes your face in any of
its frame then it will unlock
immediately the razor phone
unfortunately does not have any of these
modes or capabilities and as far as the
update that recently came out for it
shows picture quality has only gotten a
slight boost just like in our review the
camera continues to be a bit slow
especially with shutter lag during HDR
shooting which is really annoying never
mind the fact that the camera tends to
overexpose when HDR's off which means
you have to fiddle with the exposure
compensation pretty often but when
you're shooting in HDR the shutter has
to be open for so long to take all of
the photos for the high dynamic range
photo that you have to be as steady as
possible even in good lighting
situations that little bit of time and
even just a tiny bit of shake could
yield a blurry photo
this gets immensely worse in low-light
situations where the shutter might be
open for up to 2 or 3 seconds the razor
phone is a first attempt at a camera
that still needs a lot of extra baking
and hopefully future versions of the
razor phone will greatly improve on what
we see right now even after the update
and finally in software we have a couple
of different ways of looking at Android
oneplus has really matured oxygen OS
into something that actually stands
alone oxygen OS has its own flair it has
even its own font and it has its shelf
which is a different way of putting all
of your widgets together so that they
don't take up all of the home screens
and overall oneplus does well to keep
things Spartan but still unique and
personal and most importantly smooth but
personalization is a high point in the
razor phone thanks to their partnership
with a well known and very popular
third-party launcher Nova Nova Launcher
prime is included on the phone which
provides a ton of possibilities for
customization in the interface icons
swipe
gestures even icon grid sizes so you can
actually change the look of the UI to
whatever you want it to be and even have
it function in different ways Razer
keeps everything else pretty stock just
with the splash of Razer green thrown on
top so in the end these two powerhouse
phones really showed different
philosophies in the Android flagship
space either you really kill it in one
particular niche or you try to provide
the best in every manner possible what's
so interesting about this comparison is
that the 1 + 5 team manages to check so
many boxes while still undercutting its
competition by about a hundred dollars
the Razer phone is an exceptional device
don't get us wrong and it looks a
different operates beautifully through
its ultra motion display and sounds
better than most thanks to the Dolby
Atmos enhancements in both the speakers
and the deck enabled headphone jack
adapter now the camera is the deepest
point of contention when it comes to the
Razer phone and even though Razer plans
on putting so many updates out there in
order for the experience to get better
unfortunately the first attempt doesn't
seem to have done much so we'll see what
happens more in the future but until
then if camera is something you really
want this phone simply does not hold a
candle to the 1 + 5 t and plenty of the
other competition does the camera
experience actually means so much to you
that it would be the deal breaker on the
Razer phone or is ultra motion that
enticing and is the media consumption
experience something you would really
want and thus you might want to go for
the Razer phone let us know what you
would pick in the comments below and
remember to stay tuned to android
authority as we are headed to CES in
just a couple of weeks stay tuned to
this channel for all of that coverage
and even more because we are of course
