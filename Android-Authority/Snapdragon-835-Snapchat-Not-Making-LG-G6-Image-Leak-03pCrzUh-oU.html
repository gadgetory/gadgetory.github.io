me a moment
Trump's the porting Joe alright I
promise no more politics but let's get
to the new features promised in these
Snapdragon 805 Qualcomm Snapdragon 835
system a chip is expected to be in a
number of premium phones this year
including a new HTC flagship and the
Samsung Galaxy s8 upon its arrival
Qualcomm has outlined some of the photo
and video features that the chip will
offer namely optical and digital zoom
Qualcomm claims to have made significant
improvements in this regard and I quote
the Snapdragon 835 processor is designed
to address the graininess problem by
intelligently combining optical and
digital zooms so photos can be smooth
seamless and lossless unquote further
Qualcomm notes that the Snapdragon 835
will offer superior zoom performance in
videos too but autofocus is another area
Qualcomm has focused with the Snapdragon
835 chip the goal and I quote is to
build a truly effective autofocus and
help shutter bugs capture even the
fastest moving moments said Qualcomm so
all good news for Qualcomm this week not
so good news for snapchat because after
their IPO was revealed how they're
making money and they're not in its
filing earlier this week with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission
snapchat said it currently had a hundred
and fifty million people using snapchat
on a daily basis and that over 2.5
billion snaps were created every day it
had just 58 million in revenue in 2015
but it greatly improved those numbers to
four hundred four million in 2016 the
bad news the company is not yet
profitable in fact it lost a whopping
five hundred and fourteen million just
last year ok so my take is that snapchat
is an innovative company that really has
the pulse of how young people want to
use their devices but it is not an ad
platform or it's certainly not very good
one everyone wants to be an ad platform
because there's hundreds of billions of
dollars to be made in ad revenue but not
every platform is geared to that
do a snapchat have a pre-roll mid-roll
post roll ad that interrupts young
people's content on snapchat
they hate that I know from personal
experience Twitter for example Twitter
could have been a you know five hundred
million dollar company if they had had a
a subscription model right so you have a
free based set of features on Twitter
and then for power users you pay a few
bucks a month to have power tools within
the Twitter platform that would have
been great it wouldn't have made fifty
billion dollars a year but it would have
been a sustainable profitable business
but no there had to be an ad revenue
based company so snapchat has learned
from this and what they're trying to do
is build hardware to integrate into
these snapchat features I'm not very
hopeful I am not I hope I'm wrong what
do you guys think let me know in the
comments below now we couldn't finish
off today's show without talking about a
photo that we found on the LG G six and
it's the back this image here comes from
an unnamed source who sent it to
Business Insider it shows a dual camera
set up along with a fingerprint sensor
right below the cameras it also seems to
show that the case will have a shiny
glass back which again is consistent
with previous rumors some of the phones
back is obscured by the fingers of the
person who took the photo most likely to
cover up any identification markings
that could link this phone to whomever
have got their hands on it LG is
expected to hold a press conference in
Barcelona Spain on February 26 the day
before the official start of the 2017
Mobile World Congress it's likely that
the LG G 6 will be the star of this
media event the company has already
confirmed that the display of the g6
will feature a 5.7 inch qHD screen with
an 18 9 aspect ratio with other on
confirm rumors claiming that it will be
the first third-party smartphone that
will feature the Google assistant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
