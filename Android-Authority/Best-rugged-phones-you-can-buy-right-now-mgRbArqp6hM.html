need some serious ruggedness I got your
back and first up let's talk in
caterpillar and caterpillar is best
known for their huge construction
vehicles and machines but they're also
using their brand for a series of rugged
phones
the caterpillar cat s60 is the most
recent release and it has at least one
cool feature that you won't find in any
other smartphone rugged or not the
feature is the Fleur thermal imaging
camera designed to show heat that
radiates out from locations that is
normally invisible to the naked eye the
camera on the cat s60 can be used by
building inspectors to find if any heat
is being lost around windows or doors
you can also discover if an appliance
like a washing machine or oven is
overheating you can also find if any
moisture is building up in the house
where it is not supposed to be it's kind
of like the Predators heat vision but in
the real world in terms of specs the cat
s60 has a 4.7 inch 720p display it runs
Android 6.0 marshmallow
it has Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 processor
running at 1.5 gigahertz along with
three gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage a standard 13 megapixel
rear cam and a 5 megapixel front facing
shooter it also has a large 3080
milliamp hour battery now this phone is
so rugged that it can survive and work
in up to 5 meters of water for up to 60
minutes if you choose to use the
lockdown switch it can also survive a
fall from 1.8 meters or just shy of 6
feet and is reportedly impervious to
dust you can get the cat s60 from Amazon
right now for about six hundred and
twenty-five dollars
be aware though it only works on gsm
networks like AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile but if
your budget is a little bit less you may
want to consider the cat s 40 the cat s
40 is a rugged phone for people who want
to own such a device but is priced less
than the s60 the cat s 40 does not have
the fancy thermal imaging camera on the
back like the s60 model does the S 40
phone has a 4.7 inch display but it's
resolution is down to just 540 by
960 it also comes with older Android 5.1
lollipop pre-installed some other specs
include a snapdragon 210 processor
running 1.1 gigahertz along with 1
gigabyte of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
on-board storage it has an 8 megapixel
rear cam and a 2 megapixel front facing
shooter and a 3000 milliamp hour battery
like the s60 the cat s40 is impervious
to dust and is designed to fall to up to
1.8 meters or just shy of 6 feet
however the waterproofing features is
not quite as strong it can keep
operating in under 1 meter of water for
up to 60 minutes the price of the cat s
40 is currently listed at $329 on Amazon
again this phone is limited to gsm-based
cell networks but of course if you have
to tighten your belt even more consider
this and I'm talking about the Lulla
phone Armour it's a rugged phone that's
priced even less than the cat phones at
$219 on Amazon it actually has some
decent specs for the price starting with
a 4.7 inch screen and a display
resolution of 1280 by 720 it comes with
Android 6.0 marshmallow right out of the
box and inside it has an octa-core
MediaTek mt6752 processor running at one
point 3 gigahertz along with 3 gigabytes
of RAM and 32 gigabytes of on-board
storage it also has a 13 megapixel rear
camera and a 5 megapixel front facing
camera with a 3500 million power battery
in terms of how solid the phone is the
ELA phone armor are supposed to be
matched with an IP 68 waterproof
standards which means it should work and
up to 1.2 meters of water for up to 30
minutes in fact the company claims its
own tests show that the phone can go
even deeper water for up to 1.5 meters
and keep working for 30 minutes as the
caterpillar phones the EULA phone armor
can only work on gsm based networks but
some of you may be thinking Jace I'm on
Verizon and I need a rugged option I
gotcha I can't pronounce it but I'm just
gonna call it the Brigadier from Verizon
you see the previous three phones on the
list cannot work with the us's biggest
carrier Verizon however the Brigadier is
one of the few rugged phones that can
access
Raisa Network you can also get this
phone for cheap right now on Amazon for
a hundred and sixty nine dollars without
a contract however be prepared for some
lower end hardware and software starting
with Android KitKat at 4.4 right out of
the box it also has a 4.5 inch display
and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor
running one point four gigahertz and two
gigabytes of RAM 16 gigabytes of
on-board storage and eight megapixel
rear cam and a 2 megapixel front facing
camera the phone also has a 3100
milliamp hour battery the phone can
continue operating for up to 30 minutes
and 6 feet of water and has an IP 68
certification for dust and drops while
the Brigadier lacks some errors in terms
of hardware it can still take a beating
best of all it works on the verizon
network and no I have not forgotten the
s8 active the Samsung Galaxy s8 active
is the more rugged version of the
company's current flagship phone the
Galaxy s8 the phone has a metal frame
and bumper and meets military
specifications which means that the s8
active is supposed to be shatter
resistant dust and water resistant in
the latter case the phone can still work
even when it is submerged and up to 1.5
meters of water for 30 minutes because
of its rugged frame the Galaxy s8 active
does not technically have a nearly bezel
as free infinity display like the
standard Galaxy s8 but it still has a
5.8 inch Super AMOLED screen with
Gorilla Glass 5 and a resolution of 2560
by 1440 it comes with meteor gray and
titanium gold colors inside the s8
active has a speedy Qualcomm Snapdragon
835 processor 4 gigabytes of RAM 6 to 4
gigabytes of on-board storage a 12
megapixel rear camera and an 8 megapixel
front facing shooter the biggest
Hardware difference is with the battery
the s8 active has a four thousand
milliamp hour battery compared to a
three thousand milliamp hour battery
found on the standard galaxy s 8 I'm
curious to know how many of you out

don't mean like an otter case I mean
