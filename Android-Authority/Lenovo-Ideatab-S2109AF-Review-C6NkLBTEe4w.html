Youngberg coming at you from your number
one source for all things Android
Android authority comm today we're going
to be going over the Lenovo idea tab
now this Pacific model of the idea tab
is the s20 109a this is a pretty good
tablet I've had in my possession for
about a week and a half now and I've got
a good chance to go over everything you
know just basically go in and out of the
tablet see what I like and dislike and
so I'm just going to show you some of
its features its build quality and then
it's a software performance so anyways
let's just get into specs as we look
over the body you can see we have our
power button right here a nice little
red accent in there we can easily just
press that we've got our volume rocker
here goes up to the left and down to the
right and a small microphone there you
have some cool audio features on this
tablet this has a genuine SRS audio we
have two speakers here and then two
right here as well I did find that these
sometimes were covered up by your hands
if you're holding the tablet in
landscape mode though anyways also we
have our mic over here okay so we've got
a mini SD slot we've got a mini HDMI
port we've got a micro SD which I you
can charge from and then we actually
have a AC adapter charger port there and
that's how they want you to charge the
tablet so anyways let's just power this
on here we'll turn on the device as you
can see we do have our basic Ice Cream
Sandwich lock screen this is running the
Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich
software you know the Ice Cream Sandwich
software is powered by a one gigahertz
dual-core TI OMAP 4460 tab first
generation we do have one gigabyte of
RAM though which is basically the gold
standard these days our display is a
nine point seven inch TFT else
d-does have IPS so it has in plane
switching the liquid crystal and display
for optimal viewing angles i found this
device to have a really reflective
display though it was almost sometimes
not usable during the day just because
of how reflective it was I'd see like
everything behind me
if anyways it does well if you have the
brightness all the way up does have the
auto brightness feature right here but I
you I usually like to turn mine all the
way up so anyways on the front right
here we've got a 1.3 megapixel HD
front-facing camera and you know it's
basically a good tablet it does have a
little bit of some build quality issues
as you can see here the edges of the
tablet just don't really you know fit
perfect you can kind of pull those down
with any amount of force but then again
no one's really going to be doing that
so their tablet it's just a build
quality aspect I noticed so anyways
let's go into our app tray here of
course it comes pre-loaded with some
fancy lenovo applications such as the
lenovo app shop it does come with
evernote which is third-party it comes
with norton security we've got the Ovoo
app we also have docs to go pre-loaded
of course the movie studio then all of
our google apps like play music we've
also got these sugarsync we have the UI
intro which is basically just a rundown
and it's a little video that comes
pre-loaded on the tablet in order to
just give you the basic rundown on the
tablet as with all Ice Cream Sandwich
tablets we do have our little dock bar
here or status bar and then when we
press the little Settings slider it
comes up with our settings
we've got airplane mode Wi-Fi we can
audit rotate the screen turn the
brightness all the way up we have
notifications and then we can go to our
full settings menu and our full settings
we can enable the SRS sound we can
change the sound options such as the
volumes for all the different things
we've got to display options our storage
battery and apps and then I will just go
ahead and go into our about tablet we
have Android 4.0.4 running of course
with our nice little Easter Egg there
the display does work fine just a bit
reflective for me at time
anyways we have our developer options of
course with all Ice Cream Sandwich
devices we can enable the 2d hardware
acceleration stuff like that when there
are more options we cannot enable
airplane mode now this just operates via
Wi-Fi this is enough for G capable
device sometimes we'll go back and we'll
perform a quadrant test on the TI OMAP
processor here so anyways our device got
a 1943 which is a pretty slow for
today's standards but it is still a very
capable tablet as you can see that's
even below the original Samsung Galaxy
Tab 10.1 just one more thing I noticed
about the tablet complaint wise we're
going to go ahead and go into YouTube
and as you can see the nine point seven
inch display is this sort of an oddball
display there's not many tablets that
are actually of this size so a lot of
the apps developed don't really have the
compatibility as you can see YouTube we
have our video here on the far left
bezel just cut off because of the size
you know I'm sure YouTube thinks this is
probably a 10.1 inch tablet or something
like that but anyway as you can see here
it does have the nice user interface and
just breeze through like that but in the
end it does cut off the video there on
the side so anyways guys if you're
looking for a budget price tablet that
has the power to do a lot of your daily
tasks and it looks nice to go ahead and
check out the lenovo idea tab and also
stay tuned with android authority comm
because we've got plenty more where this
is coming from</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
