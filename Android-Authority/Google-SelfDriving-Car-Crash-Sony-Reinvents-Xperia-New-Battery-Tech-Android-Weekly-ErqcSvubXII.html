self-driving car hit a bus but it was
just kind of a little fender bender on
Valentine's Day February 14th 2016 a
self-driving lexus RX 450h um today
navigate around some sandbags placed in
a wide lane a bus traveling at 15 miles
per hour approached the Google car from
behind occupying the same wide lane as
the smart car the Lexus then attempted
to re-enter the center of the lane while
moving at a speed of 2 miles per hour
Google reported in a statement last week
that the Smart car anticipated that the
bus would slow down to allow the
self-driving car to continue but the bus
did not while the Smart car re-entered
the center of the lane it struck the
side of the bus causing minor damage to
the front left fender front wheel and a
sensor there were no injuries and no
police report was filed now you may be
thinking Jace it's a total non-story
little fender bender why mention it well
I mention it because some people we use
this as proof that if self-driving cars
can make little mistakes they can make
big mistakes leading to loss of innocent
life imagine the news flash in a few
years where some wonderful innocent
child is dead due to a car accident led
by a self-driving car while tragically
that is inevitable it's going to happen
but the reality is it will happen a lot
less with self-driving cars because
computers make fewer computational
errors than we do think about it are you
a Sony Xperia fan like I am well you'll
be happy to know that Sony has launched
what it's calling an evolution of the
Xperia brand the new reimagined brand
hopes to be more than just a smart phone
but a smart connected device capable of
changing the way you interact with the
world the first three phones and the new
x-series are the xperia x the xperia x
performance and the xperia x a the
Xperia X will use the hexa-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 650 processor and the xperia
x performance will use the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 820 the Xperia X and the X
performance will have 5-inch 1080p
displays while the X a
we'll use a five inch 720p display along
with the mediatek mt6752 core cortex a53
processor the xperia x and xperia x
performance includes sony's
next-generation camera technology called
predictive hybrid autofocus developed in
collaboration with sony's camera
engineers it lets you choose your
subject and then predicts its motion so
you can capture the action and perfect
focus without any blur as well as camera
tech sony says that the new x-series has
next-generation battery technology with
Sony's smart battery management which
the company says will deliver up to two
days of battery life when it comes to
design each x-series smartphone has
curved glass display within a rounded
continuous frame while the xperia x a
features an edge to edge display also
the xperia x and xperia x performance
and xperia x a each have a range of
style covers and come in four colors
white graphite black lime gold and rose
gold and for those of you looking for
news regarding the new version of
Android coming up called Android n we
got this in some new mock-ups from the
folks at Android police we get our first
glimpse at what changes it can expect
when Android n rolls around as you can
see the notification shade looks like
it'll provide quite a bit more info per
notification and the height of each
notification has been stretched to
accommodate this and lollipop
notifications on the shade have a card
like feel with gaps of negative space
between each one n looks like it's
filling up these gaps while both have a
very sleek material design look Android
n opts for a lengthly sheet of
contiguous paper over the card layout we
assume they will still be swipeable now
anyone with real geek cred will tell you
that the number one issue we hope
manufacturers improve upon is battery
life and Oppo has heard us at the Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona Opel has
unveiled a new solution to the battery
problem called super vooc flash charge
the technology is still in the early
stages of development but it will
ultimately allow smartphones to reach
100% battery charge in just 15 minutes
the development will inevitably be
limited to Oppo devices however there is
a chance
they could license it for broad usage
from OMS around the world it will be
available in both micro USB and USB
type-c configurations thanks for
watching guys you know the drill you can
connect it in here and also my Android
family right along here I shall see you
next week on Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
