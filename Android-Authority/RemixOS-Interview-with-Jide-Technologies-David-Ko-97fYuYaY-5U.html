what's going on everybody and I'm here
with David Coe with guide technologies
and first question real quick
it's a giant right it's not destroyed
okay we weren't too sure for a second
there because of the way that the
characters are put together so it's a
little bit confusing but yes guide
technologies and it's super exciting
this morning this very morning on the
second day of MWC 2016 Jai Technologies
announced and released rather the beta
of remix OS for PCs so I wanted to sit
down with of course with David and be
able to take a look at some of the
devices including a future tablet that
we did kind of see at CES but we wanted
to talk about the future of remix OS and
where you think that tablet computing in
particular but I'll move into other
areas as well is going based upon what
you guys have done with remix OS so
first of all won't you give us some
information about the beta and sort of
let the people know exactly what to
expect about remix OS and what they can
do with remix OS via the beta sure in
2016 and CES we launched our first alpha
release for Android PC so the
interesting thing is in within a month
we're getting a lot of feedback from our
community so within a month we can
actually quickly adding all the features
that usually request it to into the beta
so I'll name a couple so first of all
they wanted to be installed on the hard
disk instead of a USB Drive okay if they
want ot a updates now that we are
supporting 32 bits as well as you UEFI
as well so that opens up a lot more
compatibility as well so yeah we did get
the the USB thumb drives from CES and a
couple of our guys
Jonathan fights in particular on the
team has been really enjoying remix OS
but from what I gathered at the Qualcomm
booth which is where you guys were
meeting up with me you also have the
tablet obviously so I asked you a little
bit earlier we actually spoke before
this interview about the future of
tablet computing and we use the the
pixel C as an example and you had a lot
of good insight as to why the pixel C
even if the software wallets you sort
say what you said earlier knowing that
the Android space especially the tablet
software is maybe not the best for
productivity at the moment what do you
think that remix OS is going to be able
to bring to the tablet side of things
yeah well I think it's a natural
progression the way that we looked at
the history of Android you look at way
back 19 years ago when they first
launched the g1 yeah it started off as a
cell phone and then tablets TV and then
you see wearable Android auto that's one
thing in common the common thing is
awful consuming content so this is the
one big part of Android now I think it's
a natural progression that you move into
the productivity space you know it's
just consuming content so I predict that
2016 2017 seem to be a big year for
Android going into this space in 2015
Android launched the pixel see the way
that we looked at it and said this is
actually very exciting the way that some
people have criticized pixel see on the
productivity sides are not there yet but
the way that I looked at it is Google is
sending a very clear signal to
developers as well as to the world
saying that we are going into the
prototype space so 2016 we expecting to
be something good coming up from from
Google okay well I love that you say
about the productivity space because
there have been a lot of examples
recently on Android tablets about let's
say the creative side and I know that
Adobe Lightroom was announced yesterday
as well there are also digital digital
drawing applications and whatnot the
main example that I can think of right
now is an iPad pro with the pencil
given--given Android as your back-end
and the way that you're presenting the
workspace with the windows and the
ability to launch multiple windows at
once are you going to be supporting
these types of let's say CAD drawing
applications or let's say it's something
that Windows 10 mobile might be able to
provide on like a surface pro certainly
I think the way that we're seeing in
tablets some of people are saying that
the tablet sells has been dropping
recently but we are we believe that it's
actually the growing sector is the
two-in-one form factor and the larger
screen 10-inch above you can you have
seen that iPad pro you mentioned was a
12 inch tablet and obviously service is
doing well and Google
with XOC so 2016 2017 it's gonna be a
big year for enjoy coming into a larger
screen size so how about certain case
scenarios on remix OS are our
applications like say for for drawing
and for cad drawing and everything like
that or even 3d modeling is android
based on remix always powerful enough to
provide that experience certainly remix
OS has always been focusing on larger
screen tablets larger scene form factors
even pcs so in this kind of scenario
larger screen for productivity is
perfect for larger screen for your pan
drawing multiple windows so we can have
a browser open as well as a drawing
application open
this is actually perfect perfect
scenario okay and obviously we met at a
Qualcomm booth earlier won't you tell us
about your do you guys have a
relationship with Qualcomm now what what
is what is the partnership that you guys
have we have a very close partnership
with Hong Kong
we have built a prototype of the
next-generation tablet using a high-end
call comm chipset as a reference design
so we're looking for sometime this year
we'll be launching something very
exciting okay great and I imagine that
the optimizations behind remix OS will
not really piggyback but rely on let's
say Snapdragon processors and whatnot so
is it different creating the experience
of remix OS for a Snapdragon processor
compared to a PC so are there any
hurdles between the two because I
understand that you want to have the
same remix OS on both experiences the
way that we looked at remix OS is we
fully optimized it for both affordable
low-end devices as well as high-end
obviously if you're using high-end some
of the graphics some of the games will
be smoother but in general for browsing
watching youtube browsing Facebook
Twitter all this for a low and
affordable PC it's completely ok and
with the with the tablet that we've been
talking about and you're seeing some
footage of it right now as I'm gonna
take a look at it a little bit more
later I had a this is I thought that I
had I understand that you're focusing on
the larger screens and whatnot do you
see remix OS moving into a more
our mobile space in terms of let's say
smartphones or do you think are you
thinking of a different form factor at
all but I was thinking like is what a
remix OS smartphone version ever become
a thing for you guys do you think
because the whole because multitasking
in and of itself on an android smart or
any smartphone for that matter sir Tina
so remix always we never limit ourselves
in just one a form factor right now
we're focusing on larger screen
obviously but the key thing is I think
Android has unlimited possibility I
think this is just a very beginning of
Android the key thing about Android is
the ecosystem the ecosystem you can have
apps on your phone can apps on your TV
and have apps on larger screen display
so it's a natural progression for remix
OS to adopt to different form factors ok
and ok so with that with all of that in
mind obviously we're really excited to
see where we make so extreme ixr s goes
and I was playing with the tablet
earlier and it just seems so most
seamless to be able to have a
touchscreen windows like interface that
provides all of that and it it looks it
looks wonderful I was going to say now
you've have now you have the beta hour
what is the next step in your roadmap
for remix OS what can we look forward to
in terms of release and also in terms of
feature sets you know is there anything
else you're going to be bringing out on
the software I think the most important
part is to work closely with our
community one of the key thing about our
companies we're not very traditional we
spend a lot of time listening to our
community building up our community
listening to what the feedbacks are so
we're gonna continue listening to
feedback improving our software I think
that's the number one most important
thing and also sometimes this year
second half this year you will be seeing
a lot of partners coming up with mix OS
different devices alright well I do want
to make sure that our audience knows
where they can find all of remix OS and
also to if anything if they want to
become part of the community where could
the people find remix OS Android
technologies for that matter so that
they can join in on the fun that is
remix OS the best way is to come to a
website WWJD com
alright wonderful you're gonna see links
in the description below to be able to
find all of that and I would encourage
everyone to see this version of an
because for years we have had this
version of Android that is the recent
apps screen kind of really even on
tablets just focused upon just sort of
the home screen experience but now it's
a workspace and you're seeing the
footage right now that also that we had
from CES of how you're able to open
multiple apps at the same time I think
that I think for the most part we always
knew that Android is able to open it to
have multiple tasks going at once but
it's never fully shown to us I think
that's why I think remix is such a nice
a nice step forward all right wonderful
well I want to thank you again David
thank you so much for the interview and
I'm gonna go ahead and play around with
the tablet some more okay thanks so keep
it tuned to enter authority for even
more about remix OS and don't forget to
head on over to their site in the
description these guys are super fun to
hang out with so we want you guys to see
what they have in store with the beta
that you can try on PCs now so keep it
tuned to Android 3 for even more and
remember to subscribe to our channel if
you haven't already so you can see even
more from MWC 2016 thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
