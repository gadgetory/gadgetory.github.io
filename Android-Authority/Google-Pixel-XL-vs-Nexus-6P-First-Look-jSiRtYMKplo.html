Nexus to pixel it's jars of agar from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Google pixel
XL versus the Nexus 6p in this quick
look aesthetically speaking there's
actually not a whole lot that these two
phones have in common the Google pixel
XL has a more bare-bones look to it when
compared to the slightly more
unique-looking Nexus 6p the 6p has that
camera wedge at the top and the Nexus
logo that is sprawled out in landscape
which has been replaced by the big
Google g2 designate that the Google
pixel is indeed a Google made device
however from there you have a unique
slab of glass on the upper third of the
backing of the pixel XL which is a
little bit odd but is a differentiating
feature of the aesthetic on the pixel XL
of course it also has the fingerprint
reader and one main addition that the
Nexus 6p has over the pixel XL is a dual
speaker setup you have two speakers on
the front which provide really good
sound when compared to the bottom
mounted speaker that we have yet to
fully test on the pixel XL now both the
pixel XL in the Nexus 6p offer AMOLED
displays though you might notice in this
clip that the pixel XL seems to have
cooler color temperature in its screen
when compared to the warmer colors of
the six PS panel both screens do come in
a quad HD resolution but the Nexus 6p
has a slightly larger screen at 5.7
inches but performance will favour the
newer phone which is to be expected the
pixel XL has the brand new Snapdragon
820 1 paired with 4 gigabytes of RAM but
the Nexus 6p should still be able to
perform very well with its Snapdragon
810 and 3 gigabytes of RAM though really
a lot of this might end up being
relative when you take into
consideration the software of course the
software in the pixel XL is the
brand-new version of Android nougat but
it's at 7.1 when you compare to the
Android you get 7.0 that you can get
currently on the Nexus 6p in the Nexus
5x that are obviously going to be a lot
of different features on the pixel XL
that would differentiate it from the
nougat that is currently available for
the Nexus phones but if you're looking
for storage options the pixel X on my
disappoint a little bit in this
comparison as the choices can either be
32 gigabytes or 120
eight gigabytes whereas the Nexus 6p
offered the 64 gigabytes in the middle
but still neither phone really offers
expandable memory at all though you can
argue that the pixel XL is trying to
bridge that gap a little bit by
providing unlimited full resolution
storage via google photos for all photos
and videos both phones serve up similar
battery capacities at thirty 450
milliamp hours and also future quick
charging and USB type-c it seems like
the cameras for both of these phones at
least on paper are for the most part the
same after all with the Nexus 6p it
really raised the bar especially when it
came to low light performance because it
had a 12 megapixel shooter at F 2.0
aperture that prioritize low-light
performance by having very large pixels
at 1.5 5 microns and basically that's
the same spec that you will get on the
camera for the pixel XL now the pixel XL
we weren't able to get any shots using
the phone just yet but it has gotten our
rating on DxO mark of 89 which is the
highest that it basically has ever given
a smartphone video stabilization will be
a big deal however as the pixel XL does
not have optical image stabilization it
uses software stabilization so we're
going to have to see if it's video
stabilization is actually a leap forward
especially for smartphones at large but
the main crux of this will be the
software as we mentioned earlier and
Android nuga is what you're using right
now on the Nexus 6p if you have it
updated to the latest and greatest that
Android has to offer on the other hand
the pixel XL once it is released will
have literally the greatest and latest
that Android has to offer in the form of
Google Assistant essentially nougat is
going to be upgrade to version 7.1 that
has Google assistant at the helm holding
the home button on either these phones
will actually do different things on the
Nexus 6p it will open up Google now on
tap but on the pixel XL to Google
assistant will appear now if you looked
at our hands-on video of the pixel XL
and the pixel actually we did do some
clips to show you how Google assistant
is actually a very seamless experience
and is kind of scary accurate it was
able to pick up my voice really easily
in the noisy environments and was able
to open up the appropriate applications
for pretty much any query that I sent
now it can be argued that the fast and
fluid experience of using Google
assistant is still available with Google
now there's just an extra layer in
between in that the Android iteration on
the Nexus 6p has to go to Google first
and then perform all of its tasks but
it's just that amount of speed that the
pixel Excel can provide in doing all
those searches that makes it feel that
much more fresh so ultimately in many
ways both of these phones share a lot of
the same DNA being Google made phones
and in the case of the Google pixel
excel it's Google's actually taking the
reins and creating a hardware device
that will be able to provide the best
that Android and Google have to offer
the Nexus 6p in cooperation with Huawei
was able to bring a wonderful experience
at a premium price point with premium
basically being the reason why that P
was at Nexus 6p
however the pricing is where the two
phones will greatly differ the Nexus 6p
was able to be had for only three ninety
nine but the Google pixel Excel is the
premium one of the two this year and
will start at seven hundred and sixty
nine dollars so ultimately this might be
an evolution of the Nexus formula but
it's not going to feel like such for a
lot of users out there who are used to
being able to use the Nexus as a easy
stepping stone into the world of Android
but we're going to see how both of these
phones actually fare when we put them
head-to-head when we get our hands on a
review unit of the pixel and the pixel
excel keep it tuned to Android authority
for more on that and don't forget to
check out our hands-on for the pixel and
pixel excel so you can see everything
that we had to say about it from the
event here in San Francisco where we
brought you
Google's brand new devices keep it tuned
here to Android authority because we are
