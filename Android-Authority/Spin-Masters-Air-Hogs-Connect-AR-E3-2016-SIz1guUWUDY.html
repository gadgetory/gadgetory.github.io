Andrew authority what's going on
everybody and we're taking a look at an
AR application yes this is on an iPad
but this is also available on Android
we're here with spin masters talking
about the air hogs connect so spin
masters already creates a number of
different drones and RC helicopters and
even they made those tech decks back in
the day but now we have a small
quadricopter a drone that you can use
for an AR application you can see right
above me that there is a full display
and I'm using the camera on this tablet
here and you can see it moving around
and we have at the moment is the end of
a mission but if I go over to you might
see me go in and out of frame over here
but if I come over to here actually I
might be able to launch it from here hey
go oh maybe not okay so we're doing take
two because there was a bit of an issue
with the pairing but we have it paired
up again you can see in the TV up here
that I have the camera outputting the
drone in the middle of the AR Matt so
this world here is already being shown I
can get really close to everything and
this drone which looks kind of harmless
in real life actually looks really
badass on this television so if I take a
look at all of the other elements we
also have some barracks some workshops
and everything and an entire world is
going to be made on top of this mat
inside of the tablet augmented reality
of course and I'm gonna go and do that
right now
so you could see me go in and out of the
frame a little bit but we're going to go
ahead and have some fun with alien
invasion so what we have here is just
fly through the Rings and land on the
pad now the thing I could tell you is
that you don't necessarily have to play
this game to have fun with this drone
our remote control can be brought up
inside of the menu before you get to the
game and you'll be able to just play
with the drum which can go for up to
about 15 to 20 minutes if you're not
flying it around incessantly all over
the place we're gonna get gonna go ahead
and hit play step back a little bit
because it has to get the entire man
there you go now that now that I have it
i'm gonna go to comment a little bit
closer oh nope or just get stay out here
all right and here we go
so you have controls for altitude as you
can see from the grid so bring it on
bring it down also you want to keep it
right in the middle of the frame in the
camera so it can keep the control on it
left joystick in order to move
everything around and then once we're
done bring it up
I went under the couch I hid under the
couch this is the best video ever by the
way yeah oh go ahead let you fly so
thankfully now we have a professional
working on the drone here and we're not
gonna have any problems with the drone
flying underneath the couch like I just
did but you have these different
objectives that you can do in order to
get past these missions first of all we
went through a hoop and then you're just
gonna have to land this particular drug
for this mission there are a number of
other things you could do as well like
capture aliens save civilians and put
out any fires and once the mission is
complete you get a score so there's a
lot have been sent it to do pretty well
to fly the drone properly which is
something I wasn't able to do a minute
ago but from there this is a great game
that is available for kids 10 and up but
it's also really fun and it's actually
really involved very good for even
adults to play because after all you're
flying a drunk the game also has a
number of different power-ups that you
can collect and use to make your life a
little bit easier for example you even
have a burning building there you could
do a tidal wave or you can put down a
super commando to take out all of the
different aliens around the Air Hogs
connect emission drone is available is
going to be available rather this fall
in a soft release for $149 and it is
available for Android and iOS we did use
an iPad here but they did have an
Android tablet as well and it worked
just fine on that too so you can find
this later in the fall and have some fun
with the drone in an augmented reality
state so give it into android authority
for even more about the Air Hogs connect
and other little toys like this you can
also go to VR source to find even more
types of content like this of course
we've got to see augmented reality here
at e3 2016 so make sure you stick around
for even more because we are your source
for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
