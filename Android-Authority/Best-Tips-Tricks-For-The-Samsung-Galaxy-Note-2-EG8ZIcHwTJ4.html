Android authority a lot of us are really
big fans of the Samsung Galaxy Note 2
I've had the chance to use it for a few
weeks now and it is hands-down one of
the coolest devices I've ever used
looking at your comments on YouTube and
on Android authority comm we've noticed
a lot of you seem to be big fans of the
note 2 as well so we figured we'd make a
video for you our wonderful wonderful
viewers and readers to show you 10 tips
on how to get the most out of your
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 let's get started
with number one our first tip is a quick
one but it's a lifesaver if you're
left-handed to change your s-pen for
left-handed you simply go to settings
then S Pen select dominant hand and
switch it to left now any lefties will
have a much easier time using the S Pen
tip number two is one-handed operation
now what are the greatest things about
the note 2 is that it's big one of the
not-so-great things about the note 2 is
that it's big
this can make certain things difficult
at least until you enable one-handed
operation to do this simply go to
one-handed operation under settings and
you can make the keyboard dial pad and
calculator stick a little closer to
either the right or the left side of the
screen even better you can change these
options individually so you don't have
to change everything at once
number three is handwriting recognition
with the s-pen sure it's fun to take
notes and write on your screen but what
about when you need to get down to some
real communication to use the s-pen to
turn your handwriting into standard text
input just go to settings then language
and input then Samsung keyboard settings
and select pen detection now whatever
you may be doing whether it's an email
or a text you'll be able to scribble
away with the S Pen and it'll turn into
standard text as easy as that
tip number four replace the stock
keyboard the keyboard on the note 2 is
fine but it's autocorrect can leave
something to be desired if you're like
me you may want to choose a replacement
keyboard my favorite by far is Swift key
but there are other options like swipe
that may suit you better
the only problem is that if you use a
third party keyboard you won't be able
to use the handwriting recognition from
the previous tip number five on our list
of tips and tricks is screen capture if
you want to show other people what's on
your screen the note 2 makes it very
easy and gives you two different ways to
do it to take a snapshot of the whole
screen just hold down the button on the
S Pen and press on the screen in a
second the screen will be captured and
you can even edit it or draw on if you
just want to capture a portion of the
screen
hold down the S Pen button and draw an
area on the screen and anything within
that area will be captured passing the
halfway point our next tip is to hook
your note 2 up to an external display
the mini USB port on the bottom of the
note 2 has a secret it can also work as
an HDMI out to hook up to your TV you
just need an adapter first if you want
to watch videos or play a game on a
large screen just plug in an MHL HDMI
adapter which will cost you about 20
bucks plug it into your TV and that's
pretty much it enjoy number 7 enable NFC
and s beam while Samsung hypes s beam
quite a bit it's not turned on by
default
neither is NFC meaning until you turn it
on you're stuck paying for your coffee
the old-fashioned way to turn on S beam
and NFC you can find the options under
the wireless and networks option under
settings you don't need to turn on s
beam to use NFC but you do have to turn
on NFC to use s beam now you're set to
beam away to your heart's content tip
number 8 on our list turn off auto
brightness
the auto-brightness feature helps
visibility and can conserve battery life
but sometimes you just want a little
more control over your brightness this
option is easy to find in the settings
menu under display just turn off the
auto brightness option and set the
brightness to whatever you'd like number
nine
use the camera's HDR mode while the note
twos camera takes a pretty-looking
picture HDR or high dynamic range mode
can make them look even nicer the bonus
is the camera still takes a normal
picture as well once you've got the
camera app open select the shooting mode
option which is on the top or the side
of the screen depending on how you're
holding your note to scroll through
until you find the HDR option if you
want to increase the effect toggle it
from normal to strong as the camera app
warms make sure to hold very still while
taking your picture and you should end
up with great results our final tip save
battery life well I've found that the
note 2 has excellent battery life
already sometimes you're going to need
to squeeze a little more out of it under
settings scroll to find the power saving
mode open the menu and turn the option
on now you can choose CPU power saving
screen power saving turn off haptic
feedback and even change the background
color of web pages to help save battery
life want to save even more battery life
open the s-pen menu under settings and
select battery saving now the note 2
won't automatically notice when you
remove the s-pen but your battery will
last a little while longer so that wraps
up our list now obviously there are a
ton of tips and tricks for the note 2
and there's no way we could possibly get
to all of them I just went for a few
that I thought were the most interesting
or the most useful if you have a
favorite tip or trick that we haven't
mentioned let everybody know in the
comments I'm Christopher wolf or Android
authority and as always we love to hear
what you think of our videos so if you
have any comments or suggestions let us
know
thanks and enjoy your note too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
