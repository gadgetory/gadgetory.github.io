authority here taking a quick look at
the equal P 10 alight which launched a
few weeks ago well we've just had our
first hands-on experience let's dive in
and I mean that literally because why we
decided to emphasize the lightness of
the P 10 light by taking us to an indoor
skydiving center which is not to say
that the phone is actually any lighter
than the regular P 10 because it's not
in fact it actually has a slightly
larger screen than the regular P 10 and
that's because the light vary in terms
of why we p-series are more of their own
sub-brand than they are variations on
the flagship theme light in the name
refers to the majority of the specs in
the phone and they'd range chipset
single non like a branded camera smaller
internal storage and so on you can use
about watering those specs down the
little bo is that you'll pay
significantly less for the P 10 light
than you would for the regular p10 or
its larger sibling the P 10 plus it's
just 349 euros the P 10 light is half
the price of the P 10 plus and 300 euros
cheaper than the regular P 10 while that
price certainly fits the specs in style
here there's nothing much on the outside
to make this look like either flagship
device the design here is almost exactly
like the p9 life which is also known as
the p8 Lite 2017 in some markets
complete with rear mounted fingerprint
scanner like some light series
predecessors it features a glass back
rather than the metal found on v9 and P
10 well while the color options do
include that great shade of blue your
notes from the P 10 there's also a black
gold or white version speaking of design
the p10 light isn't nicely put together
phone as most employees devices are it
has a 5.2 inch full HD IPS LCD display
surrounded by those same chamfered edges
you'd know from previous P series
devices and really small bezels for a
mid-range phone
in fact the bezels on the p10 light
match up almost exactly for those found
on the flagship p10
however if specs are essentially those
of the entry-level p9 - for high-end
processor and dual like a camera on the
software front though you're basically
getting the exact same experience you'll
know from the P 10 and P 10 Plus Android
7.0 and emui 5.1 all onboard as well as
an option for the after all along with
all the familiar flyway features you'd
know and love
on the camera front there's a single 12
megapixel shooter that as I mentioned
does not have the like a branding so you
won't get the same results you'll get
from the pecan or P 10 plus but you will
still get similar image processing some
of the photos I took turned up pretty
good but don't expect too much from
moving subjects poorly lit environment
or the front-facing 8 megapixel camera
generally while the P 10 light doesn't
have the fancy black and white sensors
for capturing fine detail like the P 10
it does have a monochrome filter in the
camera app as well as a full manual mode
I took the same photo on the P 10 light
and the regular PE 10 one using a
monochrome filter and the other using a
dedicated black-and-white sensor and you
can see they're not actually that far
apart in terms of quality there's links
in the description if you want to check
out the full images video quality is
pretty decent too but the lack of image
stabilization quite noticeable in
certain condition for example when
filming while walking but the feet
sunlight still has 4 gig of ram so you
should give if storage expandable via
microSD dual sim a 3000 milliamp hour
battery with micro USB headphone port
and an IR blaster
it even has NFC so there's plenty of
specs here to keep you happy but the
price has crept up 50 euros since the p9
light while the basic specs package
hasn't really improved any more than you
would expect it to in a year while the
p10 light is probably still a good buy
just it's starting to creep into the
territory of much better equipped
competition like a 1 + 3 T and on an 8
floors of judgement until a full review
of course but in the meantime you can
keep an eye out at retailers in the UK
and across mainland Europe
unfortunately no details have been
released so fast for a North American
launch but you can stay tuned to Android
Authority comm for all the latest on the
p10 light and it's like siblings to
P 10 and P 10 +</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
