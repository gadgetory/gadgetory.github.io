handy the Android authority app guy here
and in this quick look video we're going
to take a look at YouTube music key the
first thing you'll notice about YouTube
music key is actually nothing all of the
changes take place in the menus and on
the video playback pages the general
look and feel of the YouTube app itself
has changed very little if at all in the
menu you'll notice a new offline
selection that houses any videos that
you have made available offline where
you'll see the biggest changes are on
the video playback screens there are two
new pieces the first is a little logo
that tells you that the video is being
brought to you ad free and I guess
that's just kind of a reminder that the
service is actually working to the right
is a little download button this will
add videos to your offline list which
you can access in the affirmation to
offline selection in the menu the third
big feature is background listening and
it does work pretty well and here is
what it looks like
along with this feature comes a playback
widget in the notifications so you can
play and pause the music along with skip
forward and back buttons and there is
also some album arts it's a pretty
standard notification music control
widget so if you've used one before you
know what this feels like
here's the thing folks that's really it
along with these new features you'll
also get these standard of Google Play
Music all access to up including these
20 million songs that you can listen to
the radio stuff and the twenty thousand
songs that you can upload yourself I
won't talk about that here because
that's something else entirely a few
things to note for now in the YouTube
application you cannot construct any
offline playlists just yet we imagine
that this feature is still being worked
on offline videos are good for 30 days
after that your device will need to
reconnect so it can perform a service
check if everything passes you should be
able to keep the video and if you sense
unsubscribed these video will be removed
we're actually surprised at the lack of
integration between play music and music
key word around the digital water cooler
is that more integration is coming such
as YouTube recommendations in the Play
Music app but for now music key is only
in YouTube and play music is only in
play music overall I would say that
music key is the YouTube experience that
everyone has always wanted the ad free
is nice the offline playback is nice and
the background listening is something
we've been clamoring for for ages it's
difficult to say whether Google Play
Music all access feels like an add-on to
this or if music key feels like an
add-on to Google Play Music for now they
are two distinctly separate services
that you happen to get for one monthly
payments if I had to wager I'd say these
two services get fully integrated
eventually but for now they are separate
and it's not really a bad thing it is in
beta and if you want to try it out for
yourself you'll have to pick up a Google
Play Music all access pass for $9.99 per
month that's it for this video ladies
and gentlemen if you haven't already do
subscribe to the Android Authority
YouTube channel thank you again for
watching everybody and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
