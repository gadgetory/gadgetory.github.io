and certainly on something like the rift
that holds true we're not trying to
entertain a billion people with a wide
variety of very very small titles we
don't want to splatter the market
instead we want deeper larger more
immersive content everything in VR is in
3d that means everything has to be drawn
in stereo it's a high end game that
requires a high end development process
and those games tend to be more
expensive take longer to make and it
takes a specific type of artist to make
those games oculus is really focused on
quality we're focused on the high end
whether that's mobile high end or the
PCI high end and we're focused on giving
the best possible experience for a
variety of reasons if you support any
phone it's not as high quality and
experience as if you focus on a specific
line of phones and you have direct
access to those phones operating system
so the partnership with Samsung and
oculus is a perfect way to get mobile VR
to be as high quality as possible
because together we can work on that
symbiosis that creates the quality for
us to go lower market and support more
phones means the quality goes down and
that's not where our oculus wants to
play in the market I think ninety-nine
dollars for a portable consumer VR
system that allows you to play games
watch movies and do all of the other
things that you can do is it incredibly
compelling Christ
I believe that innovation need to be
different so we make this for the
virtual reality industry this is called
cycle of prototype and we make a unicode
ir camera here down here use this two to
three teams first we need the camera to
track the markers on the ground so it
can bring you the positional tracking by
this it can track your movements in your
room in your angle playground and in
anywhere with markers that's what we to
positional tracking a second we use the
camera to track your hands in the
virtual world especially your fingertips
you can use your hand to type a virtual
keyboard in the virtual world so that's
a very different experiments that means
that you can use our headset at the just
as a traditional monitors especially 3d
monitors you can use it to view 3d
movies to the movies and also use it to
play 3d games 2d games so we believe
that in the middle of this year's all
the competitor will start out to to
fight
so the omnia is a motion platform that
allows players to walk or run in 360
degree environments this for the first
time allows players to physically move
into virtual environments opposed from
sitting or standing the omni itself is
the platform with the shoes with a
tracking pods on each foot the harness
that keeps you safe and stable along
with the ring and the product itself so
we're compatible with any other VR
content that exists today as well as
legacy titles but we will include a
couple game modes of our own internal
content as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
