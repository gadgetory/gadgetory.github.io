Samsung Galaxy Xcover 2 hey everybody
I'm Chris book now whether it's
clumsiness or just a rough job certain
people need a tough phone and the Galaxy
Xcover 2 is meant for just that type of
person
how's it hold up otherwise though well
let's take a look at the specs the
Galaxy excurrent WVGA display and is
powered by a one gigahertz dual-core
cortex a9 CPU for memory we're looking
at one gig of ram and four gigs of
internal storage expandable by microsd
the rear facing camera is 5 megapixels
and capable of shooting 720p video up
front we have a 0.3 megapixel camera
powering everything is a 1700 milliamp
hour battery it may be tough but the
Galaxy Xcover 2 certainly isn't going to
be winning any awards for its looks it
isn't a particularly ugly phone per se
but it's clear that this phone was built
to be tough and easy to hold on to and
it certainly is tough while like any of
these rugged phones the screen is the
weak point the rest of the phone feels
very solid and the covered porch should
keep it free of dust and moisture most
rugged phones make trade-offs in the
display department and that is
definitely the case here at 4 inches and
a resolution of 480 by 800 we're looking
at a pixel density of 233 pixels per
inch which is certainly not on the high
side colours aren't as supersaturated as
they are on many Samsung phones maybe as
a result of the excursion LCD display
instead of Super AMOLED this has one
other advantage as the screen seems just
a little sharper than it would otherwise
to get a handle on performance we ran
our usual suite of tests starting with
antutu which managed an average score of
just over 6600 over the course of 10
tests Epic Citadel managed an average
frame rate of around 35 frames per
second in high quality mode and 37
frames per second in high performance
mode
in everyday use little to no lag was
present apps launched fairly quickly and
light gaming worked well though you
might have trouble with more demanding
games the Galaxy Xcover 2 runs Android
4.1.2 jelly bean overlaid with Samsung's
ubiquitous TouchWiz UI the usual google
apps are included as are the normal
samsung apps like S Memo s voice game
hub chaton s organizer and my files
the only out-of-the-ordinary app
included that I noticed was the workout
app cardio trainer the 5 megapixel rear
facing camera definitely takes a decent
photo
especially when the lighting is good
low-light photos tend to be blurry but
without much visual noise the 0.3
megapixel front-facing camera leaves a
lot to be desired on the other hand the
720p video looks nice enough with decent
colors but there is definitely some
jerkiness and no image stabilization is
present with a battery capacity of 1700
milliamp hours you might not expect
battery life to be too good but keep in
mind that this phone isn't pushing too
much in the hardware department after a
day of testing benchmarking and shooting
with the brightness set to about 25% I
managed to get around 12 hours in more
normal use you should get better numbers
though I was running without a SIM card
present so that will eat up some extra
battery life basically if you need the
toughness and don't mind putting up with
lower end specs and the extra bulk the
Galaxy Xcover 2 isn't a bad choice if
you don't need that toughness though
there are plenty of better options out
there well I don't know more we have a
