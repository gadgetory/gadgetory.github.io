handy the Android authority app guy and
black brain messenger has finally made
it to Android in this video we're going
to do a full review of the application
your time is valuable so is mine so
let's get started the first thing we'll
talk about is the design initially the
design was somewhat controversial since
bbm follows the BlackBerry OS standard
of design and not Android believe it or
not it's a change you won't notice all
that much the left side slide-out menu
is still present but there is a second
menu on the right side that slides out
as well generally speaking the left side
menu acts as a sitemap of sorts you use
it to navigate around the app the right
side menu changes depending on what
you're doing inside of the app so if
you're in the group section the options
will be different than in the contacts
section general movement and chats look
about how you expect you open the chat
and there are chat bubbles the action
bar is a little taller than other
messaging apps but usually doesn't get
in the way too much there are icons for
when messages are delivered and received
the chat section looks like the good old
fashioned Google Talk interface while
the contacts and group tabs use more of
a tile layout the last thing we'd like
to mention are the settings you can
remove that obnoxious notification icon
if you want to bbm for Android warns
that if you do messages may not send or
be received so that's a risk reward
situation you'll have to work out on
your own you can also tap on your own
picture at any time to view your bbm pin
change your profile picture or update
your status okay so here's how this app
actually works there are a few ways to
get contacts invited to your list you
can send your pin via email SMS and
other typical services if you're
actually with the person you can create
a barcode that the other person can scan
this may seem outdated but it actually
works for all major platforms at bbm
supports so you can use this method to
swap contact info with say an iPhone or
a blackberry owner lastly and my
personal favorite you can use NFC to
swap contact details just tap the phone
together and then tap the screen and
things are done from here you can do a
lot of stuff there is emoji support
similar to hangouts there is group chat
support but we'll talk more about that
here in a minute obviously one on one
conversations work fairly well you can
send voice notes and photos as
attachments along with regular text
messages there are no video chats yet
but we assume that's coming eventually
general
speaking all of these functions work
perfectly fine you can also do a lot of
smaller things like send broadcast
messages out to multiple contacts ping
people which shows up as a separate
notification from regular messages and
even copy the entire chat if you need to
log it somewhere ok let's circle back
and talk about groups using this you can
create a group add people and interact
with them all at once this is similar to
having a hangouts with a lot of people
in a certain circle differences bbm for
Android goes more in depth with it you
can upload pictures to create galleries
that everyone in the group can see you
can create lists which then can be
assigned to contacts as tasks you can
even set events that everyone in the
group can see if used properly this can
be a very powerful real-time way to
manage and communicate effectively with
people in a business environment this is
admittedly far more than you can get
with competitor apps the first thing
that jumped out at us was the
ease-of-use
there are at least three different ways
to add contacts you can do the
conventional method if you wish or you
can use the NFC tap or the barcode scan
to add people the chat contacting
grouped tabs are all pretty much
self-explanatory and no one should have
any problems figuring out how things
work after you get used to the dual
menus nothing in this app is hard to
find or master another thing we found
particularly wonderful were the groups
the task lists the group gallery the
group events and the group chat put
together create a comprehensive group
experience unlike anything else you'll
find in the messaging space it can be
used for things as simple as keeping in
contact with all of your friends at once
but the tools provided can be useful in
pretty much any group atmosphere be it
business or pleasure so here's what we
didn't like the design is functional but
not all that good-looking
when I went through this app the first
time it was the features that impressed
me and not the interface since the
design is functional it's hard to
denounce it entirely
however there were little things the
action bar is pretty tall the menu
buttons cover more real estate on the
screen than the contacts groups and
conversations tabs combined the design
itself is functional but it's not
striking to look at it's not bad but you
won't find anyone singing praises about
it either the only other thing we could
find were inconsistencies in the
interface you can slide open the left
side menu but you can't slide open the
right side menu you can't swipe between
tabs turning off the notification icon
makes the app not work sometimes none of
these are reason enough to complain on
their own but put together the great
somewhat confusing experience when you
get right down to the brass tacks bbm
for Android is definitely good enough to
compete on most levels with other
messaging services you can send text
voice MMS and eventually video content
using this app the group's function is
simply amazing the interface isn't
perfect but it isn't awful either the
NFC contact sharing is a nice touch the
app doesn't look amazing but it's
functional which is all you can really
ask for there is still a lot of work
left to do for blackberry and
unfortunately several issues will
probably never be fixed the notification
icon is likely here to stay forever and
several design flaws will likely stick
around for the long haul
once the launch date kinks are worked
out we see no reason why bbm for Android
can't be successful for once blackberry
did something that was more right than
wrong
