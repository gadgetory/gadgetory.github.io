Authority and we're here Aoife 2016
where Sony just announced a bunch of new
products along with two new smartphones
the Xperia XZ and the xperia x compact
the X compact as the name suggests is
supposed to be a smaller version of the
XZ and it definitely is smaller but it's
also a lot less powerful and doesn't
come with as many features as the XZ the
design is all that different from
previous Sony phones it's been slightly
tweaked with some new body lines and
this looped design to give it a
refreshed look but for the most part
it's still a sharp rectangular slab the
X compact is also made of plastic and
comes in a variety of different colors
from black grey blue and white and
depending on the color you get it will
either be a matte plastic or a less
fingerprint friendly glossy plastic
despite being made of plastic it felt
surprisingly sturdy and with so many
large screen smartphones on the market
now it was a very refreshing feeling to
hold and use a phone that fits so easily
in the palm of your hand obviously with
the X compact being as small as it is
you're not going to get a very large
screen it's got a 4.6 inch LCD display
on the front with 720p resolution which
may not sound all that exciting on paper
but on a 4.6 inch screen 720p works
perfectly fine it's sharp enough that
text and graphics were still very easy
to read and it also had some pretty
nice-looking colors but with it being so
small it's definitely not going to be
the best experience for playing a lot of
games or watching YouTube unlike
previous compact phones that Sony has
made the X compact doesn't share the
same internal specs as the XZ instead
it's running on a snapdragon 650
processor with three gigs of RAM which
should be perfectly fine especially
since the processor isn't having to push
as many pixels but it's going to be
disappointing to anyone who wanted a
compact phone with flagship specs it
comes with 32 gigs of internal storage a
micro SD card slot and a 2700 milliamp
hour battery but something that is oddly
missing is that the X compact isn't
water or dust resistant it does however
have stereo front-facing speakers a
headphone jack up top and a USB type-c
port on the bottom with support for fast
charging on the right side of the phone
you have sony standard power button
which also doubles as a fingerprint
sensor and right below that is the
volume rocker and physical camera
shortcut button to quickly launch into
the cam
it does keep the same rear camera from
the Xperia XZ with the 23 megapixel
sensor and five axis image stabilization
which should work really well for
capturing photos and stable video but
the front camera on the X compact has
been reduced to a smaller 5 megapixel
sensor it's running Android marshmallow
and it does have some customizations
from Sony like the swipe down from a me
home screen to conduct an app search
custom icons and the built-in theme
engine but for the most part this is
basically stock Android this is probably
the lightest skin that Sony has ever
made and it looks like they might be
slowly doing away with their own skin or
at the very least trying to not
interfere as much with Android they've
even gone as far as integrating the
Google now home screen into their own
launcher which I thought was a really
nice touch for more information on the X
compact in the Xperia XZ including
pricing and availability check the
