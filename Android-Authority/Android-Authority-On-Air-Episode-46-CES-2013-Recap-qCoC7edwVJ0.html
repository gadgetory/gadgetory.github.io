original android hangout show on google+
I'm dare cross and i'm scott henderson
this week were joined with dan Charlton
Johnathan Franklin and first time she'll
guest Joshua Vergara hey Dylan Josh hey
what's going on everybody josh is a part
of the android authority team more
importantly he was our amazing AV guy at
CES this past week Josh made us all look
good on the on our YouTube videos
especially me it turns out i can do
hangout interviews and I can do this
really well at least I think I can do it
well but when it comes to actually
holding a mic in front of somebody and
ask questions and interviewing it is a
completely different thing I'm not good
at it um the first two maybe even three
videos I did our interviews I did were
horrible in my opinion but but Josh did
his magic and made them you know
bearable but after the heck but after
that um actually no not just josh i got
a the other camera guy that was there
from the android authority team up
christopher awoke he he's pretty awesome
too and he made him and i did a hell of
a job the other two days and did some
really good videos if you guys haven't
watched him go check out our youtube
channels are up there for a bunch of
devices we're gonna be talking about
today so how many guys were there oh
well uh our editor-in-chief Darcy lack
of a was there as well as our our
webmaster and co-founder Derek Scott
myself Josh and Chris yeah so where
there's five of this uh was my first CES
so I had a hell of a time it was great
um you know some people keep saying OCS
was a little disappointing uh from a
consumer standpoint maybe but um you
know is my first one the first two days
were awesome for me after that it was
kind of like yeah you know I mean you
know where's
where's the cool stuff that you know
like where's the cool consumer products
that you know we're going to be
launching yeah it's called the consumer
electronic show so it should be good for
the consumers but uh you know yeah so
talking about 4k TVs that nobody can you
know even uh yeah you know use yet no
it's a consumer product but still and
then you're talking about you know CPUs
nobody cares about a Qualcomm you know
CPU or a Tegra 4 CPU they want to know
about the cool devices running it okay
some people present company excluded you
don't care about it anyway so uh let's
talk about some some devices uh we had a
whole lot of interesting android phones
and tablets and Google TV devices that
will hit on this week during the show so
hallway introduced to new device is the
ascend d2 and the ascend mate and you'll
talk about i hain't seen the word
phablet i really do you know the whole
tablet phone hybrid but but on the
ascend mate which we'll talk about here
first the thing is massive it has a 6.1
inches screen so it's it's very close to
the same size as the nexus 7 you know it
has a better screen the Nexus 7 has a
higher process or better camera finger
and but it ends a phone um it's a pretty
awesome device I think good josh did you
get some hands-on time with that yeah a
little bit darcy now were able to take a
look at it and yeah putting it up
against one of the more commonplace
phones these days it's kind of a no
contest because a lot of people really
want that larger screen but putting it
up against the Nexus sezon you have a
weird sort of dichotomy there where the
specs on the Nexus 7 and experience on
it and my opinion a lot better but
having something just a little bit
smaller actually felt kind of cool that
being said though the the ascend mate
was definitely I don't know I just when
I had it in my hand it felt nice but I
don't know if I'd be able to use that
thing every single day
to be honest yeah I put on my pocket and
in it you know it's a big fella it fit
in my my my jeans immer slacks whatever
I was wearing that day out you know it
fit fine but it's big it really is uh
it's a very solid feeling device it's
well-built I mean I think it feels well
Milt I wonder what they'll what the
sweet spot is going to be now hallway
also add another device the d2 so if 6.1
is a little too big they have a smaller
phone the the d2 and it has a 5-inch
screen and still it's 1080p 13-megapixel
camera jelly bean it's very it's not a
light phone it's not overly heavy phone
but it it feat it's a very solid you
know it may be because of the way it's
weighted it it's a very solid you know
heavy feeling phone now out comparing it
to the the Ascend I mean there in terms
of you know they're having this baby
they really feel you know roughly the
same it's a well-built device to it
really is like I said it's very solid
feeling no we just mentioned two phones
that have a 1080p resolution is the that
you guys were there and I mean is this
kind of what they're pushing to be as a
standard for a screen at least in the
high-end range well I believe in unless
I'm wrong here nearly every device that
we're going to talk about tonight is a
1080p has a 1080p screen so let me this
is definitely 2013 is going to be the
year of 1080p screens yeah at least the
vast majority of them are going to have
1080p screens that's cool at least all
your LCD base screen would be LEDs
probably tough pretty get it known that
kind of like the listening I mean I only
just upgraded to 720 with the next boy
oh yeah happy I'm happy with 720 but
exactly oh my my DNA can you see the
difference yeah actually I can't mom no
I can't I'll unless I launched an app
that doesn't support it then yes yes I
can tell the difference because the app
looks all stretched out a good point
color
is more important than pixel density
yeah yeah just calibrating it will know
one thing about the Ascend devices that
I think we can touch on a bit is they
actually come with some pretty massive
batteries I think that was one thing
that they really wanted to sort of put
out there these things can probably last
quite a long time with the d2 having
3000mah and the mate having looking like
4050 miles is a tablet battery yeah
absolutely that's the and always said
it's going to last 48 hours of usage so
you get 48 hours of usage out of that
that's nuts yeah I don't matter good
Tuesday's life is just roommates block
that is crazy so now we're talking about
you know hallway devices we're gonna
talk about the the ZTE grand ass next
and both of these manufacturers are
china-based so most people consumers
here in the US net have never heard of
these companies have no clue what they
are so it's gonna be interesting how you
know if they try to move into the US
market what how that's gonna treat them
and some people you know the followers
and kind of the you know the people that
are very interested in may look may know
the names but the devices are kind of
still foreign you know nobody intended
yeah i mean i think i weigh probably
more than ZTE but highway is a game that
people are probably familiar with as you
know makers of those knockoff tvs those
cheap crappy versions of you know good
electronics from Samsung or LG but the
funny thing is you know 40 years ago
people were looking at got a samsung TV
those are those cheap Korean knock offs
from the American companies that don't
existing and people used to get a even
Samsung vs sony those debates yeah ganic
yeah so I mean I know that these Chinese
manufacturers Hawaii and ZTE and to a
lesser extent lenovo lenovo used to be
idea so it's still a pretty big name at
least in enterprise but as these chinese
manufacturers are trying to claw their
way into the American market I think
it's it's going to be slow for them and
they're gonna have to keep putting up a
lot of really good devices like this
that they're going to attract people but
they're also you have to
p down price so i think that's that's
what's going to be the crux of it not
just price but quality because people
expect you know honest they think it's
the cheap chinese knockoff so they want
yeah but they're they're nice they're
good quality phone so let's talk about
the grand ass so they're they're touting
this phone is being the world's thinnest
5-inch smartphone also the world's
thinnest quad-core 5-inch smartphone in
it I got I had the pleasure of me
playing quad-core five and smartphones
are there I don't know but they're the
first I can say that that you know is
that they're the first they can affect
will use that marketing term how about
that yeah i sell italy is thinner than
four inch high end smartphones just to
get a cover yourself because there's so
many trying to claim it at CES yeah and
it's six point nine millimeters that's
pretty dang thin no matter what you're
comparing it to ya so those either
watching know my cat is not dead
diabetic but we had a question i see so
it the IRC channel which burn and we're
eventually trying to use that it's
irc.freenode.net channel android
authority and and our good buddy Jeff
Rivera asked if if my cat was dead and
no she's not she's just sleeping that's
highly debatable so let's talk about the
grand ass a little bit more so it has a
1.7 gigahertz Qualcomm our Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 processor 2 gigs ram you
know pretty much standard nowadays it in
a 2500 milliamp hour battery 13
megapixel camera and I said a 5-inch
screen um its UI for those of you that
know me you I the ROM BIOS I owe me it
reminds me a lot like that in terms of
the launcher itself the launcher just
and even the the the the lock screen it
reminds me of me why I I was very
surprised to see that
I mean they are both they are both
Chinese companies so I guess I shouldn't
be that surprised but the they
definitely took some hints from Zion me
on that now was it fast knowing that
they can develop their own type of you
know skin yeah you know it wasn't slow I
just launched the few basic apps and
played with it just looking a little bit
it wasn't slow I didn't notice I didn't
notice any lag with suspects it really
oh yeah thank you pretty good crappily
program launcher and those two yes since
early on with similar specs the UI is
those specs push through it yeah yeah
yeah it's kind of sad that those specs
are like oh yeah whatever two years of
RAM 1.7 yogurts quad core processor yeah
whatever I think we're getting to those
days though yeah we could take this
phone back to 2009 though it would just
I cool oh my god you just blow out
people's minds with it because I mean
that's the thing with these smartphones
and technology in general the specs are
getting so good but they're also
becoming ubiquitous yeah i think it's
it's like the desktop market is going to
stagnate yeah i personally think it's
like the desktop market with the fact
that when i got my first I seven and I
you know was like okay every average
consumer is not going to need anything
more than this and they'll be fine gotta
go from Sandy Bridge to ivy bridge
there's no justification whatever to buy
it at all very true I would move on to
the lenovo k900 now a different type of
processor the Intel Atom two gigahertz
and is this the one that's supposed to
be like low low low battery as they
claimed well what's more interesting
about this is it it's a dual core
processor and a year ago is when we talk
or or they just gets dual core and it's
really a single core that's hyper
threaded oh no it's it's dual Florida on
Iran saying their previous one was dual
core when it was not well I actually
spoke with a I was going to say spoke
with Lenovo I actually spoke with an in
a rep at CES and I said to him you know
a year ago you guys were saying that
Android wasn't good enough for multiple
core devices her multiple core
processors you said that when the
medfield came out that everybody said
all Intel's putting out a single core
processor and the rest of the world's
doing dual core quad core now and Intel
you know came back and said well the
reason we didn't put out a multi-core
devices because it would actually hurt
android android can't handle multiple
cores or something like that they said
android wasn't good enough just in
thread properly well yeah so i asked i
ask the sales rep i said so what has
changed with either intel or android in
the past year and what you said John you
can watch up our YouTube video on this
when i interviewed the guy he said just
exactly that it had to do with you know
with reading that android couldn't
properly do it or many apps couldn't
properly do it so they actually build
their processors to handle that yeah it
was a change that they made in the core
of android i want to say in honeycomb
and then they patched it in a
gingerbread in one of the late additions
like two point three point six or seven
um but everything from ICS and dining
companies had it so for int'l to say a
year ago oh no it was there yeah it was
they were just behind times you know
they're talking but you remembered
devices like when the droid x2 came out
with a dual corn that was used to what
it was useless yeah yeah absolutely no
noises so Josh you would actually get to
play with the k900 uh I was uh you guys
did you and Darcy went down there and
filmed it and got to play with it
everything did you actually get to touch
it and see any first-hand experience
with it really really I didn't I wasn't
able to go hands-on with it um I
remember Darcy mentioning that you know
it's it those bigger sized screens are
going to be for all intents and purposes
the future as we've seen at CES but I
think that the main comment that I have
aside from the specs is actually really
didn't like how it looked I really did
they just did you guys see the back of
it it looked kind of like a shiny want
to be
prada looking kind of thing it really
didn't look that great um and on the
video that we put up a lot of people
kind of agreed they uh having that shiny
back on it just it I don't know it just
wasn't something that we were used to it
it looked very very tall like the DNA
just it seems in thin and tall and it
reminded me of something like that it's
very it's a 5.5 inch screen 1080p and
it's it's very thin or it but it's very
tall it just comes off that way so it's
almost you know like it's like stretch
but I'll I'm curious you know how we
compared to the hallway mate you know in
the you know in the in the future when
we can do a versus on that mm-hmm I'm
surprised the design is flashy at all I
mean yeah right Lenovo's design is so
sedated and in you know industrial
enterprise just stripped out rugged
laptops that they make I'm surprised
it's not the same for their phones well
that's I guess we're trying to make it
like a coming out party of some sort I
would love to see the thinkpad of phones
yeah exactly or a tablet with that same
kind of design style to it deviled egg
no that would just make me extremely at
me if I could get the phone that's like
rhino liner that's all I'm all for it or
how the double phone that has like that
little red nub in the middle I forgot
about that / with lenovo's a new way to
navigate at laptops all right so let's
uh let's talk about a couple tablets
here um acer is coming out with a very
cheap in price and I'm gonna say in
quality to it feels really cheap tablet
the the b-1a 71 because that's an
awesome name for tablet so spider
planers sound like a fire so we're just
gonna call to be one I mean that sounds
like to be one ball or two bits but
stick so this uh it's it it's a
cheap tablet it's gonna be about 150
bucks here in the US whenever it
launches its gonna be about 120 / in /
in europe and there'd be 120 year I was
not hungry oh yeah yeah obviously it has
a 7-inch screen with a 1024 x 600
resolution so it's you know it it's not
winning any awards for its display but
it's a but it's a budget tablet a 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processor a gig of
media tech I don't even know me piatek
made processors well they do for this
device so much you know damn that's hot
that's how impressive these
specifications are so Dan you're not
gonna bust out a MediaTek kernel for
this or what okay okay oh it has eight
gig of storage instead of an arm Oh dirt
I would say no it's more competing with
the cheapest low-end kindle fire it
really looks like it to be honest from
from this yeah but even the cheap kindle
fire didn't they upgrade to 1920 x or
not 1925 something by 800 yeah actually
yeah so but it's a it's a cheap tablet
and it's gift for those folks that
should give us one hundred fifty dollars
well they said somewhere around we're
not sure the the US specs new nobody
knows for sure because we don't know an
official launch day we don't even know
if it's going to come here in the US
they did tell us that there they're
looking into it whatever that means but
yeah it's I mean 150 bucks for a kids
tablet I'm you know you don't want him
to break a two-hundred-dollar tablet
you're you know you're on a budget yeah
find a nexus 7 on sale for just a little
bit more it's pretty much twice as good
you're right you're right but hey it's
nice to have more cheap tablets on the
market right it's true more choice is
always a good thing but you know what's
nice about this is for everybody that
complains about an SD card slot this has
one so you can put more local storage so
maybe that's the deciding factor here
if you read some comments and threads I
guess some people would buy this based
upon that yeah so if you need something
cheap with an SD card there you go next
this this would be a good tablet to use
bit torn on and not have to worry about
ruining your computer sure just don't
care buy it for your a jew bittorrent
client and Jeff makes a good point it
can't be less than five $150 because
they are making money off of the content
like Amazon or again absolutely yeah I'd
see this device is something that you'd
give like your your twelve-year-old kid
to be honest because of the price point
and it's just it's just good enough that
you know the kids not going to be all
that all that picky about the speed of
the specs or anything like that just
something to play games on I would argue
younger than that not there I don't want
to go too young I didn't know what was
yeah so let's talk about another most
likely cheap tablet we don't really know
the price on it yet but but vizio
announced two very interesting had
tablets at the show we actually didn't
get a chance to uh to take a look at
them ourselves you had to go to a sweet
I don't know where they were maybe it in
Trump but I'll yet did actually leave
the show and we were too busy geeking
out the show to leave to go to their
suite to check it out but we did see
their press release and according to the
press release these devices are aimed in
my opinion depending on the price but
just by looking at the specs they're
aimed at it taking on the Nexus 7 in the
nexus 10 and I say that because they
they run stock Android and there there
would be pretty much the exact same
specs you know that up they run stock
Android yeah manufacturer not partnering
with google for a Nexus device releasing
something running stock Android yeah
that's heating me not that's huge what
other two what other tablets do that
what's the last device that was released
excluding the motorola xoom that did
that oh this is something or other that
prepaid prepaid phone ZTE has one out
there that does but yeah you're right
there's no there's no tablets and
there's only maybe one maybe two devices
you know they do at this time
this is a strategy Vizio has used on
their laptops as well they've on their
windows laptops you're not going to find
you know all this trial software and
stickers all over them I me everywhere
and stuff this is something that a
philosophy they've adopted and have one
hundred percent agree with it because
people are tiring that grab ya so the
vizio 7-inch shall we don't want you to
have a name at this time it's 1280 x 800
16 gigs of storage 1.2 megapixel
front-facing camera neck I said Nick
Nexus 7 the cool thing about the vizio
10 is it's gonna have a Tegra 4 CPU you
know that's the first tablet that I know
that's announced to come with a Tegra 4
I think it's the first device not made
by video it's announced coming with
Tiger for yeah yeah so it's gonna have a
10.1 inch screen like I said Nexus 10 a
2560 by 1600 display like I said Nexus
10 32 gigs of storage and an ln stock as
well so who knows what the prices are
going to be you know but if they're
comparable I mean it's it's a it's
another you know I'm curious to see how
that turns out against the Exynos
processor because some people were
saying that you know the X and O's you
know processor to push all those pixels
on the on the Nexus 10 you can get it to
lag a little bit you know if you work
hard at it you can get the UI to lag
from time to time so will the Tegra 4
not lag in those scenarios that's what
I'm curious to see I haven't seen a lot
of good stats on you did the Tegra 5
running Android or work or excuse me the
Exynos 5 on Android or the Tegra 4 No so
Josh you got to do a bunch of vs. videos
with the Xperia Z in the ZL right oh
yeah I'm excited to talk about these
yeah so since you did you did an
extensive work with uh with these new
Xperia devices from Sony do you mind
talking about him for a little bit yeah
definitely on the Xperia Z in the CL to
be honest I think would be my person
no like best of show to be honest as far
as a mobile devices go phones and
whatnot you're looking at 1080p displays
5-inch on the on the Z on both of them
actually and the funny part about the
two devices is that the ZL even though
its sporting the same size screen was
able to pack it into a smaller form
factor so it's come it's comparable to
that of the it doesn't it's not as big
and the Z while it is a little bit
bigger has a very good feel to it it's
like glass all over and it's a I they
wouldn't let us say waterproof about the
phone they said water resistant because
they don't want everybody yeah they
wouldn't like they don't want anybody to
jump in a pool and just think that their
phones gonna well but they were
submerging them in a little like a fish
bowl or something is part of them
gration yeah yeah just like I did with
the xperia v in my review of it I put it
in my my fishbowl and it was it worked
perfectly in there um the thing that a
lot of people don't know is and i'm
pretty sure it's going to be the same
for the xperia z is that when it's
underwater the screen is inoperable so
you can do anything underwater if you're
using it it's just that it's not going
to die you can't doing like James Bond
stuff like scuba diving take pictures
not at all Oh deep diving with that
thing but other than that you got a 13
megapixel camera on the back the thing
that I thought was interesting about the
camera was us while we didn't get a
whole lot of technical explanation on it
it's capable of HDR video and I thought
that was a kind of interesting I would
be I would love to check that out myself
other than that two gigs of ram in both
microsd support i think on actually on
both on both devices if i'm not mistaken
and as far as the look and feel goes of
when it comes to two of the phones like
I said the Z is glass all over so it's
very slight e in your hand and it's it
takes fingerprints like nothing when we
were doing the verses videos we kept
having to wipe down the Z because Darcy
was like all over it the seal on the
other hand has a nice matted sort of
textured back and it feels really nice
it's kind of a toss-up really what I
would think the best one between the two
is but I'm not going to lie after
working with the xperia v having a water
resistant or waterproof
phone it it's actually kind of cool I'm
not gonna lie being able to throw that
thing and like a body of water and not
worry about it i think that's great and
they even told us if the phone gets
dirty you could wash it off like what
but uh yeah i really do think it's
pretty cool um just kind of a side point
uh NFC in general uh is it catching on
with new devices they do say whatever we
ask about NFC it's they do say yes and
they kind of try to make it a big deal
but like we tried to demonstrate with
our own phones one time when we were not
at the show floor it's not I don't know
NFC is cool and everything but I don't
think it's a really amazing protocol to
use at least not yet you know if i were
to if i were to share a photo with
somebody and try to do NFC they might
look at me and say why didn't you just
text it would have been faster yeah it's
it's a bigger deal in countries like
japan that have pretty much adopted it
wholeheartedly they look at you you know
if you pull out a debit credit card they
look at you like you're crazy over there
yeah that is true i still haven't been
able to figure out google wallet i do
want to try it out but yeah we would
just cut the carrier's here the oldest
bug yeah absolutely
alright so let's talk about the end the
pantech discover now what ahead whatever
I was reviewing this phone and I was
actually with the pantech ladies I kept
calling it the discovery for some reason
and thanks to it thanks to editing
awesomeness we were able to work every
time I said discovery is a god damn it
and then there's a guy we gonna start
this again sorry wiki and then it's a
it's not like I'm a big discovery
channel fan or I don't know I just I
just kept saying discovery every time
that was on video to edit I'm not gonna
lie did you do that one other one no I
got together okay we did a good job yeah
it it's it it's a neat phone um it's you
know pentek is known for in my painting
lower end phones you know you don't you
don't see too many people out there
saying you know wow check out this new
pantech film yeah you know um this one's
not bad it's a mid-range phone uh the
best thing about it is it's 50 bucks on
contract that's cheap with only on AT&amp;amp;T
and has a 720p screen comes with android
ICS so yeah it's you know a little older
but if you're if you need a cheap phone
it's not bad uh the coolest thing about
this phone likes it besides the price i
would say would be the speakers it's a
really thin until you get up to the top
of the phone where the speakers are and
then it bulges out if you want to see
what I'm talking about you check out our
video on our YouTube channel and it has
these massive speakers in there and they
sound really really good not for what
i'm talkin about let's say you're
watching a movie on your on your phone
and you get to a point where the audio
and the movie is really loud there's an
explosion or something sometimes on you
know these little tiny little speakers
you know you'll get some crackling or
you know some just it doesn't sound
perfect when there's a very loud noise
he said you know i'm talking about well
we watched a video and went to an
explosion scene it didn't crack or
anything right through that it sounded
good and they're they're telling these
as 3d speakers and
the sound was really really nice I was
impressed with it um has a four point
eight inch screen dual-core 1.5
gigahertz Snapdragon s4 1 gig of ram
16gb of internal memory 12.6 megapixel
camera and it has a something new called
ATT drive mode so it helps you send and
receive text text messages while you're
driving it was pretty cool as well as
full VPN and EAS support so um it's
gonna be available actually starting
today the 11th and from AT&amp;amp;T it's not a
bad not a bad you know low end of
mid-range phone so when we get this so
when we get this phone in order for them
to market the so I keep going green over
here like I told you my webcam is not
that great anyway um the the we get
these phones they'll come with a michael
bay film just built in so you can really
see how that's it maybe I don't know
done that's are actually interesting
what to tell the tale pantech they
should have start to package them with a
michael bay film to show the of it is so
Dan and John since you guys are the
resident CPU experts let's uh talk about
some non consumer products that was it
more announced at the Consumer
Electronics Show because as I was saying
earlier you know yeah average person
doesn't care about a processor but but
Nvidia and what the processor can do for
them yeah well draw the new these new
processors are gonna do some pretty
interesting stuff they're gonna they're
gonna core all the things as we said in
our our preview video see yes the other
day so uh what do you guys think about
those new Disney processors yeah I
really haven't seen a whole lot on the
Tegra 4 I know it's supposed to be for
cortex a15 cores which is impressive
Samsung can't get to to consume a little
enough power to use on the phone so
I'm surprised nvidia is ready to move
forward with four of them and then it's
set up in the same four plus one sleeper
course set up that they've used in our
previous ships but the sleep record this
time is also a cortex a15 horns i'm
doing i think was a five previously but
that core is still not visible to the to
the user to the system and basically you
can't get stats off of it very easily at
all well i don't think that i find
interesting about the new Tegra 4 is the
fact that it has some type of new photo
technology or photography architecture
and the fact that you know on a regular
phone if you want to take an HDR picture
there's some delay and it takes some
time to process with this it's almost
instant takes like two pictures and it
it's instant HDR which is pretty cool
and that's a benefit for people that
want to take hdr not wait around for the
cpu to render it you know yeah that's a
really big deal i mean as a photographer
HDR video for for photographers like
myself consists of I'll just a green
whatever the what you do is you take two
different exposures of the same photo so
you actually need to have like a tripod
set up with the camera and do that and
then in post editing you put them both
together so that the exposures pop out
at the same time um I always thought
that HD arm phones wasn't very kind of
weird to be honest because you have to
take those two shots and camera phones
can never really keep up but what
they're saying is the Tegra 4 processor
with its 72 GPU cores on the 4 cpu cores
both of those both of those clusters are
going to take the same picture at the
same time and process them together and
it's a it's going to sort of
revolutionize camera film technology i'm
not too sure how many i'm not too sure
if it's going to become like the biggest
selling point for more smartphones that
come out with it or two for tablet or
what for that matter but it is really
exciting to see that there are some
advancements in camera phone technology
I think you guys remember when Google
said that the nexus 10 was the fastest
tablet on the market yeah well they did
a direct you know side-by-side
comparison of the Nexus 10
and something running the Tegra 4 and
they were rendering web pages one after
another after another and the Tegra 4
did it twice as fast so it just
completely blew out the nexus 10 as a as
the fastest you know tablet which was it
very interesting and I love the fact
that they you know push it forward but
just kind of disappointing that it's
like just chaotically it's basically you
know for cortex a15 x vs 2 I mean it
should be on if it threads you know in a
perfect world which is not going to be a
perfect pearl yeah I'm the other thing
to note about the Tegra 4 is if you want
LTE it's gonna be on an optional chipset
for my Sarah so yeah it's probably just
taking a wild guess it's probably not
gonna be anywhere near as efficient as
what Qualcomm's got also it does have 4k
ultra high-def video support interesting
it's ready for you know stuff to come so
that's cool i like the fact more so that
it can output that in an hdmi you know
that setting as opposed on the phone
yeah I mean Nvidia's sort of frequently
will push things out to sort of be the
first to do something ah but that's not
always necessarily the best yeah hey you
know if you try something the first time
you know you're not always going to be
the best but at least you put it out
there and make that people think about
it and maybe improve on it so yeah
that's the only way to get over us to
adopt it and and definitely converts to
samsung with the current Exynos 5 which
just was not very impressive yeah and
then let's go over the new Qualcomm
Snapdragon processors basically that it
are a kind of a name change on the
series was the name change for those who
are keeping track of their Snapdragon
processor sets yeah so you got to get a
grid with two three and four you get 200
400 600 and 800
which is not to be confused with Krait
300 and create 400 mm-hmm so the two and
four hundred weren't really detailed
they're going to be lower end processors
so obviously hath one's there Austin
thusi asst you're going to care about
the 600 is basically just a stepped-up
version of the current s4 pro so it's
the same processors tweaked for a little
bit more efficiency and over clouds a
little bit but otherwise pretty much the
same setup I it will produce forty
percent more power than the s4 pro while
consuming less battery that's a nice
plus mmhmm yeah I mean a lot of that
power bump is coming from the clock in
Cascadia increase rate you're going up
to 1.9 instead of 1.5 that's big hunk
it's almost thirty three percent right
there and then the the 800 800 is using
the new Krait 400 cores which are
individually capable of running up to
two point three gigahertz that's
craziness four cores at 2.3 gigahertz
each and that'll be a seventy percent
increase from the s4 pros which is
freaking crazy huge and that's also
paired with the new Adreno 330 GPU so
you know a joke about hey is that a
server in your pocket well yeah the 30s
faster like twice as fast as the 322 and
it's also matched with their third
generation LTE radio that supports LTE
Advanced it supports LTE carrier
aggregation um so a lot of new radio
tech is bundled into that Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 as well another cool
thing to note is the fact that Qualcomm
claimed to have 50 devices set up for
running the 600 and the 800 product
lines which is cool just vanity yeah and
that's awesome yeah in terms of timeline
they're expecting devices with the 600
to be hitting the market sometime q2 and
the 800 sometime probably q3 Nora and I
don't have any details on the time
for the tiger for work or for the when
is at the Exynos 5 octa core yeah the
octa-core yeah wait so Derek uh Google
TVs there were a lot of them yeah
interesting stuff with that so I got to
play with the majority of them the
Hisense TV they also had the pulse there
as well but we've already reviewed the
pulse the new TVs from LG a new set-top
box from TLC as well as asus or a sous
depending on what school you're from so
let's talk about the TV's the Hisense TV
it's the same specs as is the pulse they
all use the same sfc the same Marvel
chipset and has four gigs of storage one
gigabyte of RAM 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
like I said they're all the same thing
now the pulse is stock Google TV it's a
stock experience but the new hisense
Google TV is not it slightly skinned
it's it's a not as well excuse me the
pulse what is that the Hisense pulse
that's the set-top box ah and the
Hisense TV TV is a you know it's a it's
a TV that comes in between 32 and 65
inches in q1 the TV's will be available
the pulse is available now just a
set-top box alone for a hundred bucks
TVs will range in a wide variety of
prices like I sets from 32 inch to 65
inch it comes with version 3 right out
of the box and the neatest thing that I
saw I was most impressed with was a
social stream app so you're watching TV
or you're watching YouTube or whatever
whatever you're doing and you have an
app open you can launch the social
stream app by hitting the social button
on the TV and your Twitter and Facebook
streams overlay so if you're watching a
sporting van or something and you want
to see what people are talking about you
know as the as the game goes on
you know you can have that right there
now sadly there was no Google+ stream i
was i was sad but hey not everybody
knows about this network apparently
Tommy hasn't loosen API to me Oh a
public API is available now is that just
your general stream from Twitter or is
that like you know I'm watching you can
do hash Talz game and it's gonna
automatically pull the hashtag for that
football game I don't know if it
automatically pulls it but you can't but
you can add a search you can add a
hashtag so if you say I'm only looking
for a hashtag hashtag Android you know
like like that tablet that Johnathan
Franklin has you know do I know I mean
they'd be an interesting way to sort of
add on the UI exclaiming yeah so but
it's a it's related to it I mean it's
not an overly extensive you know you I
modification on the widgets they had
some extra widgets you can put on there
so you could be watching your live TV in
one widget and have used you know three
or four other widgets on there as well I
liked it up it's definitely not bad like
I said the q1 it'll be available now LG
has actually one more thing about the
remote the the Hisense TV remote is
almost exactly the same as the pulse
remote there's maybe three new buttons
but it looks and feels exactly the same
same dimension same to your drop design
everything so if you need a new TV you
know and you want a smart TV with Google
built-in you have that available LG as I
said has had a new TV the GAA 6400
series will be available in 42 inches to
60 inches um they have a more in-depth
skin more in-depth you I it's highly
customized the TV's themselves have
almost no bezel at all it's they're
using LG's cinema screen design is that
it's a premium design to their new new
models and it looks a lot sleeker and a
lot more modern um as I said the UI is
updated and it's slightly different from
the current G to the remote as well has
been slightly revamped
and one thing I noticed is that I'm a
big fan of plex it actually comes with
Plex and flex is like a four or five
dollar app so it comes with plex right
out of the box that's nice plexus it
allows you to stream media from your
local network it actually soon Plex is
going to do cloud syncing on Android as
well so Google TV will actually get that
in the Plex rep said that that should be
coming by the end of the month but the
LG TVs are very nice i was impressed in
in there they're nice products I I would
probably buy one if I over the over the
Hisense TV um if I needed to get a new
TV moving on to set top boxes yeah TLC
they hold are heavy what's that cool
like the TV channel The Learning Channel
another music group oh they're a company
from China is not the Learning Channel
no it's not it's not it's not to learn
it's not the learning channel just like
in here you haven't heard of a company
before it might be from China so yeah
that's fair boy well and actually you
have to you have to call it right it's
not TCL I mean it's not TLC Learning
Channel it'sit's TCL I oh that's so now
I've heard of it right now um yes I made
a mistake it's TCL it's still a company
that you most likely haven't heard of
kind you said because it's a small
chinese manufacturer just like hisense
you know there are a chinese
manufacturer as well um once again all
these Google TVs have nearly the same
specs so you know it's the same specs as
the pulse within the vizio co-star using
the same Marvel system-on-chips it does
have a slight skin not as much as LG's
version but the coolest thing about this
is they're going to come with something
called personal office box which is
facial recognition for personalized
experiences for people in your house so
right now if you use prime time it
customizes you know lying
uh watching habits to me so it it knows
what you know what I want to watch and
gives TV shows and movies based on me
but my wife and I have vastly different
television morphing habits you know I
don't watch god what's that woman
channel like I don't want I don't want
to lighten up in SF I feel I don't you
know did you be depressed right like
crazy haha oh no another movie about
cancer see that so so if we have that
then we would have personalized you know
habits and it recognizes by our face and
say okay katie's here that's my wife's
name so let's uh give her all the new
latest lifetime movies or something it
whatever so that's that's neat it's got
a personalized experience um and in the
remote is vastly different from any
Google TV remote now they told me the
remote is not final I actually wasn't
even allowed to take a picture of it or
video of it but they because the design
is not final but the current design does
not have a keyboard on the back so
that's quite different from every other
Google TV remote which she allows you to
type um it's it's very very thin you
know slim sleek looking oh it has it's
very minimal as a few buttons on it it
reminds me of a lot like a larger more
butta nized Apple TV remote and the the
asus qube last but not least of the
google TV announcements from CES we once
again you had the asus was one of the
ones where you had to go to their suite
in the Trump Tower on the 60 second
floor to do a review so I only got to
hold it in my hand and talk to the to
the rap i didn't get to actually use the
UI myself but i dunno i do know the
specs are the exact same as the vizio
co-star in the pulse once again these
guys all opposition in this market
what's that there's a lot of innovation
in this market well their own they're
all rocking the same internals basically
um but the cube is different it's a cube
it cost thirty dollars more than its
competitors that thirty dollars what's
the quarter one hisense quarter one the
pulse will be getting version 3 here in
a week Plex will be getting a major
update to allow cloud syncing and cloud
streaming so if you use like if you use
box.net or dropbox you know or any of
those other services you'll be able to
sync your movies out there and stream
them from there from your own linking of
personal clouds torch but there's a lot
of things happening in Google TV you
know keeps changing and evolving I'm
sure over the next year we'll see a lot
of changes in with google TV who knows
where we'll be at quick question from
YouTube we're talking about this a
little bit earlier pre-show um we guys
think will be the first phone or tablet
pushed to the market with the news nap
during an 800 series I think pre-show
were talking we're so tablet yeah I
think they'll probably come in a tablet
first but i do think it'll be in thongs
thank you a phone HTC would probably be
the first one to come because they're
pretty tight and Qualcomm that's truly
but the first the is-4 pros was not yeah
that's true the LG as LG I personally
think it'll be in a tablet first yeah
yeah and then we'll see how on that and
then they'll you know trickle-down
effect oh yeah yeah I wouldn't be
surprised to see it in cuz I only
thought first again like it was the last
four prob I want immediate ugh so that's
uh do we have any community tech you
know actually I'll tell you something
that we did we didn't talk about him we
have a very short video of it here at
Android authority i don't know if it's
going to be turned into a review or not
i only played around it for a few
minutes there's a there's a very
interesting device running a rockchip i
believe a processor out of China
and it it's a tablet running android
that looks almost as much as it can to
look like Windows 8 there's two it's a
tile launcher and every different home
screen has tiles on it for various apps
so on the home screen is you know your
favorite apps and you flick to the one
side and you have all your office apps
flick the other side has all your games
and your tools and it's a tiled
interface it was a it was a from a
manufacturer out of China and was it
very fast and you know it was okay it
was a just was a little different that's
all you know it was a Windows 8 ified
skin on top of Android or just something
different yeah nothing too exciting in
that tile all the things give yourself a
bestest exposure so in terms of apps
this week you know there any major real
players besides chrome beta chrome beta
um it's fast much faster than chrome
yeah I'm curious what what's happening
under the hood that it's so much faster
in the Play Store no not in the place
where you actually have to have a direct
link yeah if you search for it won't
come up so yeah yeah if yeah watch me
put the link in the comments uh just so
people can find it if you haven't found
it yet yeah it's a faster maybe it
really is there's a lot more permissions
to but i try i trust google it
definitely you know renders wonders
large web pages faster i like it i can't
wait for those changes to come
downstream to the final version and you
can have them both installed too unlike
the desktop version you know you can't
have both installed you can have both
beta channel in the stable channel
installed this is like the people that
were happiest or notice the biggest
difference for people with like dual
core phones or say like a Galaxy Nexus
or something along those lines or
another thing might have just been
crowing was just really just pushing it
to the mat
I don't think we want to notice as much
if your online account or chrome is not
that power hungry or it shouldn't be
that shouldn't be no no but uh it seems
like those are the users that are
because I mean I noticed a little bit of
difference on my note 2 but it chrome
wasn't nearly a slow monotube as it was
on my galaxy taxes it was night and day
curls that's a one-loss calling about
ces for those of you that didn't get a
chance to go um wow we walked a lot oh I
think I developed shin splints I don't
know know know that the my legs were
killing me by the end of the week feed
for me man it was someone tried to give
us a tip no not to bring backpacks and I
think it was right cuz oh my goodness
yeah Chris see will said to not bring
backpacks he said to bring it you know
like I could carry on luggage jim has
like a little stroller on it yeah we
only ate a lot of really good food um we
we had a lot of fun the evenings though
there's a lot of partying to be done you
know you had to work hard all day review
in tech and then you got rewarded to
stay out until the Sun came up partying
it made for a that they made for an
interesting few days it was a good time
I said I'd it for time at Josh actually
the first time I met everybody from the
android authority team we we all had a
hell with time together knows it was
good yeah it was really great to meet
the whole team and everybody and I'm
really looking forward to the next time
we all get to get together and do it you
know we need to make it you know android
authority meet up and maybe we've invite
invite dan and Scott and John along next
time you know absolutely tag belongs
just like third wheels actually I've met
I met I've met damn before uh met John
if we're having met Scott damned if I
want to do that he's angry but anyway
alright well the cisco working we're
gonna everybody finest I because we're
watching us right now probably watching
us on youtube or google+ you can watch
us on
Plus page Andrew authority that's where
most the comments come from you can also
comment on YouTube we do see those
comments as well subscribe to our
youtube channel andhra thority also we
are available as a podcast on soundcloud
also on podbean also on itunes and to
get our show updates our summary of the
show go to android authority com scroll
on to the bottom right and it'll be a
little on air section and you can read a
little snippets there you know what I'm
gonna go ahead and just go ahead and let
the cat out of the bag watch android
authority calm for a awesome revamped
user interface that's not right website
yeah revamp website there we go revamped
website coming in the very near future
we got to take a look at this week and i
think is pretty awesome Josh what about
you I actually you know what I think I
was so busy editing that even get to get
to take a look at it oh well take my
word for it's pretty cool I'm is
anything like I saw before it looks good
yep alright guys have a good night and
have a good weekend so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
