name is Kevin the tech ninja and today
we are starting a brand new series
called Android one-on-one and on this
first episode we're going to cover the
very basics of Android right when you
turn your phone on setting up your
Android device and I'm showing you a few
things on the interface so you can
better understand the phone so if you're
brand new to Android I want to welcome
you to Android authority and welcome to
the world of Android if you had Android
before and you want a refresher well
then good for you to our kids put on
your learning caps because we're going
back to school all right so as I said in
the intro this is the basics of Android
we are starting back at square one
so first let's understand what Android
is Android is an operating system based
on the Linux kernel Android is not a
phone nor is it an application and the
most simplistic way I can say this in
regards to a phone an operating system
is where all your phone functions live
your calls your Texas your applications
anything that you input onto your device
is going into the operating system the
operating system is processing that
information and putting it into a
readable format Android operating system
versions have code names as well so you
may hear someone refer to Android as
jellybean or as Kit Kat that's just the
name of the current version of Android
you're on it still has a number
associated with it whether it's 4.2 or
4.3 the major manufacturers of Android
usually has a skin on top of the
operating system which some will argue
enhances the current version of Android
these skins all have different names but
still under the skin is running a
version of Android don't the names like
TouchWiz since motoblur confuse you it's
all Android all right now that you know
what Android is let me show you how it
works before you begin these steps I'm
showing you are on an Android device
that does not have a skin if your phone
has the skin it may look a bit different
but the options and the settings will be
similar and you should be able to still
follow along the first step we will do
is select our language select the arrow
or the play button to continue at this
point we are able to select the Wi-Fi
network if you are near a Wi-Fi area I
do recommend that you actually connect
to
because during this wizard is going to
pull down all of your Google information
and that can take up a lot of data and
time select your Wi-Fi network and type
in your password the next step ask if
you have a Google account if you use
Gmail the answer is yes if you don't
have a Google account I recommend making
one at this point the way the Android
works is centralized around Google so
all of your emails come through calendar
pictures and also applications if you
ever did get a new Android phone or you
wiped your current phone it's going to
pull that information back down for you
if you don't have an account there's
nothing to backup to and pretty much you
can lose all of your information if you
get a new phone you can set this up on
your computer or even your phone
directly since I have an account I will
select yes and then I'll enter my email
address and password now a quick thing
for the keyboards to access the numbers
press the question mark one two three
button on the bottom left and to return
back to the normal keyboard press the
ABC button in the exact same location
once the password is type proceed to the
next step now we are at the Google
services screen this screen lets you set
a few options the first option of
backing up your information like
downloads contact information and
restore is if you had an Android device
that's backed up already then this will
restore it now depending on who you are
and how you feel about security step two
and three is a decision you make on your
own now if you have location turned off
a lot of applications that use the
surrounding area around you may have
issues like if you're on the Yellow
Pages application it has a feature where
searches around you also Maps and Google
when you do a Google search for a store
it will show you the closest ones to
your area now we can name our phone and
you can personalize it if you're logged
in with your gmail account it should
have the first and last name you have on
your Google account this part of the
wizard explains one of the most useful
features that has came to Android in
recent years Google now in the next two
slides it explains what it is in
somewhat vague detail it tells you
information as you need it based on
activities it tells you your weather
location for work home or current and
also where you plan on traveling it
brings in sports scores for teams you
care about and also news and information
on things you've recently searched it
gives you traffic information on your
commute to and
work is pretty much a hub of information
that is all in your phone ready when you
need it now we are at our home screen
this is called the launcher at the top
we have our notification bar this shows
us any of our notifications and also it
shows us our status icons like Wi-Fi
signal and battery and time we can use
our finger and drag the bar down to see
what these icons actually mean a lot of
these notifications can be swiped away
or you can press it to access the
application that a corresponds to in
this notification bar you can access
some quick toggles these toggles depends
on the version of Android and skin you
are using some toggles may be visible by
the phones may require you to press a
more button you can simply press icons
to launch different settings as always
this depends on the version of Android
you're using so I understand when people
say the fragmentation and Android make
things difficult for some people yes
their settings are in different places
depending on your phone at the bottom of
our device we have our dock icons these
are icons that will follow you on your
home screen these should be applications
that you access the most and no matter
what homescreen you're on they're going
to be visible to move between your home
screens just swipe your finger to the
left and to the right when you reach the
end of the screen it would no longer go
to the next screen also there are
corresponding dots to show you which
screen you are currently located on
press the home button to return back to
the main screen the home button on
Android looks like a little square but
some devices have a physical button and
that could be a circle it could be a
square could be a rectangle it just
depends on the phone but it should be
located on the middle bottom part of
your device to launch an application
simply press on the application with
your finger this will open the
application up and you are now in this
program to get out of it go ahead and
press on the home button or to go back
to the previous screen press on the back
button okay this concludes the initial
part 1 of Android getting started we
just went through setting up for the
very first time and also general
navigation to the home screen as I said
before depending on what version of
Android you are running and also which
device it is it may look a little bit
different but pretty much they all have
Android underneath
the skin and it should operate the same
way once again guys my name is Kevin the
tech ninja I want to wish your family a
happy holidays no matter what holiday it
is and also a Happy New Year if you're
watching this video when it was first
posted and then is it guys this is
Android authority your source for all
things Android you can find me on
youtube and on google+ take care guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
