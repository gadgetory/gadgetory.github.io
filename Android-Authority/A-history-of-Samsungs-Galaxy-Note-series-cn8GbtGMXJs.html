trend of phone companies producing
thinner lighter more compact phones but
that all changed with the introduction
of the Samsung Galaxy Note series
Samsung definitely started a different
trend where bigger was definitely better
hey guys john b here from android
authority and this is a quick history of
Samsung's Galaxy Note series with
trouble back to 2011 for the original
note prior to it most people agreed that
phones with 4.3 inch displays were
considered big but of course that all
changed with the note and it's 5.3 inch
display yes it was massive and even some
people thought that it was kind of
nauseous but it introduces us to two
things the first being this new category
that they called phablets a device that
was smaller than a 7-inch compact tablet
but still bigger than most of
smartphones at the time and secondly it
reintroduced us to the stylus because
with the capacitive screens it pretty
much made the stylist obsolete but with
the note it was an enhanced stylus the
s-pen was pressure sensitive so it
bought that and some additional
functionality that we didn't see before
but the biggest thing about the note was
that it was a conversation starter it
wasn't really all that successful when
it came to when it came to sales and it
was still a niche product but it got
people talking because of its gigantic
size you pull in your pocket user for a
phone call it definitely raised a lot of
eyebrows as for the note 2 it was more
of an iterative product than anything
else it had all the improvements should
expect so that meant a beefier battery a
faster processor double the RAM the
display went from 5.3 inches up to 5.5
inches it was still relatively the same
size as the original and you also had
more s-pen centric functions that
include a new air view function which
basically allowed you to hover the S Pen
over the screen so you get useful
information like email previews or
calendar appointment previews
besides that the phone itself was by and
large more evolutionary than
revolutionary so the Samsung Galaxy Note
3 arrived in the fall of 2013 and it had
a lot of first for the series so the
first one being a 1080p resolution of
the screen you had also an IR blaster so
it doubled as a universal remote it had
also a micro USB 3.0 port for faster
charging and data connectivity and it
also had the new multi window feature
with TouchWiz which really enhanced its
productivity side so what everyone were
most about the note 3 was the attention
to the design for the first time you
kind of had that sophisticated look
because now it had this stitching
pattern around the back instead of being
completely plastic they add that element
of a businesslike device like a
BlackBerry smartphone because now you
have this faux leather like material
which kind of complemented its
sophisticated law but besides that it's
pretty much an iterative smartphone all
the specs were a boost it was just that
attention to that sophisticated look
that we listed out the most now a lot of
people probably say that Note 5 was the
best in the series but for me it was the
note 4 that's because it featured a lot
at first and it was just an impressive
foam I don't anywhere you look at from
the design to the spec sheet it was just
a powerhouse no compromise smartphone
and shaniek because it started that
change for Samsung with the design
language we had now this metal trim
bezel and on top of that it was just a
feature switch handset which had a
fingerprint sensor of quad HD screen
heart rate sensor an IR blaster pretty
much the Swiss Army knife for
smartphones along with the note 4
Simpson announced a valiant the Samsung
Galaxy Note edge it matched the note 4
spec sheet but it did have one
compelling feature that was the curved
screen and with that it brought on some
practical features although some people
thought of it as being gimmicky back
then you had notifications but this edge
transformed into something more when you
open certain apps like the camera so you
have some additional buttons and
functions available there rather than
cluttering up the viewfinder besides
that the phone
which operated similarly to the note 4
but it did cost a lot more and it
definitely started this whole trend of
curved screens for Samsung and then
there was the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 now
we know why this phone is beloved that's
because of the new premium design
language it has it followed after the
new Galaxy S a six line with that metal
meat glass package post slightly tweaked
because on the back they kind of curved
it rounded to give that slowly more
ergonomic feel and for once it felt like
a premium smartphone but besides that it
had great specs new features like
wireless charging and a slightly tweaked
s-pen implementation but overall it was
just a great performing smartphone that
had a equally compelling design with it
and that's a brief look at the history
of Samsung's Galaxy Note series we know
that the next generation Note it's going
to be announced very soon but before all
that what was your favorite device in
series mine was the note 4 for all the
obvious reasons so if you guys wanna
