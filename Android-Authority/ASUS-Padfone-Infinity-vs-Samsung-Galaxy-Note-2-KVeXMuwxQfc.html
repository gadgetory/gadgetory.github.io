cuvee we're live here on the ground at
Mobile World Congress and we got a back
seat to asus booth here which is kind of
cool and we're taking a closer look at
the Padfone infinity an interesting
concept from Asus that packs really the
latest generation hardware with a 1080p
5-inch display boasting a pixel density
of 441 pixels-per-inch it's got
snapdragon 600 inside two gigs around
beautiful brushed aluminum 13 megapixel
camera LED flash obviously internally
we're looking at a two thousand four mil
a power battery a really really nice
thin profile too so we just wanted to
compare this stuff for you with the
galaxy note 2 a device which I
personally own and I love though I am
getting a little sick and tired of its
large size in terms of its width I find
that it's very difficult to use with
and but two hundred operations beautiful
web browsing media consumption I really
do like everything about it and even
though it is boasting only a an Exynos
quad-core 1.6 30 Hertz processor with a
9 it doesn't really compare in terms of
benchmarks or the performance of what
the padfone infinity is packing though
it does have the aspect functionality so
for the samsung and has a 1280 x 720
AMOLED panel of the newer generation so
it is of the non pentile matrix variety
so it has really really bright whites
and really really rich colors so this is
a panel that's been sourced by sharp and
as you can see there's an IPS panel
excellent viewing angles all the way
through and a really really really rich
color thief galaxy note only has an 8
megapixel camera on the rear internally
has a very large battery 3,100 me lamps
so it will actually last very long
despite the fact that has a 5.5 inch
panel
so this is just a quick hands-on
comparison of the galaxy note 2 or
versus the infinity pattern excuse me
the padfone infinity my name is Darcy
