something you're gonna care about
whether you are a geek or a regular
civilian and it turns out that alphabet
that's Google's parent company has now
gotten into the business of telling you
and me what to think when it comes to
Isis and terrorism well you may or may
not agree with their message and Google
certainly hopes that you don't but Isis
and its followers have proven to be much
more tech savvy than other terrorist
groups they have managed to indoctrinate
hordes of new recruits via social media
and Google has been working hard on
countering them it's called the redirect
method and Google is now preparing its
release to North America the redirect
method created by alphabets subsidiary
jigsaw looks for keywords users commonly
search for when they're looking to learn
more about Isis and other terrorist
groups along with delivering their
search results redirect methods presents
potential recruits with counter
programming in the form of YouTube
channels and videos meant to steer
people away from extremism so who
decides what's an extremist whose
extreme is there an elected body of
officials who decide what's extreme no
we're talking Google is going to decide
what's extreme you see some problems
with that pretty scary
I mean it's cliche but it's the truth
one person's terrorist is another
person's freedom fighter I lived in
other countries for an extended period
of time that a really different culture
and I can tell you I learned something
really valuable
we are not as more civilized and
culturally superior and more educated
here like we think we are compared to
some other more developing countries we
have a lot to learn from them and this
is one of these cultural things we only
believe what the news media tells us
that so-and-so is bad so once those
extreme but what we do is not bad an
extreme it's a hard thing and so when
you give the kind of power to Google
like they have here to decide what
people see that's gonna Forge thoughts
and opinions it's absolutely terrifying
so here's more on how it will work
during an eight week pilot the redirect
method searched over 1,700 keywords and
targeted about 320
thousand people believed to be at
imminent risk of Isis indoctrination
those individuals were shown ads that
sought to refute the terrorist groups
propaganda including personal accounts
from youtubers who managed to escape
Isis claimed territory now it isn't just
combating Isis propaganda as the program
heads to the States jigsaw hopes
redirect method will help steer
potential recruits away from domestic
terror groups also although this may
strike some is eerily close to thought
policing and social engineering jigsaw
says they aren't trying to forcibly
guide people's thoughts per se jigsaws
Yasmin green head of research and
development said that quote the branding
philosophy for the entire pilot project
was not to appear judgmental or
moralistic but really to pique interests
of individuals who have questions
questions that are being raised and
answered by the Islamic state oh no no
no that is just some watered-down
diplomatic way to say we're gonna
control what you think but it's ok
because it's for a good cause
think back to the late 90s for those of
you who are living at that time there
was some conspiracy theories when the
internet really broke out and became
mainstream saying you know what the
Internet's gonna be used by the
governments to watch you if they don't
like your political band or political
thoughts they're gonna watch and track
you Wow the Snowden revelations told us
no it's much worse than that
they're watching everyone everywhere all
the time
so now the question is if Google is
doing this and they're telling you
they're doing it what are they doing
that they're not telling you what could
they do with this information
besides just protecting us from Isis
well you have a different political view
boom we can redirect to try and shape
your political views that suits Google's
needs you have different economic views
business views well we can steer what
you see to favor Google and Google's
interests it's a slippery slope it's
dangerous you shouldn't like it you
should be upset about it educate
yourself think for yourself let me know
what you think in the comments below

much everyone hates day to day admin
