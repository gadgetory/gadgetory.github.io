this is Clayton over at Android
Authority comm and today we're going to
be showing you the Android 2.3
Gingerbread operating system
head-to-head with the Android 4.0 Ice
Cream Sandwich operating system now a
lot of you guys know that the Ice Cream
Sandwich operating system is available
on the Galaxy Nexus and they're pushing
it out to a lot of phones recently now I
know some of you guys are still waiting
and because of that the majority of you
are running on Android 2.3 Gingerbread
like this Samsung Galaxy S so I'm just
going to show you the basic rundown on
these two operating systems and put them
head-to-head against each other
first off you're going to notice that
the user interface on each of these is
extremely different now the very first
thing that stands out is that the fonts
on Ice Cream Sandwich are in a font
called Roboto now this is something new
that Google has pushed out to the
Android 4.0 operating system and it
looks really nice um mind you I am using
a separate home launcher for the
Gingerbread operating system here I'm
using ADW launcher because the TouchWiz
or the motoblur or the HTC Sense are all
going to be the manufacturers own
variant on Android 2.3 and since we're
pitting it against a vanilla version of
Android 4.0 I'm going to be using the
ADW launcher in order to you know get a
fair comparison now first off we'll just
scroll through our tabs here as you can
see they're both pretty smooth but the
Android Ice Cream Sandwich has a few
more fancy transitions now that is
because I'm running Apex Launcher but I
have not changed the transitions
whatsoever
from the stock Android 4.0 you can see
down here we have capacitive buttons on
the samsung fascinate so with Android
4.0 Google was going with a more
onscreen approach to soft keys now they
both work just about as fast with the
Android 4.0 being a little bit ahead now
I don't have these devices bloated up
with anything whatsoever so I just
thought I would do that to give you guys
a good comparison
anyways I'll compare our drop-down menus
here you can see that on Android 4.0 we
have the option of disabling or hiding
our toggles here and we have a whole row
up here we're on the gingerbread we have
this row up here and they're kind of
just obtrusive there they're not as sexy
as the Ice Cream Sandwich toggles
okay so I'm downloading an application
to each of these phones just so I can
show you guys the difference in the
notification bar when we're actually
downloading an application I don't want
it to happen too fast because I want it
to actually get a good view of what the
notification bar looks like when we have
that so as this is the difference in our
status bar pull down status bar now you
see right here that on the status bar
for the Android 3.2 you cannot click and
swipe away to remove notifications you
can only click and open the notification
but here on Android 4.0 we just slide to
the left or right to remove those and
the same with our task managers now what
we would do to kill process to kill apps
that are running is open up our task
manager on Android 4.0 by pressing our
open windows button and we can just
swipe left to right to remove them now
on the samsung fascinate running Android
3.2 we would have to download a
third-party applications manager and
with that it would also kill our home
app see this does not count home
launchers as apps that are running to
kill but here if I were to press X it
would kill our atw launch Ori X okay so
next to compare our our widgets our
folders at our multitasking
functionality so if I go to the left
here I've added a calendar widget on
each of my phones here now as you can
see the calendar has been completely
redesigned for a nice clean user
interface on the Android 4.0 and it has
the old gingerbread design here on the
Android Gingerbread operating system now
I have the same exact item on each of
them it's both Tuesday April 4 but you
can see that it's a nice minimalist
design over here and it's kind of a you
know gaudy design here on the Android
3.2 now the functionality with
replacement home launchers is the
ability to resize widgets so I can edit
here and I can actually make this bigger
or smaller or wider and I can also do
the same here on the Ice Cream Sandwich
and I'll just go ahead and make that an
entire page and it'll make this one
entire page
so they both don't look terrible but you
can see that the user interface and the
redesigned perfectly clean Android
experience here on the Android 4.0 is a
little bit nicer and it's definitely
improved so next on our list is the
ability to add folders now with the Apex
Launcher I'm running here we can create
a folder right from the home screen by
dragging an item so I'll drag Chrome
Beta and I'll drive the clock and you
just hover over another icon and it
creates a folder once you open the
folder you can name it whatever you want
is click folder and you can choose new
folder and it's right up there and you
can bring browser over to the new folder
and books over to the new folder so now
we have browser and books folder but
it's definitely not as nice-looking as
the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich um
it's kind of obtrusive it's just a bland
little you know folder right there and
this is this nice clean user interface
that we have going on with the Android
Ice Cream Sandwich alright so next I'll
just go through the display of the
settings menus on each of the operating
systems as you can see on the Wi-Fi for
the Galaxy Nexus Android 4.0 it's
different than the samsung fascinate
which aggregated it into a bunch of
different wireless and network settings
now we'll go back to the wireless and
network here on the fascinate and see
that that's where you'll access your
airplane mode and your mobile networks
and opposed on the Android 4.0 your
mobile network and data is actually
monitored and you can put a cap on it
and you can kill background data so here
it can show you everything that's
consuming your data how much you have
consumed as well as the warning limit
there and you can set a data limit here
and when you do that you can choose as I
said previously to restrict the
background data on applications so you
can restrict background data for the
Google Play or anything else that's
consuming your mobile data going back we
will go to the sound settings on the
Android Gingerbread operating system as
well as on the 4.0 and you can see that
there's a somewhat significant
differences and on the 4.0 we can
disable dialpad touch tones and vibrate
on touch which is the same as haptic
feedback for Android Gingerbread where
we can actually change our vibration
intensity
and the audible selection as well as
audible touch tones
okay next we'll go to our storage
options and on the Android Gingerbread
is the SD card and phone storage and on
the Android 4.0 it'll show you a
breakdown of everything go to the
language and input and language and
keyboard we're here you can choose your
default keyboards on both of them but
it's a different setup and user
interface next we'll go to our settings
about phone menu where you can see we're
running 4.0.4 and you can see I'm the
gingerbread running firmware version
2.3.5 so next we'll go into some of the
developer options included in Android
4.0 that are lacking on Android
Gingerbread so you can choose what gets
root access as well as a mock locations
a couple other stuff like show touches
and that shows you where your finger is
actually touching on the screen you can
show the screen updates in case you have
any dead pixels you can show the CPU
usage which shows it up there in the top
right corner you can force GPU rendering
for 2d hardware acceleration you can
also choose to kill apps via your back
button and that's basically it you guys
I hope you enjoyed the review and if you
did check out more from Android
