to slim down inside and out LG has
decided to go the opposite route in the
hope that they will provide users a
phone that is quite literally everything
to everybody this is Josh regard from
Android thority what's going on
everybody and this is the LG g4 it seems
what worked in the last two high-end
releases from LG have come together to
create this brand new device curves
different kinds of backings and a large
form factor are all par for the course
here the 5.5 inch screen dictates the
size of the whole phone along with its
handling with the pretty slim bezel all
around however it manages to keep pretty
narrow especially compared to its
predecessor it is a bit taller than the
g3 but that is mitigated by a very
subtle curve no you won't be getting the
same immersive quality that was found to
the more acute angle of the G flex 2 but
LG claims that even this small curvature
will afford the g4 the same benefits of
durability 20% more than any other slab
smartphone the sides do remain quite
thick but there are no buttons to be
found on the sides and this is because
the LG signature button layout returns
and is found right below the larger
camera optic package on the back with
power button flanked by volume rocker
the power button is pretty slim but
thankfully it feels just different
enough from the other buttons that it's
easy to find the right area to press and
it all falls squarely where the index
finger would lay making for a design
choice that continues to make sense and
continues to be aesthetically unique
what curves may be missing in the front
of the phone or best felt on the back
and despite its somewhat thicker profile
this curve definitely helps with the
handling and in the g4 we have one of
the best-handling large form factor
devices around now I tend to go back and
forth with phablets because I prefer to
have a good measure of one-handed usage
but the g4 manages to really toad that
line of comforts thankfully the phone
rest nicely in the hand and in the
pocket so the hand gymnastics required
don't bother as much backings for the g4
will come in a number of different
styles obviously the one that I have
right here is the titanium finished
plastic and as far as the plastic
versions go there is a gold and a white
ceramic finish available as well and all
of them have this very subtle grid
pattern on the back that you're seeing
in these close-up shots but the story
here is of course those leather backings
it is definitely the fashion statement
that LG is making with the g4 and the
leather comes in a slew of colorways
these backings might be a point of
contention for some because they are
actually sourced from cows and vegetable
tanned while I don't have a leather
backing we did enjoy the time we had
with it at the launch event and found
that everyone tends to prefer a
different color in the leather and what
might be LG's biggest design selling
point is the fact that these backings
are removable yes compared to other
flagships today you will be able to use
spare batteries and expand the storage
with microSD cards underneath those
covers the LG g4 is ultimately like a G
flex to only its design has been further
refined and has a less of your curve
though we do wonder if the leather
backing was more removed to prevent this
release from seeming to incremental even
if that were the case though LG's design
language remains distinctive and
recognizable and that ultimately makes
for a very attractive phone all around
in the g4 LG ups the ante in the display
Department with an even better iteration
of their quad HD display this time
called the quantum display underneath
showing names we still have a 2560 by
1440 resolution IPS display at 5.5
inches pumping up 538 pixels per inch
what makes this panel different comes
down to science quite literally LG's
presentation focused on how actual
molecules are being manipulated as it
passes through a phosphor layer the
result of being an even better color
gamut than typical IPS screens can
provide but what is probably easier to
understand is LG's philosophy on
displays this time around in the g4 they
are looking to adhere to the DCI
standard normally reserved for
television and cinema
whereas Samsung Super AMOLED displays of
the world go past this standard with its
overly saturated colors the g4 stays 98%
within those parameters to provide the
proper experience now without some real
knowledge of film standards it is hard
to really tell if LG has hit that mark
but the difference can be somewhat seen
in this comparison shot the Samsung
phone is a little more saturated for
sure what matters however is that the g4
s display is still powerful and pleasing
to the eye blacks are adequately shown
colors are definitely very vibrant and
all tasks look great on it a couple of
small nuances from the g3 return however
like a smoothening of the screen
elements that can be observed mostly
when viewing and scrolling through text
perhaps like the g3 it is
the sharpness on these types of areas to
lower power consumption of course knock
on and knock code also returns so double
tapping the screen to turn it on or
tapping a pattern at any time in order
to unlock the device are available big
words and scientific language aside the
display on the g4 is worthy of a
high-end flagship and there certainly
have been no complaints here from us
it's in performance that LG has taken a
bit of an unconventional route we might
expect the latest and greatest
processing packages to be found in these
high-end flagships but that just isn't
necessarily the case here on paper it
might look like LG took a step back with
a snapdragon 808 which is a six core
processor backed by three gigabytes of
RAM but as manufacturers seem to be
getting more these days it's more about
optimization rather than just sheer
power and with that LG's usually bloated
UX man just a truck along with the
smoothness and speed that might be a bit
surprising in my daily usage of the
phone there have been no hiccups or
stutters throughout and what little
delay I may have experienced came when
ABS needed to be reloaded from the
recent apps screen but even that pause
was pretty negligible so whatever close
relationship LG has the Qualcomm
definitely seems to obtain off browsing
among applications is a breeze even when
using the dual window functionality and
when gaming intensive games are not
hindered by the two core shortage as the
Adreno 418 is still able to do its job
in the graphics department despite many
of the LG elements remaining in this new
version of the UX the snappiness of it
all almost makes it feel otherwise and
it all makes a case that taking great
care and optimizing the processor to the
needs of the software and vice versa can
often be a better recipe for success we
already touched on this subject a bit
earlier and we're also sure that LG will
heavily push these features but the
removable battery and expandable storage
are this phone's main cornerstones the
expandable storage will be most useful
for photographers that will take
advantage of the raw capture ability of
the g4 souped-up camera but most
everyone will agree that it's nice to
have a buffer for space now it is
important for me to mention that this
version of the g4 is the Korean Edition
and as such as is par for the course
here these phones will not connect to
LTE networks here in the state so I had
to rely on HSPA+ connectivity which was
for the most part reliable but some of
the testing that I did here in this
hardware section will have to wait until
I get a stateside version of the phone
and
it Artest back onto it nonetheless
connections on the t-mobile network for
HSPA+ were still quite good and phone
calls were all pretty good as well and
the subtle curve of the phone is felt
when holding the phone to one's face
it's not quite a banana phone but it
sits well to the contours of the cheek
and the rear-facing speaker sounds
better than before with more body and
richness especially in the lower ends
and it's also quite loud unfortunately
still having it on the rear is a
hindrance and finally like I stated
already battery life will be further
tested in a stateside version of LG's
flagship but I can report that in my
specific case scenario with this one the
g4 did pretty well in my daily usage
while on Wi-Fi primarily especially here
at the house but also for HSPA
connectivity abroad I was able to get
about 3 hours of screen on time for a
total of about 16 hours of total usage
and that's because the standby time on
the LG g4 is actually quite great in
even a much heavier usage day the one I
mentioned where I did a lot of GPS
navigation almost an hour's worth to be
exact and also a lot of music streaming
in my car I still got about three hours
of screen on usage even though the total
time was back down to maybe about 10
hours nonetheless three hours of screen
on time is pretty good and with a good
standby time you can really get this
phone to go for a whole day with no
problems at all and of course you can
use a spare as well and you really might
want to take advantage of those spare
batteries because quick charging
capabilities are noticeably absent here
I have noticed that the phone charged
quicker than normal using higher power
current wall adapters like the Motorola
quick charger but it is definitely not
up to the speed of Qualcomm's 2.0 or
even other iterations like oboes vu
charger so stay tuned for a follow up
review on a US version of the g4 in the
coming weeks for even more it might be a
game of one-upmanship for LG as it tries
to provide more than specifically the
Korean brethren Samsung in the camera
department but ultimately we might all
be winners as LG brings yet another
high-quality camera to this year's
Android game you can already see it on
the back a larger camera package that
we've seen on any conventional Android
device and this larger sensor comes with
the F 1.8 aperture lens and is flanked
by a laser autofocus a flash and under
it a color spectrum sensor so the g4 has
quite a bit going for it physically as a
larger sensor will also benefit from an
even better
optical image stabilization first the
front-facing camera though it is a
megapixels providing a larger photo than
many competitors but also comes with a
couple gesture centric features bring up
the hand and close it to trigger our
countdown or do the gesture twice I take
four pictures in succession and then
bring down the phone immediately after
the shot to automatically review this
selfie this might be the more useful
feature because we still think that just
hitting the shutter button on the selfie
cam is just as quick and requires a
little bit less effort we still might
put the front-facing camera of the g4 as
one of the better iterations in Android
right now as it has good detail and a
wide enough perspective for group shots
but now the interface which brings with
it a few different modes simple allows
for tapping on subjects for quick laser
focusing and immediate snapping the auto
mode opens up a few more possibilities
which are easily seen via the controls
and then there's the manual mode it is
here that the budding photographer will
have a great many tools at its
fingertips everything from a histogram
for accurate levels to shutter speeds as
long as 30 seconds to a full white
balance Kelvin gamut are available for
tweaking the picture just right and all
of the changes will show in the
viewfinder so there is little guesswork
to be had in this manual mode and even
then if you're not happy with the JPEG
that comes out you can shoot
simultaneously in RAW format which opens
up the possibilities even more as the
photographer can take the raw capture
and prep and mess with every setting
available in a program like Lightroom
of course the RAW files will be huge so
expandable storage makes a lot of sense
in that case white balance is a very
important aspect of this camera as the
IR backed color spectrum sensor works to
analyze the entire scene and get
accurate color reproduction and the very
act of taking pictures is still a breeze
here because of the laser guided
autofocus indeed using this camera
neither the auto or simple modes brings
one of the easiest picture-taking
experiences available and the resulting
pictures do happen to be quite great and
good - even better lighting the 16
megapixel photos are really pleasing
especially with the low aperture lending
to nice depth of field perspectives for
close or far focus when zooming in one
can find that a noise reduction is still
at work here as the grain is smooth out
this de tracks just a little bit from
the overall sharpness of the image but
doesn't do so to a large degree this is
better seen in lower light situations
where the camera also seemingly opts to
have
slower shutter speed instead of just
higher iso making clear shots a bit
tougher to capture because you have to
keep a steady as possible and then lower
light prominent light sources are a bit
blown out but again not to a terrible
degree we give the g4 high marks for
having a great camera interface and a
fast picture taking experience its
photos are ultimately quite great but
fall just short of being the top and
best in Android today because it still
has a bit of smudgy post-processing
going on make no mistake about it
however the g4 camera is definitely one
of the best companions a user can have
in the pocket and finally in software we
focus on the speed of the LG UX but
there are a few new additions in the g4
mainly the calendar app has been updated
to use just about any captured area of
the phone as reminders on dates it takes
away from having to fill in a lot of
information but those who prefer high
organization might still opt for those
textual elements and the gallery has
been given categories for easy looking
back at one's memory so it is generally
better organized overall as well
LG's continued relationship with Google
it's easily seen here in the g4 with
chrome being the default browser and
integrations with Google Drive baked in
not to mention a free 100 gigabytes of
drive for two years but the UX largely
looks the way it did in the G flex 2
with new lollipop stud elements and
plenty of features all around dual
window adds to multitasking and then
there are plenty of contextual features
included in the smart notice widgets now
there are more reasons for the widget to
tell you pieces of information as it
will give you suggestions not only for
current weather conditions but also warn
the user of when applications in the
background are continuously draining
battery these suggestions aren't bad per
se but they might not be quite as useful
as LG thinks they would be for everyone
qslide apps also return so if you do
need to have a floating window for
things like a dialer or a calculator the
line of applications will add extra
girth to the notification drop-down and
finally there is the smart bulletin
which is a second screen to the far left
that brings information from a number of
sources including LG health and plenty
of tips for better usage of the phone
it's a better way of showing these
features than have been before but
thankfully it can also be turned off in
the settings the LG UX offers a lot
without getting too far into the users
face which has been a gradual but is a
very welcome change still its snappiness
because of the optimization with the
Snapdragon
way is definitely felt here so the LG g4
just continues this trend of very fast
Android iterations for 2015 the LG g4
will come in at the premium price for a
flagship on carriers and as we have been
told it will be the same price unlocked
as the LG g3 was when it was first
released obviously the main competitors
in the space include Samsung and HTC who
have released their flagship devices
earlier this year
it's been a great year so far with
flagships in 2015 with every phone
bringing different offerings to the
table and the del G g4 is trying to
bring the most the great camera
experience is backed by yet another
speedy iteration of Android in a body
that remains recognizable and attractive
due to LG's signature design language if
what are missing in other flagships kept
you from buying them the g4 just might
be the phone that you're looking for it
isn't a big leap from the previous
versions of the G but then again plenty
of this year's releases haven't been
either but if you want something unique
the g4 is among the best choices you
have today with expansion options only
sweetening the deal and if you had any
doubt that LG was falling behind in the
competition the g4 is surely an example
that they haven't lost their touch as
always thank you very much for watching
and I hope you enjoyed this review of
the LG g4 where fans over the phone it
still brings a unique design language
with a pretty great camera experience
and everything underneath just happens
to be pretty good as well if you're
looking for a phone that is not only
large but also has all of the features
that you feel are missing from the
current flagships then this might be the
phone that you've been waiting for we
are going to do a follow-up review with
a US version hopefully leather-clad in
order to give you an even better look at
the battery life and even more features
of it based upon a stateside version of
the phone so make sure you stay tuned
for that and for even more videos on the
LG g4 especially all of my comparisons
with Samsung and HTC in the market as
well and keep it tuned here for all of
that and even more jabba some likes on
