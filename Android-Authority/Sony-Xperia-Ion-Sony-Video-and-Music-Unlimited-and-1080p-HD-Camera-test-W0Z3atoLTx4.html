youngberg coming at you from your number
one source for all things android
android authority calm now today we've
got a review and it's all about the
media for the sony xperia ion we've
already done our in-depth reviews you
guys can check that out but today we're
going to be focusing on the media aspect
that the sony has pre-loaded into this
awesome phone now is a lot of you may
know if you've watched the review this
is packing a 4.6 inch 720p HD Reality
Display then has the software layer
called the Mobile BRAVIA Engine and
shining through at 1280 by 720 pixels
this is a really great phone it has 342
PPI so there's a lot of great media to
be unlocked now sony has pre-loaded this
device with the video unlimited and
music unlimited service so we're going
to be demoing those I've got a free
60-day subscription to that so I got all
the media I want if you guys want any
requests go ahead and drop us a line I'm
free to do that anyways we're also going
to be doing a camera test with the 12
megapixel camera on the back in 1080p HD
we'll go ahead and just include that in
this video so without further ado let's
check out first the music unlimited
service by Sony now while Samsung has
also developed something like this and
cloud music servers are really catching
on these days so anyways out right here
this is the very front panel of the Sony
Music Unlimited service you're going to
have to make an account online and it's
easy to just put your email address make
a password and then you can add funds to
your wallets to download songs and I'll
likewise for the video service to
download videos sometimes this is your
main UI you've got your channels where
there's premium genres the sense me the
era we have recent in my channels we
have some chart toppers for the what's
new and some new releases we school
right and we have the my library where
we have artists album songs playlists
all sorts of good stuff we have our
options such as refresh we can check out
our settings and then we can switch to
offline mode which allows us to not only
stream music from Sony's cloud servers
but also keep the music and listen to
them offline so before we get anything
else we can check out our settings we
have the account information in the
account management then we can remove
the account and we can enable explicit
controls to censor songs and stuff
like that and as well as a here's where
you'll control your offline music and
remove the offline music so let's just
go ahead and search for a song i'm going
to go ahead and search for primus we'll
see if they have that i'm connected to
the 4g network on 18t and also my Wi-Fi
so my Wi-Fi is pretty fast we'll be
using that and they had Primus we'll go
ahead and check that out um we'll go
ahead and go into one of their albums
I'm actually going to go to the very
first one here and we'll get my name is
mud we can click and we can instantly
stream this song it will begin playing
and we can control our medium volume
just like that and we can make available
offline simply by pressing the menu and
splits to offline mode a drop-down menu
here brings up the rest of the tracks on
the album and which inserts or we can
add to a few so related artists panel
here will we have the discography and we
can have more like the album here and
the bio of the band so anyways that's
pretty awesome we'll go back into the
main pane right here we can download all
these songs we can purchase them with
our account and our wallet that synced
up with our music unlimited service we
also have the album's artists songs just
all of the great stuff that is packed
into a nice cloud based media server so
anyways we'll go back and have a quick
look at the video unlimited which is
really awesome it's basically the same
thing but it is for media in the form of
videos and TV shows movies series
anything like that um I went ahead and
downloaded something already we'll just
let this load up this has to sign into
the same exact account that you create
for the entire Sona sony media
experience now you can download the
files of the movies or the TV shows that
you like straight to your phone and then
once it's on your phone you can actually
transfer them to other media devices so
i recently downloaded a
favorite show of all time it's always
sunny in philadelphia they had that they
have just about everything you're
looking for and once you download it you
can stream it here in landscape mode it
takes just a second to boot up and let's
turn that down as you can see our bravi
engines working really nice to bring
this in HD quality um just looks really
nice our reality display is shining
through with all these great right
colors and stuff like that we can stream
all this great media we'll go ahead and
go back anyways our video unlimited
service has a basic UI is the same as
the music service does we have our new
releases including movies movies for
rent and then episodes of recent TV
shows we have all the regular TV shows
here we've got movies and then we have
collections and sales we have top TV
episodes there's a bunch of great stuff
we can scroll through all these like
that we click more we can just basically
a scroll in a different UI like that our
menu brings up the settings the media
library in the account under the media
library we have just everything that
we've download ourselves now I
downloaded the episode here of its
always sunny it was only 272 Meg so it
doesn't take long to download and the
good thing is is that i noticed once i
had downloaded it just um 1 megabit i
was able to actually stream it so you're
able to stream it at the same time it's
downloading that makes for a really
awesome media experience so that was the
Music Unlimited and the UM movie
unlimited by Sony Video Unlimited that
is and I hope you guys like that go
ahead and check it out you can sign up
for a subscription um if you've got an
Xperia device or a selling device I
would recommend it it's great it's
almost integral to the functionality of
this device well necessarily but if you
do want a great media experience anyways
this is packing a 12 megapixel camera to
help you capture videos in a great
lifelike features just like the ones we
saw so we're going to go ahead and check
out a camera test I took just a small
video in 1080p HD that recorded using
the Sony Xperia ion okay so as you see
here I'm just basically painting over my
computer keyboard using the Sony Xperia
ion arm
have the autofocus set to the single
autofocus there's also infinity and
there's continuous autofocus but the
infinity is a little tough to use I
enjoy the single autofocus it's what
I've gotten the best results out of it's
still kind of hard to actually get it
focused it took me just about a minute
or two to get the camera focused on the
keyboard in this fashion but we'll just
pan around you can see it has great
detail a rich display i'm actually
watching this video when i watch this i
mean on this sony xperia ion it just
looked awesome so as you can see here it
does take just a second to get in focus
but now we're focused and see all the
rich detail of the remote control and we
can just pan and it does take awesome
quality video I really like the the
quality of the 12 megapixel 1080p HD
camera on the Sony Xperia ion but
anyways guys thanks for watching check
out the sony xperia ion and remember to
stay tuned with android authority calm
we always appreciate your guys views and
support we're dedicated bringing you the
best content for android on so take it
easy guys this is clayton with android
