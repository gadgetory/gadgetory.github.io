displays being used to create foldable
phones by companies like Samsung and
Huawei but Nubia the company that
recently brought us phones like the
Nubia X and red magic Mars decided to go
a slightly different route they put a
four inch flexible OLED screen into a
SmartWatch this is the Nubia Alpha and
Nubia isn't exactly marketing this
product as a SmartWatch and instead
they're describing it as a phone on your
wrist this sort of gives you the
impression that it's gonna have
smartphone specifications but it doesn't
it has pretty typical SmartWatch specs
with a Snapdragon wear 2100 1 gig of ram
8 gigs of on-board storage and a 500
milliamp hour battery that Nubia claims
will get you 1 to 2 days on a single
charge it also has a 5 megapixel camera
on it if you want to snap a quick photo
but odds are the quality isn't going to
be very good before continue I'd like to
give a quick shout out to digit daily
our sponsor for mobile world congress
2019 your tech news direct your Inbox
make sure to check the link in the
description below for more information
the phone part is merely in reference to
its ECM capabilities which allows it to
function as a standalone device so you
can take calls with it send text
messages and browse the web without your
smartphone I have to admit the Nubia
Alpha is not the sleekest looking
SmartWatch I've ever seen it is made out
of stainless steel so it feels pretty
nice but it's a very big watch and feels
a little bit clunky the flexible OLED
screen though is very impressive it's
very bright and the colors look
fantastic and the fact that it's able to
flex and wrap around your wrist feels
extremely cool and futuristic the
software and here is Nubia own custom
wearable operating system and from what
I've seen so far it's really intuitive
and easy to use everything's pretty easy
to find and it takes pretty good
advantage of the size of the screen by
making the icons large and nicely spaced
out so they're easy to press the watch
has a lot of functionality built in you
can use it to track Fitness sleep listen
to music or view your entire gallery of
photos it also has these really nifty
air gestures that let you navigate
side-to-side or scroll up and down just
by swiping your
across the watch so you can do a lot of
interaction with the watch without
having to touch the display the Nubia
Alpha goes on sale later this year and
starts at four hundred and forty nine
euros for the non isom version in black
549 for the Easton version and finally
six hundred and forty nine euros if you
want the 18k gold plated model with Isom
let us know what you guys think about
the Nubia Alpha is a flexible display on
your wrist the future of smartwatches or
do you think this is just a gimmick let
us know down in the comments below and
keep it tuned here for the rest of our
coverage of MWC 2019</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
