enough this week with him you may be
surprised by this the rumor that the
Samsung Galaxy s8 will sport a dedicated
AI button
that's right the Wall Street Journal
cites two unnamed sources that confirm
Samsung is testing a new dedicated
Hardware button for the SAS advanced AI
assistant the AI button is reportedly
still in prototype phase and as such may
not make it to the final design but the
idea of putting an advanced AI
capability front and center and the next
Galaxy device would catapult the s8 into
the same league as Google's pixel phones
with the exclusive Google assistant but
we heard another rumor that led further
credence to the near bezel is display on
the Galaxy S 8 according to the same
report the galaxy s 8 display will not
only feature a new OLED material but
will also make the shift to a near bezel
is design the s8 display is reported to
feature dual curves on either side and
very minimal bezels above and below the
screen previous reports have the display
at 5.5 inches and 4k resolution now when
we talk about an actual release date for
the Galaxy s8 rumors have been all over
the map the latest one suggests that the
launch will be delayed one of the Wall
Street Journal sources also noted that
the Samsung Galaxy S 8 launch would
possibly be delayed until as late as
April next year that would mean the
Galaxy S 8 would be a no-show for the
Mobile World Congress 2017 forgoing its
usual unveiling time slot while this
might be a little disappointing for some
I think we can agree that if samsung
needs to put a little more time at
delivering a rock-solid device with no
flaws then it probably should now you're
also gonna be really excited to hear
about the rumors we heard surrounding
the Galaxy s8 wireless charging finally
the Korean report mentions the addition
of an extra wireless charging coil in
the Galaxy s8 for a total of three this
will reportedly allow for more efficient
wireless charging over a wider area it
would also mean less importance need be
placed on the exact positioning of the
device on the wireless charging pad now
let's talk about another fan favorite
with oneplus specifically the one plus
3t one day after Qualcomm confirmed that
it's Snapdragon 820 one processor would
be in the next smartphone from oneplus
the company has issued its own Twitter
teaser
it says that its new phone will be
officially revealed on Tuesday November
15th 1 p.m. Eastern Standard Time the
phone is already the subject of a lot of
rumors including its name most reports
claim it will be called the 1 + 3 T and
yesterday's Twitter post seem to confirm
that with its t7 statement other rumors
about the phone include it having an
upgraded Sony IMX 395 sensor for its
camera 6 gigabytes of RAM and Android
7.0 out of the box now finally let's
talk about what we hope is Lenovo's
mid-range err aptly called
Moto M the Moto M is powered by 2.2
gigahertz octa-core MediaTek Helio P 15
processor 4 gigabytes of RAM 32
gigabytes of internal storage with the
optional 128 gigabyte memory card slot
and a 3050 milliamp hour battery the
display is a reasonable 5.5 inch full HD
panel and there is a 16 megapixel rear
camera with phase detection autofocus
along with an 8 megapixel front facing
camera the handset isn't gonna win any
awards for processing power so it falls
to the hardware as casing to be build as
its major selling point the Moto M is
constructed from a full metal unibody
that's been painted with a double layer
of hydrophobic coating that will protect
it from water splashes and spills
however there's no mention of any IP
rating so don't take this phone for a
swim just yet as additional extras
customers will also find a fingerprint
scanner Dolby Atmos Audio and fast
charging capabilities packed into the
handset you know what's coming up real
soon in the first week of January CES
the granddaddy of all conventions the
Consumer Electronics Show where many
manufacturers bring out their prototype
goodies for our feasting pleasure what
are you looking forward to the most let
me know in the comments below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
