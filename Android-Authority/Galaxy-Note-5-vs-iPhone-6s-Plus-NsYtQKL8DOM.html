the world are these two guys that I
phone 6s plus and the galaxy note 5
Samsung and Apple have been very
inspired by one another recently and now
users have very similar devices at a
glance but when you dive a little deeper
these two phones couldn't be any more
different hey everybody its Crystal
Laura and this is the iPhone 6s plus
versus the galaxy note 5
ok so first let's get through the design
specs the iPhone 6s plus offers a 5.5
inch screen while the no 5 offers a
bigger 5.7 inch screen yet the no 5 is a
little smaller it's shorter by 5
millimeters and less Y by almost 2
millimeters now the reason for this is
all thanks to the rather large bezels on
the top bottom and even size of the
iPhone 6s plus the phone has a rather
large footprint for a device with a 5.5
inch screen but there is some sense into
it because Apple believes in a
symmetrical design in terms of size so
no matter which way you hold the phone
the top bezel will match the bottom
bezels with a circular home button right
in the middle however most people seem
to prefer a smaller size device rather
than that symmetrical design so we'll
lean a little more towards a no.5 when
it comes to one-handed use although
let's face it both of these phones are
huge and you're going to struggle to use
either one one-handed what it really
comes down to is feel in the hand and
the backing of the phone's the back of
the 6s plus is made from a nice and
smooth aluminum while the back of the
note 5 is made entirely out of glass
both look very beautiful in their own
ways and it's really down to individual
preference as to what looks better but
both materials no doubt have some pros
and cons first off both phones are very
slippery it's really hard to say which
is more slippery than the other your
fingers may seem to ever so slightly
stick a little better to the glass of
the note 5 but the difference between
the two are very small the note 5 is a
little thicker than the iPhone 6s plus
at seven point six millimeters
however the 6s plus is a little heavier
at 192 grams over the no 5s 171 grams
and overall this mixed with a larger
length a width of the 6s plus makes the
note 5 feel a little more secure in your
hand
and although
the 6s plus is backing doesn't help make
the phone any less slippery it stays a
lot more clean and nicer looking
throughout the day over the no fives
fingerprint magnet glass backing also
with the note 5 still being a big
slippery phone it gives users one more
side of their phone to worry about
cracking the note 5 has a little LED
indicator at the top to let you know
when you have a notification which is
very helpful for knowing if you're all
caught up even if you're across the room
from your phone the success does not
still you'll find yourself clicking that
home button every once in a while to
make sure you didn't miss anything
when you take a look at the sides of
these phones then you really start to
see some similarities really tactile
volume buttons on the left sides with
the power buttons being on the right
although the power button on the iPhone
seems to be quite high and this makes
your fingers stretch a little bit extra
but you do get a very nice volume such
vibrant slider here on the 6s Plus which
is very helpful the headphone jacks are
both on the bottom left with your
charging ports in the middle and the
note 5 has a micro USB port while the 6s
Plus has apple's lightning cable port
now that lightning cable is reversible
which makes things easier for us but it
does take longer to fully charge the 6s
plus at around two and a half hours or
you can use the iPad charger to cut that
down by around an hour but the note 5 is
capable of fast charging which can
charge your phone from 0 to 50 percent
in about 30 minutes or 0 to 100 in a
little over an hour and 15 minutes
Wireless and fast wireless charging are
also available with the note 5 which is
a very nice addition and as for the
speakers they're both located on the
bottom right which isn't the best place
for them but it isn't the worst either
and overall they both get very loud the
iPhone 6s plus the speaker's seem a bit
more clear whereas the no 5s tend to
compress a little bit too much but that
does help certain sounds cut through a
bit more and again it's up to preference
but I do like the crisper sound found on
the 6s plus like I said before you do
get a bigger screen size on the note 5
at 5.7 inches over the iPhone 6s plus is
5.5 inches
both of these screens are very beautiful
to look at although they are made with
different technologies the iPhone 6s
plus screen is more of a standard LCD
panel while the note 5 packs an AMOLED
panel so where the 6s plus has a white
backlight underneath his display to
light it up the no 5s AMOLED
relies on individual pixels choosing
when to light up and what their specific
brightness should be so the note 5 has
much deeper blacks over the 6s plus the
screen and it doesn't even light up
portions of the screen that are true
black
however AMOLED screens aren't without
their faults whites seem a little
pinkish compared to the 6 SS screens and
while AMOLED screens are known for not
getting too bright the note 5 actually
proves otherwise both phones seem to get
equally as bright
however the note 5 packs in more pixels
per inch with this quad HD display over
the 6s plus it's full HD display both
panels are very sharp but everything
including colors seem to pop a bit more
with the AMOLED display of the note 5
giving it a slight edge over the 6s Plus
both phones offer very similar hardware
features for the most part we have
fingerprint scanners located on both
home buttons however the iPhone 6s plus
a scanner is lightyears ahead of the no
fives but that's not saying the no 5
scanner is bad I think it's actually
better wait did I just contradict myself
I guess not really here's the deal my
friends the iPhone 6s is fingerprint
scanner is insanely fast much faster
than the note 5s but it may be too fast
if you have the scanner enabled say
goodbye to your lockscreen
with one tap of the home button no
matter how fast your phone will unlock
now that's pretty impressive and it
works almost every time but that makes
viewing your lockscreen only possible by
hitting the power button this high up on
the right side the no 5 fingerprint
scanner isn't as fast at the successes
but I'm extremely lock screen easier so
that's good but really the iPhone 6s
plus has a better fingerprint scanner
but it can cause some problems both
phones do have NFC but the iPhones is
locked to Apple play only now in the
note 5 you have the freedom to use NFC
with whatever you want and Samsung has
its own payment system to Samsung pay
and it's accepted at more places in
Apple pay
it works by sending a signal to the card
reader to make it think that a card has
swiped overall I think you're going to
feel more confident when purchasing
something with your note 5 rather than
the 6s now each phone does have their
own huge trick up their sleeve from the
note 5 is the S Pen which has tons of
added features to it this year you can
quickly take notes by pulling the pen
out and saving it once you put the pin
back in its slot crop areas of
screenshots and add doodles for easy
sharing you can create long screenshots
as well by
seriously capturing long passages to
stitch them together the no.5 makes
dropping down ideas and sharing ideas
effortless and it can be a lot of fun as
for the iPhone 6s we have a new
technology that hasn't been found in a
phone until this year 3d touch so iPhone
successes are pressure sensitive now and
that allows for hidden menus to be shown
when pressing with a bit of force this
helps keeps menus in home screens
looking clean while having a lot of
function peek and pop is also a nice
feature that comes along with 3d touch
we're previewing an image is as easy as
pressing a little harder on the screen
and when you want to jump from preview
to full image just press even harder and
you'll pop right in this works for
emails and such as well as animating
photos and even game controls 3d touch
could really be something that turns
into a game changer for the industry but
for right now I would say if you're
somebody who will regularly use a s-pen
then yeah the note 5 has a greater
unique feature but not everybody who
owns a note 5 will use that as pen
whereas everybody who uses an iPhone 6s
will most likely incorporate 3d touch
into their normal habits now on paper
the note 5 seems to have a lot more
potential over the iPhone 6s plus we
have different types of processors the
dual-core Apple a9 versus a quad core
Exynos 7420 the note 5 has double the
RAM at 4 gigs and a bigger battery by
250 milliamp hours but really both
phones need to perform just as well as
one another even with the iPhone having
less capability on paper the iPhone 6s
plus never stuttered or slow down no
matter what we threw at it games ran
very well without any pauses and barely
any stutters and really lost of the time
the iPhone 6s plus loaded a game like
asphalt 8 a couple seconds faster than
the note 5 the iPhones hardware is
perfectly optimized for iOS which makes
for great performance now while the
Galaxy S six wasn't so much perfectly
optimized with his three gigs of RAM
causing some issues samsung didn't play
around this time and made up for it with
an extra gig found here on the note 5
and now we have a very competitive
experience when it comes to performance
apps open immediately and dipping in and
out of recent apps works without any
hesitation with this faster animations
really make the phone feel extra snappy
and games load very fast but like I said
before most instances
a little slower than the iPhone 6s plus
but once you're in the game
everything is very smooth with high
frame rates overall you're going to have
a wonderful experience getting work done
on either one of these devices even with
the iPhones smaller battery it lasts a
long time and in most cases longer than
the note 5s 3000 milliamp hour battery
at the end of the day both phones were
usually still alive with the 6s plus
having at least 10 to 15% more battery
but you can expect great battery life on
either device and although the iPhone 6s
plus can last you longer with wireless
charging and fast charging on the note 5
I'd say this is a draw now we could talk
for days about all these other things
and this is what can make switching from
phone to phone so hard the iPhone 6s
plus runs iOS 9 while the note 5 runs
Android lollipop 5.1.1 out of the box
both operating systems master different
things the iPhone is purposely simple
but maybe a little too limited for some
users the home screen is still a grid of
icons that can only be rearranged and
put into folders and even then you're
not allowed to put any free spaces
between these icons which is a little
silly given how hard it is to reach a
top of the screen with one hand however
on Android you are free to place these
icons wherever you would like most
likely at the bottom for easy reaching
we also have widgets which are
accessible on both although on iOS they
are stuck to the notification pulldown
while on Android they can be moved
around the homescreen and resize and
after years of waiting iPhone users can
finally download third-party keyboards
although in iOS 9 they are still very
buggy and almost unusable and of course
their party keyboards and other
third-party downloads like different
launchers and icon packs are available
for tinkering with an android in the end
you have the choice to change your phone
the way you want it whether for the
better or for the worst
the choice and freedom is there which
may make users lean more towards the
note 5 both the note 5 and 6s plus take
some gorgeous photos the note 5 has a 16
megapixel camera while the 6s plus has
12 optical image stabilization are found
in both along with 4k video and slo-mo
both camera apps are designed to be very
simple and allow for pointing and
shooting a nice photo with no extra
hassle there is more settings found in
the note 5 however like full manual mode
and you can easily launch the camera app
on the note 5 in just seconds by double
tapping the home button
which we love on the iPhone you have a
shortcut to but like I said before
thanks to that very fast fingerprint
scanner well you're gonna be forced to
use the power button the majority of the
time it's going to be hard to pick a
winner between these two both offer very
sharp details and nice colors but the
overall theme here is more realistic
colors and less sharpening found on the
6s plus and more saturated colors with
more sharpening found on the note 5 does
that mean the 6s plus is better well not
really again it's sort of up to
preference naturally when looking at a
no.5 photo with that extra popping
colors you would prefer it over the more
toned-down 6s plus picture especially
when showing somebody that picture on
that nice AMOLED display with the lower
aperture found on the note 5 you get
some better looking close-up shots with
some nice depth of field and this also
helps in low-light as well I always love
phones that can shoot in a 16 to 9
aspect ratio with their full sensor like
the note 5 while the iPhone 6s plus she
set a 4 to 3 aspect ratio with this
whole sensor also with this higher
megapixel count when zooming in you get
some extra detail although it's very
minimal the selfie camera without a
doubt is better on the note 5 mostly due
to its wide angle lens you can fit so
many things into the frame and really
it's hard to understand why the iPhone
hasn't adopted this wide-angle selfie
lens yet the no 5s front-facing camera
does tend to smoothen the skin too much
even with the beauty mode off which can
be annoying since these cameras are
really so neck and neck is hard to lean
towards just one but due to my personal
preference towards saturated photos and
that wide-angle selfie cam I would go
with the no 5s camera I know I've said
this a lot but it's hard to pick between
these two devices because most of their
differences comes down to personal
preference just over a year ago the no.4
had some huge advantages over the iPhone
6 plus with his expandable storage and
removable battery but the iPhone 6 plus
also has some huge advantages as well
like a superior camera and smooth
software experience and this year the
note 5 losses previous advantages and
improved on its weaknesses to really
make these two phones such a close match
it's a tough choice to pick one but at
least you can have the comfort of
knowing that whichever phone you end up
pick
you made a good choice well that's about
it for this comparison video thank you
