josh magar from android authority what's
going on everybody and as you can see by
my attire here i am in permanent new
york mode while i'm here and the lights
are going now no anyway so as you can
see i'm in my new york mud because I'm
here in New York City for the launch of
the HTC One m8 we just got done with the
event you can see the stage right behind
me and I wanted to give you just a quick
rundown on how the event was all about
now essentially HTC likes to keep things
pretty low-key in terms of their
presentations they're just going to show
you exactly what the phone is all about
talk to you about it and showcase all
the features there and you can see our
first look in hands-on video for all of
the details regarding what this phone
can be 0 is all about so just kind of
going over a few of the features that
came up mainly they do have to do with
the camera and also with the larger
screen that is the super lcd3 screen
that is now 5 inches at 1080p resolution
but also aside from all that you have
the great build quality that has the
aluminum finish that wraps all the way
around the back of the phone and even
comes over to the sides and what that
allows it to do is have a very elegant
look that feels really nice in the hand
and if you saw the first looking hands
on video which went live as this show
was going on you'll know that we thought
that the that I thought rather that the
phone felt really nice in the hand and
was able to really just fit snugly even
though it is a little bit larger than
the original HTC one m7 aside from that
however we do have to talk about that
camera the camera is probably the most
the most exciting feature for me for me
at least because it is a hardware
solution to a problem that a lot of
these manufacturers have been trying to
figure out and that's how to get DSLR
level depth of field into the smartphone
photography now instead of taking a
software aspect and taking a bunch of
pictures at once and then trying to put
them together for various different
types of focus points in the photo the
dual camera that has been added on top
of the ultrapixel 4 megapixel camera
allows you to get that depth data into
the photo and every single photo you
take with the regular camera will be
used with the dual camera and you'll be
able to get all the information ready
for you to choose the focal point in
your foreground or in your background to
get those stylized photos it is a very
good implement
asian and the little testing that i was
able to do already with it it did
already work very well very well and
we're really excited to really put it
through its paces as far as the show
went we just had this stage right here
we're actually at the Moynihan station
which is more or less a loading dock
around here but we are able to we were
able to see a really nice showcasing of
the device see a lot of great people out
there from the HTC camp and be able to
see exactly what they thought about the
process of putting together the phone
and how difficult it was as they were
saying that they were able to make this
feat of a device with the brushed
aluminum on the back and just this
really great looking device all around
not really a whole lot to say after that
like I said HTC likes to keep things
mostly low key and it really did show
here in this quick 45-minute
presentation but after that we are able
to get our hands on the HTC One m8 as
soon as today on a verizon carrier and
then after that in a couple weeks
they'll be available on across all of
the carriers that you can pre-order
right now online on their website so
make sure you stay tuned to android or
do we are getting our review unit very
soon and you can stay tuned for our
review or full coverage and our future
focuses on things like the camera so
stay tuned to android 30 for all of that
best coverage and make sure to stay
tuned here because we are your source
for all things android all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
