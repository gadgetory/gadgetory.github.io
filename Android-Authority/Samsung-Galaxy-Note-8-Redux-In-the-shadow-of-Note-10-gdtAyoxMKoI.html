around the corner and I've always had a
soft spot for this particular series of
smartphones ever since I had my note 4
from back in 2014 with that in mind hey
guys my name's Ryan Thomas with addre
authority and in today's episode of
redux we're going to be taking a look
back at the often overlooked note 8
taking a closer look at its update
support hardware flaws and viability
over 20 months after its initial release
it's no secret that Samsung has been
leading the smartphone design game for
the past couple of years and the note 8
feels no more out of place than the note
9 in today's crop of handsets bezels are
still thin with this consistently small
chin and forehead along with sweeping
and smooth glass curves and a metal rail
it lacks the famous punch hole that we
see in the galaxy s 10 series however if
you want the latest in OLED innovation
this isn't it the screen holds up very
nicely in 2019 with a great array of
colors excellent brightness and contrast
and a more than respectable resolution
the Snapdragon 835 or Exynos 88-90 5 and
6 gigabytes of RAM still hold up ok in
2019 835 isn't the fastest example in
this due to one UI it's pretty heavy
skin and the speed isn't perfect I've
experienced a little bit of lag some
hangings is actually a couple of force
kind of crash restarts which definitely
isn't amazing for a modern smartphone
but you've got to remember that this
thing is a couple of years old now the
performance is probably the notates
biggest blunder apart from this battery
you see 3300 milliamp hours isn't a big
battery in any phone especially one as
big and as beastly as the note 8 battery
life is poor and there's no getting
around that although we still have quick
charge 2.0 which is good and we also
have wireless charging which is very
convenient the pair of OS equipped 12
megapixel cameras on the back certainly
seems pretty normal one of those is a
telly as opposed to a white like we see
on the more recent s10 YZ dual setup and
by extension a trend that we're starting
to see become more prevalent the camera
quality doesn't seem to have improved in
updates but what is staggering to me is
how poor the dynamic range is compared
to the latest phones it really does show
progression if anything it's not a bad
camera setup for any means and even the
8 megapixel self issues it's still
capable of capturing a good image but
you are missing out on some great
shooters just by
the older notate pricing is pretty
respectable in most markets being around
300 great British pounds 300 u.s.
dollars and around 25,000 rupees these
prices are for a base model in decent
condition and that puts it in the same
kind of price range as he used 1 + 6 or
a brand new pocket for f1 Samsung
promised a note 8 owners an update at
8.0 Oreo and it delivered on that
promise in March of 2018
in fact Samsung even pushed out 9.0 pite
of the device with its shiny new one UI
skin pi was in a beta for about a month
before it was released as an OTA update
in around February of this year since it
was the first phone since the infamous
exploding note 7 Samsung's main focus
was promising that this one didn't blow
up being very careful about its battery
and thankfully we didn't get a repeat of
that so they kind of held up on their
claims of it not blowing up even if it
was at the cost of having a very very
small battery the most current and
up-to-date version of the software on
this phone is one UI one point now based
on Android 9.0 PI and it runs ok we
still have a lot of the modern Samsung
aesthetic and it certainly feels more
fresh than the Samsung experience skin
that was on this family released 9.0 is
probably as far as we're going to go
platform wise although I'm expecting
some security updates over the next one
to two years but for those of you hoping
for Android 10 on this phone I don't
think we're gonna get it officially
maybe in third-party software on the
surface the note 8 seems like a decent
used smartphone in 2019 with features
like wireless charging dual cameras a
fantastic screen and a headphone port
but since you can get a used to note 9
for just around 100 pounds or $100 more
it makes it really hard to recommend
this from the likely soon ending
platform updates to poor battery life so
the fact that for the same money you can
go and get a far more fleshed out device
I don't think I can really recommend the
note 8 in 2019 unfortunately we'd like
to hear your thoughts on the note 8 in
the comments below do you have a note 8
and what's your experience with it are
you looking to buy a used Note 8 or have
you ditched that and gone with the note
9 which is definitely a more flash style
device anyway that's about it from me
thank you so much for watching please do
like comment and subscribe if you're new
around here never miss a video like this
one
I've been Ryan Thomas with Android
authority and I see you later
