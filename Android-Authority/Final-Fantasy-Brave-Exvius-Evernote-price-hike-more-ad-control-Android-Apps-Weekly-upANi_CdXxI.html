handy the Android authority app guy and
this is Android apps weekly it's episode
number 147 so let's get started Evernote
released some news this week that they
plan on increasing the prices of their
services the free accounts will have
more restrictions than they had before
including bandwidth restrictions while
the paid versions will get these non
restricted features that free users once
enjoyed for enterprise use not much is
changing but if you were a free user
you'll likely want to look for a new
note-taking app the latest humble pc and
android bundle has been set live and
it's a pretty good one included in the
bundle is badland 10 million nights of
pen and paper - and several other games
there is still one game left to be
unveiled and you can get a varying
amount of them depending on how much you
pay or all of them if you fork out
around eleven dollars it's a bit more
expensive than usual but it's still less
than if you bought all of them
separately google has launched a new
initiative that allows you to control
what ad you see while browsing on the
web the new interface also comes with a
my activities page that shows you all
kinds of information that you may be
surprised that Google was able to
ascertain in any case the new interface
is linked in the video description below
if you want to check it out and we
highly recommend that you do Facebook is
changing its news feed algorithm yet
again this time it's going to try to
show posts from friends that you
actively engage with along with some
stuff that Facebook deems to be more
informative and detailed the end result
should be that you see more stuff that
you like and less stuff that you don't
however paid posts still exist so we'll
see how all of this turns out a new
study was released this week that shows
that iOS users generally spend 2.5 times
more money on in-app purchases vs.
Android users I know there are a ton of
variables to consider as to why that may
be however Android users were more
likely to spend money on utility
applications than iOS users this can be
easily explained by things like
launchers and for the longest time
third-party keyboard apps which iOS does
not have an abundance of for even more
Android apps and games news releases and
updates don't forget to check out this
week's newsletter in the video
description below there is a ton of info
in the newsletter that we didn't have
time for in the video if you'd like you
can sign up for the newsletter using the
forum which is in the written can
which is also linked in the video
description below and we'll send you the
newsletter every Sunday for even faster
news you can check out the android
authority application which is available
now in Google Play
BitTorrent now is a music and video
streaming application that shows you all
kinds of stuff from underground artists
the idea behind the application is to
show new original and experimental stuff
to the mainstream in a way that's easily
accessible without it actually being
piracy it features a community aspect
with trending stuff along with
background play the ability to follow
artists and content that you enjoy and
you can share stuff with your friends
think of it like a walled garden version
of SoundCloud it's completely free if
you're interested in CSR racing 2 is the
sequel to the hyper popular drag racing
game CSR racing this new game features a
lot of the same elements as the prior
title as you'll be drag racing your way
up the charts to become the very best
it also features car customizations
upgrades many cars to buy from real
manufacturers and there's an online
multiplayer mode where you can join a
crew chat with friends and race other
players
it's a freemium game through and through
but it's not bad for what it is
expeditions is an educational app by
Google that allows you to take virtual
tours of many different things it's
meant for classroom use along with
Google cardboard to show kids things
like coral reefs what a TV studio set
looks like and other interesting places
and settings you can join in guided
tours or you can host your own if you
want to and the application can be used
with Google cardboard or just a 360
degree video if you prefer it's entirely
free and worth the shots the Final
Fantasy brave xvs is an unusual twist
between a JRPG and a freemium game it
was developed by the same studio that
did brave frontier and you'll notice
that during combat sequences however
underneath all of that is an actual JRPG
where you explore dungeons engage with
random encounters walk around towns and
engage with a storyline the soundtrack
is surprisingly amazing and the game is
jam-packed with nostalgic value for
Final Fantasy fans it may be the best
freemium game ever made the PlayStation
View is a live TV streaming service that
features TV sports movies news and
various TV shows it's essentially like a
for-real television subscription except
you can stream it and the official
application has finally hit mobile truth
be told it's suffering
from some serious early release bugs
it'll be a while before it's a really
good application like Netflix or Hulu
however if it's something that you use
you might as well give the app a chance
and that about does it for this one
