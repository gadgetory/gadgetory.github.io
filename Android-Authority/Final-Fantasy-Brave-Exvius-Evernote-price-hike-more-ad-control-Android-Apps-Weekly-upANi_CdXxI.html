Hindy the android authority app guy and
this is Android apps weekly it's episode
number 147 so let's get started Evernote
released some news this week that they
plan on increasing the prices of their
services the free accounts will have
more restrictions than they had before
including bandwidth restrictions while
the paid versions will get these
non-restricted features that free users
once enjoyed for enterprise use not much
as changing but if you were a free user
you'll likely want to look for a new
note taking app the latest humble PC and
Android bundle has been set live and
it's a pretty good one included in the
bundle is bad land 10 million knights of
pen and paper to and several other games
there is still one game left to be
unveiled and you can get a varying
amount of them depending on how much you
pay or all of them if you fork out
around eleven dollars it's a bit more
expensive than usual but it's still less
than if you bought all of them
separately google has launched a new
initiative that allows you to control
what ads you see while browsing on the
web the new interface also comes with a
my activities page that shows you all
kinds of information that you may be
surprised that Google was able to
ascertain in any case the new interface
is linked in the video description below
if you want to check it out and we
highly recommend that you do Facebook is
changing its news feed algorithm yet
again this time it's going to try to
show posts from friends that you
actively engage with along with some
stuff that Facebook deems to be more
informative and detailed the end result
should be that you see more stuff that
you like and less stuff that you don't
however paid posts still exist so we'll
see how all of this turns out a new
study was released this week that shows
that iOS users generally spend 2.5 times
more money on in-app purchases versus
Android users I know there are a ton of
variables to consider as to why that may
be however Android users were more
likely to spend money on utility
applications than iOS users this can be
easily explained by things like
launchers and for the longest time
third-party keyboard apps which iOS does
not have an abundance of for even more
Android apps and games news releases and
updates don't forget to check out this
week's newsletter in the video
description below there is a ton of info
in the newsletter that we didn't have
time for in the video if you'd like you
can sign up for the newsletter using the
form which is in the written can
Canyon which is also linked in the video
description below and we'll send you the
newsletter every Sunday for even faster
news you can check out the android
authority application which is available
now in Google Play bittorrent now is a
music and video streaming application
that shows you all kinds of stuff from
underground artists the idea behind the
application is to show new original and
experimental stuff to the mainstream in
a way that's easily accessible without
it actually being piracy it features a
community aspect with trending stuff
along with background play the ability
to follow artists and content that you
enjoy and you can share stuff with your
friends think of it like a walled garden
version of SoundCloud it's completely
free if you're interested in csr racing
2 is the sequel to the hyper popular
drag racing game CSR racing this new
game features a lot of the same elements
as the prior title as you'll be drag
racing your way up the charts to become
the very best it also features car
customizations upgrades many cars to buy
from real manufacturers and there's an
online multiplayer mode where you can
join a crew chat with friends and race
other players it's a freemium game
through and through but it's not bad for
what it is expeditions is an educational
app by google that allows you to take
virtual tours of many different things
it's meant for classroom use along with
Google cardboard to show kids things
like coral reefs when a TV studio set
looks like and other interesting places
and settings you can join in guided
tours or you can host your own if you
want to and the application can be used
with Google cardboard or just a 360
degree video if you prefer it's entirely
free and worth the shots the Final
Fantasy brave XVS is an unusual twist
between a JRPG and a freemium game it
was developed by the same studio that
did brave frontier and you'll notice
that during combat sequences however
underneath all of that is an actual JRPG
where you explore dungeons engage with
random encounters walk around towns and
engage with a storyline the soundtrack
is surprisingly amazing and the game is
jam-packed with nostalgic value for
Final Fantasy fans it may be the best
freemium game ever made the PlayStation
view is a live TV streaming service that
features TV sports movies news and
various TV shows it's essentially like a
for-real television subscription except
you can stream it and the official
application has finally hit mobile truth
be told it's suffering
from some serious early release bugs
it'll be awhile before it's a really
good application like Netflix or Hulu
however if it's something that you use
you might as well give the app a chance
and that about does it for this one
