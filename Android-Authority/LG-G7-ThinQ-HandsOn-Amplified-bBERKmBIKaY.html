everybody and this is the LG G seven
thinkyou now while we were spending time
with this phone in Korea we were told
that think you even though it is
officially part of the name of this
device can be omitted in future
correspondents so for now we're just
going to continue calling this the LG G
7 the design of this device is like if
AV 30 mixed together with a g6 in that
you get the glossy backings with four
different colors and you get a screen
that is taller more than it is wide and
that is because of a unique aspect ratio
in this case 19 by 9 aspect ratio
because of that notch at the top but the
notch can also be customized because the
notification areas on the sides can be
made into either a black color
effectively turning off the notch or you
can add other colors and gradients to it
to give it a little bit of extra Flair
now this area is called the new second
screen which is a little bit problematic
because we remember the second screens
from the v10 and the V 20 there were
more functions on there including
textual elements and notifications and
that's a little bit different from what
we're seeing here and that screen is an
IPS LCD display that comes in a quiet HD
resolution and the reason why LG stuck
with IPS LCD for its construction is
because of brightness in particular what
you can do here is go to the brightness
slider and hit the icon on the left and
it will go into a boosted mode this
super-bright display allows for 1000
nits of power coming right out of the
LCD and it's really bright LG claims it
is the brightest of any smartphone and
it's obviously something you would want
to use in situations like when you're
standing outside in broad daylight you
still get the volume rocker over on the
side but now the power button that used
to be part of the fingerprint reader on
the back has been moved to the side as
well you get a more conventional power
button that most users were saying that
they would prefer because having to
reach around the device in order to wake
the device was a little bit too
cumbersome at least in terms of
convenience you can use the power button
on the side and double tap it to launch
the camera but opposite that button is
now a brand new addition in the AI key
LG partnered up again very closely with
Google to provide specific functionality
for Google assistant which is this
phone's AI assistant of choice the
button allows for full
all over the way that Google assistant
interacts with the user you can press
the button and it will do the same thing
that it does when you hold the home
button on any Android device double tap
the AI key and you can open up Google
lands and then finally you can press and
hold on that button in order to talk to
Google assistant like you would a
walkie-talkie this seems like a simple
function but it might be the most
significant change to the way that
assistant works the only other place
that we've seen this kind of
functionality is in the pixel buds where
you can actually dictate what kind of
voice string goes to Google assistant
rather than it trying to figure out when
you stopped talking and as we all know
when Google assistant tries to recognize
when you are speaking sometimes it
doesn't do a good job of it of course
that's only one layer to the assistant
experience as LG is trying to upgrade
its software with more AI capabilities
Google assistant is obviously going to
be one main way of doing it but of
course the smart thing queue connection
to their iot platform is also important
and then finally a smart bulletin which
is a second home screen over on the left
a little bit like Bixby or Google now
provides some contextual cards so that
you have information for a number of
different situations and powering all of
this are what you would expect from a
high powered device the Snapdragon 845
comes with two different RAM and ROM
configurations you can get four or six
gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes or 128
gigabytes of on-board storage depending
on what version of the phone you get a
3000 milliamp hour battery might seem
like a little bit on the low side but
we'll reserve judgment on the battery
life until we get our review unit and
then all the bits and pieces you would
want in this phone are there including
the headphone jack and the audio
experience continues to be very
important to LG boombox sound is a
unique take on the speaker sharing
experience as the entire back portion of
the phone has been made into the sound
chamber in a bit of an oversimplified
way you can look at it as the back cover
and the space between hits and
everything it protects as a resonance
area when you have audio at a loud
volume you can feel the entire back
vibrate and then you can put the phone
down on a number of materials and that's
when the magic happens
for the most part this works best with a
hollowed out container like a cardboard
box or we even put this phone on a gift
are to see how it would sound from there
and the vibration of the bag actually
makes that hollowed-out container
amplify the sound for a much richer
experience it's a striking difference
between this phone and any other phone
that we tested and the headphone jack
still has the quad DAC but also now has
the DTS x3d standard tuned in this is
basically a standard for surround sound
so you can cater the soundstage to your
liking but I will tell you this that
quad DAC returning is also great and
anybody who misses their headphone jacks
can look to the g7 as a wonderful
audiophile device and if you pair the
quad DAC with active noise-cancelling
it's one hell of a combination now we
can finally talk about the camera
LG's most unique and simultaneously also
most polarizing feature in its phones
let's start off with some great news the
front-facing camera is finally a viable
shooter an upgrade from 5 megapixels in
the V 32 a megapixels now is not the
only change as the tuning allows for
better sharpness and it doesn't over
soft in a lot of the detail there's even
a bit of a portrait like mode where you
can add okay background effects granted
portrait modes tend to take advantage of
a dual lens setup but for the g7 LG
continues the tradition of providing a
wide-angle secondary Lance it's still
great to use for wide shots and even for
video especially for situations like
vlogging and you get a 107 degree field
of view which helps correct the
distortion on the sides without
sacrificing much of the wide view
without a telephoto lens the portrait
mode on the LG g7 remains the same focal
length as the main camera so you don't
have the picture actually zooming into
the subject and you wouldn't have to
move backwards in order to fit your
subject into the frame now speaking of
the cutout we did have some issues where
people with a lot of hair or my glasses
for example we're mistaken for
of the cutout and we're blurred out but
again we're gonna reserve judgment until
the software which was very
pre-production for this camera gets to
its final version in our final unit as
far as low-light photography goes LG
took two pixel binding as their solution
16 megapixels is what you get no matter
which lens you're using on the rear but
they can be in groups of four which
results in a four megapixel image where
those groups flood in more light to the
sensor and of course video is still a
big deal with the g7 as it retains the
manual movie controls and also send a
video on top of audio capture
capabilities that were in the V 30 and
finally to round out the camera
experience is another injection of
artificial intelligence LG added a I cam
to its LG v 30s thinkyou so you might be
familiar with what we call the tag cloud
the cloud is a flurry of words that when
a eye is on shows the camera is trying
to recognize what object or subject is
pointing at
for example point the camera at some
Korean barbecue and once it figures out
it is food it is looking at the camera
will up the saturation and try to give
you a better foodie shot now the tag
cloud might be a little polarizing for
some as they don't really want to know
that the cameras having trouble trying
to recognize things but for the most
part its final decision is pretty
accurate at least in my case when I was
using the front-facing camera with a I
cam I'm clearly not a cauliflower even
though that word came up at one point in
the cloud but its final decision was
that that was one person and then it
gave me settings for a selfie and so
there you have it the LG G 7 what LG
proves every year is that it takes into
proper consideration the key aspects of
a smartphone that others might be taking
for granted like the headphone jack and
then LG keeps up with some of the trends
and you can see that in the notch right
now but in this particular phone LG
continues also the tradition of thinking
outside of the box with things like
boombox sound and also even that AI key
on the side which seems simple but can
prove very useful we're really excited
to get our hands on a review unit and we
will see how the g7 fares when we get it
