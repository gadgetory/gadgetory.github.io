authority now there's a real battle
building up over the voice assistant
that you use in your house on your phone
and in your car
and that battle is between Amazon's
Alexa and between Google assistant now
why is it such a battle and why is it so
important well let me explain so if you
went back a few years ago digital
assistant voice systems weren't really
anything practical maybe there was some
fun I remember playing with a couple on
Android and they were interesting and my
kids like speaking into them and asking
them some interesting questions but they
weren't very practical but fast forward
to today and voice assistants are
starting to take over now in 2017 at the
CES show in Las Vegas
Amazon Alexa really stole the show it
really was the quiet star of that event
because it was so popular and people's
like to see that it could be integrated
into other third-party products now this
year in 2018 in CES Google have realized
they were losing ground to Amazon and
they are making a huge splash at CES
have even got you know some of the trams
and trains painted with you know hey
Google's kind of the the keyword that
you need to fire off your Google home
blazoned everywhere how'd you go at CES
but why is this such a big thing why is
Google which is a search company
advertising company spending so much
time trying to battle against Amazon now
in many ways this is going to be similar
to the VHS versus Betamax wars that we
saw in the 1980s is anyone I'm going to
explain
now some of you what's that well it's
important because the consumer needs to
pick which ecosystem they want to invest
in so way back in the day when it was
about VHS versus Betamax which machine
did you buy and which format did you use
to buy the film would rent videos that
films that you wanted to watch now today
do you invest in to Amazon system or do
you invest in to Google system now it's
quite interesting to see that it's
Amazon that are now competing with
Google in this area until now with
smartphones and kind of with content
it's really been Google versus Apple or
Samsung versus Apple or Google and
Samsung you know there's this kind of
combination of Samsung Google and Apple
in this kind of fight for iTunes or
Google play's movies or for music that
comes from iTunes or you know and you've
kind of got this and Amazon have been
kind of over here on the side and they
didn't do well in the smartphone market
they had one attempt and they failed
miserably but they have been building up
all these other things that they are
actually direct competitors with Google
to think about their cloud services you
think about their prime service you
think about their music streaming
service think about ebooks okay these
are all things that directly compete
with with Google and in some sense also
with Apple
now these voice assistants are making
their way into our homes and into our
cars and CES 2018 has shown there are
more and more different third-party
products that are integrating these
voice systems into their devices so you
can have them you know kind of in your
kitchen and in your lounge and in your
car in your you know everywhere in the
house and kind of even headphones have
now got voice assistance enabled into
them and of course the faculties who
will control the voice input from
consumers and whoever comes out on top
will be the winner in terms of being
able
monetize consumer activity and of course
Amazon articles the great star at
monetizing consumer activity actually
monitor everything we do they send you
emails or recommendations they you know
and now Alexa is used to make to help
people buy things from Amazon from their
website there's evidence they're even
offering lower prices if you order
through Alexa than if you did directly
on the website now Google aren't in that
same market they don't have all you know
you can't buy all these things you can
buy on hammers and batteries and washing
powder on and books and and cameras and
TVs you can't buy all those from Google
so Google and Amazon are controlling
they're coming at this from different
directions but their goal is ultimately
the same who controls your life
and I use that correctly who controls
your life because this isn't going to be
a Star Trek utopia hello computer nor is
it going to be a kind of Jarvis Iron Man
kind of utopia I mean basically Jarvis
never said to to Tony Stark miss Potts
is at the door and I notice you're
running low on washing power - lay order
some for you but that's because these
films these utopian ideas of the future
don't have any money involved there's no
commercialization either but both google
and amazon need to be able to
commercialize these voices systems and
that's why they need to control it
because the second place person or third
place person is not going out of control
the the personal choices and the
personalization of services for
consumers if you look at Google for
example Google are in to search Google
made its name in search and search is a
big part of what Google does but
nowadays if you ask Alexa for something
it may get the information by Google it
may get it from Wikipedia it may get it
from its own database but Alexa is now
determining the results that you get
Amazon is now determining the results
that you get and not Google and that
means the power is being taken away from
Google and it's being given to
and of course in all of this it leaves
out the smaller guy I mean you know if
you kind of go back way back people can
have moaned about the closing down of
local hardware stores or local
speciality stores because the big chains
and the big stores were taking over will
now multiply this up again a whole new
layer and basically Amazon are going to
become the king of almost everything
that we do our music our films our books
our shopping everything we want to
control in our house Amazon is gonna be
the name that's emblazoned across all
these things and there's there would be
no competition for anything else if a
small company tries to start off by
having their own voices system and even
big company that Samsung have really not
done a good job in bringing Bixby here
it into our live except for if you
happen to have a Samsung device and Siri
the same it's limited in what it does
and it's impacted it's really Google and
Amazon that are now fighting for this
top position and the others have
basically already failed and you can see
this war is hotting up on many different
fronts for example this whole fiasco of
YouTube not being available on some of
these Amazon echo devices because Google
say it doesn't meet the right standards
I don't want to accuse Google of doing
anything bad I don't have any prove it
but it's interesting that they are
fighting against Amazon and saying well
you can't have this service because of
course YouTube is Google service and
it's something that Google want to be
able to promote but they don't want to
do it at the expense of people switching
away from Google assistants switching
over to Alexa and we also see in the
fact that the pricings of the mini
versions of these devices are so so
cheap I mean the Google mini and the
Amazon echo dot are just so cheap entry
points into these ecosystems and that's
just a classic marketing thing you
always make the first entrance really
really really cheap and then after with
people in get themselves invested inside
the ecosystem and then they buy more and
more and more so you start with one echo
dot and then you say well actually would
be good to have another one in the
kitchen and then you say well actually
in the lounge we actually would like
some better music
you get a bigger one and then suddenly
before you know it you've got three four
five across the house and then when you
come to buy your next appliance you say
well actually wouldn't it be good if it
actually integrated with my GU with my
assistance so if you've got Google you
want one a fridge or a microwave or a
telly or whatever that's got Google in
it if you've gone down the Alexa route
so now it's affecting our consumer
choices and people are buying devices
buying appliances buying their next car
based on does it have the correct
integration with the system the eco
system that you've already chose and of
course this technology can become more
sinister in the sense that it takes away
all vesses of privacy I mean you can
imagine now going to a shopping mall and
your phone sends a signal to something
in the more you get to the interactive
map and it's Alexa saying to our hello
welcome to the mall I know you're
looking for a pair of sunglasses
you know the shops down there on the
left worse you could go to a hospital or
to a doctor's and it's Alexa that greets
you Alexa tells the receptionist that
you've arrived
Alexa tells you what the waiting time is
and offers to play you some calming
music while you're waiting and then all
that information is scrolled away
somewhere on a server and it knows about
your medicines it knows about your
doctor's visits and those about you're
buying preferences it knows about what
TV channels you watch Kip knows
absolutely everything now is that a good
thing and so you can see now why it's
important who owns that front end it's
the front end to all the services that
we consume whether it's music video
shopping you know medical services you
know but everything we buy everything we
spend our money on you know everything
gets funneled through this one entry
point the voice assistant and who owns
that controls everything that goes
behind it
so that's why both Google and Amazon are
so desperate to get you into these
systems
well I'm Gary sim try under Authority I
hope you like this video I hope it
wasn't too negative I'm just trying to
show you why these companies are
spending so much money trying to get
there
voice assistance into your houses if you
liked the video please do give it a
thumbs up if you don't agree with me
tell me in the comments I'm gonna read a
lot of the comments and let's chat about
it let's see what you think about it
also don't forget to subscribe to and
rathore ''tis youtube channel hit that
Bell a notification icon so you get the
notification every time I release a new
video and last but not least please get
