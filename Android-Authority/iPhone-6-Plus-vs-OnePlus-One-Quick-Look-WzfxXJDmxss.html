flagship we find out in this a quick
look at the Apple iPhone 6 plus vs. the
oneplus one when it comes to the design
the iPhone 6 plus is basically a larger
version of its smaller sibling the same
full metal unibody construction rounded
edges all around and the signature home
button with the integrated fingerprint
scanner up front just in a larger body
the oneplus one is another Android
smartphone that is comparable to these
six plus in terms of size there's no
metal here though with the with the
oneplus one coming in either a baby's
skin white version or a sandstone black
version with both offering different
feels in the hand the display size is
the same on both but the 6 plus is
slightly taller and wider but it is
definitely thinner like its smaller
sibling the 6 plus is definitely one of
the thinnest smartphones you can get in
this size category the 6 plus is also
about 10 grams heavier than the oneplus
one Apple gave into the trend of bigger
smartphones which means that the display
comparison is a much more level playing
field this time around and it's almost
practically identical the 6 plus
features a 5.5 inch IPS LCD display
while the oneplus one comes with a LTPS
LCD screen of the same size both feature
1080p resolution resulting in an
identical pixel density of 401 pixels
per inch the experience is largely same
on both screens you'll get a good time
when it comes to text games movies
whatsoever the oneplus one did have some
issues with some units having a
yellowish tinge to it but at least my
unit does not have that problem so you
get a comparable bright color system
good brightness and great viewing angles
on either of these displays it's the
age-old ecosystem debate as the iPhone 6
plus does pack with it iOS 8 but
powering it is a dual-core a8 processor
clocked in at 1.4 gigahertz along with 1
gigabyte of RAM but then on the other
hand we have some of the best that is
there to offer in the oneplus one with
the flagship standard which is the
Snapdragon 801 at 2.5 gigahertz backed
by three gigabytes of RAM now while
there's an obvious difference on paper
it isn't really evident in real-world
performance which is something we've
expected an iPhone vs. Android already
so regardless of what you do with these
phones you'll have a smooth quick
experience the iPhone 6 plus comes with
16 64 or 128 gigabytes of storage while
the oneplus one comes in at 16 and 64
gigabyte
favors and neither offer the option of
expandable storage Apple did finally
introduce NFC with their device even if
it is limited to just the use of Apple
pay but also worth noting is the return
of the fingerprint scanner and that is a
convenient layer of extra security which
can now be used by some third party
applications in iOS 8 these are features
that don't make it onto the more Spartan
one plus one as we move into the cameras
we find that the iPhone 6 plus keeps the
8 megapixel rear shooter from its
predecessor though it does come with a
new sensor and F 2.2 aperture lens
faster autofocus and optical image
stabilization which is not found in its
smaller brethren video also gets a boost
as well especially with the ability to
capture slow-motion video at 240 frames
per second in 720p resolution indeed the
modes that are available in the iPhone 6
camera application might seem quite
limited but we have found that iPhone
quality in terms of this picture has
been pretty good in previous iterations
and we don't expect it to change in this
one on the other hand we have the 13
megapixel Sony Exmor RS sensor of the
oneplus one combined with six part lens
construction with the F 2.0 aperture a
dual LED flash and a great software
package that in contrast to the iPhone 6
camera app has a lot of different
features which will allow for a great
camera experience as cater to the way
that you want it to be on the front you
get a 5 megapixel camera with a wide
lens that enables an 80 degrees field of
view which is good for some selfie
lovers out there
and finally in software we revisit iOS
vs. Android but in the case of the
oneplus one it is CyanogenMod 11 s it's
basically a special release built
specifically for the oneplus one to take
advantage of all of its hardware and
features you get a clean minimalistic
stock like experience but get underneath
the surface and you'll find a lot of
customization options not just with the
device's theme engine and with its own
store for the theme mentioned but also
for various types of gestures that are
available and a lot of options to really
cater the experience to what you want it
to be like Android should be but for the
iPhone 6 the iOS 8 UI remains largely
the same as iOS 7 but there are some new
features such as the support for
third-party keyboards putting widgets in
the notification drop-down and the
actually robust new Health application
probably the most exciting feature is
continuity which allows you to have sync
across a bunch of different Apple
products but then from there you also
get the reach of
a feature which allows for one-handed
use but here is the crux of this
comparison where price isn't usually a
factor when it comes to flagship
comparisons because they usually all
fall around the same price range that is
not the case here with the 1+1 available
at almost 1/3 of the cost of the iPhone
6 plus this is certainly worth noting
for what could be considered a similar
experience at least in terms of size
display quality and for the most part
the different tasks that you would be
able to do in either one of these phones
if you do find that the oneplus one
already caters to what it is that you
need to do in your daily life then its
cost is probably going to be the trump
card that lets you choose it over the
iPhone 6 plus so keep it tuned to
Android Authority for even more coverage
of the iPhone and iPhone 6 plus as you
take a look at the competition here
