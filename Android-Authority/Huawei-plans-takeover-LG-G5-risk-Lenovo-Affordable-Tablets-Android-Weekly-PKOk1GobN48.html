doesn't get bigger than this week the
week of Mobile World Congress where many
of 2016's major flagships are about to
drop and not only that but Huawei claims
that they're going to be the number one
smartphone manufacturer on the planet
overtaking Samsung and Apple an LG has
made some pretty risky changes question
is are those risks going to pay off
now for those of you who claim to be
hardcore geeks tell me who is the top
number three smartphone seller on the
planet LG HTC Sony no hallway hallway
who wasn't known by anyone just a few
years ago is now number three and they
are aggressively looking to become
number one yesterday Richard you the
head of device businesses said that he
believes huawei could be number one in
just five years we are quite late to the
US market you confessed and it's true to
date the company has only played a small
role on US soil moving a poultry number
of phones through online sales if they
really want to take the US they'll have
to secure partnerships with the
country's major carriers an endeavor
they hope to make progress in over the
course of 2016 while some may scoff at
Huawei's intention to become the leading
name in the smartphone industry a little
context may make the naysayers a little
more hesitant as you pointed out during
a meeting in Barcelona this past weekend
four years ago no one knew who we were
even in China the company has vaulted to
the upper echelons of the mobile world
in just a few short years although the
path gets steeper and the air thinner at
those heights while way may just have
the momentum to carry themselves all the
way to the top how could that happen you
ask well by focusing on where Samsung
and Apple are not as strong and that's
the mid tier and entry-level markets now
you're thinking Jace Samsung has great
mid-tier options yes they do but as the
market matures it's very hard to beat a
phone that's good enough at a cheaper
price and the Chinese manufacturers are
masters are doing that Huawei has proved
it time and again now it's time to talk
about the g5 and it's made a splash LG
just took the wraps off the new g5 and
it's probably the most ambitious device
in the series this phone is LG's big bet
a high-stake gamble that might define
its future in the market that's
increasingly hard to impress with a
metallic unibody and innovative modular
design the g5 also comes with some
rather shocking changes on the software
side we spent an extensive time with the
g5 ahead of its unveiling today and this
is our attempt to answer the question
will LG's big gamble
pay off the LG g5 looks much better in
real life and not even our high quality
hands-on images really do it justice the
rumors we had were generally accurate
the LG g5 features an aluminum unibody
with a side-mounted volume rocker and a
power button built into the fingerprint
sensor on the back LG said goodbye to
his trademark rear mounted volume rocker
probably to avoid making the design on
the back look too busy the edges of the
g5 are rounded which goes nicely with
the subtle curvature of the bottom cap
and the top of the screen LG calls this
design 3d arc unfortunately there's a
seam between the back and the frame
which you can feel when holding the
device now I really encourage you guys
to look at Josh's article where he goes
into more detail about the LG g5 and
answers this question is the risk worth
it my take I just want to give you the
odds the odds that an innovation like
this however need and cool would have a
major impact on their bottom line so
late in the maturation of the smartphone
the odds aren't good it's not likely but
I applaud LG I mean it's awesome it's
cool I'm glad they tried it but I don't
think it's going to move the needle a
lot LG needs to have a new category new
device to be a leader in I know I sound
like a broken record what do you think
let me know in the comments below I'll
be reading them now last up let's talk
about Lenovo's new affordable tablets
this weekend at Mobile World Congress
Lenovo unveiled its new tab 3 series of
Android tablets there are three models
and cascading sizes of 7 8 and 10 inches
while the two smaller tablets are
designed around family use and even
include some family specific features
the 10 inch model is targeted at the
higher end business segment the tab 3 7
and tab 3 8 variants are both reasonably
priced and feature very similar
specifications the two are powered by a
1 gigahertz media tech quad core
processor one gigabyte of RAM
5-megapixel rear and 2-megapixel
front-facing camera combinations and
Android 6.0 marshmallow is installed by
default the tab 3 7 comes with a 7 inch
1024 x 600 resolution display while the
tab 3 8 is an 8-inch tablet with a 1280
by 800 pixel resolution
both are also I p52 rated for protection
against the odd splash of water there
are very few other hardware differences
between the two however the tab 3 8
comes with 16 gigabytes of internal
memory and a larger 4290 milliamp hour
battery then the seven inches 3450
milliamp hour battery cell and 8
gigabytes for 16 gigabyte storage
options while the tab 3 7 and 8 may be
very much lower tier tablets the Tab 3
10 is a more typical mid-range affair
the 10 inch display boosts the pixels up
to a full 1080p resolution which is
accompanied by Gorilla Glass 3
protection the quad-core CPU also sees
its clock speeds boosted slightly up to
1.3 gigahertz and there are 2 gigabytes
of RAM or 32 gigabytes of storage or an
option for 3 gigabytes of RAM and 64
gigabytes of storage for those who want
the extra space the Tab 3 10 packs a
meaty seven thousand million power
battery and 8 megapixel rear cam and a
5-megapixel front-facing cam with twin
Dolby Atmos speakers NFC and GPS
capabilities the tablet is also I p52
rated for some water resistance and
features android for work software for
those who are looking for a little extra
productivity out of their tablet now you
guys should know that our android
authority team over at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona are basically not
sleeping this week they are shooting

rinse and repeat so be watching the
channel new shows are going to drop
