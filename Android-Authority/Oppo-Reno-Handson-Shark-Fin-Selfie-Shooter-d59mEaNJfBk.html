authority and I'm just gonna get right
into it this is the Oppo Reno 10x zoom
edition there's also a standard edition
that doesn't have the 10x zoom and is
also a little bit low respect but the
main highlight of the Opel Reno is the
cameras both the front and rear cameras
both have something that make them
pretty interesting but we're gonna start
with the rear cameras so the primary
sensor the standard angle is a 48
megapixel it's the Sony AMX and it also
uses pixel binning for a better
low-light so your photos are 12
megapixels by default the camera in the
middle is an 8 megapixel ultra
wide-angle lens with a hundred and 20
degree field of view and the last camera
is a 13 megapixel periscope sensor this
is the same type of camera that we saw
on the Huawei P 30 probe it uses a prism
to refract light into a sensor that is
stacked sideways or perpendicular to the
phone and that's how you are able to
achieve a 10x zoom it will give you a 5x
optical zoom and then the 10x is a
hybrid zoom and in the short amount of
time that I've tested this telephoto
lens the 5x there is no loss in quality
at all and when you zoom into 10x you
will notice a slight degradation in
quality but it's still a pretty good
looking result it's definitely leaps and
bounds better than a 10x digital zoom
one thing to note is that the telephoto
lens has a very long minimum focusing
distance so this lens is really designed
to be used on objects that are much
further away and not things that are
right in front of you now let's switch
to the front-facing camera and the thing
that makes the front facing camera
interesting is that it pops up out of
the phone and Oppo is no stranger to
doing pop-up selfie cameras at this
point they did it with the find X and
more recently the Opel f11 Pro but this
one is really interesting and unique in
the sense that it has a wedge shape or a
shark fin and I'm not entirely sure of
the purpose behind this but it does look
uni
and it definitely will turn a lot of
heads on top of housing the front-facing
camera you'll notice that the earpiece
is also in here as well but you don't
actually have to have this open in order
to use the earpiece there's actually a
slit in the outer bezel that still
allows the sound from the earpiece to
come through even when the shark fin is
closed on the back of the shark fin it
also houses a flash so the rear flash
instead of being on the rear panel it's
on the actual pop-up itself so not only
will the shark fin come up whenever
you're using the front-facing camera but
it'll also pop out whenever you turn on
the flashlight so what this pop-up
allows Oppo to do is to have a display
that doesn't have a notch or a hole
punch so you essentially just get all
screen on the front with extremely
extremely thin bezels all around it
actually has a very impressive screen to
body ratio and it's a very large display
and it's also an OLED display that looks
pretty fantastic it's really bright
really colorful it's a good-looking
display but what about the rest of the
phone
well the Oppo Reno is a high-end
smartphone from Oppo so it has the
latest snapdragon 855 processor six to
eight gigabytes of RAM and a ton of
internal storage it's also running color
OS version 6 on top of Android 9 pi but
one feature you won't find on the Opel
Reno is a headphone jack
at least not on the 10x version if you
want a headphone jack you'll have to
settle for the standard edition of the
ovary no instead one thing that I do
appreciate about the ovary know though
is its overall design it's very typical
logo design with the rounded corners and
the tapered back glass but the cameras
on the back here are completely flushed
there's no bulge whatsoever and that's
partly due to this phone being a little
bit thicker than some other phones out
there but that extra thickness also
gives you a much larger battery so it's
sort of a win-win situation either way
this phone also has an in display
fingerprint sensor it's of the optical
variety but it's actually surprisingly
quick and very reliable in the short
amount of time that I've been using this
phone it's been very
be accurate definitely a lot better than
some of the other ones that I've used in
the past so this technology is
definitely making a lot of progress but
that's really it for the Oppo Reno this
has been a quick hands-on we're
obviously going to be reviewing this
phone and doing a lot more coverage on
it with the cameras and everything else
that this phone has so make sure you
guys stay tuned for that and if you
enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up
we appreciate it subscribe down below if
you haven't already and I'll talk to you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
