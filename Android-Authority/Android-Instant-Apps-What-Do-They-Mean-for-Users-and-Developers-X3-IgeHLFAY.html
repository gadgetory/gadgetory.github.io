order to own it I'm not being
philosophical can once we ever own
anything I'm of course talking about
Google's instant acts since the name
suggests instant apps are apps that run
instantly with no need to install them
or at least they install very quickly
and quietly in the background and then
they uninstall as soon as you're
finished with them just means you can
run any apps with no need to install it
on your device and take up loads of
space so for instance if you're
rummaging around in the dark and you
need yourself a flashlight app but you
don't install it because you know you
don't live in a mine then you can just
click run use the flashlight and then
when you're done it'll be gone and
there'll be no sign of it but the
usefulness of internet goes beyond this
because you can also launch a particular
part of an app using this feature and
that what will be particularly
interesting so we needed a link and this
will then launch you straight into
particular part of the application or a
particular activity this could be very
useful for shopping at for instance so
if you want to buy something in
particular on a website you click the
link it opens up in the app was no need
to install it and you can see the
product right there ready to buy it
through in-app purchases
there's many more potential users for
this as well the example that Google
gave at Google i/o was a parking meter I
walk up to a parking meter and I need to
pay I don't have the parking app on my
phone but what if I could tap my phone
in the mirror and with NFC it brings up
the parking app immediately I choose
hour-long I want a park and favor the
Android be simple and easy you can also
send leave links for each other so in
theory if I'm playing a crossword puzzle
I could send you a link over whatsapp
and you'd be able to launch a particular
puzzle
in the app without even needing to
install the particular application
businesses should be super excited about
this because it massively increases the
discoverability of apps it means that
you can share an apple an experience
that you're having with a friend and
they can do likewise there's no need to
install it no barrier to entry so are
there any limitations to instant apps of
course there are firstly the individual
aspects of the app that run an instant
apps can't be any bigger than four
megabytes that means that rich
multimedia videos 3d games a pretty
much off the card of course if you do
want to include a video in your instant
app and you can just stream that from
elsewhere but it means that something
like a 3d game is going to be a lot more
difficult to Z games should be fine
certainly puzzles as mentioned and maybe
2d games at stretch as long as you keep
those file sizes down in the future that
sounds like Google's certainly
interested in supporting games as
instant apps and they said games are
highly specialized categories of apps
and often have unique tools large assets
and high performance requirements even
so we are interested in exploring game
use cases
so yeah in future we might see 3d games
like asphalt 8 running as in some apps
but for now that's not possible most of
the features that are available to any
native app will be available to instant
apps as well that includes things like
the camera like I said location
awareness in-app purchases vibrations
phone contact but there are some things
that are currently not available that
includes the ability to change your
phone's wallpaper to send push
notifications or create background
services when you use any feature of an
internet like this you need to grant it
permission just as you would have done
with a regular app now developers are
probably wondering just how much of a
headache this is going to be for them to
implement the good news is that as of
Android Studios 3.0 instant apps will be
supported out of the box and I'll be
lots of features to hopefully make this
process as smooth as possible this
includes Apple Inc's assistant which
will make it easy for you to insert
those links straight into your apps that
you know which URLs are going to launch
which parts of your app and it will edit
your manifest file for you there's a
work very similar to deep links
currently the difficult part is going to
be the modularization of your apps
they're gonna have to break your app
down into lots of individual
smaller chunks obviously these might
usually represent activities within your
app but they're going to work as
separate modules called feature modules
you can have a base feature module and
this will be the kind of most important
codes and resources that all of the
smaller features will need then you'll
have this individual feature modules
which can run as instant apps so when a
user goes to a particular page within
your app they're going to install just
that feature module for that feature
module is going to be reliant on some of
the codes and resources that are in your
base module
Google assures us process of breaking
your app down to future modules and base
feature modules should take no more than
a day for
basic apps projects were obvious if
you've got a much bigger scale project
than it could take significantly longer
and developers are also going to have to
consider some best practices in terms of
the way they design their apps so Google
says you mustn't continuously pester
your users to install the pull app you
mustn't use splash screens in between
your individual activities and you
mustn't branching your way so the idea
is that you're interested should be
seamless whether or not the user is
launching them from a website or whether
they're using them as part of your
larger app and that's why you mustn't
have anything that breaks the flow of
that experience so if you want to go
with instant apps yourself right now
then you can do what you're going to
need either a Nexus device or a pixel
device if you do have one of those
devices then head over into your
settings go to personal then Google's
and then services and then toggle on in
some apps you'll then need to select yes
I'm in to say that yes you are in then
head over to taste-off and you should
see that some apps already have this
feature enabled and you can give those a
ghost
examples include BuzzFeed and wish the
rest of us are going to wait for people
says that this feature is going to be
coming to Android versions stating all
the way back to jelly beans said
millions of us will be able to get in on
the fun so what do you think of in San
apps we think this is a useful ideas
it's something you can see yourself
using if you're developers do you think
you're going to start creating it's an
app for converting your old apps into
instant apps
personally I think this has got a lot of
potential I really like the idea of
bringing up their share experiences from
within apps with my friends simply viral
ink like I would do any webpage I also
think it's going to make the experience
of browsing the web a lot more
interactive and media rich I think that
as connections increase in speed and
become more ubiquitous are going to see
more and more streaming of our apps and
experiences as cloud computing becomes
more of a viable options I think will
eventually not even download and install
the app but rather just stream it from a
server somewhere eventually we might use
all of our apps and all of our games
without having to download a thing when
that happens it will greatly reduce the
need for high powered processing in the
devices that we carry with us it will
change the face of hardware and software
of course with a little ways from that
yet but I think that instant apps is
definitely an interesting peek into that
potential future thanks Dan for watching
guys I hope you found this video useful
and interesting if you did then please
consider leaving a like maybe share it
around and let us know in the comments
