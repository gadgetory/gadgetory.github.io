epic camera destroying its competition
with its single rear sensor whilst
others using multiple cameras to try and
get the same results pixel series of
phones has seemed to have led in
point-and-shoot cameras let alone in
smartphone so how does the recently
released mid-range pixel 3a hold up to
the previous year's flagship that pixel
2x oh hey guys my name's ryan Thomas
land run Authority and today we're going
to find out
right off the bat the pixel to excel
looks and feels more premium the glass
and metal back with their subtly
textured coating and the smoothly
rounded front glass definitely give off
the impression that the Tex I was just
made better this extends to weather
proofing to the older model carries ip67
water and dust resistance whilst the
newer model doesn't carry any kind of
weather proofing at all it's easy to see
how these two are related at the top at
the back you've got that window you've
got the same kind of placements for the
logo the fingerprint scanner the buttons
even the bezels look fairly similar
although if I had to give a winner in
this category in terms of design and
build it have to be to excel for it's
much better build quality on paper the
displays are pretty similar six inches
of 18 by 9
OLED goodness I'll be at different
subtypes of OLED the resolution
difference makes the two Excel appear
far better on paper but I'd flip that
and say that there's a three A's Full HD
Plus G OLED panel is better its colors
and tone look more natural and it's
easier on the eyes than the heavily
contrasty and otherwise bland looking
peer light of the two Excel LG at the
time we're known for making pretty poor
panels and the Twix aisle just happened
to fall in the line of fire there sure
the 3a excels display is of a lower
resolution but I find the overall
experience to be better the colors the
viewing angles and everything like that
the two excel does feature some better
speakers because they are both stereo
and fun facing whereas the 3a XL has
stereo speakers but it's more of a
hybrid setup but then the three Axl gets
one back again because it has a
headphone port and the two XL doesn't so
if I had to round this out with sound
and vision category I'd have to give
this one to the three Axl for its better
display and the use of a headphone port
next up is performance and this is
pretty tricky to cover because although
the snapdragon 670 is newer and is meant
to be mid-range versus the higher-end
835 in the older to excel they perform
closer than you may have expected
surprisingly the 670 is actually based
on the 845 which starts to make more
sense when you see the numbers are so
close in synthetic benchmarks like
Geekbench they are basically a stone's
throw away and in gaming the same story
continues the tour Excel does pull
slightly ahead here
and one of the big benefits of going
with the older model is the fact that
you get 128 gigabyte version instead of
just the 64 that you get with the 3x out
and since need to have microSD expansion
if you want more storage you're gonna
have to go with the older model neither
phone is going to give you the oneplus
and breathtaking speed but neither is
actually going to disappoint you and I
found performance to be very good on
both to these devices but since the two
Excel pulls away here we have to give
that one to the older model battery life
is thankfully a lot easier to compare
because the Sree Excel has a lower
resolution screen a more power efficient
system on the chip and has a larger
battery at 3700 milliamp hours it
handily pulls away from the 35 20
milliamp hour cell found in the older
pixel to excel and I found back to your
life to just be a complete win for the
three XL of course neither is at that
kind of 2019 standard which is around
4000 million powers but if I had to give
just a clear winner it would have to be
the 3a Excel and neither feature
wireless charging which is bear the
shame the pixels biggest feature it's
camera system is something that is so
contrasting on both devices that it's
really weird
the older pixel to excel likes to wash
out colors more and add more contrast
and I know give kind of a warmer image
not to say that 2 XL is bad but it's
just not quite up there and I would take
the 3 Excel for it's much better dynamic
range and with a new essentially updated
software that kind of makes sense so
it's 3 to 2 the newer model the 3a
excellent I was kind of expecting this
to happen yes I know that in the general
gist of things the 2 XL has some better
hardware it's got a much higher
resolution screen it's got a slightly
more powerful system on a chip and its
overall build better
however the 3 XL is just that good that
it's better than the old flagship the
reason we're comparing the Tuesday is
because they're very similar in price
the 3 XL is slightly more expensive if
you want to buy one brand new but the 2
exhale can be had for 200 to 300 pounds
or around 300 US dollars which is
awesome when you consider what you'll
get in for the money if I had to
personally take one away it will be the
three axl it's better camera is better
screen and it's better battery life all
add up to make it the better option for
me even if I'm shelling out just a lift
a bit more free we're really excited to
see what Google does with the pixel 4
and if you have any thoughts on that
