bring enhancements to what was already a
pretty great offering so what exactly
has changed from one to the other well
it's Joshua regard from Android thority
what's going on everybody and this is
the HTC One m8 versus the original HTC
One m7 now while the general design
language of both phones is very similar
the latest iteration is even more
refined with more curves and rounded
corners while the award-winning
all-metal design of the 2013 edition was
fantastic the brush metal of the 2014
device adds another level of
sophistication to what was already a
classy design with a display that is 0.3
inches larger the m8 is definitely the
bigger phone overall and the width
didn't increase by much thankfully
making the larger device still quite
comfortable to hold despite the added
weights to 160 grams from the 143 of the
original HTC One it actually sits even
more snugly in the hand thanks to those
rounded corners and the more smooth
sides because the aluminum material has
been made to wrap around the device so
HTC has always come up with some great
designs for their smart phones and while
they may not have changed anything very
significantly this time around no one
should really find anything to complain
about in the update still in the display
HTC has always been relatively
conservative with their display sizes as
the original HTC One had a 4.7 inch
screen when other companies were
starting to release 5-inch flagships but
with the latest addition the size does
get bumped up to that 5-inch stroke but
it is still smaller compared to some of
the more recently announced flagships
as considering the trend the increased
display size results in a drop in pixel
density from 469 to 441 PPI but and no
one should really see any noticeable
difference and once again it's a
beautiful Super LCD 3d display with
1080p resolution making viewing angles
as great as always and colors popping
out quite nicely in this more colourful
version of sense underneath the hood we
get the update to the quad-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 801 processor clocked in at
2.3 gigahertz in the West and 2.5
gigahertz in the East so you get the
best processing package currently
available which is of course expected
from a flagship device HTC has worked
hard to reduce the heaviness of its
Sense UI and the device should fly
through the user interface and easily
handle anything
can throw at it and this pretty much did
hold up in our testing on the other hand
the HTC One 2013 features a quad-core
Snapdragon 600 processor clocked in at
1.7 gigahertz and it's still definitely
a very able performer with 2 gigabytes
of RAM that help with the multitasking
basically the difference in performance
comes just because of the year-to-year
change and the available hardware the
600 was the best available at its points
and now the 801 is the best available in
the current space today in terms of
hardware the HTC One m7 of last year
boasted specs very similar to the
samsung galaxy s4 and arguably had the
better design but a lot of consumers
mentioned their reasoning for choosing
the latter was because of expandable
storage availability a feature that
hasn't been available in an HTC flagship
for a while
luckily that changes with this new
version of the HTC One as 16 or 32
gigabyte options get the additional
benefit of microSD card support which
might be the tipping point in favor of
the HTC One m8 the battery life has been
bumped up from 2300 milliamp hours to
2600 milliamp hours and the Snapdragon
801 should be able to make battery
consumption even better so we should see
a better battery performance from one to
the other and as far as those boomsound
speakers go the great front facing
speaker design that was originally
introduced in the HTC One m7 continues
here but the amplifiers in the speakers
have been enhanced to provide an even a
louder
experience with an even better sound
stage from mids and lows HTC did stick
to the four ultrapixel camera of the HTC
One from last year and while it had its
hits and misses its low-light
photography was actually pretty
undeniably good but this time around to
the processing has been improved so that
all other photography gets the same
types of enhancements while the same
camera does make a return this time it
does get a dual LED flash and what is
also very interesting is the inclusion
of that second rear camera called the
duo camera in which it takes the depth
of field data and adds it into the photo
in a hardware solution that allows you
to go into the picture and edit it in
order to pick your focal points in a
very easy way having a hardware solution
this time around eliminates the need for
the processing time that more software
based solutions use and in our testing
it was actually very nice
to use and very easy and is one of the
real distinguishing features of the HTC
One m8 camera and if selfies are
important to you you do get an enhanced
5 megapixel sensor on the front with a
88 degree wide angle lens the camera app
has also been very vastly improved more
opting for simplistic elegance rather
than just a full feature set it is very
easy to use but if you delve into the
settings a little bit more you'll find
that there are a lot of options for
manual shooting and finally in software
the Sense UI does make its return and is
updated to Sense 6.0 on the HTC One m8
which is now on top of Android 4.4
KitKat
the usual array of software features
including blinkfeed do make a comeback
but things have seemed to been
simplified a little bit as there's no
longer the paginated format of the
original blinkfeed in the HTC One m7 and
is now a more of a traditional scroll
with a bunch of rectangles made for all
of the consolidation of your social
media applications and also of your news
sources as far as the aesthetics ago you
do get that new power widgets underneath
the notification drop-down and also all
of the icons seem to be about the same
but or consolidate a little bit closer
together
to accommodate that larger screen and
also some gesture-based features are
available in the new m8 version
including the ability to just move the
phone up to your face and be able to
activate the phone by double tapping on
the screen or in a horizontal position
pressing down on the volume key in order
to turn on the camera just to name a
couple and so there you have it for this
quick look at the HTC One m8 versus the
HTC One m7 of last year it's undeniable
that there is a good update from one to
the other here and you can get your
hands on the new HTC One right now as it
is on sale if you were looking for a
even better experience from the greatly
received HTC one of last year then you
don't have to look any further than the
one that was just released today so keep
it tuned to Android 34 all of the best
coverage on the HTC One m8 for future
future focus videos comparisons and the
like because Android authority is your
source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
