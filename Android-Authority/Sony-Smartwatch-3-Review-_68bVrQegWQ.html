Android authority and Sonia is certainly
no stranger to the SmartWatch game and
it was only a matter of time before we
saw an Android wear SmartWatch from Sony
but with the growing number of Android
wear smartwatches how does Sony stack up
to the competition well that's what
we're here to find out with the Sony
SmartWatch 3 with the design of the
SmartWatch 3 Sony has chosen to go a
different route from other OEMs it's a
square face so it's not trying to
imitate the look of a real watch or be
elegant or classy so it's certainly not
the type of watch you'd want to wear to
a fancy dinner or night on the town
instead the design of the SmartWatch 3
has more of a fitness look and feel to
it so it's being aimed more at an active
audience the wrist straps are made out
of silicone and there's an adjustable
metal clasp making it very easy and
quick to put on the metal clasp is a
nice touch and the silicone band feels
very soft and comfortable on the wrist
but like many products made out of
silicone is a dust and lint magnet
making it very difficult to keep clean
the face or body of the watch is what
Sony likes to call the core so it's a
similar implementation to the smartband
Sony released earlier this year it's
removable but there's not a whole lot of
reason why you'd want to take it out
unless you were swapping wrist straps
this also means you're not going to be
able to use any watch straps of your
choice and instead you'll be limited to
what Sony has to offer but as of right
now black is the only color available on
the Google Play Store the SmartWatch 3
features a rating of ip68 so it's
resistant to water and dust just like
any other Android wear watch but unlike
other Android wear watches this is the
first one we've seen so far that doesn't
feature a heartrate monitor which is a
very odd omission as far as the size
goes I personally don't think it's all
that big it's very similar in size to
something like the Moto 360 but
obviously size is a very subjective
thing so depending on the size of
watches that you currently wear right
now that is going to influence whether
you think the SmartWatch 3 is a big or a
small watch the display only Sony
SmartWatch 3 if you couldn't already
tell is a square and it's a 1.6 inch
trench
selective LCD display with 320 by 320
resolution putting it on par with the
competition but the quality of the
display doesn't quite stack up it's
bright and has great viewing angles but
colors look washed out and there's a
yellowish tint to the display it's
mostly noticeable when you're looking at
anything with a white background but
considering that Android wear has a lot
of white elements you're pretty much
going to notice it right away the bezels
on the display are also pretty thick but
that's to be expected right now with any
Smart Watch featuring a square screen
the SmartWatch 3 features a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core processor and 512
megabytes of RAM which is really more
than enough power for what our
smartwatches are capable of right now so
there's not much to say about these
SmartWatch 3s performance except that
it's very fast and responsive it runs
Android wear about as well as any other
wear watch so you're not going to
encounter any lag stutters or drop
frames leaving you with a very smooth
and enjoyable experience with the latest
Android wear update Google brought GPS
functionality and offline music storage
and the SmartWatch 3 is the first
Android wear watch that has the hardware
to take advantage of both of these
features Sony built this watch for
fitness and what they built in GPS you
can track you're walking or running
independently of your phone meaning you
don't have to love your phone around
with you in order for it to work because
everyone knows how much of a pain it is
to have your phone with you when you're
working out right now Google's own my
track app is the only app that supports
it but this will most likely change in
the coming weeks and months as
developers update their apps the same
story goes for music so you can now
store music directly onto the watch's
four gigabytes of internal memory for
offline listening but as of right now
the only app that currently takes
advantage of it is Google Play Music so
if you're not a play music subscriber
you're basically Sol and these songs are
transferred to the watch via bluetooth
and since watches don't have 3.5
millimeter headset jacks you'll need a
Bluetooth headset to listen to them so
essentially if you don't have a play
music subscription or a Bluetooth
headset you won't be able to take
advantage of this feature but if you
meet both of these requirements then you
are good to go
Sony's life log app has also been
updated to support the SmartWatch 3 and
if you're not familiar with the life log
app it's an app that not only keeps
track of your exercise but also other
daily activities like sleeping playing
games watching TV and browsing the web
anytime you've hit any of your daily
goals your notifications will appear on
the watch the rest of the Android wear
experience is practically the same
mostly because Google doesn't allow OMS
to modify the experience outside of the
watch faces and Sony has added a few
watch faces but they're all pretty bland
looking and don't feature any additional
functionality outside of telling the
time with the 420 milliamp hour battery
the SmartWatch 3 has a larger capacity
battery than most other Android wear
smartwatches right now so you would
think the battery life would be slightly
better but it's really just average
hours getting anywhere between two to
two and a half days worth of battery
life depending on if I had always screen
on turned on or off but this is with
rather normal usage if you plan on using
the GPS a lot for tracking your walking
or running the battery drains extremely
quick and I was losing roughly 20%
within an hour's time so depending on
how many hours you use the GPS a day you
may or may not even make it through a
full day the good thing about the
SmartWatch 3 is that it doesn't use a
proprietary charger so there's no
wireless charger there's no cradle and
there's no dock it's just good
old-fashioned microUSB the one that Sony
provides is kind of short so you'll most
likely want to use a different one it's
not the most elegant or nicest way of
charging a SmartWatch and plugging in
the microUSB cable into the back of the
watch is kind of a chore the good thing
is you can charge this watch a lot
easier because microUSB cables are a
dime a dozen and in more places like in
your car for example so while the
microUSB might seem very pedestrian not
having to carry around a specific
charger is a definite benefit the Sony
SmartWatch 3 is priced at to $49.99 on
the Google Play Store making it one of
the more expensive Android wear watches
on the market and putting it at the same
price point as the Moto 360 it's
certainly not as classy but it wasn't
designed to be so whether the $250 price
tag
it's worth it will depend on how
important having the built-in GPS is to
you and how much you plan on using this
watch for fitness because that's the
only thing differentiating this watch
from the competition and there you have
it for the Sony SmartWatch 3 with Sony's
entry into Android wear there are now
plenty of choices to pick from and
depending on what you're looking for in
a SmartWatch that will determine which
one is right for you
if you're looking for the best fitness
centric Android wear watch the Sony
SmartWatch 3 is the one to get but the
$250 price tag might be tough to swallow
especially when you take a look at the
watch as a whole as always guys thank
