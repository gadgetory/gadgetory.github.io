hindi the android authority app guy and
it's about that time of the month to
round up the best new android apps that
were released in September of 2017
if you want to check out any of these
apps for yourself you can find those
links in the video description below
Amazon Prime video isn't technically new
amazon re-released the application on
the Play Store after a long period of
absence the application works fairly
well you get access to Amazon's video
library and that includes TV shows
movies original series and various
channels the channels may cost you a
little bit extra though it doesn't have
chromecast support and that's a serious
problem for a video streaming service
these days otherwise the application
isn't half-bad
AMOLED minimal X is a new wallpaper app
this one is for AMOLED and OLED displays
most of the featured wallpapers have
large amounts of black with a splash of
color or other design that way they can
help improve battery life even if it's
just by a little bits there isn't a huge
selection of wallpapers to choose from
however what's there is enough for most
to find something that they like it's
free with no in-app purchases but it
does have advertising flexi is a new
screen recorder app it works by
periodically taking screenshots of
whatever it is that you do the app then
saves those screenshots and even plays
them back for you in order the interface
is quite hideous however we did find
that it worked pretty well and it does
what it says that it does this is
definitely a niche product those who
need a timeline of what they did on
their phone definitely have one now the
application is free to download and the
pro version has a variety of price tags
the maximum of which being $8.99
gyroscope is a new fitness app it can
bring in a bunch of information from
other fitness apps like Fitbit and
Google Fitz you can also add information
manually the application keeps track of
your steps Fitness weight and various
other health metrics the free version
does the basic tracking the pro version
goes for $9.99 per month and includes
more graphics sleep tracking and more
in-depth information it's still in beta
and that means it's a little buggy but
otherwise it's not half bad hurricane
impact is the official weather
application of hurricane track comm and
it helps you track hurricanes the
application offers news in the form of
blog and Twitter
it also includes video contents live
camera footage of hurricanes and other
useful resources that also does include
stats on potentially upcoming hurricanes
about the only thing we didn't like
about it is the user interface it looks
old
even though it does work really well the
application is $3.99 with no in-app
purchases mint browser is a surprisingly
good new web browser its main focus is
security and privacy that includes an
advanced incognito mode with encrypted
bookmarks browsing history and even
notes that's hidden behind a password or
your fingerprint the app also includes
tor proxy supports mint browser works
surprisingly well as a browser and it
manages to load web pages pretty rapidly
it also comes with adblock should you
want that the application is free to
download with a pro version going for a
dollar 49 make sure create is the latest
application from Microsoft it allows you
to livestream videos on your mobile
device it's made for gamers mostly
however you can use it for pretty much
whatever you want the application
includes a chat viewing metrics and a
lot more and you can also stream with
your cameras or your phone screen
Microsoft has a separate application for
viewing mixer content so you won't be
able to do that with this one the
account linking process is a bit of a
pain but the actual streaming experience
isn't half-bad Noten is a simple little
note-taking app it doesn't have a main
interface like most others instead you
add a note and that note is then added
to your notifications it stays there
until you clear it out this isn't great
for long notes or notes that are meant
to last a long time however it does work
rather well for quick little reminders
for things you may often forget it's
free to download and use but it does
need a little bit of optimization
reverse dictionary is a simple reference
app that allows you to look up words by
how they sound how they might be spelled
and by the description of the word there
are a variety of niche uses for
something like this it works great for
people who are learning English as a
Second Language you can also use it as a
thesaurus or even as a helper for
crossword puzzles the app is easy enough
to use as well it is also completely
free with no in-app purchases or
advertisements split-screen Creator is a
tool for multitasking it allows you to
put two applications together into a
single shortcut the shortcut then opens
both of the applications and androids
multi window mode this is very similar
to the galaxy
a feature that does a very similar thing
this one also comes with support for
icon packs and you can even have it open
the same application twice you can
download it for free and the full
version runs for $0.99 do note that you
will need a phone that runs at least
Android 7.0 nougat in order to use this
and that about does it for this one
folks don't forget to subscribe and hit
the bell so you can get the latest
android authority videos as soon as they
come out all of these apps are linked up
in the video description below if you
want to check them out as always thanks
for watching everybody and have a
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
