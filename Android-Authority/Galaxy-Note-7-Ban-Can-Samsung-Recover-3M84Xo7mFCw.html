they could lose significant market share
and possibly never gain it back you
think it couldn't get worse for Samsung
until it does the US government has
officially banned the Samsung Galaxy
Note seven smartphone from all airplane
flights in the country beginning at noon
Eastern Time on Saturday October 15th
now previously the Department of
Transportation allowed the Galaxy Note 7
to be placed on board airplane flights
but only if they were powered down and
not in use this new ban effectively
keeps the smartphone from all flights
regardless of whether or not they are
powered down Samsung announced a few
days ago it would end production of the
Galaxy Note 7 after continuing reports
that even some of its replacement phones
were exploding the US Consumer Product
Safety Commission also issued a second
and final recall on the smartphone
samsung is now offering up a $100 bill
of credits to any galaxy note 7 owner
who wishes to switch to another galaxy
handset or a $25 credit for people who
either want a refund or if they switched
to another phone made by a company
outside of Samsung now imagine for a
moment that tens of thousands of people
who travel on Airlines every day maybe
even some of you who hear the alarming
commercial that Samsung Galaxy Notes are
so dangerous they can't even be on a
flight that is painfully damaging to
Samsung now you know a debacle like this
has reached epic proportions
when sheeple non techie people come to
me and say hey did you hear what the
Galaxy Note seven did you cover that are
you sick of talking about it now you
know it's massive when even those people
are talking about it it's really bad but
can Samsung recover if so how when the
average consumer believes that a
particular product is the number one in
its category namely right now the Galaxy
Note seven a huge flagship it is almost
impossible to change their mind unless
of course a new idea can take over and
the old idea was that the Galaxy Note
seven is one of the best Android
flagship phones period but it will no
longer be
it's considered also the most dangerous
so this provides possibly a fantastic
opportunity to Xiaomi hallway or some
other manufacturer that could usurp that
position and become be not just the best
phablet phone but the best Android phone
pretty excited now I know what some of
you are thinking you're thinking Jase
know what about LG the v20 is awesome
what about HTC they're awesome no no no
it's gonna be the Chinese that Chinese
are coming hell no the Chinese are here
they're making fantastic phones at far
cheaper prices and they are coming to
the west now part of the very dark and
cynical person to me believes that this
could have been a brilliant although
very macca valiant attempt by a Samsung
competitor to sabotage Samsung think
about it for a moment I think that
Samsung you know shot themselves in the
foot with the initial problem with the
battery with Samsung Galaxy Note 7 but
after so much attention for like six to
eight weeks on the replace in the Galaxy
Note seven and the exploding battery on
the airplanes and in the truck and all
that kind of stuff all that needed to
happen is that one or two of those
samsung note 7 replacements needed to
explode and it was all over for the
Samsung Galaxy Note series is that
possible is a company capable of doing
something like that
hell yeah I'm not saying it did I don't
have any evidence to suggest it but
there's just that part of me that's
thinking mmm
that's very possible it's safe to say
that pretty much everyone hates
