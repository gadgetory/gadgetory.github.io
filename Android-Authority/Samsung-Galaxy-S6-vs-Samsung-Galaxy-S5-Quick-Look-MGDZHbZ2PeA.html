Android authority and the brand new
Galaxy s6 is finally here but how does
it compare to last year's Galaxy s5
well that's what we're going to find out
what the galaxy s6 versus the galaxy s5
while the design language between the
two generations of Samsung's flagship
still share a lot of elements especially
a front with a tactile home button
flanked by capacitive back and recent
app keys to be found once again there is
a stark and much needed and appreciated
difference in build material though with
the plastic build alongside the dimpled
back cover of the galaxy s5 giving way
to a more premium metal build with
elements of glass and plastic on the
back with the galaxy s6 the curved sides
and edges of the galaxy s6 give a more
rounded look as well compared to the
rigid lines of its predecessor even with
both devices featuring identical display
sizes the galaxy s6 is the leaner and
thinner of the two allowing for an even
better in hand experience there have
been a lot of complaints about Samsung
not doing much in terms of design and
build quality between generations of its
flagship S line but finally the s6
brings with it this much hoped for
change it's not without its compromises
though with the new unibody design
meaning that the battery is no longer
replaceable a very well-liked feature of
samsung smartphones as mentioned the
display size remains the same with both
smartphones featuring 5.1 inch Super
AMOLED screens but the resolution has
been bumped up to quad HD from the 1080p
resolution of the s5 with the pixel
density going from 432 PPI to a whopping
577 as always those Super AMOLED brings
with everything we love about it
including deep blacks bright vibrant
colors and great viewing angles
resulting in a fantastic experience on
either display Samsung always packs its
flagships with the latest and greatest
and that holds true for both the galaxy
s5 packs a 2.5 gigahertz quad-core
snapdragon 801
backed by two gigabytes of ram with
another version featuring an ex
5 octa with both processing packages
offering the type of performance you'd
expect on the other hand Samsung has
given Qualcomm a pass this time around
in favor of their in-house Exynos 7420
chip coupled with 3 gigabytes of RAM
once again performance is fantastic but
credit has to be given to Samsung's more
streamlined iteration of TouchWiz things
remain the same in other hardware with
both offering 32 and 64 gigabytes of
space which is further expandable one
advantage the s5 does have is with
regards to the overall protection from
the elements it provides with its ip67
rating for dust and waterproofing that
isn't available with the galaxy s6 but
may make its way to a future ruggedized
version in terms of battery the galaxy
s6 packs a smaller 2600 milliamp hour
battery compared to the 2800 milliamp
hour unit of the s5 which could be a
problem given the higher resolution
display and the fact that the battery is
now non removable that said the Exynos
7420 is said to be a lot more frugal
with its power consumption so we'll have
to wait for real-world testing to see
how exactly the galaxy s6 fares in terms
of battery life the 16 megapixel isocell
rear shooter of the galaxy s5 offers
some great detail fantastic color
reproduction and clear and crisp images
the galaxy s6 also packs a 16 megapixel
rear camera with a setup identical to
what is available with the note 4 and
such should provide the great experience
we got with its larger flagship
counterpart samsung also packs its
camera software with a ton of features
so you get a bunch of modes and features
to help you get the most out of this
smartphone camera the Galaxy S 5 runs
Android 4.4 KitKat with an upgrade to
lollipop already arrived for some of
course with TouchWiz on top while this
iteration is quite smooth and sleek it's
really not toned down at all features
such as multi window the new s health
app with heart rate monitoring and my
Magazine are all available along with a
bunch of gesture controls there are no
real major UI changes except for the
recent apps
mien and notification drop-down that
will be available with the updates of
5.0 on the other hand the galaxy s6 pax
5.0 lollipop with the latest version of
TouchWiz on top and finally Samsung
seems to have streamlined its software
experience a lighter UI that doesn't put
much stress on the hardware it's always
a good thing and in this case only a few
features and apps are found
pre-installed with users now being given
the option to download more if they
choose to do so and that pretty much
wraps it up for this quick comparison of
the galaxy s6 versus the galaxy s5
there's definitely a lot more to come so
stay tuned for the rest of our Mobile
