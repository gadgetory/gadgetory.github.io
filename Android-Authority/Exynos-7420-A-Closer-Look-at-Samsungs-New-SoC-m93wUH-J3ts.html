brought to you by domain.com
so you remember all the ruckus that was
made about the Snapdragon 810
overheating well it turns out to be a
lot of hot air and some believes that
that hot air was a false rumor created
by Samsung itself to help generate buzz
regarding its own system-on-a-chip
the beast that is the Exynos 7420 so
let's look at that puppy a little closer
as expected this samsung galaxy s6 is
another industry-leading flagship
smartphone especially when it comes to
hardware packing in some of the latest
and greatest pieces of mobile tech this
time though Samsung is opted to
exclusively use its in-house Exynos 7420
system on a chip rather than a Qualcomm
processor as it is done in previous
years
so let's devil into the specifics one of
the Exynos 7420 s big talking points has
been the move down to a 14 nanometer
FinFET manufacturing process which puts
samsung ahead of Qualcomm's 20 nanometer
Snapdragon 810 because when it comes to
manufacturing size smaller numbers are
better as shorter transistor distances
consume less energy and boost processing
speeds however smaller closely packed
transistors can lead to current leakage
between parts of a chip an issue that
FinFET manufacturing addresses by
enclosing the conducting channel in a
thin silicon fin for the same processor
design lower power consumption means
heat room for increasing clock speeds or
additional power savings which will help
explain some of the capabilities of
Samsung's chip as we dive deeper the
bulk of Exynos 7420 s processing
components are rather familiar though
it's built from arms reference cortex a
57 and a 53 CPU cores at a quick glance
the design is very familiar to the
Galaxy Note Exynos 54:33 chip thanks to
the smaller manufacturing process
Samsung has been able to up its clock
speeds to 200 megahertz on the GPU side
and 72 mega Hertz on the GPU side
working out to a very rough 10 percent
increase over the Exynos 54:33 and while
this will inevitably lead to
some performance gains the biggest
changes have been made to the system on
a chips memory and GPU specifications
but the GPU is where Samsung has
implemented the largest performance
gains over the Exynos 5 series as well
as the clock speed increase Samsung has
scaled up the number of GPU cores from 6
in the note 4 to 8 in the s6 and this
extra graphics grunt will come in handy
when gaming on the galaxy s6 is qHD
display comparing our own galaxy s6
benchmark tests against the galaxy note
4 we see a rather substantial increase
when it comes to 3d graphics performance
at 2560 x 1440 now benchmarks don't
indicate real-world performance but it
certainly confirms the areas in which
Samsung has managed to make significant
improvements with performance up and
consumption down Samsung's push for a 14
nanometer has clearly paid off and it's
clear why the company chose to drop
Qualcomm Snapdragon Series this
generation although CPU performance is
only marginally better than some
existing flagships additional GPU
performance and battery savings are
precious improvements for samsung's qHD
galaxy s6 so in yesterday's show I made
the effort to find a new domain name
that was interesting and new one that I
haven't talked about before so I just
grabbed the first one I saw ishka having
no idea what it meant but it turns out
it means a genteel girl or woman
especially one who attracts a Jewish man
I don't need any Jewish men thank you
I'm good
but I do need a good domain name
extension he knows there could be a lady
out there who wants to be the Android
ishka just not me because it's not just
about ComNet org anymore you now have
the opportunity to name your site or
build your brand in ways never before
possible choose from a growing list of
more than 200 domain name extensions
like ninja NYC expert org club in this
case dot ishka all available now at
domain.com and the guys who domain.com
want to hook our viewers up with a great
offer save 15% off domain names and web
hosting when you use our coupon code
Android at domain.com check out don't
forget 15% off when you use our coupon
code Android when you think domain names
think domain.com
alright thanks for watching all you
Android sheesh cos love to connect with
you right here on Google+ or Twitter as
usual and you don't wanna forget about
these guys these guys work so hard to
deliver the best content on the web your
