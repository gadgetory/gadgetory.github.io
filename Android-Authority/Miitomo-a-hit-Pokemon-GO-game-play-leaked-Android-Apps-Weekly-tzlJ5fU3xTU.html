weekly show is sponsored by mega cast
hello again ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe
handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 133 let's get right
into those headlines Sony announced that
they will soon be developing games for
mobile they've established a new company
called forward works that will take some
old PlayStation properties and create
new mobile games out of them Sony has
promised that these will be full-fledged
games which is something everyone has
been pining for a study was released
earlier this week that shows that the
majority of in-app purchases take place
over the first three days of an app's
existence and more interestingly half of
all in-app purchase revenue comes from a
measly one point nine percent of mobile
gamers this is a vastly different figure
that most we're probably expecting there
is so much hype for miitomo right now
that you could probably put it on a
plate and eat it the application was
released in Japan this last week and
already has netted over 1 million
downloads that's quite impressive and we
expect the numbers to be similar or
better when it gets a worldwide launch
we received our first official look at
Pokemon go this week with application
screenshots this is shortly after a
video was leaked at South by Southwest
that showed how the game will be played
we still have no idea when the game will
be released but expect it to be a huge
hit when it does come out because it
definitely looks like a lot of fun
Google is engaging in a little bit of
April Fool's Day tomfoolery this week as
an astronaut named Alex Scott has been
posting app reviews all over the place
in the Google Play Store the gag is that
Alex Scott is posting from low orbit
using a nexus 16 and he's using
spaceships instead of stars
very amusing Google very amusing for
even more Android apps and games news

dear Rack is the latest game from
mediocre the creators of smash hit and
do not commute in this little puzzle
game your job is to connect various dots
but you must avoid the wrong colors the
better you do the more points you get it
has a sci-fi theme to it and the game
tends to rest on the easy side according
to most reviewers it's not the most
exciting game ever but it is relatively
inexpensive and has no in-app purchases
it also has Google Play games
achievements reverse tethering no root
is an application that does exactly what
the title says it does it allows you to
hook your device up to your computer and
then you can use your computer's
internet on your phone this is useful in
those rare cases where you don't have a
steady web connection for your phone it
doesn't work with every application such
as the Google Play Store but it does
work surprisingly well there is a free
version with some limitations and a paid
version with no limitations the Total
War battles Kingdom is a new strategy
game out of Sega in this title you're
tasked with building a base battling the
bad guys and taking on opponents online
in real time it's not quite as in-depth
as Age of Empires but it should provide
more depth and gameplay than something
like clash of clans it looks good and
the mechanics seem to work pretty well
it's free to play with in-app purchases
as well it's also cross-platform so you
can play on phones tablets or even
computers the Droid ID is a very
creative application and perhaps one of
the best yet that uses Android
marshmallows native fingerprint scanning
support this application allows you to
lock your computer and then unlock it
using a fingerprint on your device
you'll have to install the application
and the computer companion but our
testing shows that it actually works
pretty well for now it only supports Mac
devices but word is that windows support
