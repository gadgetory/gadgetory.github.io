authority now I did my review of the
Raspberry Pi 3 which had built-in Wi-Fi
and bluetooth I said that the type
wouldn't be great if all rather aspire
boards of the future had built-in Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth I even suggested the
Raspberry Pi foundation later board
called the Ralphy 5-0 plus which has
built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and sold
$15 well they didn't listen to my advice
because not called the Raspberry Pi zero
plus it's called the Raspberry Pi zero
ww4 Wireless and it doesn't cost fifteen
dollars it cost just ten now I'm not
going to do a full review of this board
because we it is very similar to the
Raspberry Pi zero however this is a good
opportunity to look at what is new in
the Raspberry Pi zero w and just where
we are with the Raspberry Pi zero in
general so just to refresh your memory
what you get here is a small circuit
board with an arm v6 processors a 32-bit
processor capable of running Linux
you get half a gigabyte of memory you
get a micro SD card slot for holding the
operating system in your data you have a
mini HDMI port for connecting to a
television or monitor and a micro USB
port for connecting peripherals like
keyboard mine and so on the version of
Linux that comes with it's called
raspbian and it's capable of accessing
the full GPIO pins as a set of pins that
you can use to resent the data to
control stepper motors to do anything
you'd like to do in Hardware and control
it in software so looking around the
board we see a couple of interesting
things first of all this is a one sided
board with no components on the back end
of this circuit board and on the front
side of it we have the main feature
there is the Broadcom arm v6 CPU also
has a GPU on it it's also half a
gigabyte of memory then looking around
the ports on the top you have this
unpopulated area for the GPIO pins you
can solder a header in there and those
pins are compatible with all the other
Raspberry Pi devices on the left here
you have the micro sd card which is for
the OS but the micro HDMI the two
USB port one for your data peripheral
and one for the power and something new
that came on later versions of the
Raspberry Pi zero and it including the
Raspberry Pi zero w and that is the
camera connector now you're probably
going around your Raspberry Pi 0 W in
what's called a headless configuration
that means without a monitor without a
mouse without the keyboard and that's
great when you're using it in little
project in maybe Internet of Things
project clicking sensor data maybe for
in a robot maybe inside of all other
kinds of projects home security home
automation anything you want to use it
for it's probably not going to be
attached to a keyboard mouse and loiter
and we'll talk about that in a moment
before we go there it is worth mention
that it does have a full Linux desktop
now the Linux desktop with the default
distribution is called pixel and you can
actually now get it also as a USB disk
to boot up on your PC and that will give
you access to a simple but very
functional elegant desktop and from
there you have access to things like
libera office and also to chromium as a
web browser but also in terms of
Education you also get access to things
like Python and then of course things
like C and C++ and Java and you can
write a whole bunch of different
programming languages on the Raspberry
Pi there is a great educational tool and
very cheap for people to get involved in
learning how to program and just spend
money on laptops and desktops you can
just buy this $10 board and you could be
up and running writing a C program or a
Python program in next to no time so
going back to the heckler setup for a
moment as I set up your use without a
mouse monitoring keyboard which will be
for most projects with this hardware
Rivoli's what you have to do to set that
up is to download the software from the
Raspberry Pi website you copy that onto
a microwave D card you boot microSD card
you follow the instructions to install
after a few minutes and a reboot you
come up with pixel desktop you then want
to configure your Wi-Fi on equals Wi-Fi
built into the Raspberry Pi 0 W and
there's a little icon on the top right
hand side mix of the clock you can click
on your Wi-Fi network enter in general
password and now the Raspberry Pi 0
always connect to that network whenever
it boots up you also want to go into the
Wrightwood pi configuration options and
there you might want to change the name
of your raspberry pi 0 especially like
me if you've got more than one Raspberry
Pi in the house secondly you probably
want to enable secure shell because that
will make sure that you've got good
remote access to your board and thirdly
you probably want to configure VNC which
is basically a way of getting a remote
desktop and once you've done that you
can then reboot disconnect the mouse the
keyboard and the monitor and as long as
it's got power to it it will be
available on your Wi-Fi network you have
a remote desktop you can secure shell
into it and you can basically program
and use the Raspberry Pi 0 wherever it
is inside of your house and then you can
build your projects home security
Internet of Things whatever you're into
and it will be a remotely accessible
piece of kit which will be amazing
different things you can try and build
with it so for $10 I am mega impressed
with the Raspberry Pi 0 ee I think it's
a brilliant move by the Raspberry Pi
foundation although it is twice the
price of the original Raspberry Pi 0 I
think that extra $5 for Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi is definitely worth it and I've
got one here and I know I'm gonna be
buying more in the future well my name
is Gary similar Authority I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please do
give it a thumbs up please tell me in
the comments below what you've been
using your Raspberry Pi 0 for if you're
going to buy a Raspberry Pi at 0 W also
ever forget to subscribe to an annual
thority YouTube channel hit that Bell
symbol to make sure that you get
notifications when we release new videos
and last but not least do over to Andrew
