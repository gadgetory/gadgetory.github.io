don't know about the LGV 30 well after
weeks the rumors and speculation and
even a guest appearance on Joseph
gordon-levitt's hit record LG took to
its Korean social blog to announce that
it will officially unveil the V 30 on
August 31st in Berlin now if that date
and location rings any bells it's
because it's just before FIFA Europe's
largest tech show as for the phone
itself the V 30 is expected to feature a
six inch qHD OLED full vision display
with rounded corners Qualcomm Snapdragon
835 processor a 32 hundred million power
battery and a new floating bar that will
replace the secondary ticket found on
previous iterations the phone is also
expected to feature a rear mounted
fingerprint sensor and dual rear cameras
the latter of which LG looks to heavenly
emphasize during the phone's launch
event all in all the V 30 looks to be
LG's true flagship for the latter half
of 2017 according to the company the
launch event will be live streamed over
YouTube and Facebook at 9:05 a.m. CET
that's 4 or 5 a.m. Eastern Standard Time
so folks in the US will need to either
stab late or wake up pretty early to
catch the stream and you remember I
talked about Joseph gordon-levitt the
actor who co-founded hit record will hit
record partnered with LG to leap the
latest images of device right here as
you can see from the images here from
hit record it shows the LG v 30 from
every angle
the first looks almost identical to the
LG G 6 with a 2:1 aspect ratio full
vision screen although both sides of the
glass seem slightly curved this time
around the back is unmistakably LG
featuring two camera lenses a laser
sensor and a fingerprint scanner
interesting Lee though it looks like LG
might adapt Samsung's approach and offer
different color options for the back but
have a uniform black front panel for all
variants and sadly the LG v 30 will
ditch the series signature secondary
ticker but will implement a software
based floating bar for notifications and
app shortcuts so what do you
do you like the LGV 30 or what we expect
it to be let me know in the comments
below
you be saving up your cheddar to buy one
what do I think
I think tablets didn't die I think our
phones have become tablet phone hybrids
our phones are so big now they operate
almost like tablets what do you think of
that let me know in the comments below
meet Jeremy shoemaker otherwise known as
shoe money and he became famous for this
photo where he showed off a cheque that
he made from Google Adsense and he's
become so good at making online
businesses that he made an announcement
that he does not start a new business
unless he can secure the businesses name
in a.com now why is that exactly well no
domain name extension tells your story
with the same degree of trust as
Nakumatt net domain name.com and dotnet
domain name extensions and jet
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
don't forget you get 15% off when you
use our coupon code Android when you
think domain names think domain.com hey
guys how's it going
it's been a while since we've done one
of these but I wanted to give you a
quick update sort of behind the scenes
what's been going on since the YouTube
retreat because this is the first show
since I came back from the YouTube
retreat and what that is is basically
the Android thority YouTube team or
video team got together most of us got
together we were missing Joe and Gary
and maybe one or two others but most of
the team was there and we spent the
whole weekend planning how we were going
to really up our video game not just
from a video production standpoint but
also from a strategy and content
standpoint so it was exciting was
fantastic time we also went some
sightseeing but most of the time it was
all work and so all of this for me is
going to change I'm setting up a much
more dedicated studio and I really want
to improve that that's going to take
like at least two weeks and some trial
and error but I got some new gear new
digital quarter lens new shotgun mic and
I have to learn some things so it's
going to be exciting I'm looking forward
to it we're to try a whole bunch of
these things some things work some
things won't but if you have any
suggestions or requests or ideas let me
know right there on Twitter that would
be fantastic
Twitter is kind of where I go most of
the time and have a conversation I still
read the comments but Twitter is the
universe that I like to live in so I'll
chat with you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
