name is Kevin the tech ninja and today
we're going to take a look at one of the
most anticipated device wait a minute I
thought I reviewed this device already
you know what I'm having deja vu because
Samsung has released another variant of
the galaxy s5 this is the Galaxy s5 mini
the s5 mini feels looks and smells just
like his big brother not saying the
design is bad but the s5 mini is just a
smaller version of the galaxy s5 you
know today the mini stands at five point
one six inches tall 2.55 inches wide and
just to spell point thirty-six inches
thick just a hair thicker than its big
brother but it's still a slim device and
for what is worth I can't bend it it
tips the scale at four point two three
ounces and just for further reference
the average weight of a smartphone is
four point nine ounces the same
ruggedness introduced with the s5 was
passed on to the Mini it's rated for
ip67 dust and water resistant that's the
certification that allows your device to
be submerged under one meter of water
for 30 minutes and also for dust this is
the highest rating no dust should ever
find its way under your screen on the
front of the device you have a front
facing camera and on the top edge you'll
find the IR blaster towards the bottom
you'll find a large patented samsung
home screen button and to the left of
the home screen button you'll find
recent applications button and to the
right of the home screen button you'll
find the back arrow now a big fan of
samsung's chrome design but it actually
looks like it's been beat up after a
couple months of using your phone on the
right side of your device it only has
one button and that's the power button
and now you grip your phone your thumb
naturally goes to that spot right there
so this is the perfect location for it
on the opposite side you'll find the
volume rocker and at the bottom is the
USB port on the back of the vice you'll
find an 8 megapixel camera and also it
shoots video at 1080p at 30 frames per
second and that's actually a huge
downgrade from the 16 megapixel camera
and also the 4k recording found on the
s5 the heart rate monitor is located on
the back under the lens as well and
underneath that you'll find a Samsung's
logo which pops out a bit and on the
back you also find the speaker grille as
well
the 4.5 inch screen on the Mini is only
720p resolution also has 320 PPI now
this is below the industry standard for
flagship but putting a 1080p resolution
screen on a phone this small would
probably just take up more power than
provide a stunning image it's really
hard to see the extra pixels when you're
viewing surface is so small the super-mo
LED display still trials the same color
reproduction properties as other phones
using the screen expect a bright screen
with punchy and vivid colors now I think
the contrast is up a little too high on
this display and some will agree with me
but our eyes are actually tuned to see
this and find it a more enjoyable
picture that's why a lot of
manufacturers go with the oversaturated
screen versus natural colors but you can
actually go into the settings and adjust
that too if you like the Texas crisp and
easy to read even a few feet away the
colors make images come to life and it
really jumps out at you it feels like
the normal s5 screen just a bit smaller
besides the display the hardware is
where you'll find most of the drastic
changes the specs on the s5 mini is
considered men rage this Qualcomm
Snapdragon 400 is in tow will also find
1.5 gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
on-board storage now 16 gigabytes isn't
enough storage there is a micro SD card
slot under the back cover fast 5 is also
no slouch when it comes to gaming since
it comes with a decently powered and
rino 305 GPU
when looking at the hardware the
performance narrative is halfway written
the only thing we need to account for is
the highly scrutinized TouchWiz skin
TouchWiz does affect the performance on
this device specifically comparing the
s5 mini to a phone with similar specs
running a stock Android ROM
the difference when navigating the UI
the in-app experience is pretty much the
same but launching apps there's a hint
of delay and also pressing the home
button sometimes it just takes a few
moments for it to actually go back to
your home screen
now a lot of times online you'll see
this referred to as touch with lag if
you are new to android or all the
Android phones you have used has been
Samsung then your experience will be the
status quo even with mid-level specs the
device handles most tasks with little
issues most games you play will run as a
developer intended on this device with
little to no lag but once you launch a
game that taps into system requirements
a bit more then you experience a lot of
slowdown the battery on the s5 mini
gives you all day power that's 5 mini
has a smaller battery compared to the s5
but to compensate it uses components
that requires less power now it's a
compensation that benefits the battery
greatly I was able to get around 2 days
of usage with about 3 hours of on-screen
time now that's right on par with the
phones that has the best battery life
like the s5 the inmates and also the
note 3 the s5 mini camera is fast easy
crisp and chock full of features the
camera is an 8 megapixel shooter which
is half the size of the original s5 also
the aspect ratio of the pictures is 4 by
3 resolution which works great if you're
looking to upload pictures to Instagram
or even Facebook you can change the
ratio but you will be hit with some
quality loss now as far as features
there are way too many to talk about
right here but our buddy Josh Pagar from
Android authority what's going on
everybody actually made a video and you
can check that out as the Samsung s5
feature focus on the camera now
everything is pretty much the same as
far as settings as far as modes but just
understand that it's a lower megapixel
on the camera but everything else is the
exact same there's a column of shortcuts
found on the left to adjust any setting
that you could think of and these icons
are arranged in a grid
although they may be in this grid it's
still hard to find what you're looking
for but after a few days I was able to
pretty much memorize where everything
was also there's a button for different
types of shooting modes a lot of the
modes are very specific and some may not
be useful but there are a few gems in
there like panoramic mode and sport mode
and have a pretty good feeling that most
people will keep it on auto now the
images that come out of this phone look
great they're sharp they're clean and
actually have a lot of detail
it pretty much surprised me a lot of
people think that at lower megapixel
means the less quality but actually
doesn't mean that the lower the
megapixel it just means you can't zoom
in as much you can't crop as much and
things like that but for me the true
star of the show is the depth of field
you can really get a nice blurry
background and a sharp foreground and
when it's done right the results are
awesome now for mid to low light you'll
lose some of that quality but for a cell
phone it's one of the better cameras out
there now as of this recording the
galaxy s5 mini is running Android 4.4.2
now you also know that it's running
TouchWiz in the background and you may
have an opinion on TouchWiz already if
you do that's okay you probably are
right one of the features that was
introduced with this version of TouchWiz
on the s5 was the S health
this is Samsung's one-stop shop for all
things health wise once you get a set up
it has a built in pedometer you can
track your exercises and also your
heartrate now it's not going to replace
your fitness band but it's a nice start
to something that could become bigger
over time a few more things on the
software side is kids mode and also
Smart Remote his mode actually does not
come installed on the phone but you have
a shortcut to install it from Samsung's
App Store kids mode locks down your
device so only certain applications can
be accessed from the home screen now as
a proud uncle of three kids this is
something that all phones should have I
wish it was built natively into Android
you can actually hand your phone to your
kid and not really worry about them
getting to something weird or going
through your pictures or anything weird
like that we also have the Smart Remote
it uses an IR blaster to control TVs you
can easily program the remote by
selecting the type of TV
and is not much else I can really say
about it it has a minimalistic approach
to controlling TVs and it just works is
the Galaxy s5 mini a good phone well the
answer to you is if you enjoyed the s5
normal you wanted a smaller device than
it is a good phone now if you haven't
used the s5 yet the s5 and the s5 mini
both are excellent Android devices
whether you like TouchWiz or not you
can't deny it's a good phone it's fast
its responsive the screen looks very
good and also a lot of the software
features that Samsung has added is
actually not that bad the TV mode is
nice the kids mode is great the camera
is pretty good and you know what the
smaller form factor is starting to grow
on me I'm not sure if this is something
I can use as a daily driver but it was
pretty refreshing to just have a tiny
phone in my hand and be able to text
with one hand or actually do anything
with one hand and it wasn't that
cumbersome to keep in my pocket so these
larger devices are too much for you or
you have a smaller hand or a lot of
times you have something else in your
hand you want a one-handed phone and the
s5 mini could be your phone a choice as
