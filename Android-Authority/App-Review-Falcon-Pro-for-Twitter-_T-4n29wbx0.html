android authority calm and today we're
taking a look at Falcon pro it's an
up-and-coming Twitter client the google
play store there is both a free version
and a paid version that cost 99 cents
let's take a look at the settings first
and get that out of the way in settings
you have a few options these include
sync and notifications display user
experience manage mutes and like Falcon
pro sync and notification settings if
you hadn't guessed controls your synced
notification settings the options in
here are about what you'd expect out of
a Twitter client one of the best
features in our opinion is the ability
to livestream your timeline no need to
refresh and it's helpful if you're
having a conversation and you don't feel
like updating every few minutes display
control your display settings including
theme font text size and other options
once again pretty typical stuff for a
Twitter client user experience settings
control the more unique features in
Falcon pro these include the internal
browser enabling DoubleTap and some
speed boost settings these will be
compatible with all devices but most
current devices should support these
settings next up is managed mute this
tool allows you to mute tweets with a
certain keyword so if you don't like
something and you don't want to hear
about it simply add it to your mute list
then any tweets that contain that
keyword will not show up in your
timeline in you'll be a happier person
if you hit like Falcon pro you'll be
taken to a place to our page where you
can get an add-on package for donating
an extra dollar ninety-nine some of the
extras you'll get include expanded
features and custom backgrounds in terms
of usability this app is very easy to
navigate swipe right to see things like
your lists trending topics and things of
that nature to get the settings
favorites retweets and other stuff you
can swipe left at the top or three
buttons that will take you to your
Timeline your mentions and your DMS if
you tap on the timeline button it will
bounce you straight to the top of the
timeline so you don't have to scroll
there this app is a usability dream you
can literally use this entire app with
nothing more than swiping in a back
button there are no drop-down menus and
everything feels very streamlined when
it's all added up we gave usability a
rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars with Falcon
pro you can do pretty much everything
you can on any other twitter client
viewing and sending tweets as easy as is
retweeting things checking and sending
DMS searching for hashtags or people is
pretty easy as well and the settings
offer a lot of customization that said
there are some bottlenecks several
settings are for Wi-Fi only such as live
streaming and push
vacations so if you want any of those
you have to have Wi-Fi access you can't
edit your profile and widgets aren't
available for everyone while the core
features are very strong and we love
that the whole app can be accessed
without a menu button what it cannot do
seems to bug a lot of people so we gave
productivity rating of 3 out of 5 stars
when it's all said and done Falcon pro
is a great Twitter client it brings some
new ideas to the table like access to
everything without a menu button
features like live streaming are pretty
awesome if you're in the right
circumstances and the app itself runs
pretty smooth it seems to be designed to
get where you want to go in a hurry
however the problems are still there
people want widgets and it's a shame
that not all versions of Falcon pro have
them having some settings restricted to
Wi-Fi only hampers the experience for a
lot of people who are always on the go
not being able to edit the profile isn't
so bad but it's definitely some
functionality we would have liked to
have seen overall Falcon pro is an
awesome Twitter client and it's pretty
fun to use despite some oversights by
the developers this is still among the
best Twitter clients out there and it
really separates itself from the
competition so overall we gave it a
value of 4 out of 5 stars once again I'm
