heady the android authority app guy and
welcome back to google play weekly this
week google updated a few of their
applications microsoft is trying more to
suck less and there's a new home a
bundle in town along with a lot more
news so let's get started google
typically likes to update their
applications in droves and this week
google keep google play movies as well
as Google Play newsstand all got updates
Google Play newsstand got updated with
some UI tweaks that lets you swipe
through categories more easily so you
can get to news faster it also finally
unified the my magazines and my news
segments into a single entity and that
was a long time coming play movies got
some UI enhancements more information
cards and multi-account supports
meanwhile Google keep got itself a
tweaked interface with a new action bar
searchable images some settings menu
tweaks and your trash hangs around just
a little bit longer than it used to so
last week we got to talk about Microsoft
Office and how they made office free for
all android users this week we learned
that Microsoft is turning out a new
microsoft outlook for Android as has
been the pattern over the last month or
so Microsoft is making a bigger effort
to not suck on Android and that means a
proper outlook application is in the
works to replace the blatantly mediocre
offering that's there now some of the
features include a redesigned interface
automatic onedrive syncing for
attachments and integration with
microsoft group there is a new system
called the clutter system that helps you
organize your emails and do things that
are clutter and things that are not so
you can get the more important stuff
faster if it is an obvious by now
Microsoft is going after Google where
they live with onedrive in office
they've begun their fight to create a
Google Drive competitor and with the new
outlook application having integration
with all of those things it's pretty
clear that Microsoft is also going after
gmail Microsoft still has a long way to
go to undo the blunders of the Balmer
era but with these latest moves and
making their net and C sharp compilers
open source it's hard not to say that
they're finally moving in the right
direction you know what rocks humble
bundles humble bundles rock the latest
humble bundle is for PC and Android and
includes broken sword to bridge
constructor typewriter and Raven sword
Shadowlands if you pay more than the
average which is about three dollars and
sixty cents at the time of this video
you'll also get Kingdom rush and nights
pen and paper let's face it three
dollars and sixty cents is but a small
price to pay for six games the best part
of this humble bundle are that all the
games are for both PC and Android so if
there's one you'd rather play on your
computer you have that option if you so
choose I always urge people to toss down
a few bucks on a humble bundle because
it helps support indie developers and
various charities and if there are two
organizations that need money it is
indie developers and various charities
since the Android SDK has been released
we've seen a noticeable increase of
applications with chromecast support
this week you can add crackle voodoo and
Rdio to that list these are a few really
good applications to get chromecast
support crackle and voodoo both stream
movies and TV shows and as everyone
knows our do is a music streaming
service this helps beefed up the bottom
line of applications that do these
things with the chromecast and if you
use any of these applications then
buying a chromecast just started to make
a lot more sense that said there have
been a few complaints people have had a
little trouble streaming from the
applications but the updates just
happened a few days ago so we've no
doubt that the issues will be fixed
eventually if it's working for you great
and if not just hang in there they'll
fix it soon enough all three apps are
pretty awesome and just got a little
more awesome with chromecast support
you've probably seen it before it's
called spritz and it lets you read
things stupid fast and now we finally
have a timetable on when it's going to
be released for android okay so what's
going on as sprint's of shipping its SDK
out to developers who signed up for it a
few months ago this means that in the
coming weeks we will begin to see more
and more applications that use the
spreads technology I've given it a shot
and it's actually really awesome it is
to reading what swipe was detecting on a
smartphone obviously we'll see the
technology on smartphones but another
great use for it that a lot of people
have talked about already is used on
smartwatches being able to read long
text messages emails etc on a watch
without squeezing all of those words on
that small display is going to make
smartwatches dramatically more useful
but let's face it we've seen the demos
and a lot of people have been talking
about it for so long that at this point
I'm ready for some apps to just start
including it who wants to see some
trending applications as usual if you
want to check any of these applications
out you can find the links in the briton
companion which is in the video
description below first up this week is
a very minimal launcher called Crescent
launcher with this launcher you can do
all the things you normally do but you
don't have any of the complicated home
screens to customize or worry about this
probably won't ring
a useful app to most people but for
those upgrading their feature phones to
Android for the first time or for those
of the techno phobic senior citizen
demographic this could help make
smartphones more enjoyable to use for a
lot of people it's free to try with a
premium version available as an in-app
purchase if you so choose next up is
themer beta this last week a rather
large update came up for the popular
launcher that includes various fixes and
performance improvements along with icon
supports so if you have a favorite icon
pack and have been avoiding using theme
or beta because of it you can now go
back to using theme or beta themer has
been growing increasingly popular and
even though it's still in beta many
people swear by it you can pick it up
right now for free in the google play
store if you want to the popular cut the
rope series got continued this last week
with the release of cut the rope 2
despite being plagued with what users
are calling ridiculous in-app purchases
the game still apparently manages to
rock a 4.5 rating in the Google Play
Store so it can't be all that bad it
features the same basic gameplay
elements as the first series with some
new characters new powers and some
minigames it's also free to play so
there's no harm in at least trying it
out the time pop is a fun little
application that shows you what you were
doing on various social media sites a
year ago each day you can check your
time hop to see what you posted on
facebook instagram and twitter as well
as seeing where you went on foursquare
it doesn't support Google+ yet which
sucks a little bit but if you use those
other social networks it can be a lot of
fun to see what your life was like a
year ago also it's free so enough said
nitro nation is a new racing game from
the makers of the popular game called
drag racing drag racing was a great game
but the graphics left a lot to be
desired in nitro nation there are no
such problems it's a beautiful game with
a lot of detail and a lot of racing
there are in app purchases but so far
people don't seem to be complaining
about them so they seem to be okay it's
all about drag racing so it's mostly
just hitting the gas and shifting gears
in terms of gameplay it's also free to
play so if you're interesting you should
probably check it out once again I'm Joe
