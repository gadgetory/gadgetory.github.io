better over the years but there's only
so much you can do when the phones
themselves just keep getting slimmer but
Bluetooth speakers have never been
better and today I'm here to show you a
few of the best hey guys I'm Chris walk
in this video we're going to look at
Bluetooth speakers for different uses
and different budgets but we're going to
start with one we just couldn't ignore
the Bose Soundlink 3 well it doesn't
offer the bells and whistles that many
of its competitors do the Soundlink 3
seems to adhere to the philosophy of do
one thing well when it comes to sheer
volume and sound quality this one is
tough to beat while lack of bass is a
common complaint law looking at
Bluetooth speakers that isn't the case
here this isn't going to blow a full
hi-5 system or car stereo out of the
water but given the size the depth and
presence of the bass is impressive if
you're looking for a speaker to fill the
room at a party this is going to be your
best bet the only real downside is the
price at 300 bucks this is far from the
most expensive speaker on the market but
it's also more than some people are
willing to spend don't worry we've got
you covered next up on the list at half
the price is the creative Sound Blaster
roar not only is the roar cheaper than
the Soundlink 3 it's absolutely packed
with features as well sure it plays
music over Bluetooth but it also has a
built-in micro SD card slot that allows
it to function as a standalone music
player a 6,000 milliamp hour battery
that can charge your mobile devices and
a voice recorder function it even works
as a siren in fact the only major fault
of the sound blaster roar is that it
might do too much despite the hefty
battery it only supports 8 hours of
playback time
and the speaker itself is fairly heavy
the louder may not be a - especially if
you're using this speaker at home but it
does make it less portable still we've
never seen a speaker that boasts this
many features and it sounds good to foo
it's even got an internal EQ that can be
adjusted by plugging it into a computer
with that feature set you might expect
the price to be insane you can actually
find the creative Sound Blaster roar
going for a hundred and forty nine bucks
online now our next pick is a bit more
expensive but it's also a lot tougher
it's the fugu the fugu is little and
it's incredibly tough but it doesn't
sound like either of those things and
yes that's a compliment the speaker uses
an interesting concept it has a core
speaker that is then adorned by one of
three different jackets well I looked at
the style model in my review over at
sound guys it's also available in a
sport model and the tough model which as
the name implies is even tougher than
the sport and style model so much so
that it is described by the company as
virtually indestructible that said even
the style model is waterproof up to
three feet for 30 minutes in addition to
being snow and sand proof that alone
would be impressive but this little
speaker also boasts 40 hours of battery
life at 50% loudness even at full power
it's capable of over 15 hours of play
time considering that many speakers
struggle to get even half that it's
quite the accomplishment the fugu style
and sport models both go for $1.99 while
the tough model goes for 229 bucks now
for our next pick we're staying at about
the same size but we're going way
cheaper in price it's the JBL flip to
the original JBL flip was an ear instant
hit but the JBL flip ii took everything
great about the original flip and made
it better while at the same time
improving on the faults of the original
for a speaker that you can literally fit
in your pocket as long as you're not
wearing skinny jeans the sound is very
impressive
while the cylindrical shape has
more common than it once was the JBL
flip 2 is still fairly eye-catching and
though it isn't as loud as our first
pick it still gets loud enough without
distortion to keep a party going the
battery life is still the weakest aspect
of the speaker but at 6 hours
it's long enough that you shouldn't find
yourself running out of juice very often
at 99 bucks the flip to is significantly
more expensive than the sound length 3
but it's also not the cheapest item on
our list that honor goes to the anchor
NP 141 as I said in our review of the
anchor MT 141 while anchor is a fairly
recognizable brand name the company has
its hands in so many areas that you
might not know them for the audio
products while plenty of companies with
no history and audio make budget
bluetooth speakers these days it's
uncommon that they make them as good as
this one looking at the NP 141 for the
first time even though I had heard good
things about it I was fairly certain
that there was no way anything good
sounding was going to come out of it I
was wrong
it may not stand toe-to-toe with the
sound length 3 or even the JBL flip -
when it comes to sound quality but given
the tiny size and low price it would be
a crime not to mention the anchor NP 141
here while the heavy-duty hook and small
size might not be for everyone the price
certainly is and the 20 hour battery
life is another plus at $39.99 it's
basically a no-brainer and that wraps up
our list and yes this was only 5 items
long but there are a ton of great
Bluetooth speakers out there want to
know about them well that's pretty much
my job over at sound guys so if you want
to know more about all kinds of awesome
audio stuff
I suggest you head over there and
