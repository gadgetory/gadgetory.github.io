Android authority and blue if you
haven't heard of them is a smartphone
manufacturer based out of Miami and for
the last couple of years or so they've
been creating some really compelling and
easily accessible unlocked smartphones
one of their latest offerings is the
thinnest smartphone you can buy in the
US and it comes in at a very affordable
price let's go ahead and take a look at
the blue vivo air when it comes to
affordable or budget smartphones you
usually don't expect to be overly
excited by the design or build quality
but I have to admit I was quite
impressed with the vivo air while it
might look like it heavily borrows from
Apple's iPhone design that isn't
necessarily a bad thing
the vivo air is made from a combination
of Gorilla Glass 3 on the front and back
with a solid aluminum frame sandwiched
in between combine that with the fact
that the vivo air comes in at only 5.1
millimeters thick you get a phone that
feels very solid sleek and lightweight
with the somewhat curved metal sides and
the glass back you might think that this
phone would feel slippery in the hand
but that is actually not the case the
four point eight inch screen then side
bezels and the overall thinness of this
device gives off a very small footprint
making the phone very easy to grip and
comfortably use in one hand which is a
very refreshing feeling when most
smartphones nowadays have become quite
large the rest of the hardware has been
kept to a minimum with only 16 gigabytes
of on-board storage with no room for
expansion min you either have to rely on
the cloud or stray from downloading too
many large apps connectivity is also
limited to HSPA+ but in my experience it
was still plenty fast for everyday tasks
including watching YouTube so I didn't
really find myself missing LTE all that
much the top of the phone has been kept
clean of any buttons or ports while the
right side houses the SIM card slot and
the bottom is where you'll find the
microUSB and 3.5 millimeter headset jack
the volume and power keys are located on
the left side and they protrude a good
amount from the body of the phone so
they're pretty easy to find and also
very tactile
normally I prefer the power button to be
on the right side but the left mounted
power button was still easy to reach as
it naturally sat right under my index
finger every time I picked the phone up
so it didn't take very long to get used
to as I had initially thought standard
capacitive keys can be found on the
front below the display and the single
speaker can be located on the back side
in the bottom right corner
the speaker is of pretty average quality
and it's fairly easy to cover up by a
single finger or when resting it flat on
a table it won't get the job done just
fine but you shouldn't expect anything
spectacular from a back facing single
speaker as mentioned earlier the display
on the front comes in at 4.8 inches and
it's an AMOLED panel with 720p
resolution we all know that everybody
wants 1080p and quad HD nowadays but
720p works perfectly fine on a 4.8 inch
screen viewing angles and brightness are
not an issue and since its AMOLED you're
going to get all the characteristics
that make AMOLED so great like the deep
blacks saturated colors and high
contrast ratios it's obviously not the
sharpest display out there but in
everyday use I really had no complaints
and the display still provided for a
very solid experience when watching
videos or playing games inside of the
vivo air is a fairly standard processing
package that you can expect to find for
a phone in this price range you're
looking at an octa-core MediaTek
processor with one gigabyte of ram
mediatek processors historically have
not exactly been known to deliver great
performance especially when you compare
them to their Snapdragon counterparts
and the story is pretty much the same
here with the vivo air while tasks like
loading apps and gaming seem to perform
just fine it's in everyday general use
that I noticed some performance hiccups
swiping through home screens and social
media feeds often resulted in some
choppiness and dropped frames it doesn't
happen all the time but often enough
that it becomes pretty noticeable it is
possible that some of these hiccups
could be due to a lack of software
optimization but regardless of the cause
it's not going
to necessarily slow you down from
getting to point A to point B it's just
not going to be very aesthetically
pleasing to the eye taking a look at the
camera on the vivo air you'll find an 8
megapixel sensor with LED flash and
starting with the camera application
the vivo air actually features two
camera apps but we'll talk about the
main camera app first it's a very basic
camera app with just the essential
features like HDR panorama and a few
other additional settings while the
experience is pretty straightforward the
only gripe I really had with the app is
these settings which do not rotate to
landscape anytime I wanted to make a
change in the camera settings like
turning on HDR I would have to rotate
the phone back to portrait to do so and
it got pretty annoying over time the
secondary camera app is called the Charm
cam and this can be accessed through the
main camera app or directly from the
home screen the Tron camp allows for
more customization so you can have a
little more fun with your photos
features include things like beauty mode
to make yourself look better by
softening the details in your face in a
makeup mode to give you the appearance
of wearing makeup you can also apply
live filters stamps to images and then
there's my personal favorite called PPT
with PBT the camera will focus on
PowerPoint presentations whiteboards
books or anything with text really and
it basically crop out everything from
the image except the area with text the
cool thing is you can group all the
images together into a single PDF file
for easy printing which could be
extremely useful if you're a high school
or college student as far as actual
image quality is concerned the images
look quite good on the 4.8 inch AMOLED
screen but it's a whole other story when
you blow them up on a computer the focus
tends to be very hit or miss with colors
appearing flat and details lacking the
sharpness that you would want in a photo
HDR also doesn't help out as much as I
expected
images are brighter with a little bit
more detail but colors still appear very
muted even more so than without HDR and
the HDR image processing seems to lean
more towards overexposing
then creating a well-balanced image and
low-light the camera doesn't fare much
better the increase in noise levels is
to be expected but the slow autofocus
and shutter speed times make the camera
pretty unreliable in night
situations because the blue vivo air is
so thin there's not a whole lot of space
inside to fit a large battery so what
you're looking at is a 2100 milliamp
hour battery and the battery life is
good enough to get you through a full
day if you stick to things like texting
reading social media feeds and some
light web browsing while keeping YouTube
and gaming to a minimum anything heavier
than that and you will have to recharge
midway through the day and usually when
I got down to my last 10% or so I wound
it with about 12 to 15 hours off the
charger with between 4 to 5 hours of
screen on time when it was all said and
done a CPU power saving mode is included
in the settings to help you get the most
out of your battery but something to
keep in mind is that this does limit CPU
performance in favor of better battery
life so it's best to only use it when
you need it on the software side the
vivo air is running on 4.4 kitkat with
blues custom skin it's not an overly
intrusive skin but it does provide for a
very different experience from stock
Android for starters swiping left on the
lockscreen will give you access to the
camera sound recorder and flashlight all
without unlocking the phone you can even
fake a phone call to get you out of a
predicament which I actually thought was
a pretty hilarious feature but I could
see a lot of people using it diving in
further blue ditches the traditional app
drawer meaning all your apps will reside
on your home screens but since its
Android you can always download a
third-party launcher for a more standard
homescreen experience
blues overlay also brings some
customization to the table like themes
although you're only limited to a few at
the moment and fancy homescreen
animations you'll also find a series of
smart gestures like smart dial smart
answer double tap to wake and gestures
to quickly open apps without waking up
to display they're all features we've
seen before in some other phones so it's
not exactly anything groundbreaking but
they're still really useful nonetheless
the blue vivo air is available now
directly through Amazon for $200
unlocked and it comes in this white and
gold version that you see here but if
you want something a little bit more
tamed it also comes in a black and
gunmetal version
and also since it's unlocked it'll work
on pretty much any GSM carrier including
t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T in the US for $200 the
vivo air is going to be pretty hard to
beat especially in the budget category
there are some other options out there
like the Moto G for example which can be
had for twenty dollars cheaper comes
with stock Android but with arguably
lesser build quality it's still pretty
early in 2015 so you can expect a lot
more competition in this particular
price point that might offer a better
bang for your buck ratio if you're
willing to wait but that is going to do
it for the blue vivo air for $200 you're
getting a phone with really great build
quality in a very thin and sleek package
and you're probably not going to find
another phone that says good looking as
the vivo air in this particular price
range it does have a few shortcomings
like the lack of LTE connectivity a
pretty underwhelming camera and a few
performance hiccups here and there but
for $200 you can't really expect
perfection what you can expect though is
a phone that will provide a pretty good
overall experience for the
budget-conscious as always guys thank
