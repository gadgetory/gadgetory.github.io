reporting again from pep calm digital
experience read the tailgate party it
was a lovely people from sony mobile so
now we're going to take a look cool to
look at the sunny experience at out
which is essentially the same phone in
sony xperia set although it is not
waterproof you will notice it is a
little bit smaller in terms of form
factor making a little bit more
attractive for people that tend to use
their devices one hand since I don't
really know as much as the sunny
marketing people on my pass it over to
either how are you guys doing so the
Xperia ZL because I am American so I say
Z so the Xperia ZL is actually on the
second device that we announced here at
CES xperia ZL also is basically what we
like to consider again the best of Sony
in a smartphone so it definitely is a
premium device and when we talk about
the best of Sony and smartphone what
kind of cover four elements that would
embody you know the four pieces of
technology four pieces of so many
technology that you'll find in xperia ZL
so we're actually going to first start
off with the display element so when we
talk about it this way we're actually
basically talking about the screen so
you notice here the screen is actually a
5-inch screen and we like to consider
the 5-inch screen up the largest
footprint of a 5-inch screen in your
hand so can i actually a quick question
what what phone do you carry and if we
can just kind of do a quick comparison
here the osu don't you so what's the
screen size on that was a 4.3 inch
screen so and this is a 5-inch screen
let's have you put both of them in your
hands
alright so i mean i like i love a big
display I can't do it and that's even
with some compendium astex try this one
out alright so it's a lot more doable 25
inch really is that a perfect form
factor for people that want to use the
device with one hand but still have a
larger screen exactly and what do you
think that's a 5-inch screen in your
hand honestly you guys really minimize
the bezel there's so much screen going
on and so little best on so much less
room
it really is a kind of it obviously a
little bit afraid if you lose point
three of an inch but in terms of the
screen size yeah it's uh it's not usable
the Galaxy Note 2 is not usable one hand
obviously I love it but this is a lot
more usable one yep so Leeson doubt in
terms of the display definitely feels a
lot more comfortable in terms of a
5-inch screen and you're in your hand so
when we also talked about this boy we
also like to highlight that it is an HD
display but when we talk about HD we're
actually about full HD so that's 1920 x
1080 p so everything in here at least in
terms of text that you see on web sites
and what not a very crisp and clear and
then as he's going whipping through the
screens it's actually pretty fast very
fluid because the device actually is it
has a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core processor
snapdragon s4 pro so you know that it's
really beefing up the specs here so
everything is fluid and there's no
dragging for delay can I just interrupt
for a quick second sure the speed of the
camera time I know obviously things slow
down a little bit when the flash is on
so let's make sure that's all
ok so let's let's go back to the home
here
here's a pretty bad
noise there but nothing too bad so it
does appear to be faster than most of
the phones on the market in terms of the
finishes its comparable to the sunny
experience that it is not it is slightly
a little thicker but not not bite but
not by much still under 10 millimeters
because you'll notice when we talk about
the design aspects between Xperia Z and
Xperia ZL because it has a textured back
you there's a more there's more of a
little a slight curve on the back of the
Z I honestly I it was a lot of proof and
that's a big trade up I do kind of like
the texture back he's got a nice grip in
the hand you know yeah thank you so
actually we talked about the display
already and I kind of alluded to the
design aspect as what we mentioned at
least in terms of the difference between
Z and ZL for ZL it does have that
textured back that you see um it does
definitely feel natural in the palm of
your hand and also we kind of touch upon
the camera aspect as well so that's the
third element that we like to focus on
in terms of the best of Sony in a
smartphone so the camera it takes
pictures rather quickly but also in
terms of the camera itself it's a 13
megapixel camera it utilizes the next
more RS image sensor so in a way it's
the upgrade to the formal exmor r sensor
that we see use in our other cameras so
with Exmor RS m sorry to allow you to
take hdr photos and videos that's a
really a cool element that we have for
the image sensor on the devices but what
we also like to focus on in the camera
is for those who are similar familiar
with the popular with cyber-shot cameras
you'll notice the film another icon
right over here which is basically the
superior auto mode so we basically took
similar technology you find in
cyber-shot cameras and embedded it again
best of Sony in a smartphone into the
Xperia ZL
so what the superior animal will do it
has built-in intelligence to identify
the type of environment that you're in
I'm moving around it knows you know the
items are moving around you so it's a
it's a person there there you go it
reads text so it says documents so it'll
basically autumn eyes the self different
what document it is if I was facing a
person up it's something really close it
had macro up there if I had a person
it'll know it's a personal self portrait
so there are a combination of up to
thirty-six modes actually that you'll
find no all intelligent and auto
detecting yeah so and then the fourth
element so we did display design camera
is connectivity so you know Sony we're
really focused on NFC capabilities we
call it one touch connection so the
device here has an NFC sensor towards
the bottom course yes good
so identical specs expandable memory
1080p s4 pro 2 gigabytes of RAM
13-megapixel 5 inch display but just not
water guess not waterfront okay mm-hmm
same Rollo going to be q1 sometimes yeah
yeah go Marty Oh yep q1 still even this
device no word on market availability or
micro switch over there that I'm not
sure yeah we're asking tough questions
here you are asking you know reading the
comments and judging the marketplaces we
do a lot of people really love the way
sunny designs phones the big fans of
some of these phones in the here and
read Authority so bring a look forward
to collaborating doing some reviews
hopefully some giveaways there we go
you'll actually notice the icons here
this one really embodies Sony GNA when
you notice the walkman the album the
movies PlayStation mobile so you'll
actually see a lot of these elements
that are integrated across other
consumer electronic products which is
like tablets and laptops so just kind of
a little piece in terms of how we really
are becoming all a part of the Sony
trying to integrate the ecosystem
exactly good luck with that forget to
connect the charger there apparently I'm
you know doing a lot of demos ok guys so
we'll have the wrap up there this is
first look at the Sun experience that
out we're going to meet with something a
little bit later and do some comparisons
and have a little bit more of a closer
to a look my name is are selective a
reporting live here imagine 30 thank you
very much for your time no problem
thanks
