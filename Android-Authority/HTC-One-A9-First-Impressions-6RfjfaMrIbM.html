the one line in spirit at least but once
you get past the name you'll find that
there is a lot different with this phone
it's Josh Berg are from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is your first look at the HTC One
a9 while bringing back the metal is
definitely a trope of HTC devices the
HTC One a9 now has rounded corners and
sides that do help with the handling and
with a five inch screen it is a little
bit easier to handle than most devices
out there that are larger in their
screen sizes this five inch display is
also of an AMOLED construction and
covered in Gorilla Glass 4 but the
entire phone does have a pretty
symmetrical look and everything is
centered on the back if you head on over
to the front you'll notice a new button
underneath the HTC black bar and that is
the fingerprint reader which we'll get
into a little bit more in a bit but what
you also notice is that despite there
being a large slit at the top this is
not for boomsound speakers instead
you'll get a bottom mounted speaker that
is enhanced by Dolby but it is right
next to the regular USB microUSB port
and the headphone jack over on the right
side there are the various buttons with
a textured power button underneath the
volume rocker and on the other side
there are two slots one for a SIM card
and then one other one for a micro SD
card yes you've probably noticed by now
that I have been trying to skirt a
particular topic when it comes to this
phone and I wouldn't really blame you if
you've been yelling at the screen that
the HTC One a9 looks a lot like an
iPhone 6 or 6s and in a lot of ways
you're probably right the handling of
this is very similar it's just that this
phone is a little bit thicker but it
provides that same symmetrical design
along with the rounded sides and corners
that are probably what you've seen
before in the iPhone now HTC even in the
meeting that we had where we first got
our hands on this phone did tell us that
although the inspirations might seem
like they come from Apple's Kamp metal
has always been HTC's first design
choice and they were one of the first
manufacturers to even put metal on their
devices and they were really big on
telling us that and reminding us
fact but even then they did say that
Android should be an alternative to
iPhone and the HTC One a9 is an
alternative that still brings you some
of the design choices that some people
tend to like with Apple iPhones but
despite knowing all of that it will be
up to you of course if you like the look
of this phone there are some other
colors though including a lighter silver
version and then one called deep Garnett
now this might not be a total throwback
to the hotrod red that HTC used to use
but we still liked it all the same I
already mentioned before that this
particular screen coming in at 5 inches
in size is covered in Gorilla Glass 4
and is of an AMOLED construction you are
able to change the saturation levels in
the settings by changing it to srgb mode
as well but nonetheless you still get
the higher saturation in the colors
throughout this display for the HTC One
a9 and overall it has looked quite good
now this is not a quad HD display you
get full 1080p full HD but it is still
very enjoyable to use and thus far we
haven't had any problems with it but get
underneath the surface and that's where
the changes continue HTC's
experimentation continues with a
snapdragon 617 no they're not going to
be using the 810 on this one but instead
they're using an octa-core processor
with 64-bit processing that is going to
support quick charge 3.0 and that is a
big point that HTC wanted to make about
the fast charging on this device moving
on to the hardware we will say that
there's no boom sound speaker setup on
the HTC One a9 which is a huge bummer
especially if you're thinking about
audio without headphones but even with
headphones or even without them you
still get Dolby enhancements which allow
the sound to sound pretty nice now we're
going to do some more extensive testing
on this obviously but the main story
here is that you're not getting dual
front-facing speakers and of course we
already mentioned the expandable storage
which is always nice to have especially
with the 32 gigabyte model you still get
a lot more storage if you add a microSD
card but this particular version which
is a European SKU does have 16 gigabytes
in it with 2 gigabytes of RAM rather
than 3 that you're going to get in most
models in the West and then of course we
already alluded to the new button up
front which is the fingerprint reader
now this button can still be used as a
home button and you can change that in
the settings but ultimately touching
this area will
turn on the screen after which it will
scan for your finger after setting up a
fingerprint it's as easy as leaving the
thumb or any other finger on there as it
wakes up the device scans for the
fingerprint and then unlocks it's not
necessarily the absolute fastest
fingerprint reader that we've tested
thus far but it is still highly usable
and is one of the better ways of
unlocking the device and finally in
battery a 21 50 milliamp hour battery is
available under here which sounds a
little bit paltry but it might be helped
by the lower resolution of the display
and also the Snapdragon 617 that you
have underneath powering everything but
HTC made a very big point of saying that
it's fast charging that is going to be
the biggest draw of this device not only
is quick charge 2.0 already available
out of the box but an update will allow
it to go up to quick charge 3.0 and be
one of the first devices to be able to
support that and HTC made a big point of
saying that in the middle of the day if
you're able to plug in the device using
a quick charge charger then you should
really not want for power throughout a
typical workday we're unable to show you
any camera samples just yet but we will
have all of them for you in a camera
shoot outs for the full review that said
however you have an updated package on
the rear with a 13 megapixel oh is
powered camera package that should bring
some pretty good pictures if you
remember the HTC One m9 the camera was a
demain Achilles heel and HTC really
hopes that this time around they were
able to nail it but you still have the
ultra pixel camera up front which should
provide some nice pictures for
self-portraits even in low-light
situations now going through the
application for a little bit right now
we will show you that there are a couple
of new modes not only it does the pro
mode return with the ability to shoot in
RAW format but you also get a hyper
lapse mode now we did take some pictures
over the last day or so already and they
do look quite nice thus far but we'll be
able to show you those in full detail
when we have our full review and finally
in software we have another big
development in the fact that the HTC One
a9 will have marshmallow out of the box
but that's not the only development as
the Sense UI that HTC has been using for
a long time now has actually been
somewhat dialed back actually this
particular version of Android will seem
more like stock with just a bit of a
over it rather than have all of the
different features that sense used to
have in the past but that being said it
still feels very sense like because you
still get blinkfeed on the side it's
just that right now this is going to be
one of the first manufacturer-specific
phones that actually has marshmallow out
of the box and that will include
everything from doze to Google now on
tap to even the app permissions which I
have already been showing themselves in
our first day or so of using this device
and so there you have it for your first
look at the HTC One a9 this is a phone
that's going to come in at 399 dollars
which is another nice development about
a phone that is essentially supposed to
be the next flagship in the HTC One line
and really a lot of this phone feels
like it's HTC trying some new things
which is always kind of nice even if you
think that the design might be a little
bit too derivative even if you think
that the boom sound speakers going by
the wayside in this device at least is a
big bummer these are all things that are
trying to make room for new features
that HTC is hoping will make a phone
that is great for you so keep it tuned
to Android authority for the full review
and then watch more from my colleagues
in Android and once you're done with all
of that subscribe to our channel if you
haven't already so you can keep up with
all of that and more because we are your
