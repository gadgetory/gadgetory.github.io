Hindy the android authority app guy and
in this video we're going to take a look
at the 10 best applications from 2014 Oh
cast is an application that lets your
android device communicate with a number
of things like chromecast apple TV
amazon fire TV Roku xbox and many others
it lets you stream your personal content
like photos and videos to those devices
there's a free version to try out but
the paid version removes the
restrictions and gives you the full
experience commander is an application
that aims to make Google now more useful
for my practical standpoint it works
offline and allows you to do some of the
more basic things like turn on and off
things like Bluetooth Wi-Fi flashlight
and others as well as setting volume
access google play music playlists and a
whole lot more if you have root access
you can even reboot into recovery and
clear your notifications it's a unique
application and one that all Google now
fans should at least check out Google
now launcher was released earlier this
year and has become the way for people
to get a stock Android feel on their
devices without all the root and rom
stuff that many don't feel comfortable
doing it comes with built-in Google now
support a solid set of features and it's
much lighter than OEM skin launchers and
most third-party launchers it's very
Google centric but people who use this
know that and use it for that reason the
nokia had a big year since they distance
themselves from hardware and started
focusing more on software one of the
more recent additions to their software
lineup is here maps it contains a great
design offline mode and many of the same
features as Google Maps such as the
ability to explore things nearby
turn-by-turn directions and maps
available in more than 100 countries
verizon is a camera application that
aims to do things from a different
perspective horizon allows you to
produce full horizontal shots no matter
how you hold your phone that means you
can hold it in portrait landscape or
anything in between and the video comes
out as though you were holding it in
landscape mode horizon corrects a
problem that many people don't know they
have and does so in a unique and
inoffensive way IFTTT stands for if this
then that and what it does is create
connections between applications so when
you do something in one it makes the
other app do something else a popular
example is the ability to save a picture
from Instagram and upload it to Google
Drive automatically the options are
virtually limitless and it can save you
a lot of time and effort you can even
find lists of recipes easily on Google
to help get you started stack exchange
has helped an unto
number of people in an untold number of
ways across many many topics their
official Android application takes the
positive force that is stack exchange
and makes it mobile if you're curious
about pretty much anything then this is
an application you should have on your
Android device it's a great community
that is run by the community and they do
a pretty good job of it themer launcher
wasn't beta for a good long time but
this year saw the first official release
themer is unique because it is a
launcher like nova and action launcher
but the themes you can choose for your
home screens are highly varied and quite
enjoyable all the themes are fully
customizable the themes are done by a
talented community and it is integrated
with zooper widget if you want something
truly different for a launcher give this
one a shot after a long road of fixing
bugs and adding features VLC for Android
has finally exited beta with version 1
point 0 R aleast early in december the
beta version was already popular but it
should be even more so now that it's not
in Veda anymore it plays video and audio
files along with a number of more unique
features that you'll find only with VLC
those in the market for a new media
player should check this one out last up
is the curious case of Yahoo's a v8
launcher it was originally done by an
app development startup that was
purchased by Yahoo for quite a bit of
money it features a redesigned home
screen setup with categories to organize
your applications contextual features
based on what time it is and your
location and unique look and feel
