hindi the android authority app guy and
in this video we're going to take a look
at the 10 best applications from 2014
cool cast is an application that lets
your Android device communicate with a
number of things like chromecast Apple
TV Amazon fire TV Roku Xbox and many
others it lets you stream your personal
content like photos and videos to those
devices there's a free version to try
out but the paid version removes the
restrictions and gives you the full
experience commander is an application
that aims to make Google now more useful
for my practical standpoint it works
offline and allows you to do some of the
more basic things like turn on and off
things like Bluetooth Wi-Fi flashlight
and others as well as setting volume
access google play music playlists and a
whole lot more if you have root access
you can even reboot into recovery and
clear your notifications it's a unique
application and one that all Google now
fans should at least check out Google
now launcher was released earlier this
year and has become the way for people
to get a stock Android feel on their
devices without all the root and ROM
stuff that many don't feel comfortable
doing it comes with built in Google now
support a solid set of features and it's
much lighter than OEM skin launchers and
most third-party launchers it's very
Google centric but people who use this
know that and use it for that reason the
Nokia had a big year since they distance
themselves from hardware and started
focusing more on software one of the
more recent additions to their software
lineup is here Maps it contains a great
design offline mode and many of the same
features as Google Maps such as the
ability to explore things nearby
turn-by-turn directions and maps
available in more than 100 countries
Verizon is a camera application that
aims to do things from a different
perspective horizon allows you to
produce full horizontal shots no matter
how you hold your phone that means you
can hold it in portrait landscape or
anything in between and the video comes
out as though you were holding it in
landscape mode horizon corrects a
problem that many people don't know they
have and does so in a unique and
inoffensive way
pftt T stands for if this then that and
what it does is create connections
between applications so when you do
something in one it makes the other app
do something else a popular example is
the ability to save a picture from
Instagram and upload it to Google Drive
automatically the options are virtually
limitless and it can save you a lot of
time and effort you can even find lists
of recipes easily on Google
help get you started Stack Exchange has
helped an untold number of people in an
untold number of ways across many many
topics their official Android
application takes the positive force
that is stack exchange and makes it
mobile if you're curious about pretty
much anything then this is an
application you should have on your
Android device it's a great community
that is run by the community and they do
a pretty good job of it
themer launcher wasn't beta for a good
long time but this year saw the first
official release themer is unique
because it is a launcher like nova and
action launcher but the themes you can
choose for your home screens are highly
varied and quite enjoyable all the
themes are fully customizable the themes
are done by a talented community and it
is integrated with super widget if you
want something truly different for a
launcher give this one a shots look for
a long road of fixing bugs and adding
features VLC for Android has finally
exited beta with version 1.0 released
early in December the beta version was
already popular but it should be even
more so now that it's not in Veda
anymore it plays video and audio files
along with a number of more unique
features that you'll find only with VLC
those in the market for a new media
player should check this one out last up
is the curious case of Yahoo's a v8
launcher it was originally done by an
app development startup that was
purchased by Yahoo for quite a bit of
money it features a redesigned home
screen setup with categories to organize
your applications contextual features
based on what time it is and your
location and unique look and feel
purists didn't like it that much but
