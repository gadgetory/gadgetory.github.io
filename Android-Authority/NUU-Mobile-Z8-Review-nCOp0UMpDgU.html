of the younger smartphone brands but
that hasn't stopped them from releasing
a few affordable offerings with a 4G LTE
equipped u.s. model the z8 is the
company's latest attempt to deliver an
affordable mid-range smartphone this is
Bailey Stein with Android authority and
this is my full review of the new mobile
z8 when it comes to design the z8 offers
a somewhat standard looking body the
glossy plastic rear cover has a faux
metallic look and tapers off at the
edges to provide a comfortable feel in
the hand it does resist fingerprints
very well although it is a bit difficult
to remove while removing it will grant
you access to a microSD card slot to sim
card slots and a user replaceable
battery actually getting the cover off
can prove to be a challenge the side
power and volume buttons do provide a
good amount of tactile feedback but I do
wish that the power button was
positioned to slightly lower along the
right side of the phone although it is
on the slightly thicker side at nine
point four millimeters the phone still
feels very nice in the hand it also
weighs an average 146 grams in addition
to the silver plastic band running along
the sides of the z8 there's also a
plastic chin on the front of the device
instead of using a traditional
notification LED new bubble has actually
integrated a light directly into the
plastic chin it's a very unique addition
and the breathing effect is undeniably
pretty sweet the three capacitive keys
on the bottom are illuminated but some
users may be disappointed by the
non-standard layout there's also an 8
megapixel wide-angle front-facing camera
to the left of the earpiece the z8 5.5
inch 1080p gapless IPS display looks
excellent with great viewing angles
unfortunately the maximum brightness is
still relatively dim which causes poor
sunlight readability my unit did arrive
with an LCD bright spot out of the box
and while new mobile confirmed that this
would be covered under their standard
two-year warranty it does raise some
concerns in addition to those drawbacks
I also found that it easily collected
finger prints which may annoy some users
thankfully new mobile will be releasing
a tempered glass screen protector with
in the next few weeks which will
hopefully make this less of an issue
featuring the octa-core 64-bit mediatek
mt6752 processor clocked at 1.7
gigahertz the new mobile z8 as a solid
performer the benchmark scores closely
follow the Asus zenfone 2 and day-to-day
performance was very good during my
testing it just feels as fast as in sun
phone - and the stock Android software
experience makes the overall experience
buttery smooth there is two gigabytes of
RAM which should be enough for most
users coupled with a mali t760 GPU the
z8 is able to play most games without
any issues the new mobile z8 supports
802 11 AC Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth 4.0
unfortunately the Wi-Fi signal wasn't as
strong as I would have liked in addition
to sometimes dropping the Wi-Fi
connection completely the z8 speeds were
slightly slower than they were on
comparable devices it might not be an
issue for some users who have smaller
homes and or stronger Wi-Fi routers but
I do feel that it is worth mentioning
the GPS signal also struggled to lock in
doors and did sometimes take a moment to
obtain a GPS lock while outdoors
once it obtained a lock however I didn't
have any issues luckily it does fully
support HSPA+ on AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile with
850 1900 and AWS 1700 2100 band support
although it does include support for
dual SIM 4G LTE bands 2 4 7 and 17 it is
missing damn five for AT&amp;amp;T and been 12
for t-mobile out of the box new mobile
has assured me that they are working
with t-mobile to add been 12 VN
over-the-air update which should be
ready very soon the phone should work in
the majority of coverage areas but I was
actually unable to receive 4G LTE on the
AT&amp;amp;T network in some areas because of
the missing band 5 the rear speaker on
the new mobile z8 is very loud although
it does sound a tad distorted
the 2615 milling head power user
replaceable battery sadly provides
disappointing battery life new mobile
released a firmware update to address
the shortly after my first day of
testing which started at 7:30 a.m. and
ended at 3:00 p.m. with two and a half
hours of screen on time after the update
I was able to get the phone to last
until about 5:00 p.m. with three and a
half hours of screen on time it's an
improvement but I still don't think it's
going to be enough to last through a
full day of use for the average Android
enthusiast the 13 megapixel Sony rear
camera on the za produced a good amount
of nice-looking images autofocus can be
a bit slow but it does capture images
fairly quickly there can be a lack of
saturation in some images but that's
mostly noticeable when comparing the
images with the zenfone 2 which tends to
actually over saturate it also has some
exposure issues where if you tap on a
light object the exposure drops
significantly or vice-versa all of the
images I took however were very sharp
and detailed low-light performance is
where the phone really struggles though
even with the flash on just to give you
an idea here's the same shot with a
zenfone 2 with flash on and here's the
image with the za with flash off and the
zenfone 2 with flash off once again new
mobile confirm that they will try their
best to improve image processing through
future for more updates the camera app
is just the open source media tech app
so there's really nothing different from
other media tech devices there are a few
modes as well as settings to adjust
things like white balance and ISO
running a near stock Android 5.0
lollipop out of the box the za provides
an excellent software experience new has
added a few gestures as well as a clear
all apps button in the multitasking view
but has otherwise left the software
completely stock the launcher is very
similar to the Google now launcher
except without Google and the Google
keyboard is default out of the box
there's absolutely no bloatware which is
quite frankly refreshing it does have
double tap to wake draw over camera
shake for flashlights similar to
Motorola's chop for flashlights flip to
mute and wave to me all worked very well
but shake for flashlight is currently
limited to just the lockscreen new
mobile will expand this however with a
software update coming within the next
few weeks speaking of updates new mobile
has also promised an android 5.1 update
although there is still some uncertainty
regarding an Android M update the
company's current software efforts are
an early indicator that an update may be
likely the new mobile z8 is available
officially through new Mobile's website
as well as various resellers including
Amazon Best Buy Target and HSN you can
pick up the 32 gigabyte variant for
$2.99
in either black or white now or wait for
the 16 gigabyte black variant the 16
gigabyte variant will be available in
early August through new Mobile's
website for 249 you can always expand
the storage with a micro SD card as well
up to 64 gigabytes the new mobile z8 is
a very solid offering from a company
relatively new to the US market while
its positives include an excellent
display quality great performance and a
stock Android experience there are a few
notable drawbacks the Wi-Fi signal could
be stronger the audio output does sound
a bit distorted and the battery life is
very poor unlike other smaller
smartphone producers within the US it
seems that new mobile is very dedicated
to improving the device further with
software updates and after-sales support
on the other hand with today's growingly
competitive market it's still difficult
to recommend this device that's
especially the case if you're a moderate
to heavy user and need your phone to
last for a full day of use all in all
the z8 is a very laudable first attempt
and I look forward to seeing how much
new mobile will evolve their products
