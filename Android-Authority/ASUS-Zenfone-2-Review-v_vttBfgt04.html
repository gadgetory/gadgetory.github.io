Android authority and back at CES a sous
made quite the splash by announcing the
world's first smartphone with four
gigabytes of RAM but is there more to
this phone than just raw specifications
well that's what we're here to find out
with the ax Suzanne phone - the zenfone
2 is technically a budget phone but it
doesn't feel or act like one the design
isn't different or unique and it might
actually remind you of some existing
devices but that isn't necessarily a bad
thing it's made of plastic like previous
Zen phones but doesn't feel cheap and
it's very well put together the corners
are rounded and the back curves and
tapers down towards the edges giving a
very comfortable feel in the hand the
plastic back features a faux metallic
coating which not only gives it a really
nice look but also gives the phone grip
and prevents the back from collecting
fingerprints the back is also removable
revealing the two SIM slots and a micro
SD card slot but the battery however is
completely sealed in so if you're a fan
of swapping out batteries you don't have
that option here
Asus claims that the zenfone 2 is a 5.5
inch smartphone in a 5 inch smartphone
body and while the phone does feel
fairly manageable in one hand
it certainly is anywhere near the size
of a 5 inch smartphone nor is even the
smallest 5.5 inch smartphone out there
and a lot of it has to do with the
relatively thick side bezels and the
large bottom chin due to the capacitive
keys and while I do wish the bezels were
a little bit smaller for better one-hand
usability they don't necessarily detract
from what is an overall very sleek
looking smartphone one thing you'll
notice right away about the zenfone 2 is
that both the left and right sides are
completely clean of any buttons or ports
instead of a side mounted power button
as Zeus chose to place it up top next to
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack which
is kind of unfortunate not only is it
difficult to reach but the button itself
is also extremely flush making it very
hard to press luckily a soos has
implemented a double tap gesture to wake
and sleep the device to help avoid the
use of the power button in most cases
with the volume buttons a soos took the
LG approach
and shifted them towards the back unlike
the power button the volume keys are
very easy to press with a satisfying
amount of travel and the slightly Ridge
texture makes them very easy to find by
feel lastly the microUSB port is in a
pretty standard location on the bottom
and on the front is a bright
notification LED light next to the usual
sensors earpiece and front-facing camera
a soos didn't skimp on the display of
zenfone 2 either it's a large 5.5 inch
screen with 1080p resolution and a
pretty respectable PPI of 403 quad HD is
obviously becoming a new trend but 1080p
is still nothing to scoff at the screen
is quite good and offers pretty much
everything you would want from a
high-end panel it's sharp vivid bright
easy to see in broad daylight and has
great viewing angles at 5.5 inches it's
also great for all sorts of media like
web browsing gaming YouTube and even the
occasional movie whatever you enjoy
doing on your smart phone
this display is perfect for it also the
color calibration can be adjusted in
these settings if you want to tweak it
more to your liking balance is the
default setting which I thought looked
perfectly fine but you also have a
reading mode that's easier on the eyes a
vivid mode that pumps up the saturation
and a custom mode for more granular
controls over the display settings a
soos has a close relationship with Intel
so it's no surprise that they stuck with
the Intel Atom processor for the zenfone
2 the new Atom chipsets bring 64-bit
processing to the table but these specs
will vary based on the version you get
the base 5.5 inch model of the zenfone 2
comes with the Intel 3560 and 2
gigabytes of RAM while the higher-end
version features the Intel 35 80 with a
whopping 4 gigabytes of RAM it's the
first of its kind and this has gotten a
lot of people's attention is it complete
overkill maybe for some but for those
who demand a lot out of their phones it
won't be our review unit is of course
the 4 gigabyte model so I can't speak
for the base model but this version of
the zenfone 2 is fast and it feels every
bit as snappy and responsive as a $700
flagship animations are smooth apps open
quickly and it handles all sorts of
games extremely well
four gigabytes of RAM onboard
multitasking is a breeze on the zenfone
2 just to really stress out the zenfone
2 I loaded up several games at once and
multitask back and forth between them
and it still didn't stutter or show any
signs of slowdown this was done merely
for the sake of testing purposes and
obviously won't be a typical use case
scenario for most people but it's still
very comforting to note that the zenfone
2 has the raw power to handle it
especially if you're a power user with
the rest of the hardware the zenfone 2
comes with all the usual things you
might expect like Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS
and NFC it also supports LTE
connectivity here in the states and I
had no problems using it on t-mobile
storage options include 16 32 and 64
gigabytes with the option to expand via
microSD of up to an additional 64
gigabytes the speaker is located on the
rear denoted by a very large speaker
grille which might lead you to believe
that there's a powerful speaker
underneath but it's actually just a
small single driver on the left side of
the grill these sound quality is fine
but it doesn't get very loud in
comparison to some of the other phones
out there with a single speaker making
it pretty tough to hear in noisy
environments
the camera at the back is a 13 megapixel
shooter with a dual tone LED flash and a
respectable aperture of f2
just like previous Zen phones the
zenfone 2 also features a Seuss's pixel
master technology that's supposed to
provide for better low-light in photos
and video the camera software is fairly
straightforward and easy to use with all
the usual settings that you would expect
like white balance exposure ISO and
1080p video capture among the typical
modes like manual HDR and panorama the
camera packs a laundry list of shooting
modes to give you a variety of different
ways to take photos like most cameras
the zenfone 2 camera performs best in
good lighting conditions and the F 2.0
aperture will allow for some nice depth
of field but the cameras biggest issue
is its dynamic range or lack of it it is
capable of taking a decent looking shot
but more often than not highlights were
either completely blown out and
overexposed or it was on the opposite
extreme and images were way too dark and
underexposed the best thing to do is to
use HDR and the HDR mode works quite
well on this camera it evens out the
images and add some extra saturation in
color which I personally don't mind at
all the only downside is the HDR image
processing takes a very long time
between shots so if you don't have a
steady hand or the subject is moving
you'll wind up with a not so sharp
looking photo in medium to low light is
where photos will start to exhibit noise
and image quality deteriorates at
anything shot at ISO 300 or higher ISO
is capped at 800 which limits the amount
of noise that could potentially be
introduced from higher ISO s but even so
the camera's image processing doesn't
handle the existing noise all that well
the built-in low light mode takes
advantage of the pixel master software
to allow for up to 400 percent brighter
photos and while it does work the images
are lower in resolution and the increase
in light makes the digital noise even
more visible if you're into selfies the
front facing five megapixel wide-angle
lens will certainly get the job done the
camera includes real-time beautification
and there's also a selfie panorama mode
to help you easily fit your friends and
family into the frame to keep the
zenfone 2 power throughout the
Suz packed a nicely sized 3000 milliamp
hour battery inside and when you combine
that with the more battery friendly
1080p display and the battery efficiency
of the Intel Atom chip this sounds like
a winning combination for great battery
life but that hasn't necessarily been
the case while I have been able to make
it through a full day with around 4
hours of screen on time there's been
some significant battery drain issues
from the Android OS that's drastically
shortening the battery life preventing
the zenfone 2 from getting a whole lot
more than what it's currently capable
this could be due to the fact that it's
running the very initial release version
of lollipop which we know had a handful
of bugs or it's an issue within a
Seuss's Zen UI itself it's rather
difficult to pinpoint because Android OS
is a very convoluted pool of background
processes but hopefully this is
something as soos can address fairly
soon with a software update on the
bright side the zenfone 2 does support
fast charging technology so when you are
in need of extra battery life you'll at
least be able to gain it back in a short
amount of time in software the zenfone 2
ships with Android lollipop but it's
just 5.0 and not the latest 5.1 nor is
it even 5.0 point 2 so hopefully it'll
get that update soon on top of Android
5.0 is a Seuss's Zen UI and it's taken
on some of the material design aspects
of lollipop like the notification shade
and card style overview but for previous
design phone users it should still feel
very familiar the biggest drawback with
the Zen UI is that it brings a ton of
bloatware applications but there are a
good handful of features that add to the
experience like an easy mode for a more
simplified interface and a one-handed
mode that can be triggered by a double
tap of the home button for easier
one-handed use there's also a bunch of
screen off gestures that as soos calls
Zen motion that brings a double tap to
wake the display and a series of
characters that can be drawn on the
screen to quickly launch into any
application of your choice back at CES
asou said the zenfone 2 eliminates the
need for carrying two phones because of
the built-in snap view feature that
allows you to create a completely
separate and secure profile to store
business and personal data that only you
can access
this is great if you store a lot of
sensitive information on your phone and
truly allows you to use your phone for
both work and play one of the main
attractions with these Nui is the
ability to customize the interface
there's a built-in theme engine that can
alter the look and feel of the entire
experience with different fonts icons
and system UI changes like the
lockscreen and notification shade the
launcher preferences can also be
customized simply by swiping up from the
bottom or long pressing on the home
screen you've got the usual options like
widgets wallpapers and various different
home screen scroll effects but the best
part about this launcher is the ability
to use third-party icon packs from the
Play Store something you can only
normally do with a third-party launcher
the ascend phone 2 is available now in
select regions like China Taiwan and
Europe and will soon be releasing in
India in the coming weeks but us
availability is still to be announced
available colors include black gold grey
red and white with pricing starting at
$1.99 for the base model official
pricing for the higher-end models will
be announced by ASUS later this month
but you can expect it arranged anywhere
between 50 to $100 extra based on RAM
and storage once the battery life issues
get resolved the Isuzu zenfone 2 is
going to be a beast of a smartphone to
contend with and with a beautiful design
powerful specs and an overall solid user
experience that caters to a variety of
users a soos is proving once again that
you don't have to pay a lot to get a lot
if all goes well the zenfone 2 is going
to be very disruptive in the smartphone
market setting a completely new standard
for affordable smartphones as always
