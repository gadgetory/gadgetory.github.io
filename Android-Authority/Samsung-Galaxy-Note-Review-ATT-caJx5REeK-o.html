lock away from android authority
reporting live from CES 2012 we are
looking at a fantastic device here if
you're a mobile professional a realtor
lawyer someone who has a huge pocket or
purse the Galaxy Note could be a great
device for you know what we're looking
at here is a ATT branded variant of the
samsung galaxy note the only difference
is being of course from the
international version that we reviewed
previously is that we have the four
buttons here which is actually quite
helpful now this device is blazing fast
in addition the differences are rather
than having the 1.4 gigahertz XE knows
this is going to be having a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core now Samsung isn't
going to tell us exactly what kind of
dual core that is what it doesn't really
matter all of them are on the same level
performance and this one is smoking fast
now of course this one is going to be an
LTE device too they've incredibly thin
they've given a couple of different
backs they have a few different kinds
it's here that you can add on your
personal style but we're looking at a
1280 by 800 display imma let things just
really pop on this display you can just
imagine what sort of amount of real
estate you're dealing with here now I
thought my galaxy note was large and I
apologized that is being so greasy but
just to give you a sense it's a really
really difference we're talking about a
whole new base here people
so five point three inches versus 4.3
for me if I was walking bluetooth I
would go for the galaxy note any day
just because it's it's just it's a
fumble it it's everything in 1 1.5
gigahertz dual-core like I talked about
12 ram expandable memory I think it's
going to be a good seller for AT&amp;amp;T no
word on pricing yet we'll have a full
review shortly after this guy's thanks
for checking in to android authority
