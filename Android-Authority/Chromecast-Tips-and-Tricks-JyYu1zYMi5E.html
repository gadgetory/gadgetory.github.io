hands on a pretty sold-out chromecast
hell you might be watching this video on
you television right now so what do you
say we try to get a little bit more out
of it hey it's Josh magar from Android
thority what's going on everybody and
these are some tips and tricks for the
chromecast but before I get into the
tips and tricks I want to answer a
couple questions that came up in the
review basically the chromecast does not
stream content straight from your phone
or tablet so if you have some local
content on your tablet or on your phone
it's not going to be able to be casted
over to your television the way it works
actually is that when you hit that cast
button on YouTube or Netflix or play
music it relays the information to the
chromecast so it can find the content
from the source itself by using some
html5 magic the chromecast connects to
the actual service finds your video or
music and then plays it after you
install the chromecast app and then
update all of your media apps this is
all available if you do really want to
stream content from a local source that
is somewhat possible using a laptop or
computer like I said in the review you
are able to use the chromecast to
broadcast a tab from a Chrome browser
now what's really awesome is that tabs
in Chrome browsers can actually display
a ton of stuff websites Flash content
and pictures but let's say you have some
local videos you want to watch if your
Chrome browser has the appropriate
plug-in to view the content then that
tab will play it and then you can just
send that tab to the chromecast just
browse your computer hard drive from
within Chrome to your video and it will
display through the browser tab then hit
chromecast it's pretty awesome right
this allows with the chromecast to
bridge the gap between your computer and
your television think outside the box
and you'll realize the possibilities I
even have a plex media server that my
friend set up and all the content from
there streams to my computer which then
streams to my living room TV at least
for me this is definitely the easiest
way I've ever gotten Internet and local
content to my television
but it doesn't have to stop there hidden
away in a small arrow on the side of the
chromecast extension is an option to
cast not only a tab but the entire
computer screen now this is a very beta
feature and while it is nice to have for
perhaps quick presentations or picture
viewing it may not be a particularly
smooth stream but I'm sure that this
feature will be continuously enhanced
and just get better and better now you
may notice the first time you try this
Chrome browser streaming that it isn't
completely smooth well there are ways of
optimizing it since your computer is
basically in this case transcoding on
the fly it also has to stream the end
product to your chromecast this is one a
very fast internet connection is
important and recommended in the browser
extension hit the options button and
you'll see the main way of helping this
the transcoded footage can be set to a
high bitrate 720p regular 720p which is
the default setting or a much easier
480p
now for my decent internet connection
480p works beautifully sure it isn't
high definition but it's better than
choppy video so those are just some ways
of getting more out of your chromecast
especially if you're using the computer
but let's get back to the hardware
itself if you haven't have a TV that has
HDMI version 1.4 then you may not need
the USB charging cord or the wall plug
because the TV may be able to route
power to the chromecast itself
unfortunately I don't have any TVs that
are able to demonstrate this but on the
other hand you might want to keep it
plugged into the wall because there's an
extra feature in the chromecast that
might work for those of you who happen
to have these TVs with these particular
versions of HDMI see if you start a cast
from your phone or tablet or from your
computer and your TV is off it can send
the information to the chromecast and
recognize that the TV is off and then
turn it on and switch to the proper
source unfortunately again I don't have
any TVs I can't demonstrate this and
finally this tip is for anybody who ran
into the same problem that I had in the
review like I said before my DLP TV does
include a HDMI input but it is rather
old and the 5.1 system that came with it
requires audio to come straight from the
source
if you haven't noticed the chromecast
has only the HDMI output some people
commented that
I could get a navy receiver but those
things can cost over $200 since I only
needed a way to split the chromecast
signal I decided to find something for
that specific purpose I did and it is
this box that actively splits the video
and audio signal into HDMI and spdif
perfect for my setup now I can go from
this
to this
like I said before though this adds more
total cost to your chromecast experience
so be aware of your setup at home before
you pull the trigger but to me this was
worth having my big-screen available for
all my viewing pleasure and so there you
have it just a few tips and tricks for
you to get even more out of your
chromecast I think the best feature is
still the Chrome browser tab
broadcasting because you could do so
much in a Chrome browser and then all of
a sudden is available on your TV I'm
sure that a lot of these vendors and
companies are soon going to be made
available for the chromecast like HBO Go
revision3 songify we already have
reports of them testing to become
available on the chromecast so it's only
going to be a matter of time before a
service that you want to have on there
is probably going to make it on there
and that's what's great about the
chromecast it has a very open
architecture so that when the SDK is
released a lot of people are probably
going to jump right on it so
broadcasting a chrome tab from your
computer will likely be just the
workaround you have for now and pretty
soon whole lot of possibilities are
going to open up as always for the best
