you know and love with a 30% larger
battery and an extra half inch on the
display diagonal with that fancy new 18
to 9 aspect ratio but there's a bunch of
other improvements that make it more
than the sum of its parts
I'm Chris Collins Android authority and
this is the HTC u 11 plus hands-on you
11 plus packs a 6 inch qHD plus Super
LCD 5 panel using the DCI p3 color space
with hardware support for HDR 10 that
just requires a software update for full
HDR video taking the differences in
aspect ratio and display diagonal into
account
you 11 plus offers a little over 10
percent more screen in roughly the same
overall area as the 5.5 inch HTC you 11
thanks to that more bezel is designed a
fingerprint scanner now lives on the
back and the u 11 plus gets a bump to an
ip68 rating
I went hands-on with a translucent black
version which features a mirror like
finish over a semi-transparent glass
back which will be available online only
in January or February next year the
main color will be ceramic black which
will be available in Europe in late
November or early December for 799 euros
gestures make handling the taller phone
easier like swiping down anywhere on the
screen to pull down the notifications
for swiping up to open the app drawer
you can also add additional navigation
buttons to the bottom of the screen so
simple swipe to the side can provide
access to a one-handed screenshot for
example a new circular edge sense
launcher feature is kind of a mishmash
between samsung's apps edge and paranoid
androids PI controls just squeeze your
phone to bring up a customizable
rotating wheel of shortcuts and toggles
Google assistant Amazon Alexa and HTC
Sense companion are all onboard and you
can customize the edge sense shortcuts
for the main UI as well as within
individual apps view 11 plus runs
Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box which
means support for a high-end audio
codecs like Qualcomm zap Dex HD and
Sony's 24-bit L DAC these will come in
handy of course because there's no
headphone port on the u 11 plus there is
however a USB type-c to 3.5 ml adapter
with an integrated DAC as well as HTC's
you Sonic active noise-cancelling
earbuds which led you tune your hearing
profile for a better audio experience
acoustic focus and 3d audio recording a
possible via for microphones and the u
11 plus is high res audio certified
boomsound hi-fi Edition is back
thirty percent louder sound than the you
eleven thanks to the you eleven pluses
improved front channeling there's not
much different on the camera front with
a 12 point two megapixel ultrapixel
three BSI sensor with F 1.7 aperture 28
mil focal length 1.4 micron pixel size
ultra speed dual pixel phase detection
autofocus HDR boost oasdi s and so on
upfront though there's now a lower
resolution 8 megapixel BSI sensor with F
2.0 aperture 85 degree field of view and
28 mil focal length that as HDR boost
enabled by default and can shoot 1080p
video the rest of the specs include a
64-bit Snapdragon 835 six gigabytes of
RAM 128 gig of you FS 2.1 storage with
microSD expansion via hybrid SIM slot
and a 30% larger 3930 milliamp hour
battery with support for USB power
delivery and quick charge 3 but no
wireless charging
that's an NFC antenna you can see as I
said at the outset there's more to the
HTC u 11 plus than just a new display
and larger battery it offers enough
improvements over the original u 11 and
is absolutely worth checking out if
