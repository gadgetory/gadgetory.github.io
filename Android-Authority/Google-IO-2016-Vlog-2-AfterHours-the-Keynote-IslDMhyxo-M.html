they have really great acts look who's
going to be the concert for tonight
that's awesome yeah this is kettle corn
pop chips seaweedy seaweed seaweed come
on having so much trouble getting the
damn camera back here we just had a hell
of a time trying to find a place to
record that's the thing about having guy
outside is that it's really hot we want
shade
yeah it's been a long day lon had his
bag all ready and prepped to go oh the
cameras still there I'd better put that
away you know he's using my gorillapod
google system is like a church I shall
read a press event right now with
chocolate press come around have a few
drinks like what a lot of Googlers
actually come out and talk to a lot of
these people like for example there's a
little group right around there is
talking to sundar Pichai now the only
thing though is that I'm staying in here
and I'm just walking for you guys right
now because wow you're not supposed to
take pictures or record with them they
get a little bit the concert is actually
going on right now and it's started at
seven thirty and you can see it's eight
o'clock right now but we decided to come
back drop all of our stuff off we're
sure Charli XCX is really dope and all
but kygo is definitely the headliner so
we figured we will come back here rest
up a little bit drop our stuff off
because if we're going to have a good
time at this concert with some good
house music it's not really that great
to have a backpack on and having all
your crap with you
ricks from a seat
you
you
Tiger what you think it's raining
confetti what did you think didn't
notice I know sing
