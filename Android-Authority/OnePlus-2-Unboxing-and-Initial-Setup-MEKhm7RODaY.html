Joshua regard from Antron Authority
what's going on everybody and it's time
to unbox and give my first impressions
on the oneplus 2 well everybody here we
are with the oneplus 2 the packaging is
still of the signature red color that
oneplus uses but it is not quite as
unique as the packaging was for the
oneplus one this literally just made to
my doorstep today and I'm going to go
ahead and unbox this bad boy and rip
this thing open like it's Christmas so
here we go
and here we go with the actual unboxing
itself and there you go we have the
oneplus 2 right there of course we'll
have that plastic to be able to peel off
but there are already some pieces of
information that are available right
here on the top portions the headphone
jack of course I've taught the alert
slider the brand new input on the left
side that is like a notification toggle
and a silenced toggle the power button
and volume rockers over on the right
side and you can see that information
plainly on the front to give you a bit
of a snapshot of what to expect of
course on the bottom here you can see
the fingerprint scanner we're gonna put
that aside just for a second and take a
look at what else we have inside of the
box we have the Quick Start Guide all of
the manuals the user guide down here now
here is the power adapter the AC adapter
rather for the USB type-c connector
which is brand new to this device and
the oneplus 2 is going to be one of the
few devices currently that actually
supports that new standard so we're
going to have that as a new feature on
the oneplus 2 now the flat USB type-c
cable is really nice because it won't
get tangled very easily and if you had
the oneplus one you know what to expect
with this one except the fact that the
port is now different of course it's USB
type-c reversible and different this
time around you will be able to put it
in no matter which orientation you will
insert it in so it's going to be easy to
connect on both ends of the cord well it
seems simplicity it pretty much does it
for the oneplus 2 unboxing you really
only get the bare essentials but those
actual essentials are a little bit
different especially what that new USB
standard and
what makes the unboxing for this a
little bit more unique and here is the
oneplus 2 in all of its glory
it's the sandstone Black Edition with
the camera optics a little bit lower
down which we've already talked about
quite a bit in our first looks and all
of you guys have already sounded off
your opinions on a little bit but really
what's great about this device and what
I feel already from the moment I take it
out of plastic it's just how solid it
feels with this metal frame over on the
sides it seriously feels like a very
meaty very not necessarily heavy but
it's very substantial device definitely
not one you would expect a phone at this
price to really come in at and really
looking at the sleek front there with
the black slate design everything is
just pretty much where it needs to be
even the fingerprint scanner here on the
bottom there which will act also as a
home button and of course the slider
over here on the side that will be able
to silence the phone or just put it on
priority notifications if you don't want
all of them to come in on the other side
over here we have the volume rocker
above the power button which lands
beautifully where the thumb would land
for this 5.5 inch device and really it
just feels very accessible and very easy
in the hand which is lovely and great to
see for this new flagship killer as it
is called and then if you want to change
the backing which is really easy given
that this back cover just easily pops
off I should to go ahead and demonstrate
that right now that cover actually
really easily comes off just got to get
all of the little poppers out and you'll
be able to easily replace the backing of
the oneplus 2 and by any of the other
covers we did do a comparison of all the
different style swap covers when I did
this phones first look and you'll be
able to see all the different stylings
that you can put on this phone and it's
great that it's nice and easy to get the
back cover off and replace it so you can
really make this phone your own and
there you go powering on the oneplus 2
obviously we have oxygen OS at the helm
here version 2.0 now based on version
lollipop 5.1.1 of course CyanogenMod is
not the version of Android you're gonna
be getting in here but oxygen OS already
shows that it has a bit of style with
this
loading screen here and we're gonna jump
right into the device itself you've
probably already noticing on the top
corner here that we have dual-sim
capabilities so the oneplus 2 will be
able to take bill sims off the bat and
you can see the two icons up there
because I don't have any SIM cards
inserted into this phone at the moment
all right looks like we're gonna go
through the oneplus set up actually
navigation control right here quite
simple you could just use the hardware
buttons or the software buttons
underneath if you want to use those
they're not going to show up right here
at the moment but you can see that
preview on the bottom to show you what
they would look like of course we want
to use the ones down here to preserve
our precious real estate on the screen
so actually and here are all the
gestures over here
oxygen OS keeps things pretty Spartan
you just have to do a double tap to wake
which is one that I really do like to
use let's go and open the camera that
way I don't want the flashlight one
because I don't want that triggering in
my pocket and then of course the music
control which I can do without and
finally we have the choice of which
keyboard we want to use whether it would
be Swift key or the Google keyboard
Swift key is nice and all but I will
keep the regular lollipop method now the
Shelf is the new one that we're going to
take a closer look at in our full review
but I will enable the shelf it is
basically a replacement for Google now
that essentially is two different
widgets one of them will show you your
most used applications the other one
will be your most contacted contacts so
just for the sake of posterity let's go
and test out a couple of those gestures
double tap to wake seems to work pretty
well I'll go and turn that off and let's
go ahead and do the circle one to go
straight into the camera so there it is
of course I will be doing the camera
shootout very soon on the oneplus 2
we'll see what the camera quality is
truly like on it for the daily and with
that our oneplus 2 coverage is
officially underway so keep it tuned to
Android authority for all of the
coverage of the oneplus 2 we're gonna go
through a lot of different comparisons
see if this so-called flagship killer
actually does kill the flagships and
with a lower price point we're excited
to see if this might still be the bang
for buck phone that you want in your
pocket so keep it tuned here to Android
thority for even more about the oneplus
2 and for all of the other videos that
are coming out
not just from me for this device but
from my brothers and sister in Android
