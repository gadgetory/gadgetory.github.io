what's going on everybody and this is
the unboxing and my first impressions on
the Sony Xperia z1 this new offering by
Sonia was announced back at Aoife in
Berlin and was definitely one of the
most anticipated upcoming devices it is
supposed to take the design philosophy
originally started by the Sony Xperia Z
and pretty much perfect it but before we
get to the actual device let's see
what's in the box
for the most part we get the standard
fare when it comes to extras though sony
does make it a point to include screen
protectors with their smartphones these
will come in handy but normally I don't
use screen protectors under the flap we
find some Sony branded earbuds with
extra ear pieces the standard microUSB
charging cord and a plug made for Europe
after that we have a few thick
instruction manuals that would help you
get started with your z1 life put all of
that aside however and we can get right
to the phone itself the phone is covered
in a nice plastic film and it's pretty
ceremonious to slowly peel them off like
I was saying earlier on this is supposed
to be the full culmination of what was
originally started in the Xperia Z a
fully glass encased phone this z1
benefits from a completely steel frame
that should give it all of the
sturdiness implied as well as a much
more premium feel and that's exactly
what you think when you first put the z1
in your hands this is a heavier phone
than the Xperia Z and the smoother sides
evoke a real feeling of premium that's a
word you'll probably hear me say a lot
when referring to this phone premium of
course the other big addition to the
Xperia z1 is the powerful G lens capable
of almost twenty one megapixel shooting
with the F 2.3 aperture and a bunch of
added enhancements in the app I'm very
excited to see how this camera will
perform and if the premium keyword holds
true for it as well I wanted to address
something right off the bat when turning
on the z1 screen there has been some
speculation regarding the screens to use
on the z1 apparently some users have
been reporting mixed results with their
units especially in regards to viewing
angles whether or not this means one z1
can have a different screen compared to
others is up for debate but with the
unit we're working with we can only
surmise quality based on what is in
front of us that being said I am
initially disappointed in the viewing
angles on this particular unit Sony
really missed the mark with the Xperia Z
with it's horrible viewing angles and
then they redeemed them cell
with the much better angles found in the
Xperia Z ultra but now it seems like
they've fallen back a couple steps with
the z1 it's viewing angles are not
really horrible as things are still
generally visible but a gray hue does
cast over everything the steeper you get
in the angle for a phone that feels and
is supposed to be as premium as this the
display might be its biggest miss at
least in these first impressions this is
the case and so there you have it the
Xperia z1 in this preliminary look we'll
see how the rest of the device fares but
there's one thing for sure there's a lot
to love about the design the look and
the feel right off the bat until the
viewing angles are put into the mix
however stay tuned for my final opinions
in the full review coming soon on
