flagship season all right let's talk the
LG G six baby 925 Google got a hold of
two images you can see here essentially
confirming everything we've seen in
renders and other late images already
they show the handsome metal back
version of the phone and give a pretty
good indication of just how a tall glass
of water the g6 is 2.1 display ratio is
going to be we get our first look at the
always-on display and a close look at
the camera array on the back which
conforms to what we've already seen from
case makers and others the source of
images also gives us a quick spec
rundown including the Snapdragon 820 one
system-on-a-chip 32 gigabytes of storage
4 gigabytes of ram 32 hundred million
power battery and if 5.7 inch quad HD
display with an aspect ratio of 18 9 the
LG G six will officially be unveiled at
the Mobile World Congress 2017 on
februari 26 real real soon with the
hopes of nibbling away at some of the
galaxy s 8 sales by getting out a couple
of months early than Samsung's next
flagship now there has been some
confusion regarding whether or not the
LG G six will have a full metal body
construction or a glass construction but
LG has made very clear in a press
release that it will have a sleek full
metal body design but still this rumor
lingers that there may be two versions a
glass design in a metal design I don't
see that unless of course there is a you
know a mid-range version of the LG G six
and they decide to go with a glass
version for that I don't know do you
guys that preferences do you care I care
I would much prefer an all metal design
I know it doesn't mean a removable
battery but if there's a great battery
life in it already it's not that big of
a deal for the average person let me
know what you think in the comments
below I want to hear
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
