clayton youngberg coming at you from
android authority calm your number one
source for all things android today
we're going to be giving you a browser
comparison using the Samsung Galaxy Tab
10.1 going to be showing you which
mobile browser is the best we've got a
selection from a few of the pop the most
popular downloads as far as browsers go
that we're going to be using could be
using the opera mobile browser now that
differs from the Opera Mini because the
upper mobile is optimized for almost
higher end devices the Opera Mini is for
low-end smartphone applications for
compatibility reasons we're also going
to be using the google chrome browser
the over screen floating browser firefox
beta because the actual firefox is not
compatible with this device and boat
browser all these brothers have great
features they have some standout
features that are native to each of them
that some of the others don't have so
let's just go ahead and check them out
let's open up the opera mobile browser
right now now on the opera mobile you
can see our front page here just gives
us a few nice tiles of popular on recent
visited sites and go ahead and click the
0 to get our little settings tab there
we've got our bookmarks history start
page we have saved pages download
settings and then we can search the page
for keywords and we can share the page
and then we have our help settings so
let's go ahead and go into the actual
settings now now we can choose to
preload images we have our opera turbo
which is a compression um feature that
you know actually compresses websites up
to seventy percent for faster loading so
we'll just click always on maybe see
some demos of that opera link zoom is
that one hundred twenty five percent we
have text wrapping privacy and advanced
options now anyways let's just navigate
to a web page we'll go ahead and go to
android authority already and actually
google searches right from the URL bar
we do have a google search bar dedicated
as well it should be going
inserts okay its search I'm going to go
ahead and pop a brightness up just a
little bit for the sake of the video
anyways we do have our search results
now we click android authority com um
the Opera Mobile does not have the
option to view as desktop site as one of
the options in the little star bar there
so we're going to have to go and scroll
down to deselect the mobile theme on
android com we'll see if that loads up
sometimes they do not honor the request
to do that right from the website but
anyways we do have the non mobile theme
now the Opera browser is running it very
nicely go ahead and check out our tabs
management where we can just simply
swipe them left and right to get
different tabs we can add a new one
there we can choose from all of our
different popular tabs here and then we
can simply add tabs based upon
suggestions went ahead and added android
authority so now we can actually just go
to android authority right from the
start page cancel our load just like
that we also have the refresh button
there back and forward pretty easy
controls basic stuff it's really fast so
I enjoy using it let's go ahead and
compare it to our next browser to use
the chrome browser now the chrome has a
few more options and it has more of a
desktop feel we can go ahead and sign in
to Chrome going to go ahead and sign in
so now that we're signed in we can
actually import all of our desktop
bookmarks and the bookmarks from our
other devices running the chrome browser
so you can see our tab management is a
very similar to that on computers and
desktop applications we have our
bookmarks and our voice search right
there in the URL bar the three dots
similar to Ice Cream Sandwich and jelly
bean are where we will find our menu
options we have new tab you can choose
incognito tabs on the google chrome
browser simply switch back and forth
between our regular open tabs and our
incognito tabs by pressing me squares up
there can cancel our incognito tabs we
have our bookmarks see here on our
desktop bookmarks we have all the ones
that we do have on our actual computer
so i'll go ahead and go to android
authority right from the bookmarks very
convenient we'll just load it up and
cancel the first tab now a chrome does
not support flash unfortunately but we
can simply
is the menu and request desktop site so
now we'll reload into the android
authority desktop site works very well
it's pretty fast as well let's check out
some of the other settings we can choose
other devices where we can sync our
chrome bookmarks and open tabs from our
other devices running chrome as I said
go ahead and go into the actual settings
now we have basic settings such as our
email what a town we're synced into we
have the advanced settings with privacy
accessibility bandwidth management
developer tools and content settings
chrome works great easy tab management
simply you just add new tabs like that
we have our forward back and cancel
button this also serves as refresh when
you need it also save a bookmark very
easily and perform voice searches so
that's great we'll go ahead and move on
to our next one I'm going to skip the
over screen for now I'll use that one is
our last one and I will move on to
firefox beta firefox beta is very
similar to the google chrome except for
we have plugins available for firefox
beta which makes it very very cool you
can just add plugins go ahead and check
out our menu here we can request desktop
sites as well go ahead and navigate to
android authority com first
whoops i did misspell it but we're going
to go ahead and search it anyways we'll
see if we can get the suggestions let's
check it out mobile site is usual go
ahead and hit our settings options and
click request desktop site one of my
favorite features that comes with
browsers got to have my desktop site
when I'm using a tablet that's basically
why i have a tablet i don't want the
mobile version 10 inches wide anyways we
can search the page we can save the page
as PDF we can clear the site settings
manage our add-ons check our downloads
go ahead and set our settings really
quick and then we'll check out some of
the add-ons available anyways we can
enable cookies we can clear a private
data tell sites not to track me I'm
going to go ahead and do that we can
import other bookmarks from our android
browser and stuff like that you have
plugins text size options let's go ahead
and check out some of our add-ons we can
get as you see it here is our tab
management comes in from the left you
can simply add a tab like this go ahead
and minimize that right to our add-ons
manager now we can now choose integrated
search with google amazon in the great
search twitter wikipedia and go to a
little add-on store here remove that
with URL fixer phony these are just some
suggestions there's a lot of addons you
can do a lot of great ones to go ahead
and check them out for yourself view our
full site as well Firefox is awesome
does not have flash support has
integrated html5 support it's what
everything is moving to so go ahead and
go back check out the boat browser now
the boat browser is really cool because
we do have our status bar here on the
bottom forward and back we have our
favorites or bookmarks here's our tab
management and then there's our settings
under settings we can choose a homepage
this has add ons as well so let's check
out some of those
it's going to the Play Store whoop sound
a little better here's our different
add-ons we have web to PDF tab history
show IP URL shortener multi license key
all that great stuff go ahead and go
back just to a web page now let's try
and navigate to android authority search
result there
case we can also set how the browser
appears whether or not it's acting as an
Android desktop so we can always request
the desktop sites iphone Internet
Explorer Firefox Safari or iPad we want
to keep that an Android for now very
cool fast browser we do have the ability
to enable the desktop site if we go
ahead and switch the UA again let's go
ahead and do the desktop in fact go back
and if we refresh the page it does act
as a desktop will load the full version
of the website so that's really great
awesome functionality we'll go ahead and
do the over screen browser now and I
also fail to mention we're going to be
checking out the dolphin browser so
we'll download that one very quickly
here's our over screen browser as you
can see I opened two of them by clicking
it twice very cool innovative browser
you can simply drag it around and you
can still share and do all of your
different stuff in the background here

in the background and then you can
simply maximize this if you'd like so
main functionality the over screen
