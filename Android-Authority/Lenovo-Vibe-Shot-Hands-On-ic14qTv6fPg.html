Android authority and we are here at
Mobile World Congress 2015 hanging out
with Lenovo taking a look at one of
their latest handsets this is the vibe
shot and as you can see it's a very
premium device it's made of glass
on the front and the back wrapped in an
all metal frame and it feels really nice
in the hand just to recap some of these
specs really quick here it is being
powered by a Snapdragon 615 so it does
have 64-bit processing you're looking at
a 5-inch display on the front here at
1080p resolution it is also an IPS
display and it's very vibrant very
saturated on the back here you're
looking at a 16 megapixel sensor which
we will talk about a little bit more in
a second and on the front you're looking
at an 8 megapixel sensor which is going
to be really great for taking some high
resolution selfies if you're into that
sort of thing also you're looking at
three gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes
of internal storage which is also
expandable up to a hundred and twenty
eight gigabytes via micro sd inside
you're also looking at a very large 2900
milliamp hour battery which should be
enough to give you a really good battery
life all-day battery life and it's also
running Android 5.0 lollipop out of the
box a with lenovo's vibe UI on top so
you are getting the latest version of
Android which is really great with this
phone now the main takeaway and you can
sort of tell by the name of the vibe
shot is the camera so there's a big
focus on the camera here and on the back
you can kind of see that it's sort of
designed to look like a camera and then
on top here there is a dedicated camera
button so it feels a lot more like a
standard point-and-shoot when you're
taking photos there are two modes
basically with this camera app and you
you're going to notice that there's a
smart mode and a pro mode and basically
what smart mode is it's essentially an
automatic mode and it detects the
scenery and tries to adjust the camera
settings as best as possible for that
particular scene or subject whether it's
a person or a picture of an object it'll
do its best to adjust the camera
settings for you so you can just focus
purely on
taking the shot now where it gets
interesting is the pro mode so I'll go
ahead and just pull this switch here and
switch to the pro mode really quick this
will give you a lot more manual controls
like ISO white balance aperture shutter
speed all those different things that
you would expect from a normal camera
you can even adjust the depth of field
which is really great so you're getting
some really awesome controls here with
this camera so that's basically the main
takeaway here with this with this the
particular device is the camera itself
and that's really it for the vibe shot
as far as pricing and availability goes
you're looking at three $49.99 without a
contract and it will be available in
June</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
