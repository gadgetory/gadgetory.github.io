really taking a different look at the
Android ecosystem and it is very
different in and of itself inside and
out but it is a very intriguing phone
and that's why we have here your first
look at the Turing phone now the Turing
phone very aptly named by the company
turning robotics is a different take on
an Android smartphone that might look a
little bit more like a boutique brand
like virtu but it comes in at a more
affordable price point
it also prioritizes a security on the
inside as well as out which is the
reason why some of the design choices on
the outside are very different from what
you might expect but first before we get
into the design itself which is really
all I can show you of this phone because
they didn't really have a full working
camera or even software inside of these
particular prototypes that they were
showing me what I can't show you about
the software is the kind of design
language that they might be looking for
this is a demo of the software that
they're using and you can see I can
swipe left and right to change the
different areas that I'm in and even
swipe halfway in order to get to certain
settings they say that the final
software is going to look very different
from this but at least I can show you
what their design language might end up
being like and I have to say it does
look kind of sleek and is a different
take on an Android operating system but
let's take a look at the device itself
now it definitely has the look of let's
say a high-end sports car and it
definitely feels like one as well the
phone will remain pretty light not too
light as to suggest that the materials
are not sturdy and that in and of itself
is a big portion of the turning phones
appeal at the fact that more than half
of the phone on the outside and also in
is made up of a material called liquid
morphine it's a very strong material
that is able to withstand a lot of shock
and a lot of punishment without even
breaking or much less getting too many
dents and scuffs at least compared to
plenty of the other types of materials
that we see in the Android space they
even were gracious enough to give me a
small piece of liquid morphine to mess
with myself and you can see here I have
a hard time breaking and much less even
bending it and the sound that it makes
when it falls on the ground is a little
bit telling of just how sturdy this
material is
now the entire phone is not made of
liquid morpheme actually on the back on
the top and bottom we have polycarbonate
and in the middle is a aluminum panel
moving over to the side you'll see that
there is a fingerprint reader on the
side on the left side of the phone
rather and I was able to get a
demonstration of what that usage looks
like now what interested me about this
was when he was trying to get into an
unfinished version of Turing's own
security software
there was a two-factor authentication
required you first use your fingerprint
and then you have to put in the code it
really goes to show you just how much
turning wants this phone to be as secure
as possible and it also has to do with
the design because don't notice that
around the entire device there's really
no headphone jack because they want the
phone to just be Bluetooth audio capable
they told me that headphone jacks and
using wired headphones is kind of passe
and then on the bottom there is no micro
USB charging port or data port I should
say because the magnetic strip that's
down there is for charging and no data
transfer data transfer will be done with
Turing's own proprietary software that
utilizes Wi-Fi for you to transfer data
from let's say a computer to the phone
so really this phone is supposed to be
self-contained or everything on the
inside is just what it is and there's
nothing that will tamper it from the
outside world that also includes some
protection as the water-proof phone will
be able to withstand depths and also
some shocks because of the liquid
morphine outer body but one interesting
fact about the waterproofing is that all
of the inners are coated as well so even
though there are some open areas in the
design where water might seep in it's
not going to keep the phone from working
and you just have to shake off the water
and you should be good to go because not
only is the outside coated and for the
waterproofing but every little part on
the inside is as well so we are going to
get our hands on a review unit pretty
soon but the phone is going to be
available for pre-order starting on July
31st the 16 gigabyte version will go for
six hundred and ten dollars which is a
pretty low price point considering that
phones with this kind of attention to
detail tend to go for even more like for
example phones by virtue from there you
can go from 16 gigabytes to a 64
gigabyte version that will go for 700
and $40 and a 128 gigabyte version that
would go for 870 so this is a look at
the turnin phone I'm mostly at the
design because these particular
prototypes were all that I was able to
look at a very short look at software
not even the final finished product but
you will just have to wait for my review
unit to get here and I'll give you all
of the details about to the turnin phone
at that point so make sure you keep it
tuned to Android Authority for even more
about the Turing phone and keep it tuned
here for even more from all of us here
at Android authority because we are your
source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
