Android experiences available today hey
it's Josh vegard from android authority
and this is the brand new Moto X we
might not have been able to be there at
the chicago one but we have a great look
at this the new Moto X you can see I
have the bamboo version right here which
in the original moto x is one that I
really wanted and I'm certainly going to
do my best to get this one in this
particular version right now so what
we're looking at here is the brand new
Moto X it has the 5.2 inch screen and
it's pretty much the size that you would
want it to be but it's still prefer it
still has the small form factor all
around that will make it easy for plenty
of people out there to use no matter who
you are now as far as the materials go
it all feels very premium and even the
buttons themselves have this nice meaty
look and also maybe feel rather is what
I meant to say and as we get into the
operating system we're going to have a
lot of different elements in here that
are very akin to stock Android which is
what you already expected from the
original moto x but now it's even been
beefed up more with more of Moto's own
additions including gestures and also
voice commands further enhanced but
let's go ahead and head around the
actual device itself we still have that
well at this point maybe it's not so
subtle curve on the back that does give
it a kind of a grin right there as you
can see in the shot right there but that
curve right there makes it so easy to
use in the hand is able to rest very
easily right here with the thin sides
that really cradle your entire poem and
make it very easy to grasp head on over
to the back and of course we have the
bamboo backing there are a lot of
different choices that you will be able
to have on the Moto maker and the bamboo
is just a one of those choices now we do
have the prominent modal logo in the
middle personally I'm not too sure how I
feel about that particular logo but the
entire look still looks very nice and
you take it as a full package the camera
right up here is a 13 megapixel camera
at this point which brings a lot of
great power to the moto family and after
that you'll be able to have black white
all these different ones and also
leather which you'll see a clip of in a
little bit but all in all this is a
device that is already exciting to look
at and exciting to feel here are the
buttons on the sides that all feel
really great and there are a lot of
great usability features right and right
inside of this package that is powered
by the Snapdragon 801 which is
incredible and what you see on the front
here actually something that wasn't able
to say earlier these are not
buns these are front facing speakers now
they've taken the philosophy from the
Moto e that had the front facing
speakers that a lot of people wished
around the x and now they're on here the
new brand new X 4 2014 and beyond
alright so we're sort of taking a bird's
eye view of the Moto X right here the
brand new one and you're going to see
here the settings for the moto actions
now this is inside the settings menu
obviously and you just click on moto and
you have a lot of air I places that you
can customize experience to what you
want but what I did was I already went
to the voice area and I created my own
phrase in order to create the experience
that I want for the launch so at any
point in the phone in whether it's on or
off I will be able to say the following
phrase and it will go ahead and go right
into it what's up moto x good night
obviously the phone right here is set
for one of the people here whose name is
Victoria but what I just did is put it
into a night mode now what a night mode
does is it will allow you to get a good
night's rest without actually having the
phone ring or the screen will stay off
or it will keep going and keep you from
cue from disturbing you when it's a when
the time comes for you to not get
disturbed a couple other commands that
are available are ones that will allow
you to respond to texts wats app be able
to search YouTube clips and to do plenty
more with it but the other feature that
I have here is in terms of the infrared
sensors that are here now you have four
of them two of them on the bottom one at
the top that's easy to find but
essentially what will happen here is
when I when I move my hand over the
actual device itself in the infrared
sensors detect that it will turn on the
active display now the active display
obviously is one of the main components
of the original moto x that people
really love because it gives you instant
look at your notifications and if I just
wave over the device and just hold there
I'll be able to look at all my
notifications very easily now we're
taking a look at the leather version
right here and while I'm not completely
sold on the leather I'm sure that a lot
of people out that will really like it
does have a really nice feel and it will
definitely stay really nice in the hand
but also you can see very plainly on
this version of the phone but it's
across all of them that there's an
aluminum frame and you got the lip
around here that really accents
everything and it's
beautiful on the leather right here you
can see that there's no stitching
whatsoever it's just as nice I thought
it's a cowhide but really it's just a
nice leather feel and a really accents
and really complements the look of the
Moto X quite well though I will say I'm
probably going to go for that bamboo
version I gotta tell you this is one
hell of a device and one of the devices
here at Aoife that really excited us
with all of the different features that
were already usable in the Moto X that
have been further enhanced for this
version of the brand new phone stay
tuned to android authority for all of
the best coverage as we continue our
coverage of the Moto X the brand new
Moto X's are calling it and you'll see
even more from us here at Android
authority as we're here from Ethan in
Berlin but we will still have a lot more
for you even after Aoife so make sure
you stay tuned because we are your
source for all things and drove it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
