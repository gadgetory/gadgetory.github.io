channel to hear you talk about Apple
dude you click the video and I'm here to
talk about what Android is up against
and the views are nice too Wow
the threat of a new iPhone is looming
over Android peeking through the clouds
we've seen and heard various rumors
about it including one that may come
with a bezel is design like the Xiaomi
me mix and the Galaxy s8 and most
recently Andy Rubens essential phone now
the phone may be a few weeks away but
trusted leaker Evan Blass aka evey leaks
has given us this now the render depicts
what is believed to be just one of the
new iPhone devices inside a bulky case
Apple is said to be readying a curved
screen device for later this year - it
appears to be similar to that of Andy
Rubens essential phone with the screen
wrapping around the cameras and speaker
at the top of the handset now it is
difficult to get a firm grasp on the
true size of the bezel especially
because the phone is pictured in a case
but it's likely that there won't be
inches above and below the screen so the
bezels might be even slimmer than that
of the galaxy s 8 you may also notice
the omission of the typical iPhone home
button just like the approach Samsung
took with the s8 and si plus earlier
this year now I know what some of you
are thinking because I was thinking it
too with deep bloody do I mean Samsung
and LG has been providing beautiful
bezels displays for a while now and
Apple's going to do it and Apple sheep
are just going to bow down an amazement
of their innovation well there may be
truth to that but it's not because Apple
can't be innovative it's because Apple
doesn't have to you see for those of you
who are new to this show you'll know
that I have talked about this book the
22 immutable laws of marketing many
times and another book that is dedicated
just to this specific topic called
positioning by the same author all deals
with the idea that if you want to be
successful make the most money in your
industry you don't necessarily have to
have the best product what you have to
have is mind in the market share right
so if
you are the first product in that
category that the average person thinks
of you win and you don't win a lot you
win
almost everything case in point when you
want to go to a fast food restaurant
what do you think of you don't think of
Wendy's or Burger King you think of
McDonald's if you want to wipe your nose
you don't say give me a tissue paper you
say give me a Kleenex that's right
because they are first in the mind when
you need some tape you don't say give me
some tape you say give me some scotch
tape because they have market share
their first in the minds of the first
product that you think of in that
category and they if they're in that
position they earn not just like twenty
thirty percent of the market share but
they earn a crazy amount like the second
position isn't like a little bit less
it's a lot less if you compare the
market share that Apple has compared to
Samsung there's no difference I mean
we're not talking 6040 split we're
talking lots of difference right so
apples in a position where they can just
have much longer life spans between
innovation and upgrades than Samsung and
LG do they got to do something to really
catch your attention much more than
Apple does right so that's why we're in
the position where Apple can just give
us incremental upgrades every year and
you know something big every two to
three years whereas upon LG have to
really push the envelope on a much more
frequent basis yeah what do you think of
that let me know in the comments below
or you can talk with me about it over on
Twitter verse right there
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
