authority and today we're taking a look
at two devices to see how they stack up
against each other the HTC droid DNA and
the samsung galaxy note 2 while we knew
it was coming for quite some time HTC
and Verizon officially unveiled the HTC
droid DNA in an event in New York City
earlier today this is the HTC j
butterfly rebranded for verizon so if
you start to feel a bit of deja vu
that's perfectly normal now let's take a
look at how these devices measure up to
each other the first thing you'll notice
is that while it still has a fairly
large screen the HTC droid DNA is
smaller than the samsung galaxy note 2
with a 5-inch display to the note 2's
five and a half inch display whether
this is a good thing or not depends on
how much screen real estate you need as
well as how large of a device you're
comfortable with one clear edge that the
HTC droid DNA has is its 1080p 440 pixel
per inch display while the samsung
galaxy note 2 only has a 720p display I
was initially skeptical on whether 1080p
resolution would matter on such a
relatively small display but seeing the
droid DNA in action there were
definitely times where images were
notably clearer obviously a lot of web
content is in 1080p resolution so you
won't notice this too often but in the
case of photos for example the higher
resolution display is very nice when it
comes to the design it's entirely a
matter of personal taste between these
two devices as fond as I am of the note
2 I have to say that I find the droid
dna's design more interesting the droid
DNA is also thinner than the note 2
which some users may care about more
than others looking at sheer power it
would seem that the two devices are
evenly matched both feature quad-core
processors with the Samsung Galaxy Note
2 using an Exynos 5 chipset and the HTC
droid DNA using a Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
chipset while the note 2's processor
clocked slightly higher at 1.6 gigahertz
to the droid dna's 1.5 gigahertz the
droid DNA seems to be the faster of the
two devices one issue that may not work
out so well for the HTC droid DNA is its
battery now we haven't seen the battery
in action too much but at 2020 milliamp
hours compared to the samsung galaxy
note 2 s3100 milliamp hours it'll be
interesting to see how long the droid
dna's battery keeps powering that 1080p
display both of these devices run
Android 4.1 jelly bean and both of them
are skinned the HTC droid DNA has an HTC
Sense overlay while the galaxy note 2 is
running TouchWiz if you're a fan of
stock Android you might not be happy
with either of these but both of them
are similar enough to each other that if
you like one chances are you'll like the
other just fine looking at the
differences in features both devices
have one feature that they push above
the rest in the case of the HTC droid
DNA it's probably the integrated Beats
Audio which is powered by a DSP chip in
the Snapdragon s4 pro meaning it doesn't
put a drain on the main process in the
case of the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 it's
the S Pen and it's related features as
with a lot of the other differences
between these two devices which feature
set you prefer is probably going to
depend a lot on how you use your phone
are you a busy person who's constantly
taking notes and using productivity
tools in that case maybe the Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 is for you on the other
hand if you use your phone more for
media especially music and video the HTC
droid DNA might be the better choice
especially since it sounds fantastic
although it's going to be interesting to
see how the battery holds up with all
that media
both of these devices are currently
among the very best you can buy so for a
lot of people this will be a win-win
situation either way personally until I
saw the HTC droid dna's 1080p screen and
action I wasn't sure that it was a
feature that would matter at all but
seeing it's definitely an advantage as
for the samsung galaxy note 2 as someone
lucky enough to have used the device for
the past few weeks I've fallen in love
with it if I had to choose between the
two I wouldn't even know where to start
in the end the decision between these
two devices hinges on a number of
factors but the main question to ask
yourself is do you want a phone or do
you want a tiny time with that also acts
as a fun really the only way to decide
for yourself is to use both devices for
a few minutes in person and see which
one you prefer all the specs and
features in the world can't choose what
the right device is for you that
decision is entirely yours which of
these two devices seems more appealing
to you do you like the smaller form
factor in 1080p display of the HTC droid
DNA or do you prefer the samsung galaxy
note 2 s S Pen features and larger
amount of screen real estate tell us
what you think in the comments this has
been Christopher woof or android
authority and as always we'd love to
hear what you think of this video and
