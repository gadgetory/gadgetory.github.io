related question in 10 seconds before
Andy Rubin the co-founder of Android
sold to Google who did he try to sell to
first and the answer is Samsung and if
you can answer trivia questions like
that in 10 seconds without using Google
search you might be able to win some
cash I'm talking about the biggest viral
sensation to hit Apple's App Store this
year stay with me though because there
are some promised Android goodies at the
end I'm talking about the app HQ it's a
live trivia quiz show for your phone
where contestants compete for real cash
prizes much like a regular TV quiz show
the game is held at specific times and
usually hosted by Scott Rogowski
affectionately dubbed quiz daddy by his
fans get a question wrong and you have
to wait for the next game and you can't
use Google search either because the
question only shows up for 10 seconds
it's like jeopardy and twitch had a baby
that's sort of HQ in a nutshell now we
were supposed to get HQ trivia for
Android this Christmas but there was
some sort of hiccup in the launch but we
do have the next best thing to offer a
link to pre-register so you can be the
first in line when HQ trivia for Android
actually launches hit the link in the
description below and it will take you
to the Play Store last week was big news
for alphabet the parent company of
Google and possibly very meaningful
Google's parent company alphabet
announced a major shake-up for its
executive ranks this week Eric Schmidt
the former CEO of Google
will step down from his role as
executive chairman on alpha-bits Board
of Directors which he has held since
2011 the change will officially take
place during the company's next board
meeting in January 2018
now I thought long and hard before
reporting on this but I thought this
part does really need to be said Eric
Schmidt has been slowly pulling back
from responsibilities at alphabet in
Google over several years on the surface
it looks like just business as usual
someone on Twitter who I won't say had
perpetuated a rumor that perhaps Eric
Schmidt is stepping down as a
pre-emptive
to dampen the blow of a possible sexual
harassment allegation this person
provided no evidence nothing verifiable
nothing just fueling the gossip and in
today's environment to me that is
exceedingly dangerous we have no reason
to believe that Eric Schmidt is stepping
down for anything other than the reasons
he stated in the press release nothing
right but this person has a lot of
influence and the rumor had just been
stirring in the background if you guys
follow me on Twitter I challenge that
person and went back and forth and said
maybe there were healthier ways to go
around spreading rumors instead of
risking destroying someone's life we are
innocent until proven guilty and you
know as a free society we try and allow
due process to do its job to increase
the chance that there can be justice for
all people I wanted to say that because
man the world is getting crazy now you
guys remember magic leap magic leap was
a secretive startup that received
billions of dollars backed by Google and
was working in the exciting arena of
augmented and virtual reality over the
past four years there has been fever
pitched excitement about the new tech
coming from magic leap unfortunately
they produced bubkis nothing except for
some videos they didn't produce anything
tangible for us to see until now last
week
they revealed the magic leap one set
which includes a pair of light wear
goggles a portable light pack computer
and a motion controller that looks a lot
like daydream views remote crossed with
an HTC vive wand starting with the light
wear goggles itself according to a legal
report the futuristic looking eyewear
will come in two sizes while the unit
itself has been engineered to be
lightweight and comfortable as well as
several adjustable components around the
forehead nose and temple magic leap is
apparently going as far as taking into
account prescription details so it can
adapt the lenses for users who wear
glasses light wear is tethered to two
cables to the light pack a circular pad
that houses magic leaps spatial
computing platform and provides the high
powered processing and graphics needed
to effectively blend digital objects in
the real world the secret behind magic
leap one however appears to lie in the
firm's digital light field technology
magic leap explains how this works in
detail on its website our light field
photonics generate digital light at
different depths and blend seamlessly
with natural light to produce lifelike
digital objects that coexists in the
real world this advanced technology
allows our brain to naturally process
digital objects the same way we do
real-world objects making it comfortable
to use for long periods of time does
that make you hopeful for me at best I
am cautiously optimistic
