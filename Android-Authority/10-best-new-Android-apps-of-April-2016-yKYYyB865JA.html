handy the Android authority app guy and
it's about that time a month to round up
the best Android apps from April of 2016
if you want to check out any of these
applications we'll have those links for

dictionary that allows you to look up
words find their definition and
translate them into a variety of other
languages complete with example
sentences it comes with a quick search
offline mode and pronunciation which
rounds out an already impressive set of
features this is a great tool for
travelers people learning second
languages and anyone looking to expand
their vocabulary it's free to download
with no in-app purchases encode is a
beginners programming application that
teaches you the basics of programming it
uses JavaScript to teach the basics but
all of the concepts are fairly universal
which makes it a great starter
application for those who have never
programmed but you definitely want to
start it has sections for numbers
strings boolean's variables if
statements and other basics it's free to
download and use with it's only weakness
being that there's really nothing here
for intermediate or advanced programmers
the chippy technically existed as an
extension to facebook Messenger but
April saw a time of great change for the
app it has been released as a standalone
application capable of searching for
gifs and sharing them just about
anywhere that you want you can search by
keyword or category if you prefer or
check out what's trending there are a
ton of categories including moods free
actions and there is even jiff emoji
that you can download and use it's all
entirely free which is just a cherry on
top
email time is a newer email client that
allows you to organize your emails in a
chat like order so you can communicate
with people more easily it allows you to
connect to a variety of services
including Gmail Yahoo Outlook mail dot
Roo and many others once connected your
emails will be organized by sender with
the interface looking a whole lot like
your standard messaging application it's
free to use and a great app to pick up
if you communicate through email a whole
bunch the boat is an RSS reader in an
age where RSS readers don't really get
made anymore
it focuses on simplicity where the
experience revolves around just you and
your RSS feeds there are no
recommendation engines getting in the
way or
anything ridiculous it has support for
feedly and I know reader which is great
if you use one or both of those services
the free version gives you the basics
including a light and dark themed
gesture navigation and offline reading
options going pro removes the
advertising ads themes and support for
multiple accounts three-color is a
coloring book application that's meant
for adults this is part of the wave of
adult coloring books that promotes
relaxation and creativity the
application features over 700 coloring
pictures with new ones being added on a
daily basis they are categorized into
difficulty levels ranging from beginner
to expert depending on how complex you
want your coloring experience to be many
images are free but you will have to
fork out for some using in-app purchases
the application is free to download by
itself credit release their nascent
application in April to unfairly
negative reviews you see most people use
powerful third-party reddit apps and
we're disappointed that the official app
wasn't like one of them it is however a
perfectly decent and usable reddit
application for casual users which was
all it was ever meant to be it embraces
material design and allows for basic
navigation and interaction it is still
working through some early release bugs
but it's a good application nevertheless
this lightbox is a photo organizer
application which is really just a fancy
way of calling it a gallery app with
this one you can delete photos sort
photos into albums group photos that
look similar and compare them and a
whole lot more it also organizes your
images where they are so it doesn't mess
with the functionality of any other
applications it's missing a few features
like SD card supports but it's an
otherwise good effort that's completely
free to download and use face maker is
developed by us to these same developers
who brought us the hit game Monument
Valley this application is for Android
wear users and it gives you two template
watch faces that you can customize and
control it has a variety of
customization options and you can really
create some unique watch faces with this
app it's not as in-depth as something
like pacer but it's entirely free and
it's much easier to use

guessed an application that covers the
world of eSports it covers a variety of
games including MOBAs fighters shooters

easy to NAV

video recorded video highlights events

only a few good eSports apps out there
