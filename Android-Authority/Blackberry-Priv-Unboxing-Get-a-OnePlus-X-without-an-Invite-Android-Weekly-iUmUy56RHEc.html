brought to you by domain.com now if you
are quick and depending on where you
live in the world I may be able to help
you buy a oneplus X without having to go
through the pesky invite system I know
you're thinking Jase oneplus will be
selling a limited number of its X
smartphones each day at pop-up stores
appearing in the following cities the
handsets will be sold on a first-come
first-served basis so you'll probably
have to be fast to avoid disappointment
now the first pop-up store has already
arrived in Paris today November 2nd but
the deven will be located right here and
although it started today at 11 a.m.
Paris time it will run until November
4th here's a list of the other scheduled
cities and dates Paris London Berlin
Rome Hong Kong and Los Angeles now
oneplus did say that they would be
having other events today and tomorrow
in Mumbai and Delhi but with the wording
it suggests that they wouldn't be
selling phones there any of you who are
in these cities and buy these phones
tell me about it
please show me a photo tell me about the
phone shared on Twitter or Google+ and I
will add it in next week's show now
let's move on to the BlackBerry Prive
the Prive originally referred to as the
Venice is set to ship November 6 for
customers in the US on the other side of
the pond however UK retailer Carphone
Warehouse has received a release unit
and unboxed it for us all to behold we
first get a quick look at the packaging
which contains the words privilege and
privacy now for the British they
pronounced a privacy privacy giving a
some indication on how blackberry chose
the name the video also demonstrates
several unique blackberry features
carried over from bb10 blackberry hub is
retained and can be accessed by holding
down the home button and swiping to the
right hub is also a one-stop go for all
your notifications the Printz virtual
keyboard allowed you to quote flick word
predictions into the text field by
swiping up from a key
now the
is $750 u.s. unlocked to me an ominous
indication of how well the phone is
going to sell it's not good friends now
let's talk about a new launcher from
Microsoft the Redmond computer giant
introduces a new app that some of you
may be familiar with it's called the
arrow launcher the launcher is optimized
for the Android experience but it is
unlike vanilla Android or most other
third-party launchers for that matter
the whole point of microsoft's
customized UI is that it tries to offer
a smarter experience and adapts to your
own usage habits it gets rid of all the
extra fluff and tries to put all your
information front and center you will
notice it really has no homescreen the
UI consists of three sections people
apps notes and reminders the people
section unites your contacts and
messaging services so all your recent
numbers messages and email addresses
will be readily available there you can
also dial your own digits and find
people other features include widgets
page rearrangement a customizable dock
icon pack support and more now we did
receive a little hint that Google may be
getting into the hardware market even
more historically google hasn't been
much of a hardware company having relied
on partnerships with OEMs to bring
products like its Chromebooks and Nexus
smartphones to market that changed with
the Chromebook pixel and more recently
with the pixel see tablet a new Google
job listing for a quote multimedia chip
architect suggests that Google may be
planning to go all the way and design
its own processors for future products
as well now the listing was apparently
posted by the pixel division and Jim
McGregor a chip expert said this with
the trend towards vertical integration
especially at Microsoft and Apple it
wouldn't surprise me if Google developed
their own chips especially for Android
productivity tablets to compete with the
surface pro and iPad pro now that makes
sense and please bring on those
productivity tablets so do you guys will
remember from like 15 years ago when
people were making money hand over fist
in the dot-com bubble remember we didn't
call it a dotnet bubble or dot org
bubble
we didn't call them dot biz billionaires
we called them dot-com billionaires
because that's the power of a dot-com
now why is that because no domain name
extension tells your story with the same
degree of trust as a dot-com or dotnet
domain name.com and dotnet domain name
extensions inject credibility into your
online presence save 15% on domain names

when you think domain names think
domain.com thanks for watching and word
army my name is Jace love to connect
with you right here on Google+ or
Twitter and don't forget about my
brothers and sister and Android we're
