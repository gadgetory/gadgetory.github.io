future for a lot of these companies in
our tech but Google is really putting
their best foot forward and they're
doing so with a version of virtual
reality that is not only affordable but
it's pretty accessible and available to
everybody hey it's Josh with regard from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is a look at the
updated version of Google cardboard but
one of the best enhancements of it is
that all if you watch my video from last
year I had a little bit of trouble
putting it together there were quite a
few steps that were required and I felt
like a bit of a dunce because I couldn't
get it together quite so easily but this
year's iteration of cardboard especially
the one that is now made for devices
like the Nexus 6 is now in a more in
easier to assemble package I should say
so we're going to go ahead and just
slide out all of the elements here we
have this sleeve that we're gonna get
out I'm gonna go through this setup with
you guys right now so we're going to
take that out of course simple Google
design there on the bottom right we have
some information right here including
the viewer profile and see the apps and
the product safety information
there you go we have our instructions
right here
so our instructors pretty much tell us
to bring the these portions down almost
like Darth Vader there and then once
those are velcroed into place the next
thing we have to do is just bring that
over and there we go
cardboard is as easy to put together as
it has ever been last year it took me I
think I'd like a couple minutes and a
little bit of video editing magic to get
this things together but now we have the
area here to put the phone in so if we
were gonna work with let's say the Nexus
6 which I have right here it'll fit just
fine there cardboard IO 2015 all right
here we go let's go ahead and install
some cardboard apps here so you can see
that there are quite a few applications
that are there one in particular I'm
gonna download it I'm not really excited
about it but it's called insidious VR oh
god I don't want to get scared but I'm
gonna do it okay I'm gonna download that
let's see how big it is hundred ninety
megabytes so it's gonna take a little
bit
oh wow this is terrifying things are
happy they know the sound is really
scary and I'm because I'm actually being
shown things being thrown thrown at me
it's pretty terrifying so that's just an
example of the new cardboard like in
terms of just the device centric feel of
cardboard it has become bigger and able
to take phones like the Nexus 6 which is
really great but what really intrigues
me about cardboard this year is the fact
that cardboard will be made available
for a lot of different platforms one of
which being education now of course we
can already going to be talking about in
the coming months the fact that you can
create the content for VR on your own
using camera arrays and GoPro it's going
to actually have one available and I'm
sure it's gonna cost a fortune
but what really gets me about cardboard
now is that well it's just a piece of
cardboard maybe a little bit of plastic
over here and you're able to just sort
of put it together after that you throw
your smartphone in there and you'll be
able to view pretty much anything and if
we're able to create moments and scenes
from pretty much anywhere in the world
then basically what happens is that we
can share what may not be shareable to
particular people and an education that
could be about going to places like in
China or going to places across the
world
Egypt everywhere and actually seeing
firsthand what we would only see in 2d
in our textbooks I'm not that far
removed from college but it with with an
immersive experience from let's say my
high school years of my junior high
years it probably would have created an
even better experience of schooling for
someone like me that is very sensory of
centric I need to be able to hear and
see things in order to really connect
with them rather than just reading them
off of a page and being told what it's
supposed to be about and cardboard might
be the gateway that Google is creating
for all of these kids and eventually
it's going to become not only an
immersive educational
explain immersive experience all on its
own and really it's all just through
something like this there are obviously
better VR headsets out there that will
provide even better experiences but
really that's not the point of cardboard
the point is that it is democratizing
the information in such a way that makes
it better than anything we've had before
fully immersive fully able to be seen in
depth and telescopic ways and to become
a part of those moments that's the thing
about Google i/o is that it really
provides those kinds of moments for
people where they realize that Wow this
this this future of technology is really
looking pretty bright
and if VR is the future well we have a
pretty nice entry point right here so
keep it tuned to Andhra Authority for
even more I'm reporting to you live here
from Google i/o 2015 here in San
Francisco California
stay tuned for even more because we are
your source for all things and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
