Hindy from android authority com the
Nexus 6 and the Nexus 9 have been
announced but we're kind of in that
limbo because they haven't been launched
quite yet in this video we're going to
do a quick roundup of everything we know
about them so far okay let's start with
the Nexus 6 and we'll go with the specs
first the nexus 6 forms a 5.9 inch 2560
x 1440 qhd AMOLED display that rocks an
astounding 493 pixels per inch under the
hood is a 3200 20 milliamp hour battery
a 13 megapixel camera with optical image
stabilization and a 2-megapixel
front-facing camera it has a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 805 quad-core CPU clocked at
2.5 gigahertz and comes in 32 gigabyte
and 64 gigabyte options it also comes
packed with 3 gigabytes of RAM support
for practically every network on planet
earth your standard array of sensors and
it runs Android 5.0 lollipop a lot of
people were skeptical when this was
first announced and really a lot of
people still are the price tag is much
higher than the nexus 5 and there are
those who take exception to that the 6
inch display is also gigantic and it's
almost too big even for most fans of
phablets the normal sized phone crowd is
very unplaced about that even without
the device in hand there are a few
educated guesses that we can make there
are very few phones that have over 3,000
lamp our batteries that have poor
battery life the 1400 display will
probably keep it from attaining the kind
of battery we saw in devices like the
note 3 but most people should be able to
make it through the day with a battery
that size the processor is
top-of-the-line so is the GPU and so is
the operating system this means that we
can expect a nearly flawless performance
that results in a very pleasant and
pretty much lag free experience there
will probably be a hiccup occasionally
but overall this should be one of the
best performing smartphones of all time
we also know that this is pretty much
the same camera that's on the Moto X
2014 edition unfortunately that camera
has come with mixed reactions some
people think it's alright and others
think it's pretty bad a lot of that
depends on personal taste though and
we'll definitely know more once the
comparisons come out
finally we know that the Nexus 6 will
cost about 650 bucks and will be
available in the Google Play Store the
four big US carriers along with US
cellular and likely a range of carriers
from around the world next up let's talk
about the Nexus 9 which is arguably the
more interesting device it comes with an
8.9 inch IPS LCD display with a
resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels that
also includes a double tap to wake up
feature it also sports a 1.6 megapixel
front facing camera and 8 bang a pixel
rear facing camera and an astounding
6700 milliamp hour battery it comes in
black white and sand colors under the
hood it has two gigabytes of RAM a
64-bit dual core tegra k1 processor
clocked at 2.3 gigahertz along with its
192 core kepler GPU it also comes with
HTC boomsound speakers and comes in 16
gigabyte and 32 gigabyte options it also
runs Android 5.0 lollipop far fewer
people are skeptical about the Nexus 9
it's reasonably priced by pretty much
everyone standards comes with a
reasonable amount of storage by most
people's standards and that 64-bit
processor is about a state-of-the-art as
you can conceivably get any mobile
device right now about the only weird
thing is the 43 aspect ratio because 69
is kind of the standard but this isn't
the first time Google has done this if
you'll recall the pixel Chromebook has a
43 aspect ratio when Google fans seem to
enjoy it so it may not be that bad of a
move even without this device we can
make some educated guesses with that
processor that ram and running stock
Android lollipop we can guess that this
is going to be a pretty impressive
machine some may balk at the idea of a
dual-core processor but do keep in mind
this isn't in the same category as the
dual-core processors from two years ago
we're relatively certain that this
device is going to be a beast as
everybody knows HTC built the Nexus 9
and with that comes HTC boomsound boom
sound has been well regarded since it
was first included on the HTC one m7 and
continues to be one of the best features
on literally every HTC device that has
it the speakers are going to sound
awesome compared to most other tablets
overall the Nexus 9 seems to be a fairly
solid device it has great specs HTC's
well-regarded build quality and boom
sound and it'll be running stock Android
when the Nexus program originally
started it was meant to be a benchmark
from which all other OEMs could follow
to create awesome devices the Nexus 9 on
paper seems to live
to that status there are some people
that are missled by the fact that Google
didn't put out a smaller device this
year instead they often to keep the
Nexus 5 around for another year and
that's not entirely a bad thing the
Snapdragon 800 in the Nexus 5 is still a
very speedy and efficient processor and
our cursory tests show that it runs
Android lollipop with grace when you
look at the big picture Google is kind
of doing a Samsung strategy here they
have a 5-inch device a phablet and then
a tablet in other words there's pretty
much a device out there for everybody
right now if I had to guess I'd say that
we'd probably see a nexus 5 and six
refresh next year when 64-bit
architecture becomes the standard but
until then there's really nothing wrong
with the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 6 is only
a slight step up something else to keep
in mind here is that there are plenty of
options if you want to go with the Nexus
and still get lollipop altogether there
will be 7 Nexus devices running lollipop
by Christmas including the Nexus 4 5 6
both sevens 9 and 10 since it's been
established that you don't need amazing
specs to run stock Android really well
that means there will be more up-to-date
Nexus devices than ever before and
that's pretty exciting especially since
you can get about half of them used at a
very reasonable price it's literally
never been a better time to be a nexus
fan we'll know more about the Nexus 6
and the Nexus 9 when we get some devices
in hand like I said earlier we're kind
of in that limbo where the devices have
been announced but only a select few
people even have them when they do start
getting handed out you'll want to stay
tuned to android authority because we'll
have a cornucopia of videos for you to
watch once again I'm Joe Hindy from
