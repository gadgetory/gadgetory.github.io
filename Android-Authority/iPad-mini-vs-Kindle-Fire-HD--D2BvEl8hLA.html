Android of the wordy channel on YouTube
Amazon has found the flames for the
7-inch tablets market and has recently
unleashed a newcomer to that raging
market the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7 Apple
2 has just joined the 7-inch air race
with its newly released iPad Mini this
Apple's tablet have enough water and
it's bucket to douse the flame of the
Kindle Fire HD watch the rest of this
video and find out at first glance you
can tell that the iPad Mini looks taller
and wider next to the Kindle Fire HD
though Houston metal the iPad Mini is
lighter it is also thinner both tablets
are very easy to hold and carry
primarily because of their small form
factors but for me the thickness of the
Kindle Fire HD is perfect for a
comfortable grip its soft touch rubber
bag also helps with the grip it has a
more solid feel to it by virtue of its
thickness and weight the iPad Mini on
the other hand is a delight to carry
because of its light weight but I feel
that it is dangerously too thin for one
hand to grasp firmly it's metal bag does
have some slight texture but I don't
think it helps with traction the front
of these two tablets are all black glass
bezel and front camera on the iPad Mini
there's the extra home button at the
bottom the touch panels are protected by
tough glass I'm not so sure about what
glass covers the iPad Mini but for the
Kindle Fire HD it's Corning Gorilla
Glass these two tablets have enough
protective cover against scratches
notice the differences in the vessel
width on the iPad Mini the bezel is
narrower on the left and right sides if
you hold the tablet like this your
fingers can easily touch the screen but
this tablet has thumb projection
technology so that seems a non-issue
these sides are actually thicker which
suggests that the iPad Mini is intended
for landscape use the Kindle Fire HD has
even Bessel's so I can rotate it any way
I want without worrying about my thumbs
touching the screen notice the location
of the front camera it's here this is a
strong suggestion that the tablets main
orientation is Lance
take a quick look at the back and you'll
get more confirmation that it's supposed
to be used in landscape on the iPad Mini
you can find the volume buttons on the
side
Apple has split the buttons into two
separate buttons rather than put them on
one volume rocker this one's the side
switch for either muting the sound or
locking the screen orientation the power
button is up here on this corner the
microphones here in the middle and the
headphone jacks here at this corner on
the left side there's nothing here on
the bottom side this one's the non
standard charging port you plug in this
non standard lightning cable here if you
want to charge the tablet or connect it
to your PC these two of course are the
loudspeaker grills on the Kindle Fire HD
the microphone is here at the top side
let's look at the right side most of the
control buttons are here just like on
the iPad Mini here's the headphone jack
this one's the volume rocker and right
next to it is the power button if you
hold the tablet like this you'll find
the power button dangerously within easy
reach of your hand but it's not easy to
accidentally press it because the button
is flat and doesn't protrude this one
here is a portion of the loudspeaker
grill on the left side there's nothing
here but the other speaker grille on the
bottom side are the microUSB port right
here for charging using a standard
microUSB cable compared to the charging
port on the iPad Mini
this one is standards compliant and not
proprietary so you can easily use the
microUSB charger cable from your other
devices this one here is a micro HDMI
port for use if you want to connect the
tablet to your HDTV
the backs of these tablets are very
distinct and very beautiful the iPad
Mini has an aluminum back with very
light texture though it easily attracts
fingerprints and smudges as you can see
here the back camera is also here it's a
five megapixel shooter on the Kindle
Fire HD the back is soft touch black
matte rubber it makes the tablet easy to
grip though like the Apple tablets bag
it is also prone to fingerprint smears
this band here is made of metal and on
both ends are the loudspeaker grills now
let's take a look at the screen and
display I'm not sure which of the two
displays I like better they both look
very lovely to me the diagonal lengths
of both are quite okay the iPad Mini has
a 7.9 inch screen while the Kindle Fire
HD has a 7 inch screen both can render
high-definition images but they do
differ in resolution the Apple tablet
has 1024 by 768 and the Kindle has 1280
by 800 because of its smaller screen
size the Kindle Fire HD has higher pixel
density resulting in a much sharper and
crisper display colors your bright and
vibrant as are on the iPad Mini the
Apple tablet though appears to have
better contrast so the whites look
whiter and the blacks look blacker
regardless the displace on these two
tablets didn't make me frown these two
tablets come with very powerful
processors though both are still using
dual-core CPUs the one on the Kindle
Fire HD is a Texas Instruments OMAP 4460
clocked at 1.2 gigahertz and with 1
gigabyte of RAM on the iPad Mini its
Apple's own a5 chipset clocked at 1
gigahertz and with 512 megabytes of RAM
you can get either 16 or 32 gigabytes of
internal storage for the Amazon tablet
while on the iPad Mini you can get 16 32
or 64 gigabytes nope no micro SD card
slot the Kindle Fire HD s powerful
screen and processing hardware provide
the smoothness and responsiveness and
the user interface it's actually more
fluid than the previous Kindle Fire
though some areas show very noticeable
lag and jitter
in contrast I found only very little lag
close to nuttin all on the iPad Mini
both tablets have batteries for the
capacity of 4400 mAh which generally
provides about 10 to 11 hours of power
under moderate use the Kindle Fire HD
uses lithium ion and the iPad Mini uses
lithium polymer we did a quick and
informal battery test after two hours of
heavy use with brightness at maximum and
with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on each
tablet had only 64% of its battery power
left
so it appears even between them until we
felt the bag covers the Kindle Fire HD
turned slightly warm as expected but the
iPad Mini became hot and comfortably hot
according to a colleague of mine you can
connect to the internet through Wi-Fi on
these tablets the iPad Mini though has a
variant with LTE connectivity it's
coming out this month according to
sources both also have bluetooth in our
tests the Kindle Fire HD was super
friendly with its Android friends but
the iPad Mini was really antisocial we
try to make them shake hands by
bluetooth but the iPad Mini said that
the Kindle Fire HD was not supported you
can also transfer data through a USB
cable on the iPad Mini you'll need
apples proprietary non
standards-compliant lightning cable and
plug it into this proprietary non
standards-compliant Lightning port I'm
not sure how easy it is to buy a
replacement cable but if this were
standards compliant microUSB like this
one on the Kindle Fire HD you can easily
use your other phone's cable so big plus
points to the Amazon tablet for sticking
to standards and a bag full of
additional points to the Kindle Fire HD
2 for this micro HDMI port for
connecting the tablet to an HDTV if you
want to take photos using your tablet
you can do so with the iPad Mini it has
a 5 megapixel back camera which is
actually very snappy and actually
captures good quality photos and videos
the Kindle Fire HD doesn't have a bad
camera at all most of us here at Andrew
thority are very happy that it doesn't
main reason is though we have almost no
use for a bad camera on the tablet we
only need a front camera
for video calls for photos or videos we
use either our smart phones or our
digital cameras which capture better
images than the iPad Mini can secondary
reason is that the absence of a camera
also lowers the cost we are not willing
to pay extra for a hardware feature that
we don't need or that we only use once
in a blue moon but the bad camera on the
iPad Mini can be very handy during video
calls especially when you want to switch
to the bad camera so you can show what's
in front of you so on the iPad Mini you
have two cameras for use on the Kindle
Fire HD you have only one as for
multimedia playback both tablets play
high definition videos excellently and
fluidly the Amazon tablets video player
gives you only basic playback controls
on the iPad Mini you get a film strip of
scenes that you can tap to jump forward
or backward sounds from the loudspeakers
are quite good though I lean more
towards the richer based on the iPad
Mini the Kindle Fire HD has an option
for Dolby Digital Plus to enable
surround sound and improve audio quality
greatly as for the software on the rest
of the user interface it's a huge
elephant of a discussion so let's just
have an overview of some of the
highlights the Kindle Fire HD is an
Android tablet in fact it is reading
android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich though
Amazon has altered the user interface
drastically to make access to Amazon's
online stores easier and more mobile the
template is primarily meant for use with
an Amazon account and makes it easier
for you to switch between PC and tablet
using only one Amazon account even
before you unlock the tablet you'll be
met with ads from Amazon partners the
ads look nice though but if you want out
give Amazon $15 the help screen itself
is optimized for quick access to digital
products and content from Amazon this
strip of links here is your gateway to
Amazon products and services let's see
what happens when you tap a link here's
the book screen it's arranged in some
sort of grid that looks like shelves you
can see the book stored in your cloud
account or books that you have on your
device
this link here opens the Amazon book
store so you can shop for more books
let's go back to the home screen this
carousel here shows icons of your most
recently opened apps you can swipe to
the left to view them depending on
what's in focus on the carousel this
dynamic bar here also changes the star
here opens your favorites panel
notifications can be viewed by pulling
down the notification menu but the
Android notification menu on Kindle Fire
HD allows you to dismiss notifications
one by one or dismiss all notifications
at once toggle buttons are also
available here and this plus sign here
brings you to the settings menu as you
can see the Kindle Fire HD interface is
deeply integrated with Amazon stores and
services the interface is quite easy to
use too let's now turn to the iPad Mini
a default operating system is iOS 6
like all other Apple products this
tablet is also integrated with Apple
services in fact you will need an Apple
ID to be able to use the tablet and
access Apple services unlike on the
Kindle Fire HD the Apple tablets lock
screen does not show at it can even run
a slideshow of the photos in your
gallery through this picture frame
button here the home screen is a simple
grid of app icons Apple wants you to be
able to access your apps right away so
this interface is perfect for that
compared to the black themed Kindle Fire
HD home screen this home screen gives
you more colors since some degree of
personalization at the bottom is a 3d
dot for your favorite app shortcuts just
long tap on an app icon until the icons
wiggle and drag the icon to the dock you
can also move app icons around for music
and video purchases your one and only
source is iTunes
for books you have iBooks
for apps your one and only source is the
App Store you can't install third-party
apps on this tablet and like on the
Kindle Fire HD which does let you side
load third-party apps one of Apple stars
is Siri a voice-activated virtual
assistant the Kindle Fire doesn't have a
similar assistant you can talk to Siri
if you're bored or lonely and Siri will
respond to you you can instruct Siri to
search for info compose an email and do
other tasks you can even dictate
messages for Siri to convert to text
another thing that makes the iPad many
more likeable than the Kindle Fire HD is
its keyboard the Amazon tablet provides
a very simple functional keyboard
although with strong word prediction and
spelling correction though the keys are
easy to reach for the thumbs
the iPad Mini allows you to split the
keyboard so the keys are closer to your
thumbs then typing that's a very good
interface decision on the iPad Mini like
the Kindle Fire HD the iPad Mini also
has a pulldown Notification Center it's
simple and efficient notifications are
grouped according to app on the Kindle
Fire HD you can flick individual
notifications to the side to dismiss
them you can't do that on the iPad Mini
you can't even dismiss all notifications
at once on the iPad Mini on the Kindle
tablet you can as for security features
both tablets allow you to log down your
tablet with numeric or alphanumeric
passwords you can also set restrictions
to what tablet features and apps can be
accessed the iPad Mini however has a
security feature that the Kindle Fire HD
doesn't it's called a fine iPhone app
which allows you to locate lock and wipe
your iPad Mini if you lose it there is
no denying that both the iPad Mini and
the Kindle Fire HD have an edge over
each other depending on the consumer
base you're looking at for those who
fancy themselves stylish the iPad Mini
won't fail to deliver with its 5
megapixel back camera solid but classy
design and slightly flexible but
efficient interface if you want to fully
utilize your Amazon subscription the
Kindle Fire HD is a handy device that
will provide the ease of access you need
while you're away from your computer it
is also a cost-effective alternative if
you don't want to buy a laptop or
netbook just to access Amazon or go
online which of these tablets are you

Kindle Fire HD share your thoughts in
