a huge impact on streaming media to your
TV for $30 you can easily cast your
content and control it right from your
mobile device Amazon has seen Google's
success and is ready to step up to the
plate and take on Google for your living
room Amazon's weapon of choice is the
fire TV we'll put them head-to-head and
will determine which one is the best for
you the Amazon fire TV was released in
early April 2014 this is about eight
months after the chromecast Amazon has
had a lot of time to see where the
chromecast excels and also where it
lacks Amazon took the set-top box
approach versus a dongle you plug the
fire TV into the HDMI dropping the power
cord and you're ready to go
the initial boot up is quick because you
already logged into your Amazon account
any Amazon Prime video purchases and
active Reynolds are all ready to be
watched within a few moments from the
interface the chromecast is a simple
dongle it's less than three inches long
and it's designed to just play your
media set up on the Google chromecast is
a quick one as well although a may not
be as quick as the fire TV you just plug
in your HDMI into your TV plug the USB
cable for power and then switch to the
correct input now on the screen just
follow a few more directions like typing
in your network password and within five
minutes you're up and running the fire
TV at launch has support for over 30
applications all the big players but HBO
was at the party
we have Netflix Showtime Hulu crackle
vie mole and the list goes on unlike the
chromecast the fire TV actually plays 3d
games accord Amazon there is over a
hundred games and thousands more are
coming some of the games that are worth
mentioning our asphalt 8 Riptide GP and
also the pixelated heroes for Minecraft
performance-wise it's comparable to a
high-end Android smartphone you can also
buy additional gaming controller or with
some games you can use the remote that
comes with the fire TV if you currently
use Amazon Prime as your means of
accessing media whether it's their cloud
music offering or photos they really
make it easy to access that stuff
and it's fast it eventually becomes
pre-cached to the box as well because
once you click the file it opens with
little delay this applies to video too
and this feature is called ASAP it
predicts what you're going to watch next
by your viewing habits then it downloads
it to your fire TV without user
interaction also if you own a Kindle
Fire you can push any Amazon media
directly to your fire TV just by
flicking it over all the programs I
mentioned are downloadable from the
dashboard you can easily use the menu to
navigate to the application or you can
simply use a voice search for it once
you're in the application the normal
functionality from the fire TV is now
gone you are locked down to this
applications rules and just like any
other platform when pressing the menu
button depending on which application
you get a different result in some
applications I can press on the menu
button and change the aspect ratio
however other applications you can and
also the voice search does not work in
all applications only a few are
supported the chromecast at launch had
very limited application support Google
Play Music movies Netflix Chrome and
YouTube it took about six months for
them to open up the SDK and once that
happened the floodgates opened up new
applications are adding support for
chromecast daily and since there are
normal Play Store applications updates
can be pushed out at a regular basis you
launch these applications from your
phone or tablet and then there is a new
icon on the screen this icon signifies
that it works with chromecast the fire
TV is pre-configured to your Amazon
account the interface is quick fluid and
downright pretty it really looks just
like the Kindle Fire and just like other
companies they're trying to make one
interface for all their devices from the
home screen you can do a voice search
for an actor director movie title or
even an application and this concept
seems great and it works good for the
most part and as I mentioned earlier the
voice search does not integrate to all
applications for example if I want to
continue to watch house of cards via
Netflix I do a voice search and it takes
me to a house of cards on prime to rent
it versus where I left off on Netflix it
creates inconsistencies within the
Experian
and thus some time creates frustrations
sometimes you find yourself cycling
through videos to find what you are
looking for because the voice search is
not working for that application there's
also no way to pin items as well and
sometimes it leaves you flipping and
scrolling to get to that thing you just
watched a few moments ago with the
chromecast you are using your host
device to control the media for example
you open an application connect to the
chromecast and then from there you can
simply play your media it launches on
your TV and then you can adjust the
volume play pause skim all through your
mobile device I'll sum it up like this
if you're the type of person that always
has their phone on you and you want to
stream your media to your TV and
chromecast will work best for you if
you're looking for entertainment system
and something for the family then the
fire TV is the best option for you if
you don't have a Prime membership the
experience is not as fluid it's not as
quick but it's still a pretty decent one
while I was in the middle of editing
this video there's a few more points
that I thought I should bring up the
first point is in the video you'll see
that when I'm casting to my chromecast I
have an option to cast to the fire TV
well that is correct you can actually
cast in a fire TV but the only thing
that it does it actually launched the
application and then a request for you
to link the account with the fire TV
once you link the account then it does
work sort of like a chromecast except
for it is not as fluid and it's a little
bit clunky and it just really has some
bugs that it needs to iron out but it is
possible to catch to it directly from
your phone and also when it comes to
gaming some games require the controller
and some games do not you can actually
use the remote as your controller it
actually works pretty good for the games
that I tested on now some of the games
like the first-person shooters do
require for you to go out and purchase
that controller and so there it is that
was the Google chromecast versus the
Amazon fire TV now as always I just give
you the information and from there you
need to make a decision on which one
works best for you both of these have
their pros and they both actually have
their cons so it's up to you to make the
form decision on which one you want to
purchase and when you figure out which
one you already purchased all the one
you already have going to leave it down
below
we would love to check it out and while
