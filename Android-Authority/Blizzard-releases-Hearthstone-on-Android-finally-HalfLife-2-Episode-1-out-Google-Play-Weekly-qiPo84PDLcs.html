brought to you by Norton security hello
again ladies and gentleman I'm Joe Hindy
the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly first
up this week Plex released a huge update
with a lot of new features it really is
quite the impressive update and includes
support for playlists bigger playback
notifications improved queues better
category management and a whole lot more
including bug fixes and performance
improvements if you use plex this is an
update you do not want to miss and it's
rolling out right now Nvidia released
half-life 2 episode 1 but only for the
Nvidia shield tablet this is both great
news and bad news it's great news
because it's a half-life game and having
it on android only makes the platform
better unfortunately the only people who
can play it or those with the Nvidia
shield tablet and the shield tablet
controller and that's the bad news so
far the reports are that the game runs
great and looks gorgeous google has
updated Google Docs sheets and slides
with some enhanced editing features all
three applications will now play nicer
with microsoft office files which is
always a big plus each app also received
a few individual tweaks to improve
editing and formatting such as google
docs new line spacing controls and
sheets now has scroll bars for faster
navigation it's a big update and worth
checking out if you use all three
speaking of Google they have updated
google now with support for Google Drive
and nest thermostats the integration of
google drive seems to be pretty basic
but still very welcome you can now
search for documents in your google
drive with voice commands in google now
along with that they've added
functionality to control your nest
thermostat with Google now there have
been some small issues with connecting
the nest so far but we imagine that
those will be ironed out soon enough
their last bit of news this week
Blizzard has finally released her stone
for Android but only for Android tablets
we kind of knew months in advance that
the game would only be released on
tablets initially so there are no
surprises there the size limit for this
version is six inches so if you have a
phone or a tablet that is larger than
that you should be good to go blizzards
soon to be hit card game has been long
awaited by us android users and word is
that a phone version is in the works and
will be here eventually suppose to see
some trending applications as usual if
you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the
your description below first up this
week is swiftkey keyboard they have been
super busy over this holiday season and
they continue to be they have released
some new themes inspired by the Disney
movie frozen there are a total of six
teams and they are essentially ice blue
keyboards that also display your
favorite characters from the movie given
that it's winter in the Northern
Hemisphere at least it's a good fun and
relatively cheap way to decorate for the
season if you're really into getting
into the holiday spirit Christmas and HD
is a newer live wallpaper that will help
you out with that it features parallax
effects lens blur effects and some
seriously gorgeous Christmas scenery
there is a free version and a paid
version and perhaps the best part about
both of them is it neither of them use
any permissions it's a great way to
theme your device for the holidays
SimCity build-it brings you back to the
classic days of SimCity but with
arguably better graphics this last week
they released a sizable update that
includes better support for
international play any range of bug
fixes and performance improvements if
you enjoy the original sim city of the
olden days you'll probably enjoy this
title as well and it's free to play with
in app purchases Baldur's Gate 2 has
been released on android and old-school
PC RPG fans rejoiced the controls and
graphics are about the same as they were
on the original Baldur's Gate which was
released for android earlier this year
so if you've been playing that one this
one should have a similar look and feel
the game also includes all the
expansions and some extra non-game
content you can purchase through in-app
purchases last up this week is
pushbullet the app allows you to see
your phone notifications on your PC and
it also allows you to send things
between your devices easily and reply to
texts the latest update now allows you
to use quick actions so you can do
things like archive emails in gmail or
snooze your alarm and do pretty much
whatever you can do with quick actions
on your device the best part is the app
remains free if you want to check out
