android authority channel for years acer
has been trying to make inroads into the
android phones market early this year
the world famous maker of laptops and
netbooks released into the Asian and
European markets its mid-range dual core
android phone the acer liquid e1 will
this be the phone that finally brings
acer into the same league as bigwigs
like samsung and HTC sit back watch the
rest of this video and find out the
liquid e1 caught my attention primarily
because of its compact size and shape
which leans towards roundish at a time
when android phones are usually straight
edged and rectangular with slightly
rounded corners small pocketable and
light the e1 is comfortable to hold for
one-handed use with a little effort my
thumb can easily reach the farthest
corner of the touch screen the touch
panel is surrounded by a hard plastic
frame at the top side sandwiched between
the frame and touch panel edge as the
phone speaker grill at the opposite side
on the bottom is the phone mic looking
at the front and sides of the phone I
can generally say that this is a brain
design yet I also personally feel that
the phone may benefit more aesthetically
without the plastic frame let's take a
look at the back it's actually pretty
but they find it a little bit
overcrowded the round grills at the top
and bottom are for the stereo
loudspeakers acer wants us to know
they're sure that this phone sound
system uses DTS technology which is
another way of saying you can expect
audio to be awesome this part here
obviously is the camera lens and flash
with a small microphone hole to the ring
and down here is the metallic acer logo
embossed right in the middle of what
seems to be a hyperbola of dimpling dots
to a swiss credit this back plate is
removable and feels very sturdy to
acer's discredit however the backplate
that my unit came with a perfectly
fitting back plate which no longer
snapped tightly onto place after just a
few removals the NFC chip is embedded
onto the back covers underside there's a
slot for a standard mini sim and for
micro SD card expansion for up to thirty
two gigabytes more storage another plus
point
for this phone is the removable
lithium-ion 1760 mah battery this has
enough juice to power the phone for
about 8 to 12 hours of moderate use now
let's turn our attention to the screen
and display this is not an HD phone it
only has qHD resolution or 960 x 540
pixels on a 4.5 inch IPS LCD screen
which practically gives it an effective
pixel density of 245 PPI so you can
expect the display to be crisp and sharp
enough to be pleasant I know this
vertical striping in the display perhaps
it may not be noticeable to most people
it may not even be a big deal to most
people but for a sophisticated and
diehard Android with a trained eye
this could be a big turnoff the good
news however is that the phone's display
lives up to its liquid name in terms of
snappiness and fluidity the touchscreen
is responsive enough and scrolling
through home screens as smooth enough
web browsing is functional at best
whichever the two default browsers I use
either stock Android browser or Google
Chrome the phone seems to gasp for
breath when rendering webpages and when
zooming in or out it's not a jitter for
you right across the web on this phone
the smoothness along with a jitter here
and there can be attributed primarily to
the phones processing capability the
liquid e1 is powered by a dual-core
mediatek mt6577 cpu power VRS GX 531 GPU
one gigabyte of ram and 4 gigabytes of
internal storage don't worry though app
launching is rather quick and playing HD
games such as cut the rope time travel
HD won't make your phone choke apart
from that the phone's connectivity
features include Wi-Fi Near Field
Communication bluetooth 3.0 a micro USB
port and a stereo headphone port though
armed with dual stereo loudspeakers the
liquid e1 may not be a wise choice for
hardcore media production and
consumption but it does have enough
muscle for anyone to enjoy the basic
pleasures of multimedia that you wants
five megapixel camera for instance is a
snappy shooter it's not exactly zero
shutter lag but the shutter speed is
quite fast the camera can use several of
shooting modes several scene modes and
several image sizes for both photo and
video don't expect photo quality to be
visually stunning but you can trust the
camera to get the job
I tried playing HD and full HD videos on
the e1 and the phone was able to play
them but not without some noticeable lag
or pixelation or screen artifacts
standard definition videos though
playback smoothly audio quality is quite
amazing thanks to DTS technology and the
dual stereo speakers at the back but to
better enjoy the crisp and pleasurable
audio you might want to plug in those
headphones one of the endearing things
that I love about this phone is the fact
that it is not heavily modded or heavily
skinned acer you I 5.0 is a simple and
easy.you I powered by Android 4.1 point
one jellybean underneath the lockscreen
animation and stuff it's a testimony to
the simplicity of the UI no fancy
repulsor metal rings or light clouds
just a vertical blinds effect I like the
toggle buttons on the notification shade
I also like the feature for scheduling
went to power on or power off the phone
quite useful for those who want to turn
off their phones at night when they
sleep the feature known as float collar
also seems quite useful it pops up an
interactive alert box for incoming calls
instead of opening the phone app and
blocking whatever is on your screen acer
UI is also customizable via the my style
app which lets you choose wallpapers
including videos it can customize your
lock screen shortcuts your ringtones
notification alerts and volume levels it
even lets you choose amazing transition
animations and settings for your home
screen my favorites are flip and cube
the acer liquid e1 isn't exactly a WoW
phone but it's not exactly a so-so phone
either it has its shortcomings but it is
not made purely of shortcomings either
as a mid-range phone it does the job
well enough for me to give it a pat on
the back it has good looks a sturdy
design a fairly fast hardware
configuration coupled with software and
you I'm complimenting the phone's
hardware muscle and all the basics for
enjoying multimedia yet the flip side of
all this is that liquid e1 will never
satisfy anyone who yearns for more
Android power and more smartphone
performance what about you what do you
like or dislike about the acer liquid e1
would you consider buying the acer
