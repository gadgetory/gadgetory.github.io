pain all too well you get a brand new
game console like say the ps4 on let's
say Black Friday and even though it is
the holiday season you don't really have
a whole lot of time to play that new
console and your brand new games for one
particular reason the TV is always taken
well there should be a solution for it
and now that I have my ps4 I can finally
show you one and I think it's really
great it's Joshua regard from Android
Authority what's going on everybody and
finally it's time for me to show you the
ps4 remote play capabilities along with
the Sony game control mount for the Sony
Xperia c3 all right here we are with the
game control mount for the Sony Xperia
z3 line but can also be used for the z2
smartphones and also the z3 tablet
compact also it can be used for the
Xperia z3 V for Verizon because that is
where I was able to get this mount
widely you won't be able to get the game
control mount until later in December
Sochi on places like Amazon or anywhere
else like that I actually had to order
this straight from Verizon because they
had it available for the z3 TV which was
released not too long ago but the box
contents basically had just this mount
and a small booklet of instructions and
essentially it's just a clasp but that
will go around the DualShock 4
controller quite easily as so it'll just
snap right on and once you're through
with that this suction cup up here will
allow you to mount the actual phone to
the controller pushing up on this little
lever on the back in order to really get
it firmly onto there the angle can be
adjusted but for the most part you're
probably just gonna have it right
straight ahead like this as far as
playing actual games goes streaming ps4
games that is you actually won't be
using the PlayStation application as you
can see is already pre-installed on
there but instead you'll be downloading
an app called remote play that has the
ps4 icon right over there once you have
it clicked and you have it set up you
should have your ps4 already connected
to your Wi-Fi in your network at home or
wherever you may be but I strongly
recommend that your ps4 be connected via
Ethernet to your router in order to get
the maximum speed that you can give it
that way when you do Wi-Fi to the actual
phone and it will be able to stream to
the phone you can get the best type of
connection possible you should have your
phone obviously connected to your Wi-Fi
as well and once they're both on the
same network they'll be able to find one
another also the pairing of the
DualShock for to the phone will happen
around this time essentially what will
happen is you're just going to hold the
PlayStation button right here and the
share button together until a white bar
appears on the top where the LED is and
it's there that the Bluetooth will pair
to the phone and then it will be used
for a remote play now after you do the
initial connection with the ps4 all
other times that you do so should be
pretty quick and you'll see that it is
going to check the connection
environment and then the screen of the
actual ps4 itself will appear on your
phone screen and it's from there that
you can use the ds4 controller and just
go through all of the elements of your
ps4 and you're really going to notice
right away I might not have the best
connection possible to be able to get
very very low or close to no latency on
my connection to the ps4 but for the
most part it actually works just about
the way that it should certain games
like Call of Duty or any shooter games
like destiny might be kind of tough to
play on here
I actually am playing WWE 2k15 quite a
lot using Remote Play and I'm going to
demonstrate a little bit of it in a bit
but being able to get timely counters
off or in first-person shooters being
able to aim properly at a rate that
allows you to be successful in it it's
not quite the same the latency just is
maybe like a quarter of a second late
especially if you have even when you
have an ideal connection but for the
most part I've been having a great time
on this especially when the TV like you
saw in the intro was already taken and
the best part about this you could take
it wherever you want and I'm ready
inside of the game right now
Hey
the ditch
get back to his fate
at this
Cena stays alive at a roundhouse kick
 let me do it Cena may be finished
but singling time to go to sleep and
talk to be closing in on the
championship see
so I just wanted to give you guys a
quick look at the capabilities of ps4
remote play but mostly give you a quick
review of the game control mount for the
Sony Xperia z3 as you can see I have it
on here still and I just got done with a
match in WWE 2k15 it is a very nice
amount to use and you can see back there
you have the suction cup that's keeping
the phone right there obviously you have
the screen on time to contend with when
it comes to the z3 and around four or
five hours you're probably going to conk
out so you won't be able to play for too
long but you can always plug it back in
using the micro USB charging port and
continue playing but ultimately as you
can see back there TV's still taken up
but I'm still enjoying my ps4 right here
like I said in the previous segment the
the latency does provide a few issues
when it comes to the particular games
where you need to be very timely mostly
first-person shooters and in the case of
WWE 2k15 getting off the right types of
counters and the right timing for them
but for the most part it's really fun to
use and it provides another way for you
to enjoy the XIII aside from it just
being one of the best smartphones that
Sony has put out as far as the game
control now goes it does provide some
top-heavy weight to the ds4 controller
right here but it's not really too much
and for the most part unless you're
playing maybe at a certain angle you're
not going to have that much trouble
having fun on the mount using the mount
in order to enjoy your games and it also
doesn't get in the way of any of the
buttons that are on the controller
itself you can see Ash's review of the
z3 tablet compact over on the side
the only gripe that I might have with
the Xperia z3 is that it's a little bit
small for playing ps4 games certain
games you might need to squint just to
be able to see what is going on and with
the z3 tablet compact and that larger
screen you might have a better time with
that so keep it tuned here watch their
videos the z3 tablet compact is over on
the side and don't forget to drop us in
