brought to you by domain.com do you know
what Motorola is like right now Motorola
is a little bit like the pretty girl
next door who says hey handsome boy when
you're done with the flashy expensive
cheerleader come on by next door and
I'll give you more options now to
intelligently make the argument I'm
going to make today we need to define
the nebulous term user experience now
wiki calls it the overall experience of
a person using a product such as a
website or computer application
especially in terms of how easy or
pleasing it is to use in 2013 Motorola
began down a very different path from
its rivals with the original moto x
foregoing the spec race in favor of
focusing on user experience first and
foremost that meant clean non bloated
software that had a few meaningful
additions but ultimately kept to a near
stock look and feel it also meant more
customization options so people could
have their phones better express their
own style here's the problem though
although the strategy can work and it
certainly has for Motorola most users
don't go into a retail store saying hey
I'm looking for a phone with a better
user experience people tend to be
motivated by more instinctual things
like a thinner phone a sexier phone that
cool fingerprint scanner but if you can
finally get with the proverbial girl
next door you end up being much more
loyal in the long run and I think
Motorola knew this when they aim to
reinvent the budget space with the debut
of the Moto G up until that point most
handsets that were affordable sub two
hundred fifty dollars were cheap garbage
that made major concessions on hardware
software and design the Moto G showed
you you could still provide an excellent
Android experience with reasonable solid
specs and yet off right at a price tag
that wouldn't break the bank for most
consumers you see now that's a
compelling pitch what can a
six-hundred-dollar flagship phone do
that the Moto G can't not a whole lot so
now I know what you're thinking is this
whole new emphasis on user experience
actually making Motorola cheddar yes
according to an earnings report released
by parent company lenovo Motorola sold
about 10 million smartphones during the
same quarter
last year now it doesn't specify which
smartphones sold exactly though it is
safe to say that moto G was probably
responsible for most of those sales now
it's even more impressive is that this
is more than a hundred percent growth
from the same quarter of 2013 so what
can we expect from Motorola and other
manufacturers for the rest of 2015 it
seems that OMS are finally starting to
get it user experience is king the two
biggest examples are LG and Samsung for
samsung the galaxy s6 was an opportunity
to reinvent themselves giving users a
more premium flagship and also providing
the option of both curved and standard
screen models with aesthetics being the
biggest difference between the two even
more important than the design Samsung
worked hard to optimize its software
surprising much of the world by ditching
many of its own apps and services to
provide the cleanest version of TouchWiz
to date turning to the LG g4 you'll find
leather and plastic covers and multiple
colors making it easier for customers to
choose the LG g4 that best represents
their style you'll also find that LG
chose the more modest snapdragon 808
over the 810 and worked with qualcomm to
optimize this experience so it actually
performs smoother than the 810 powered
LG G flex 2 one shared aspect where both
manufacturers improve the user
experience was the camera both improving
the software and hardware to ensure an
optimal photo and video taking
experience curiously enough that's one
area in the user experience where
Motorola has been less than impressive
but let's just take a moment in key code
on the rumors surrounding the Moto X
2015 the new spec rumors come by way of
gadgets portal the specs claim will see
a snapdragon 808 processor 4 gigabytes
of ram a 5.2 inch qhd display a 5
megapixel front-facing camera and a 16
megapixel rear facing camera and a
massive 3280 milliamp hour battery you
see the bottom line is that phone
manufacturers don't just want you to buy
their phone they want you to buy their
phone again and again and again over the
next 10 years so my question to you is
have the manufacturer earned that level
of loyalty with you yet will you buy a
samsung galaxy phone for the next 5-10
years I know I'm not there yet are you
