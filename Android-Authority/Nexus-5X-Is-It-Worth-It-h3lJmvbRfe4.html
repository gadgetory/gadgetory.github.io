domain.com so you've got a budget of
around 400 bucks give or take and you're
thinking about getting the nexus 5x but
is it worth it if you felt the Nexus 6
was a bit too expensive and it looks
like many people did then you might be
excited about the pricing of the Nexus
5x it starts at just three hundred and
seventy nine dollars for the 16 gigabyte
version and has a pretty enticing set of
specs but does it compare to the value
for money that the original Nexus 5
represented two years ago the market has
moved on since then and prices have
fallen and the Nexus 5 was originally
offered at $349 is the Nexus 5x a good
deal well first let's talk about why it
might be the first standout feature of
the Nexus 5x both figuratively and
literally is the twelve point three
megapixel main camera Google knew it had
to work on this front one of the biggest
disappointments around the Nexus 5
original was the performance of the 8
megapixel camera and it looks as though
the 5x is going to be capable of
capturing quality shots and it needs to
be the front facing camera has also been
overhauled in the wake of a selfie mania
that's currently going on and it's rated
at 5 megapixel undoubtedly a massive
improvement over the over 1.3 megapixel
effort of its predecessor Nexus imprint
is the other thing that immediately
jumps out about the 5x a conveniently
placed fingerprint sensor on the back of
the phone under the camera is a smart
move unless awkward to use than the
one-handed traditional home button
placement it only requires a single
touch and looks lightning-fast
the hexa core Snapdragon 808 back by 2
gigabytes of RAM looks a little
lightweight compared to current
flagships storage options are the same
16 or 32 gigabytes for most people 16
gigabytes isn't going to be enough in a
long term but an extra 16 gigabytes only
cost 50 bucks and there's no micro SD
card slot 429 dollars in total is
relatively cheap but it's not a special
price when you look at what's out there
the battery is a respectable twenty
seven hundred million powers and
non-removable now let's talk about the
compromises there are a couple of sublet
disappointing compromises in the Nexus
5x wireless charging support has been
dropped
Google has gone all-in with the USB
type-c instead it's reversible so it
should be much easier to plug in but for
anyone used to wireless charging it's
still going to feel like a step back now
let's compare the 5x with its
competitors with regards to price the
Asus zenfone 2 is only 300 bucks and it
manages to pack a 5.5 inch display with
2.3 gigahertz quad-core processor and 4
gigabytes RAM the oneplus 2 starts at
$329 and has an octa-core processor more
RAM a bigger battery USB type-c support
and a fingerprint sensor you could pick
up an LG g3 for around 330 bucks right
now with a 5.5 inch 2560 by 1440 pixel
display even though moto x style pure is
only $400 and boast a 5.7 inch display
and a 21 megapixel camera just take a
moment for some historical context two
years ago in November the Nexus 5
original was released and it was
groundbreaking
it makes diddy with excitement why it
had a great system on a chip a great GPU
it was flagship power for 350 bucks it
got a lot of people excited so you
understand there was a lot of high hopes
for the 5 X now the 5x is still a great
deal it really is if you like that form
factor when you like that size and you
love vanilla Android it's still a great
deal it's just not quite the kick geeks
