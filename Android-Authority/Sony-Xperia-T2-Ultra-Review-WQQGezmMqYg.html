Android Authority and the competition in
the mid-range game has never been
tougher and Sony is looking to get in on
the action with their successor to the
Xperia T from last year it's a monstrous
size phone that's packing quite the
punch at least on paper but does it
actually deliver let's take a look at
the Sony Xperia t2 ultra so let's start
this off with a unboxing because I know
many of you will be curious as to what
this phone comes bundled with but there
weren't any real surprises here inside
the box is your standard reading
materials microUSB cable with a wall
adapter and a pair of white earbuds that
actually look pretty decent but here is
the star of the show they Xperia t2
ultra and if you're paying attention to
Sony for the last couple of years or so
the design of the t2 ultra is what you
sort of come to expect from Sony it's a
rectangular slab with very sharp angles
so it doesn't deviate whatsoever from
previous Sony devices that we've seen
the design isn't necessarily my favorite
as I tend to prefer my phones to have a
little bit more curvature to them but I
can understand why many people find
Sony's design appealing as it is very
simple and streamlined the phone is a
unibody design entirely made of plastic
that doesn't feel cheap but the back of
the phone is glossy making it a
fingerprint magnet it's not so bad on
the white model but fingerprints and
smudges will most likely be easy to see
on the black version regardless you'll
probably be cleaning your phone quite
frequently it is a large phone if you
couldn't tell by the Ultra name and when
I say large I'm talking phablet
territory as a completely Dwarfs phones
like the Nexus 5 and the Samsung Galaxy
s5 despite its size it doesn't feel
heavy which is partly due to its all
plastic construction and it's also pre
thin at 7.7 millimeters making the phone
a little bit easier to handle all the
ports and buttons are located on the
sides of the device with nothing on top
and bottom which made using the t2 ultra
while charging or listening to music
feel very awkward but on the left is a
microUSB port and a micro SD card slot
right below that supports up to 32 gigs
following along to the right side is a
3.5 millimeter headset jack a micro SIM
card slot sony signature power but
with volume rockers right below and a
dedicated camera key which you don't see
very often on Android devices while the
phone itself feels very sturdy and
well-made the buttons on the other hand
feel cheap they wiggle and the feedback
is extremely mushy especially with the
camera key and the microSD card and SIM
slot are both covered by flaps but this
phone is not dust proof or water
resistant like many of Sony's other
phones so the flaps are really just
there for aesthetics on the back of the
phone right below the Xperia logo is a
single slit speaker and it's loud and
sounds quite good but the placement on
the back makes it very easy to cover up
especially when watching videos or
playing games and landscape and even
having the phone sitting on a table will
cause the sound to be muffled flipping
around to the front is the biggest
reason why this phone carries the Ultra
name and that is the 6-inch display
coming in at 720p resolution it's not
the most pixel dense display so if
you're a pixel junkie you might not be
satisfied but I personally had no
problems with it if you look close
enough you will notice jaggies
especially on text when browsing the web
but the display itself is very bright
vivid with great colour reproduction and
viewing angles the only other thing that
I really notice is despite how bright
the display gets it's a little difficult
to see outdoors especially when looking
at it off axis but that's a relatively
minor complaint to an otherwise
great-looking display and while some
people might find a 6-inch display to be
too large there's no denying that it
makes for a great multimedia experience
whether it's browsing the web watching
movies or playing games on the inside
the t2 ultra is being powered by a
Snapdragon 400 processor clocked at 1.4
gigahertz
with one gigabyte of RAM and Adreno 305
GPU and eight gigs of internal storage
of which only four gigs are actually
usable meaning you'll run out of storage
quickly without a microSD card in
day-to-day usage I do notice some lag
when opening apps and even scrolling
through home screens will result in some
dropped frames but it wasn't enough to
cause any frustration or break my
overall experience gaming is also very
solid even with the audrina 305 GPU as I
was able to play all my favorite games
of the moment like clash of clans dead
trigger 2 and Shadowgun deadzone without
issues and like I mentioned earlier it's
even more enjoyable on a 6-inch display
on the back of the t2 ultra is the 13
megapixel camera that utilizes Sony's
Exmor RS sensor and it's the same
experience that can be found on other
Sony phones with all the same shooting
modes like superior auto background
defocus AR effect timeshift burst and
several others the difference tuning
modes like AR effect make this camera
quite fun to play and experiment with
but if you just want to take
great-looking shots just put it on
superior auto and let the camera do the
rest you can take photos using the dual
stage camera key or the on-screen
shutter but I found myself doing the
latter the picture quality is rather
impressive as the photos came out
looking very sharp with accurate colors
even in low-light situations with very
little noise but the biggest drawback
with superior auto is that it maxes out
at nine megapixel resolution not that
nine megapixels is bad as there still
plenty of detail but if you want to take
13 megapixel photos you'll have to
switch to manual mode which
unfortunately changes the aspect ratio
to 4 by 3 so as you're looking through
these photos the 9 megapixel photos are
16 by 9 whereas the 13 megapixel photos
are 4 by 3 the shutter speed is a little
slow for my liking but for the most part
this camera does a great job and is very
fun to use also great is the battery as
the t2 ultra is packing a 3000 milliamp
hour battery and I got ridiculous
battery life on this thing on my second
day I got over 18 hours off the charger
which doesn't sound like a whole lot but
my screen on time was a little bit over
6 and a half hours which to me was just
insane and that just goes to show you
how much I was actually using this phone
and even with pretty heavy usage of only
12 hours off the charger I still managed
to pull in five hours of screen on time
so I'm pretty impressed with the battery
life to say the least and I think with
moderate usage you can easily get at
least two days out of this phone before
having to recharge on the software side
of things the t2 ultra is running on
Android 4.3 jelly bean so hopefully
we'll see an update to KitKat soon which
could alleviate some of the performance
issues but on top of Android is Sony's
Xperia UI that comes with their usual
slew of apps like walkman PlayStation
mobile
and Sony select but they don't
necessarily feel like bloat Sony does a
great job of adding their own personal
touches to Android while leaving the
core Android experience intact and
personally I think the Xperia UI is one
of the better skins out there as it's
not very intrusive there's no denying
that the t2 ultra is a big device and
Sony knows it so they've included some
very welcome features to make one-handed
use a little bit easier like the
centralized dialer that makes it easier
to dial a phone number without having to
reach across the other side of the
display the keyboard that can be offset
to either the left or the right and my
favorite feature which lets you pull
down the notification shade just by
simply double tapping the home button
you can also multitask with Sony's small
apps from the recent apps menu I'll be
it with a very limited amount of apps
but it's great if you want to be able to
browse the web check emails or do some
quick calculations without leaving
whatever it is that you're currently
doing the t2 ultra isn't targeted for
the United States but if you're inside
the US looking to get one for yourself
there is one thing to be aware of and
that is the different model numbers they
all support HSPA+ and LTE but only one
has support for US carriers the one that
I have is the 5303 but there's also the
53 22 which is the same thing except
with dual-sim capabilities both of these
can be found for roughly 380 to 420
dollars depending on where you look the
one that most people will probably want
to get is the 50 306 which supports both
t-mobile and 18 T in the United States
but it's a little bit harder to find and
so far I've only managed to find it for
$650 from one retailer and at that price
you're better off buying a high-end
flagship device alternatively there are
other options out there like the htc
desire 816 that I previously reviewed
which offers almost identical specs to
the t2 ultra at a very competitive price
and if you saw my review for that phone
you'll know that I really liked it
because it offered a very high-end
experience for a supposedly mid-range
phone but there you have it for the Sony
Xperia t2 ultra it's a mid-range phablet
with reasonable performance a great
camera and pretty awesome battery life
but whether or not this phone is worth
it to you might be dependent on
you live or how much you're willing to
shell out to get the connectivity
support especially inside the United
States
that's pretty much it hopefully you guys
