you by Harry's comm well it turns out
that Samsung is launching the W 2016
which is basically the galaxy s6 in the
body of a flip phone spotted earlier
this week in China's tena listings the
w16 has received a quiet official launch
but that's about the only quiet thing
about this flip phone which features a
decadent galaxy s6 inspired design and
it equally a rageous spec sheet now some
may call the W 2016 excessive but for
Samsung and presumably a certain
demographic group in Asia this dual
screen device makes total sense
just like the galaxy s6 the W 2016 comes
with a sculpted aluminum frame a curved
metal back and metallic accents even the
speaker perforations and the USB slot on
its bottom evokes Samsung's s6 coming in
gold or silver the device is rather
heavy at 204 grams it's also more than
15 millimeters thick when closed but
that's the price you need to pay for
this style not to mention the 23.9 inch
1280 by 768 AMOLED displays and a t9
numeric keypad other specs include an
Exynos 7420 processor 3 gigabytes of RAM
64 gigabytes of storage the rear camera
is 16 megapixels while the front is 5
megapixels the device runs the Chinese
version of Samsung's TouchWiz based on
android 5.1 lollipop
there's also wireless charging and a
2,000 milliamp hour battery and dual SIM
LTE now do you guys remember the del
dude dude you're getting in there you're
getting Adele easy to buy easy to own
easy as Dell dude you're getting a Dell
now some of you may be too young to
understand what that really meant but it
was super super popular in the 90s Adele
represented a high end somewhat
customizable laptop or desktop that you
could order by telephone you could just
call up and say hey I want these
components these components these
components send it to me imagine if you
could do this now you could call up
Samsung and say hey I want a room
battery I went this much storage I went
this size of screen that would be a
geeks paradise right well Dell Michael
Dell the owner and co-founder of Dell
computers eventually had wild success
and sold to a big corporation and then
Dell kind of watered down their message
and now we don't know what Dell stands
for anymore I mean what are they about
they're just a generic computer
manufacturer and my worry is that
Samsung is going down that same road why
because they have the shotgun approach
throw everything against the kitchen
sink or but the kitchen sink and see
what sticks what do they represent I
mean this this w 2016 sounds interesting
but like what does it mean what is
Samsung stand for they had some great
success in the past year with the edged
galaxy s6 run with that choose one thing
and just run with it and be used that to
distinguish yourselves among all other
competitors maybe that's not the right
approach because they are so dominant in
the data in the android market maybe it
doesn't matter maybe they can do that
but I don't know I sort of feel like
dude you're starting to be a Dell what
do you guys think let me know in the
comments below and yes it is the month
