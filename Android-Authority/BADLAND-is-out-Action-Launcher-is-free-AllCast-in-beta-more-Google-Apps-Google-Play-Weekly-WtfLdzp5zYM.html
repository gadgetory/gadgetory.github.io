Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly in
this week's episode we're going to talk
about Google Apps updates Cal calendar
badland and Santa Claus without further
ado let's get started with those of our
viewers who celebrate Christmas google
has launched a website called Santa
tracker much like no ride and so site
that people can use to track Santa Claus
on Christmas e4 now only the website is
out however they are planning on
releasing an android app and adding
chromecast support it's not a big deal
we know and it's obviously aimed at kids
and families but it is really nice
seeing Google playing along if you're a
fan of the show you've no doubt heard us
talk about all cast all cast is an
application that lets you stream content
to your television it's been in
development for a while now and now it's
available to the public as a beta in
order to get it you have to sign up for
the beta in the Google Play Store and
join the signage in mod community and
you can find more info on how to do that
in the written companion in the video
description it doesn't have chromecast
support yet but it does support other
devices like Roku xbox 360 xbox one
samsung and Panasonic Smart TVs and many
others speaking of the chromecast one of
the features the chromecast users have
been asking for for quite some time is
plex support the bad news is plex
doesn't support it quite yet but the
good news is that it might happen soon
there has been no official word from
plex yet but some tech savvy people
managed to find a chromecast file in the
software's configuration file now this
may not be a significant as some may
think but it is a pretty good sign that
work is being done so don't get too
excited just yet but it is okay to get
you know a little excited google search
and google voice search saw an update
this last week in google search you can
now search for applications directly or
open info from the web in an application
if you have it on the voice search side
of things there is now support for
French German and Japanese so if you
speak those languages you can now use
them in google voice search the good
news is the changes server side and not
app side so you don't actually have to
update the application just change the
settings and you're ready to go while
we're on the subject of google apps
google play music and Google Play Movies
both got updated this last week Google
Play Movies now allows you to download
the standard definition video even if
you only bought the HD version so if you
have some storage concerns or a device
with an older screen you don't have to
pay for the same movie twice to get the
smaller file on the google play music
side of things you can now use the SD
card as the location
for your cash and downloaded songs this
is a big deal for SD card users as you
no longer have to worry about using your
primary storage also in the update where
some bug fixes and UI tweaks who wants
to see some trending applications as
usual if you want to try any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the written companion in the video
description action launcher was recently
updated to 2.1 when they came some
pretty dramatic and awesome changes
namely it's now free so there is
literally no reason for you not to check
it out anymore also included our android
4.4 theme elements and quick page which
is a full home screen that you can swipe
out from the right edge of the screen to
get to do yourself a favor and give this
one a shot cowboy any.do is probably the
most beautiful calendar app we've ever
seen and it has a lot of features to
boot so far it's received some pretty
good reviews from users and we do plan
on reviewing this app very soon to see
if all the hype is deserved if you don't
want to wait for that it is a free app
so there's no harm in trying it out
right now dead trigger 2 hasn't been out
for very long but madfinger games has
been actively working to make it even
better and a recent update zombies and
missions have been rebalanced for better
gameplay more missions have been added
and an upcoming update will add some fun
Christmas stuff so if you haven't yet
now is a perfect time to pick up dead
trigger 2 field trip is done by the same
people who did ingress so you know it's
already a good app it was recently
updated and included our new features
and a redesigned user interface among
the new features are simplified settings
swiping information cards accessing
items on the bottom bar and new
publisher previews if you need an app to
keep you company on long trips this is a
good one to keep with you last on our
list this week is a brand new
atmospheric side scroller called
Badlands and we literally can't say
enough good things about this game it
has 80 single-player and 21 multiplayer
levels that are challenging competitive
and gorgeous it has unique gameplay that
results in a very enjoyable gaming
experience also it's free to play and
the developer is already promising more
levels so you can't lose once again I'm
