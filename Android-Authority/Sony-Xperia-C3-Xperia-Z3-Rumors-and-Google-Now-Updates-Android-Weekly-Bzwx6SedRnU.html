brought to you by Full Sail University
welcome back to Android weekly my name
is Jace and in this past week we not
only saw two new phones from Sony a new
system on a chip from Samsung but Google
now allows us to correct Google now when
she misunderstands us case in point
ok Google who's the most handsome
Android host of all when there's a need
for a correction you do OK Google know I
said who's the handsomest Android host
of all stop you just like seeing his
name yes that's right you can now
correct google mouths voice search
commands handy tool but that's not the
only improvement we've seen from Google
now Google now lets you change the name
of a location card previously you could
only change the name of two default
locations home and work now to rename a
custom location in Google now you click
on the three dots Settings button right
here select your preferred mode of
getting around like mass transit driving
biking walking whatever then click on
the next arrow then click on rename
button now moving on to good news about
what's claiming to be the world's best
selfie smartphone the Xperia c3 the new
experiance c3 is a 5.5 venture with
mid-range specs and a consummate Sony
design that launched last week in Taiwan
a successor to the experience see Sony
skipped this c2 for some reason the new
c3 s most outstanding feature is a 5
megapixel wide-angle front camera with
an 80 degree field of view and a soft
LED flash guaranteed to make you look
the best day or night so sony claims
sony also packed several software
features to enhance selfies or pro
selfies as sony calls them the Xperia c3
is the first Sony phone to boast
superior auto mode on the front of the
camera which picks the best setting
depending on the scene including HDR
you get the obligatory beautification
mode and a function called Smile Shutter
which does exactly as the name suggests
plus a few eight-hour features allow I'm
gonna make a suggestion if I may if
you're one of those people who are crazy
enough to watch YouTube videos on a
mobile operating system maybe you want
to consider this as a career because you
should know that it's expected mobile
app development projects will exceed
that of PC projects four to one by 2015
yeah you see the emerging world is just
gonna skip the PC revolution and move
right on to the mobile revolution and
that's where our beloved sponsor comes

forward slash authority and get started
now now some good news for those of you
who are hoping that Qualcomm and NVIDIA
will get some more system-on-a-chip
competition this system-on-a-chip is the
first from Samsung to offer an on-die
LTE integration and is built on a 28
nanometer H kmg process this
system-on-a-chip offers cat 4 LTE and a
built-in image signal provider capable
of supporting an 8 megapixel sensor with
1080p video recording at 30 frames per
second suite now it's clear from the
mid-range specs of the system of a chip
that it's clearly intended for more
mid-range devices but the question
remains will Samsung's Exynos series be
able to compete more and more with
Qualcomm let me know what you think in
the comments below I'll be reading them
now for those of you hungry for rumors
we got rumors about the sony xperia z3
while previous rumors made us expect the
design to be different we don't see many
changes in the design language
here most specs continue to be a mystery
but from the photos you can tell it
seems to be running Android 4.4.4 it
also seems like the device will have a
2.5 gigahertz Snapdragon processor at
Drina 330 graphics and probably the same
20 point seven megapixel camera found in
both its predecessors keep in mind guys
that what was found here was a prototype
and therefore subject to change even if
the rumors are completely accurate the
phone could look quite a bit different
once it officially launches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
