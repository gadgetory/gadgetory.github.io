the president and CEO Huawei consumer
business group Richard thank you so much
for joining us it's a real real honor of
mine to be able to interview how are you
today sir
I have I am so let's talk about 2017 it
was an amazing year for huawei with so
many good devices you had P 10 P 10 plus
and then you later in the year you had
May 10 and make temp row all really
really good devices which was your
highlight by highlight is that you know
that's a myth I made temporal and it's
the very first one in the industry to
using the AI processing insider
artificially intelligent processing
inside and although also we support the
super fast like connectivity the cat's a
king
the modem the super fast not open the
1.2 gigabit per second super fastest
speed the connection and I like not only
this is a AI processor and enable this
phone I was drawn performance on a
camera appears the best camera
experience and also have ai
functionality to do a lot of a is the I
the industries coming so it's a good
opportunity and more importantly for the
users the phone is a actual on battery
life
superfast chasman you know that's the
very convenient for American consumers
the make tempura was the culmination of
all of these efforts of Huawei over the
last several years to be the absolute
best on the market
yeah what do you think is the next big
thing in the industry I think the next
big thing for the industry is the camera
camera I will Ellucian a camera
revolution you know today that's the
matin and made them Pro how the unity
the best camera experience but we but
it's very good and by the way we hope is
everything is not enough we want you
more closer to the professional camera
the big bulky professional camera that's
unless Mike you got it today da you know
for consumer the may 10 amid improve the
speed the fast enough
you know the battery life is a long and
also very compact design good good this
way and the AI and I are coming and we
can that's the phone more bring more
value to the consumer you can talk with
your phone okay yeah you can do a lot of
the enhanced ability it has the function
functionality what can we expect in
terms of revolutionising the camera I
think that's kind of revolutionary first
you know you know that is a bigger
pocket lines we need a room a lot is
long distance
zoom in zoom out you know that's you can
see ticket of photo far away I get a
boat on Qi the bigger the closer so I
think that that's kind of things it's
very nurturing
Agathe is a very low light condition how
you can take a very good photo in the
toughest situation in a low light
condition in the high contrast today us
see the mid 10 beaten pro in the high
contracts involving vehicles really very
good photo it's amazing yeah maybe photo
yeah buddy in future we want to cut him
better even better obviously talking
about the camera is it brings us a great
way to talk about partnerships and the
camera is where even you put that
partnership with Leica yeah what made
you choose like over other partners yeah
you know the lacquer they are they have
a lot of experience professional camera
yeah and there are no holiday on the and
the camera lens and also the camera how
to take a great photo so we we want we
partnership with lacquer it because in a
pack back hard you know possibly have
your not only the luxury brand famous
brand but all more important is you have
a lot of knowledge and know-how and how
can you take the best photo best picture
and the partnership with like is it just
hardware or do they also help with the
software and algorithms yeah both
hardware and software and also tuning
out the cameras that's fabulous
so another partnership we've obviously
seen here is porsche design with maj
designer and we've this is now the
second portion of art design device
let's talk back a few years ago because
you were still the
the CEO of the CBG at that time yeah
what made you pick porsche design as a
partner yeah you know that posh guy in
the luxury brand and they are good at
the design so working with them to the I
now I have them beating and cheaper I
the best premium high in the phone watch
the I know how it working together we
can bring them the best best of luxury
good price so during the keynote and you
say you announced the partnership with
imax for the Huawei VR experiences yes
yes can you tell us what does it mean
for not just the experience here but
also for huawei's VR efforts overall
yeah you know that's a wiry partnership
the imax the imax with the VR at a home
in the imax you can you know magic scale
you know that you can even looks like
you are in a cinema and I'd bestest it
just immense you immense you experience
it is really amazing amazing fabulous
and the last one partnership idea when I
talk about is a year ago today Bo almost
today at CES you guys announced a
partnership with Amazon to bring Alexa
to the mate nine year to the make nine
in the US and then this today we've seen
you talking with it's all about Google
Earth system is that is it just gonna be
about Google assistant going forward or
do you still plan to work with Amazon
yeah we wish to do her partner she would
cooperate the reasons also okay yeah we
have a little cover you either Google
and also be the Amazon so we want to
increase the industries our personal
services to the consumers will Huawei
ever work on its given its advancements
in AI especially on the processor side
do you plan to ever launch your own
assistant or are you happy with the
established players China market below
our own assistant
the globally we partner with you the
Amazon is a Google today obviously saw
the announcement of the partnership with
gal gadot for the launch of the make
tempura in the u.s. yes and then that
was the big new the other big news
during the keynote was the make tempo is
coming to the US and we it's launching
next month it's seven hundred and ninety
nine dollars with $150 gift card why do
you think now is the time to
to start bringing big flag ships into
the u.s. for fruit wale you know that's
a in the u.s. marketer is the mainly the
other two men that's the prodigal the
lack of enough for competition so we
because a week of our confidence our
product is the competitor having the
best in the best smartphone and I have a
better experience that's why we bring
the phone and to kill the consumer more
choice you know the last year we we
bring them the mid and I usually sue
very good consumer feedback can see
below it what are the challenges you
faced in terms of bringing devices to
the US I think you know in the u.s.
marketer consumer need us
Karia need us we want us only only some
some some of the other issues yeah you
know that I I don't speak already but
you understand it was that so that kind
of to be honest that's why we our phones
we are very stringent and of security
and the privacy protection we saw this
during the keynote you had a lot of
announcements around the various
standards you're compliant with all the
privacy all the securities there is a
little bit of a stigma unfortunately
when it comes to all Chinese companies
in general around privacy especially in
the US market is that going to be enough
to help us customers change their mind
yeah you know that's a no issue at all
that's the kind of things for the
consumer we're doing the best we do the
best that's the things that's kind of
things in information you look
beautifuller some the other people you
see some people you know that China
using some that excuse to keep us out
but III tell three I tell them the fact
he let him learn no excuse
it wouldn't be talking about 2017 and
the mate empro without looking at our
end of your Awards last year I'm really
really happy and really really proud to
be able to say that after all of that we
actually crowned the huawei mate empro
as the best smartphone of 2017 and we do
have a little memento here just to say
thank you to you and something to
remember us by so here let me give you
this have you gone are fast thanks I
will I guess we can end by saying I hope
this is the second year we've spoken to
you and every year we do speak to you we
see at the end of the year that you do
even bigger and greater things and
