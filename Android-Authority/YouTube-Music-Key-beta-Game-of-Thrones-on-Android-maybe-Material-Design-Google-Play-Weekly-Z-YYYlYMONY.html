Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly this
week we have more material design some
awesome games coming soon and some
awesome games now so let's get to it in
our first bit of news this week YouTube
is launching its subscription service in
beta next week we've heard a lot about
music key it's kind of a mixture between
Google Play all access and the long
awaited ability to watch videos without
advertising it'll start at the
promotional value of 799 before being
bumped up to 999 later and includes 20
million tracks ad free videos exclusive
band content and concert recordings if
you're lucky enough to snag a beta
invite you'll get six months for free so
it's likely safe to assume that it'll
launch sometime in that timeframe we
finally have a solid time frame on what
hearthstone is coming to android at
blizzcon 2014 during the keynote address
it was said that Android tablets will be
getting the game sometime in December
with a phone version coming for iOS and
Android sometime in January the card
game is already massively popular and
mobile users have been surprisingly
patient about waiting for it your wait
will be over soon at least if you own an
Android tablet the telltale games makers
of the popular Walking Dead title on
Android has just announced a new game of
thrones game the game revolves around
house Forrester which although part of
the books hasn't played that big of a
role in the TV show which is frankly a
perfect place for the game to go you'll
play as a member of house Forrester who
is trying to save the house from
destruction Android wasn't specifically
announced along with everybody else but
the walking dead games are on Android so
we assume this will make it there
eventually google has added a number of
family-friendly games to their
chromecast lineup and they're available
right now some of the titles include
wheel of fortune monopoly dash connect
four quads Scrabble blitz and a game
called big web quiz which uses Google's
knowledge graph to ask you a bunch of
questions obviously this is aimed at a
more family-friendly atmosphere and not
for the hardcore gamers but that's part
of the reason why android TV exists
these games are available right now and
you can get a link to them in the
written companion below in our last bit
of news this week Google keep and google
keyboard both got their material design
updates
Google keep now has the new material
design which actually doesn't make it
look all that different because it was
pretty close to material design already
there were no new features just some bug
fixes performance improvements and the
new material design google keyboard also
got its material update and it comes
with two themes which are material
lights and material dark these will be
added to the holo light and holo dark so
you'll have a total of four themes to
play with other than the new themes not
much else was changed so who wants to
see some trending applications as usual
if you want to check any of these
applications out you'd find the links in
the written companion which is in the
video description below first up is HTC
camera HTC has been systematically
putting their proprietary applications
on the google play store for faster
updating and it's a practice that should
be applauded unfortunately only HTC
devices can get it so if you don't have
one you can't get this any better camera
is a solid camera application that
offers some desirable features it tries
to mimic a DSLR camera experience by
giving you control over things like
white balance in ISO and even allows for
HDR video recording on devices running
Android 4.3 and up it's a solid option
if you're looking for a camera app and
there are some fun features if your
device supports them sid meier's
civilization revolution 2 was released
on android this last week and it's a
great strategy game if you like those it
features a bunch of new content
including new civilizations leaders
units technology and more it is having
some release day hiccups much like grand
theft auto san andreas did so you may
want to wait a week or two before buying
it it's a little expensive but there are
no in-app purchases messenger is
google's official text messaging app
that was released alongside the nexus 6
it's available for android devices
running 4.1 and up and includes material
design along with some management
features like easy search the ability to
block SMS senders audio messages and
emoji supports it's free with no in-app
purchases if you're looking for a new
text messaging app if you want to check

android apps and games head on over to
