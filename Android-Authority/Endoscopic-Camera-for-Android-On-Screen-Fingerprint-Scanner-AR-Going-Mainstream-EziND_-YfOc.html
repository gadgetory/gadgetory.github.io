camera is well normally that's a camera
that is inserted up the rectum by a
board-certified physician to explore
your colon health there may even take a
little biopsy little piece down in there
and test it out for later
well our good friends at jinx Tech have
provided you with an endoscopic camera
that's compatible with your end or
device just in case you want to pursue
some aggressive home remedies or free
dribble don't Google that let's try this
again a company called jinx tech has
produced an endoscopic camera that
attaches to your Android device most
people are familiar with such cameras
those devices that doctors use to look
inside people now we're hoping no
doctors use their smartphone to do this
but there is a surprising number of
other uses for this little gizmo it is
waterproof and flexible thank God
meaning you can use it to do things like
look inside your sink for a clog in the
drain or if you are working on a vehicle
you can use the tiny little camera to
get into tight spaces
now jinx Tech endoscopic Android camera
is being sold for $49 but recently that
prices dropped to 1899 suggesting that
there's been a build-up and backlog of
products that needs to be drained
alright moving on to more comfortable
news let's talk about the s9
specifically the feature that almost all
of you wanted it's now looking good the
latest report from South Korea alleges
that the upcoming Galaxy S 9 will not
feature an in display fingerprint
scanner instead it'll be placed on the
back of the device just like its
predecessor the biggest question that
arose out of this year's design trend
was the placement of the fingerprint
reader with all manufacturers moving
towards elongated screens and bezel as
bodies there simply isn't enough room
for a fingerprint scanner on the front
of the smartphone anymore most companies
Samsung have decided to move it to the
back though Samsung's approach has
frustrated many while Apple has decided
to go a different way altogether so I'm
thinking then that could potentially be
a big thing what do you think
I mean I'm someone who normally likes to
keep my devices facing upward while I'm
working or at the dining-room table
wherever so I can see notifications as
they come up but I want those
notifications to be secure so I got a
you know fingerprint sensor that open
that up so not everyone can see my
notifications but if I'm using a device
like the pixel two that has the
fingerprint reader on the back I got to
get under it each time I got to dedicate
the whole hand to do that maybe I'm
being picky and nitpicky I don't know
maybe I'm being lazy but that's a lot of
extra work compared to the new iPhone
that has the facial recognition does
that matter to you guys let me know in
the comments below
and good news for all you augmented
reality fans because AR is marching on
augmented reality apps and games will be
available on hundreds of millions of
android smartphones by the end of 2018
that's the word from the business and
operations lead for Google's VR unit I'm
at Singh who talked up the search
giant's AR ambitions at the recent Web
Summit in Lisbon and the Rollo won't
just cover high-end flagship devices
either as Google appears to be aiming
for a mass-market crowd with text often
herald next best thing
augmented reality will become a core
feature of most of Android over the next
few years
Singh said noting that mid and low tier
handsets will be updated over the next
two years now this a are ready utopia is
all thanks to a our core Google's
Android software development kit that
lets developers introduce a our
capabilities to almost any Android
device without the need for additional
sensors or hardware according to sing
the AR core project is running as
planned and his team is currently
helping developers build the experiences
so that AR can become a daily habit if
you're a little bit older like me you
may remember Atari video games in the
early 80s they were the bomb we
considered that cutting
video game tech I remember space
invaders and pac-man and all that kind
of stuff
well if you compare that to today like
recent Call of Duty game for example the
comparison is laughable I mean it's it's
ridiculous
I think that the current state of
augmented reality is like where Atari
was 35 years ago right we're taking some
graphic and we're slapping it on the
real world video image and that's
augmented reality I think it's just in
its infancy and with the support that
Google and Apple are gonna throw at this
we're gonna see huge pushes in the next
seven to ten years
I mean think of the possibilities we can
begin to really bridge the gap between
the real world and the augmented world
in ways that like I mean just think
about real estate right you don't have
to go to a house and see what it's like
anymore because you can just see almost
a virtual creation of that house right
and you want to change the the curtains
and the walls and the lights and the
whole decorations well you can do that
now you can do that already but with an
improved augmented reality that can be a
really immersive experience and that's
just for the real estate business I mean
there are countless examples where
augmented reality can really move the
needle for a whole bunch of people not
just video games now my audience is
smart so smart that sometimes you're
inspired by a business idea and then you
try and get the name of that business in
a domain name and your next prospective
customer is searching your business name
and they assume you have the dot-com and
if you don't you're giving your business
away to the one who does that's the
power of accom now why is that exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions and jet
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
don't forget you get 15% off when you
use our coupon code
Android when you think domain names
think domain.com hey guys Jess here so
earlier today just before I shot this I
did a live chat on Facebook I'm gonna
try and do those on a semi-regular basis
just to show you behind the scenes ask
questions us meet questions so we can
get kind of a dialogue going we had
questions about the new pixel two that
I'm using and the camera and the audio
and stuff like that and I really enjoyed
that engagement so follow me here on
Twitter and like us on Facebook so you
can get all that goodness talk to you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
