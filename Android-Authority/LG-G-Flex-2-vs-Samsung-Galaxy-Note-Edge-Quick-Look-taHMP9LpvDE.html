look at this comparison between the nude
LG G flex 2 and its main rival to
Samsung Galaxy Note edge now thanks to
their curves the G flex 2 and the Note
edge are two of the most distinctive
devices you can get right now but that
doesn't mean they're really any similar
the brand-new G flex 2 features a
dramatic curve from top to bottom that
on not only looks unique but it's
supposed to make it more ergonomic to
use and especially with the 5.5 inch
screen that is smaller than the original
iteration this is actually very true LG
used a new duraguard glass for the front
that makes it 20% more durable than
Gorilla Glass 3 moving around the back
we do have the button layout that LG is
known for now with the power button and
the volume rockers but also the
removable backing now has an improved
version of the self-healing coating that
was introduced in the original G flex as
such minor scuffs and scratches should
begin disappearing in as little as
twenty seconds especially if you apply a
little heat but on the other end of the
spectrum Samsung added a metal build and
now a curve to the well known notes or
concepts the device will feel instantly
familiar to anyone who's used the notes
series down to the Aspen housed in a
slot on the bottom of the device but the
edge that gives the phone its name is
really an extension of the screen that
gives you an extra area to have
different panels for let's say news
taking or for a number of shortcuts that
can be accessible from anywhere or for
putting the controls on there to get
them out of the way from the main screen
but when it comes to economics the curve
definitely does change that feel a
little bit especially for people who
might be left-handed and find the grip
to be a little bit odd on the right side
now the curves are made possible using
plastic based o le d-- technology which
ensures great contrast deep blacks and
vivid colors the no edge comes ahead
thanks to its higher quad HD resolution
but the now full HD G flex 2 is still no
slouch and you'll be hard-pressed to
notice much of a difference the bigger
story is the effect of the curve even
with the added edge Samsung's device is
still pretty conventional to use while
on the G flex 2 the effect is actually a
little bit more dramatic
for a somewhat more immersive experience
when using all of the elements that show
up on the screen even though the edge
might be given to the G flex 2 in terms
of having the first in the wild
Snapdragon 810 processor available that
doesn't mean that the performance on
either of these devices will really be
leaps and bounds ahead of one another
even though the note 4 is powered by a
powerful Snapdragon 805 processor and it
comes in this note edge as well
performance is smooth on it and on the
LG G flex 2 as well both of these
software suites also include a lot of
features that can arguably over
saturates the usage from time to time
but in hardware a micro SD card slot has
been added into the G flex 2 which gives
it a better storage capability but as
far as battery is go the 3000 milliamp
hour battery of the G flex 2 is embedded
into the body while the removable
battery of the note edge will allow you
to replace it if you do happen to run
out of power which is always a nice
feature of these Samsung phones now
while there will be a more robust camera
comparison when we get our full review
unit of the G flex 2 LG says that the
camera on it is the best one yet and
like the LG g3 the G flex now features
OIS plus in its camera with a laser
assisted focus which should ensure
faster focusing time even in difficult
low-light situations the main shooter is
13 megapixels and on the other end of
the spectrum the Note edge comes with a
16 megapixel rear camera with OAS as
well while the front camera is 2.1
megapixels on the LG G flex 2 and 3.7
megapixels with a wide angle on the note
edge in software it's worth noting that
the G flex 2 actually launched with a
lollipop but the software experience
remains largely similar to the g3 with
many of the same features like the
knock-on but it has been given an
enhancement or the knock-on and now has
a new feature where you can swipe down
on the screen in order to open up a
small area on the top to get little bits
of information like the time and the
date but after that even though there
are very little aesthetic changes in the
UI from lollipop for the most part of
the experience is very much the same
from the LG g3
now on the note edge you obviously have
the the edge on the side that allows for
a bunch of different panels to be used
but when you take away the edge the
TouchWiz experience is very similar to
that of the note 4 and even from
previous iterations of samsung's line
and even if the edge panel is not
something you would use all the time
perhaps the s-pen is what gives the Note
edge even more points in terms of
usability because it adds not only a
one-of-a-kind stylus experience in the
smartphone game but also every feature
that it allows the no edge to have and
so there you have it for this quick look
at the LG G flex 2 vs. it's a main
competitor in the curved display
category the Samsung Galaxy Note edge
stay tuned for a more in-depth look at
both of these phones once we get our
review of the G flex 2 including a
camera shootout perhaps but until then
