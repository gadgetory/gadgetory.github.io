can find manufacturers you've never
heard of right here in the United States
and one in particular hails from Miami
Florida and looks to bring you a
flagship experience for a lower price
hey it's Josh Arikara from Android
Authority and this is the blue life pure
excel now before you ask no this is not
to the same company as the maker of
those electronic cigarettes but instead
blue BL U stands for bold like us and
they are certainly trying to be bold it
seems like with their choices on this
smartphone a 5.5 inch screen dictates
the overall size of this device and the
design aspect is where blue seemingly
decided to keep things pretty simple
capacitive Keys line the bottom portion
while a phone speaker grown and the
front-facing camera are found up top
now glossy plastic is what is used quite
literally all around this device and
there is a curve at the top as well as
on the bottom
despite the sides being very flat after
that you have the headphone jack up top
with the power button and on the bottom
you have the dual speaker setup along
with a micro USB charging port the sides
though flat do have the volume rocker on
the right side and the SIM tray on the
left come around the back and you'll
find a slight curve along with the
protruding camera up top now it doesn't
come out too much but it will take the
brunt of any damage if you do tend to
slide your phone on tables a lot and
that's pretty much it for the material
around the device it's covered in glossy
plastic and thus it is generally prone
to smudges and fingerprints though I
will admit that keeping everything to a
dark in this case black color does
somewhat hide that now I wouldn't say
that this is my favorite looking device
out there because while I do like
simplistic elegance this might be a
little bit too simple for its own good
someone I knew took the phone and said
this feels like a chocolate bar and
that's not necessarily a good thing
handling is a different matter and it
actually isn't too bad on this phone
though the glossy plastic does lend
itself to some slippage here and there
the power button up top might take some
hand gymnastics to get to but it isn't
too difficult considering the flat sides
make it easy to grip and tilt the phone
those flat sides also help with the
overall grip allowing for a rather
comfortable fit when coupled with the
curve on
back well as is the case with larger
screen devices this 5.5 inch screen does
provide a little bit more difficult
handling when you're trying to reach
everything on the top especially so
maybe this minimalistic design is not
going to turn heads but the Life Pure
Excel does get a couple points for
having some pretty accessible handling
as mentioned above the screen of the
blue is a 5.5 inch size and is a 1080p
LTPS LCD with 401 pixels per inch
now the screen is pretty vibrant and
does its job of putting out the pretty
colorful OS general tasks such as
watching YouTube provided no issues and
with the standard pixel density I didn't
have any issue viewing or reading text
on webpages even playing a game like CSR
classics was a breeze on this display as
it provided a fun experience with all
the colorful cars and graphics all in
all this is a display that gets the job
done there are real no complaints here
and in performance blue wanted to ensure
that its larger hands that came with the
right specifications to match current
top devices in this case I went with the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 clocked in at
2.2 gigahertz backed by the adrenal 330
and 3 gigabytes of ram the ram portion
was a nice touch giving this phone a bit
of an edge despite having a processing
package that is just one step behind the
current bleeding edge but that being
said the performance on this phone
should be without question but I believe
it is bogged down by some shoddy
software work even if it's just in the
way the animations were built seeing
slowdown and stutter and even the small
portions of the operating system is
pretty disheartening the OS might be
just trying to look fancy but its
overtures and flourishes sometimes get
in the way of truly feeling like a fluid
experience and once you get to where you
need to go though things pretty seem to
perform about as smoothly as I need to
gaming in particular post few issues as
I was able to enjoy CSR classics easily
and then web browsing was really easy
and I didn't find any rendering issues
on plenty of websites that I view all in
all the performance aspect has a just
get the job done attitude on the live
pure Excel and I did find as I continued
to use his device that just getting the
job done was generally the motif you
would use to describe this device and
that does continue in hardware aware
there aren't really too many bells and
whistles
talk about but the life pure Excel does
come with everything you would expect
from a higher tier device
Bluetooth Wi-Fi and of course NFC now
it's worth mentioning that this phone is
not capable of connecting to LTE network
so when it comes to mobile Internet
you'll be getting HSDPA instead call
quality was pretty standard though I
will say that while I sounded alright to
the person on the other line
I felt the speaker volume on this phone
could use a boost in both volume and in
clarity I could hear the other person
just fine but it doesn't sound as crisp
as plain as the other phones out there
and speaking of the sound experience
those two grills on the bottom simply
don't provide a very good stereo
experience I would actually argue they
don't really provide a stereo experience
to begin with actually sound seems to
primarily come from only one of the
grilles which is easily muffled by a
covering finger the sound that comes out
of it also isn't particularly crisp
though I will say that it does get
plenty loud underneath the hood of the
live peer XL you get 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage and a 2,500 million
power battery that does go for a pretty
good time
now usually connecting to LTE networks
is a bit of a battery drain and that is
not found here so that might help but
after taking a bunch of calls sending a
lot of texts doing a lot of navigation
with this phone and also taking quite a
few pictures that moderate usage did
bring this phone down to 25% after about
10 hours which isn't that bad power is
also not in shortage when you're talking
about the camera after all it's a 16
megapixel shooter that is available in
this device starting off with the app
though it does provide a few different
options but in the end doesn't have that
many features to boast HDR scene modes
and some control is available what I
didn't like about the interface is that
when you try to look at the settings it
always comes up in portrait mode so when
you're in position to take a picture
properly but need to change something
you have to rotate the phone just to do
so it's kind of annoying but when you
move to advanced mode the controls do
rotate to landscape but then again it's
still not that easy to maneuver around
the various dials and sliders while you
are able to select more minutes
parts of the shooting experience like
ISO and white balance here the interface
again just tries to look fancy and in
the end is not all that useful or
doesn't allow you a way to change your
settings in a very timely manner but the
speed of the app is well decent at best
as shots are pretty easy to get if you
are in the normal shooting mode but do
require some extra processing time if
basically any extra scene mode is used
and as far as quality goes that isn't a
great shooter and pales in comparison to
just plenty of the cameras out there :
reproduction is pretty shoddy as a
below-average saturation yields washed
out photos in pretty much every instance
details are also lacking as is easily
demonstrated by this 100 crop noise
levels are high enough that subjects
don't really get separated well from the
rest of the shot so once again we find
ourselves in a situation where additions
put into the live pure excel are there
not because they're going to excel at
what they do but because they are
basically what is required for this
phone to be considered anywhere near the
top-tier the operating system found in
the live pure excel does get the job
done but it's pretty quirky the main
striking difference you'll find is the
fact that there's no app drawer which is
much like a number of Chinese iterations
of Android out there all of your
applications will be stored on the
screens left to be organized by folders
also there's no way to put widgets on
the home screens so that lends to a lack
of customization the background is a
little blurred out which is a bit of a
stylistic choice that actually makes it
look kind of nice but other than that
you're greeted with a dock and all of
your applications are provided with a
lot of pages to swipe through
multitasking takes on an interesting
method as pressing home on the home
screens will bring you a sliding list of
your most recent used applications and
then you use the HOME key to return to
this list and it will allow you to jump
between the various apps and another
interesting feature fountain here was in
the lockscreen which is a simple swipe
up unless you swipe to the right where
you can get a few functions one of which
was being able to initialize the camera
which is kind of nice to be able to do
so from straight in the lock screen but
then another one that allows you to make
the phone feign a call in order to get
you out of quote unwanted situations as
far as apps go the ones built into the
blue OS include a power manager for
power saving capabilities a
a pretty nice-looking music player
actually and a different camera if you
want those extra effects so based on
jellybean the blue OS is actually pretty
outdated by now and as far as function
goes it does away with the common tropes
that Android people will probably be
more used to like an app drawer so as a
result you will be able to get general
tasks done with a built-in user
interface but I wouldn't be surprised if
you launched a custom launcher as a
solution in order to get a more familiar
experience priced at 399 dollars on
Amazon the blue life peer excel does
provide a lower price point compared to
plenty of other flagships out there
but there are other phones that might be
able to beat that price the main ones
that come to mind are any flagship
devices that came out last year whose
prices may have gone down by now but
they might not have come down as low as
399 dollars the ones that do come at
that price point include the Moto line
even though for lower prices you might
be paying for a somewhat lower tiered
experience comparatively at least in the
spec sheets after that you have of
course the Nexus 5 which comes in at
$349 at its base model and provides a
very very good experience with stock
Android the way that we want it and then
after that you have of course the
oneplus one priced in at 299 at its base
model but it is still incredibly
difficult to get your hands on today so
in the end the live pure XL is a phone
word you pretty much pay for what you
get and what you get in this phone is a
device that just does exactly what it's
supposed to do but doesn't necessarily
excel after that and so there you have
it at that price it's really not that
bad of a device by any means it just is
a phone that pretty accurately fits its
retail value while the power of the
processor the capable screen and the
only decent camera will provide enough
for the average user anyone else looking
for even a little bit more than that so
will probably have their eyes set on
other devices at the very least the life
peer XL shows that lesser-known
manufacturers are definitely capable of
providing comparable experiences to more
well-known devices but what they need to
do now is go above and beyond rather
than just do exactly what is expected of
their device as always thank you guys
very much for watching and I hope you
enjoyed this review of the Blu life pure
XL while there were some moments of
enjoyment when I was used
this device unfortunately they paled in
comparison to plenty of other devices
that overall provide a richer experience
but at 399 it is a viable solution for
any of you users out there who don't
want to pay the premium for any of the
other flagship devices out there so keep
it tuned to Android authority for all of
the best coverage including coverage
