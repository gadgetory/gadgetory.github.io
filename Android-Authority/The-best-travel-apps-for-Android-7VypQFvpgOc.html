hindi the android authority app guy
whether it's for business or pleasure
everyone travels however not everyone is
good at it so today we're going to show
you some of the best traveling apps for
android to help you get from point A to
point B first on our list is a very
capable app called hotels.com in most
cases when you travel you need to stay
in one of these hotel things so an app
that can help you find them is always a
good decision hotels.com does a pretty
decent job of that and it has about as
many features as you can ask for you can
search hotels by either your current
location or your future destination you
can also sort by star rating customer
review and price during our testing we
found some decent deals but nothing
overly special it's solid and it works
and you can't ask for much more than
that next on our list is an app for
people who like to use the bus it's
called I next bus and it gives you the
bus schedules in a number of cities well
it can be used by people who live in
these cities locally it can also be
useful for travellers who are in a
strange large city and once it gets
somewhere the app is very simple to use
just click the prompts where you want to
go and see where the nearest buses are
it will tell you automatically upon
opening the app based on your current
location but you can search for other
routes as well where you wish there were
more routes but that's something we're
sure will come eventually
number eight on our list is called
Hipmunk flight and hotel search this app
features a cute chipmunk mascot which we
approve of and also helps you find
flights and hotels it claims to do this
by comparing the rates of various
websites and then showing you the
results this is probably the most useful
app on the list so far you can use the
first part to find a flight on the date
you need then once you do that you can
simply jump to the other side to find
the hotels there are a variety of sort
items and prices were relatively decent
all in all it's a pretty nice app number
seven on our list is another hotel app
called hotel tonight this is developed
using the Android design standard at
least for the most part so holo Yolo
fans will enjoy how it looks
design preferences aside this is a
fairly decent hotels app if it works in
your city
it had Cleveland and Cincinnati Ohio but
not Columbus Ohio so they've already
disappointed me however if you're going
into a city that the app supports it's a
truly enjoyable app to use you can only
use it to book hotels on a day's notice
and it even has little fun facts about
each hotel number six on our list is an
app called and I hope I'm pronouncing
this right a gota this popular hotel
booking app is a pretty solid option if
you're traveling and need to find a
place to stay while other apps search
only metropolitan areas one thing we
thought was really cool about ACOTA
was even search by landmarks or suburbs
not just major cities the interface is
reasonably easy to use you search the
city or area you want to book a hotel in
you then define how many in your party
how many rooms and for how many nights
it even lets you search for smoking and
non-smoking Wi-Fi and pool access you
can also book straight from the app
which is an added convenience number
five is an awesome little app called
kayak this app can do so much that it's
kind of intense
you can book flights hotel rooms and
rental cars you can check out flight
price trends plan a whole trip all at
once and even get airline fees for
bagging and convert currency really it's
pretty awesome we can't really
understand why this wasn't rated higher
we couldn't think of much this app
couldn't do it has a decent user
interface and it's pretty easy to use it
even comes with a packing list so you
don't forget to pack anything I mean
really what else could you ask for
taxi beat is number four on our list and
as the name implies it's an app that
helps you hail a taxi the premise is
really cool instead of hailing a
stranger you call a cab that's been
reviewed by other taxi Beat users so you
know who you're getting and what to
expect it's really quite unique the only
really bad part is that it's very region
specific it's only available in a
handful of areas including parents
Athens Rio de Janeiro and a few other
locales so people in the US can't use
this one yet despite that people who
have tried so far have really really
liked it and it's recommended if you're
going to a city that's on the supported
list first on our top three is
TripAdvisor if kayak had everything
necessary to plan the trip TripAdvisor
takes care of everything once you get
there
it lists hotels in the area like any
good travel app does it also has
restaurants activities entertainment and
nightlife listings for things to do
while you're in town like most of the
apps on this list Trip Advisor's
interface is nearly idiot-proof so
finding what you want to find is quick
and easy not only is this good for
travelers but it's also good for locals
as you can explore new places around
your area or even add new places to the
app for tourists to check out when they
pass through number two on our list is
the app for booking comm this fairly
decent and solid app helps you find in
book hotels like kayak it's one of the
few on this list that lets you book your
hotel room from within the app it has a
large selection of hotels at competitive
rates the interface was friendly and
easier to use than most a lot of the
interface lets you swipe between pages
instead of backing up and selecting a
new page that was very convenient there
is nothing really that helps a sap stand
out it's just very solid and people seem
to like it
there is one type of trouble we haven't
covered yet the venerable road trip it
just so happens that our number one
rated app is Gas Buddy and I've
dedicated to the driver it does this by
displaying the gas prices for just about
everywhere you could ever need to go the
app is very simple open it up create an
account real quick and either find gas
stations based on your current GPS
location or search by zip code this is
handy for planning pit stops on road
trips or even locals who want to find
the best prices on gas in just my area I
was able to find gas up to 30 cents
cheaper that's probably why so many
people love this app if you take a
glance at the leaderboard you can see
how these apps stack up against one
another we wanted to do more than just a
list of hotel apps so we made sure to
find other apps that could be useful to
travelers if you want to check them out
the links are in the video description
as stated there is more than one way to
travel and finding the best way for you
is what is most important so if there is
a travel app that you had a particularly
good experience with and you want to
talk about it let us know in the
comments also for the record hotels and
airlines do not approve when a certain
Android Authority app guy accidentally
books plane seats and hotel rooms then
calls to cancel that was my bad once
