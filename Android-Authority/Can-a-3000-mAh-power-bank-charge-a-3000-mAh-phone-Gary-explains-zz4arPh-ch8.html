situation where you've got yourself a
external battery pack and you've used it
to recharge your phone on the go and
your phone has got a 3000 milliamp hour
battery your battery pack is a 3000
milliamp hour battery pack and yet your
phone doesn't reach full charge why is
that
well let me explain as in my name's Gary
Sims from Andrew authority today I want
to look at the capacities of portable
power banks these external battery packs
you can use a charge your phone on the
go now the thing about a battery pack is
they come in all shapes and all sizes
there are big ones and small ones and
round ones and square ones and they all
have a characteristic which is the
capacity and that capacity is normally
quoted in milliamp hours and you might
say well I've got a phone a galaxy s7
for example has got a 3000 milliamp hour
battery I'll get myself a 3000 milliamp
hour portable battery pack and then if I
want to I can recharge it but actually
then you find that when you do try to
recharge it doesn't get to 100% doesn't
get even near 100% now why is that well
to look into this problem I've done two
things I bought myself a couple of
battery packs of different sizes and
I've tested to see how much charging
they will actually do and to see how
that charging number compares with this
milliamp hour capacity number that's
quoted on the battery and then the
second thing I have done some math to
try to work out what's really going on
so starting with the battery packs I
bought myself an anchor lipstick size
portable power banks at 3350 milliamp
power unit I also got a small Samsung
one that's a three thousand one hundred
million power unit and then I got a big
one this is the Amazon basics battery
pack and that's a 16100 milliamp power
unit obviously you can see it's quite a
different size to the other ones and so
I use them I charge them all up fully
and then I had a whole bunch of depleted
mobile phone and I started to charge
them up to see how things would go now
starting with the Samsung which I said
it's got a three thousand one
hundred million power capacity when I
tried to charge up a galaxy s7 for that
it went from zero to 71% now that
actually gives a figure of 2130
milliamps so from a three thousand one
hundred million power battery I managed
to get two thousand one hundred and
thirteen milliamps of charge out of it
now the second battery that I test it
was the anchor lipstick size one and
that's a three thousand three hundred
and fifty milliamp hour battery and when
I charged up a mobile phone with that I
managed to get two thousand three
hundred and thirty seven milliamp hours
out of it and then the third one of
course I tested was these Amazon basics
with its 16 thousand milliamp hour
battery now that's pretty huge so I had
to charge up several phones one after
the other to try to drain that battery
but I still didn't get 16 thousand
milliamp hours of current out of it what
I actually did get was twelve thousand
three hundred and eighty so as you can
see all three charges whether they were
small whether they were from a big
company like Samsung whether they were a
value pack one like the Amazon one in
whatever they were like none of them
reach their full capacity so let's try
to understand some maths to see why that
is now if you look closely on the label
of these phones you'll find two numbers
one is the capacity in milliamp hours
like I've already told you and one is
also something called what hours now
what hours are actually a much more
reliable way of telling about the
capacity of a power bank now I'm sure
that you remember that what is
calculated by multiplying volts by amps
now actually when you look at the what
our numbers on all of these devices you
can divide that by the capacity that's
given and it will tell you how many
volts the battery is on the inside of
the power pack and what you find is that
power packs in general have a three
point seven volt battery inside of them
and that's quite good because most
mobile phones most smartphones have a
three point seven volt battery inside of
them however there's two small problems
one is that we do all our charging by
USB and so there's a USB port on the
battery pack and
into your phone now USB runs at five
volts so the first thing that has to
happen is is that the battery pack has
to convert that 3.7 volts into five
volts and to do that the amp each has to
go down so already you're not running at
the full amp capacity of that battery
because there's been an up conversion to
a different voltage level and then what
happens it goes down the USB cable it
hits the phone and then the phone will
then probably down step that to maybe
four point two volt or four point four
volts so there are two conversions going
on here one and up up step from three
point seven to five volt and then in the
phone from five volts down to 4.2 or 4.3
for the capacity at 3.7 volts is not
what is being used when it comes to
charging the phone so there's a
difference there and secondly the up
conversion and then the down conversion
actually lose power because all
conversions lose power otherwise we'd
have infinity and machines that could
just go on putting them forever and ever
we wouldn't have any problems but energy
gets lost and that's normally lost
through heat and you can feel that at
the back of your phone when it's
charging there is some heat being
dissipated now over at the androids comm
website I've got all the calculations on
how you calculate the actual capacities
with the voltages and the amps and the
watts and all that kind of stuff go over
to Android comm and look for this
article however if you want to know my
rule of thumb this is what it is a
battery power bank will give out two
thirds of what it's milliamp hour
capacity is so that's really easy if you
have a galaxy s7 with a 3000 milliamp
hour battery then what you want to do is
multiply it by three 9000 divide it by
two 4.5 4500 so you want 4500 milliamp
hour external battery pack to get one
charge out of that phone if you want to
charges in that then you're going to
need a 9000 and so on and so on if
you're being really lazy because you
don't want to multiply by three and
divide by two then basically just get
one twice as big as the battery in your
phone and then you're pretty much
guaranteed to get yourself a full charge
in fact they'll even be a little bit
left over so that's really good news
so as a summary the battery inside of
the battery pack is three point seven
volt there has to be an up conversion
there has to be a down conversion the
battery charges in your phone at around
four point four or four point seven
volts there's heat loss and the
combination of all those things together
is that your battery packs only give out
two thirds of what's written in the
milliamp hour capacity so buy one that's
big enough to cope with the battery in
your phone my name's go sim from Andrew
Authority and I hope you enjoyed this
video if you did please do give it a
thumbs up also please tell me in the
comments your experience of using
external power banks how good are they
at charging your mobile phone on the go
