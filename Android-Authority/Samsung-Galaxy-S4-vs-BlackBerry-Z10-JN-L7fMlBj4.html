Android Authority we're up to Samsung
Galaxy s4 launch event in New York City
at Radio City Music Hall now we've been
comparing it to a bunch of different
phones and what we're doing this time is
preparing the s4 and the BlackBerry z10
probably something you don't see us talk
about on Android authority very often
now first screen size you can see this
is significantly bigger than that the s4
has a 5-inch screen compared to the
BlackBerry z10 S 4 point 2 inch screen
now the z10 is running at a resolution
of 1280 by 768 720p with a pixel density
of 355 pixels per inch
while the s4 is running in 1080p at a
pixel density of 441 pixels per inch as
you can see we just wrapped up running a
benchmark and the Samsung Galaxy s4 kind
of blew the z10 out of the water coming
in at 3163 - the z10 1430 now getting
down into raw specs part of the reason
this just blew it away in the benchmark
is that this has a 1.9 gigahertz
Qualcomm arm v7 processor while the
BlackBerry has a Qualcomm processor as
well but only 1.5 gigahertz looking at
Ram both phones share 2 Meg's of RAM
both have as little as 16 gigs of
internal storage while the s4 goes up to
64 the BlackBerry z10 only goes up to a
total of 32 gigs of internal storage
both phones have expandable storage so
you can throw in a microSD card for up
to 64 gigs of extra storage looking at
the cameras on the back the Samsung
Galaxy s4 has a 13 megapixel camera
while the BlackBerry z10 has an 8
megapixel camera both feature 2
megapixel front cameras looking at
battery life it's quite a bit of a
difference while the BlackBerry z10 only
has 1800 milliamp hours of battery
capacity the Samsung Galaxy s4 has
literally double that at 2600 milliamp
hour
this is Chris woofer mandroid authority
coming to you from the Samsung Galaxy
launch event
stay tuned for even more comparisons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
