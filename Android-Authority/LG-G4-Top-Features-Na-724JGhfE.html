Android authority and LG's latest
flagship was just announced so today
we're going to go over what we think are
some of the top best features of the LG
g4 so kicking off this list at number
one is the display so it's a 5.5 inch
screen with quad HD resolution so 2560
by 1440 just like it was on last year's
g3 but the big difference on this year's
g4 is that it features a quantum display
and if that term sounds familiar it's
because there was a pretty big deal made
about it at this year's CES back in
January so quantum or quantum dot if
you're not familiar with it just to
break it down a little bit essentially
what it is is just a layer of tiny
crystals that break down the backlight
and produces a richer white light for a
better overall image and that's exactly
what LG claims so LG is saying that the
display is it has a 20% better color
gamut it's 25% brighter and it has a 50%
greater contrast over the competition
and whether that's true or not remains
to be seen but one thing we know for
sure is that it's a huge improvement
over the LG g3 s display feature number
two is the camera so the g4 features a
16 megapixel sensor with an aperture of
f-18 so it's an extremely wide aperture
probably the widest that we've seen on
any smartphone so not only are you going
to get some really great looking depth
of field but this should provide for
some really good low-light performance
as well the camera also comes with oh is
built-in but this year you get three
axis stabilization so not only are you
getting stabilization on the X&amp;amp;Y axis
but also the z-axis as well so you
should get some really crispy looking
images and some really steady looking
footage when recording video which is
going to be great LG also claims that
this is the world's first smartphone
camera to feature a color spectrum
sensor that provides for better white
balance for a more color accurate image
now as far as how well this actually
works remains to be seen but it
definitely does look promising the
camera also has a built in manual mode
now what you didn't get on the g3 and
the manual mode gives you
sister things like white balance
exposure ISO shutter speed and the
ability to shoot in RAW so if you want
more control over your camera you now
have that ability in the g4 speaking of
cameras that leads us to our next top
feature which is the front-facing camera
for all you selfie lovers out there so
the front camera is an eight megapixel
sensor so you should be able to take
some really high-resolution selfies and
also the gesture shot on the g4 has also
been improved allowing to take up to
four selfies in sequence so if you're
into selfies this should be a really fun
feature for you to take advantage of our
next top feature has to be the removable
battery and the reason why this is even
a feature is because it's essentially
going the way of the dinosaurs because
we're not really seeing it all that
often especially among the major ball
players like Samsung HTC Motorola and
even Sony and I think LG is really the
only company left that is still doing it
so if you want to take advantage of that
feature you definitely can do that on
the g4 and swap out batteries but
hopefully you don't have to do all that
often especially with a large 3000
milliamp hour battery inside feature
number five is micro SD card expansion
which is not going the way of the
dinosaurs because a lot of phones out
there still support micro SD cards but
it might be especially important on the
g4 because there's only a 32 gigabyte
configuration available but the g4
supports up to a whopping 2 terabytes of
storage so you should be able to store
pretty much anything that you want on
this phone from movies photos videos
whatever you want without having to
worry about running out of storage
our final top feature has to do with the
new back cover so along with the plastic
or ceramic back you now have a leather
option available and these are actually
made of real leather they were sourced
from real cows so animals were harmed in
the making of the g4 but that's ok and
these are vegetable tanned leather as LG
is calling it so if you want something a
little bit more premium a little bit
more elegant the leather backs are
definitely the way to go and it's just
nice to see another OM besides motorola
offer some extra color options and
material options when it comes to their
phones so if you want something a little
bit different the leather options are
definitely worth checking out and that
prevents wraps
for this top features video for the LG
g4 definitely let us know down in the
comments below what your favorite
features of the g4 are or what you just
think of the phone in general and also
