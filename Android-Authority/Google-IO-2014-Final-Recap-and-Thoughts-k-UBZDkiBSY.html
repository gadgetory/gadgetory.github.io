what's going on everybody and supposedly
maybe for the last time I'm going to be
coming to you live from google i/o 2014
here at the moscone center in now sunny
San Francisco it was really windy and
kind of gloomy last day but yeah just
kind of giving you my reactions to this
year's i/o there were a lot of great
announcements at the keynote the near
three hour-long keynote that is and
despite a couple of protesters it
couldn't bring down the spirit of
development and the spirit of the future
of technology here at the Google
Developers Conference you can see all
the people behind me there are a ton of
people just lining up everywhere for
various sessions now i will say real
quick that I did want to attend a
session but I was not able to because
well this year's i/o was cut short by
one day last year we had three whole
days to be able to do a lot so when I
was there last year the first day was
about getting all of the keynotes
announcements on tape and then the
second day was about going to sessions
and catching up on anything we missed it
and third day was all about fun I had to
kind of condensed the last two days of
last year into this one day today so you
saw Android auto in the nice demo
Android TV also in a pretty nice demo
and after that I was able to actually go
around a little bit and actually uh have
fun with a couple of the boots that are
actually upstairs because the second
boot that the second floor rather is
where a lot of the sort of developer
centric areas are this community lounge
where people can actually code and learn
about code and what about the
development of their applications and
the distribution of their applications
upstairs there were a few games I played
a couple in particular one of them was
with project tango where I was able to
demo their actual zombie game zombie
gunship reality and have to use the dev
sensors the entire project tango suite
in order to destroy or rather kill the
zombies there by running around in the
small space all right here we go zombie
gunship reality all right here we go
after that was a quiz that i was able to
actually I did win I i got this large
shirt with the icon of the player that i
was playing and it was the Cyclops the
devilish Cyclops no it was called the
the big web quiz and here is the Cyclops
right here it's too bad they didn't have
any small these are large I don't know
what I'm gonna do with it but I have it
in my possession is just my trophy for
winning that quiz but yeah there is fun
to be had here and there's a lot to be
able to do at Google i/o I will say that
it is not the best conference for the
general consumer that's something we
said last year as well the consumer can
have a lot of fun here learning about
the new products the new devices that
might be coming out based upon the new
software that developers are creating
but as far as devices go everyone was
expecting something like a nexus 6 or
maybe the new Nexus tablet or first for
for some reason but also we had android
TV which is great android auto but the
main announcements when it came to
devices if you were just looking from a
purely consumer standpoint were the
smart watches and i'm wearing my LG G
watch right here I'm having a lot of fun
with this G watch I still have to film
my reactions not really reactions my
first impressions on the LG G watch
after you may have seen already my
unboxing and my initial setup but for
the most part I do really like the way
that all of this is put together and you
know even with all of the cards one
thing i will say just in this video is
even though a lot of people were afraid
that you might have to scroll a whole
lot just to get to where you want to go
that's not really the case it the crux
of it is primarily from your
notifications so as you dismiss your
notifications so too do you dismiss all
of the different cards that are going to
show up eventually you're just going to
have the watch face and that's all
you're going to have from there though i
did want to talk about the new L preview
and the L preview is essentially going
to be what we will call I don't know
what we're going to call it may be lemon
drop lemon bar I would love lemon bar
that'd be great lollipop is kind of
funny licorice is kind of funny but we
don't know what's going to be called
it's just called the L preview right now
that has some new graphical elements to
it and right now it's being called the
material design I do think the material
design is pretty nice we already saw
kind of in the new Google+ application
update and when it gives a center stage
to a number of the elements that are
available inside of your application it
does make it look really seamless and
all of the animations look really nice
you're going to get a preview of what
material design kind of looks like when
you get when and if if and when you get
your SmartWatch whether it's the Moto
360 which does look really nice the
Samsung gear live or the LG G watch so
we do have a lot to look forward to in
the world of Android but in the world of
just google it in general it was very
much about the code the developer
centric aspects there was a whole
section in the middle of the keynote
that I really a lot of stuff went over
my head because I do think that if I was
a developer I would be excited about all
that was act that was announced at the
keynote the one that did really get me
though was Android one and I suppose the
Moto e was probably our our best example
what Android one was going to become
eventually in that we had a device that
was literally made just for emerging
markets and it was very competitively
priced in that market somewhere maybe
around one hundred dollars in the case
of the Moto e it was Al it just a little
bit more than that but may not come with
all of the best specifications and even
sundar sundar Pichai said himself he
uses high-end space science spec phones
all the time but by using one of the
Android one devices that are made for
the Indian market currently he was able
to have a lot of fun with its toe and it
was perfectly fine personally I'm really
excited to see where the wearable tech
division goes we did have I did I did
mention in my we are here at Google i/o
video that there was a term that I saw
describing one of the sessions that I
wish I was able to attend and that was
ubiquitous technology and in a way what
we have in front of us with Google
leading the charge is a loo of
smartwatches google glass and all of
these smartphones obviously that are
created by the various manufacturers and
that when you have your technology and
people are trying to get in in touch
with you people trying to reach you and
you're trying to get information about
anything let's say this week it was all
about the world cup go team USA I'm
sorry that they lost today
the the point of ubiquitous technology
is when you get that one piece of
information that you need it gets to you
in every which way possible if you have
google glass on it comes up right away
it becomes a part of your world when you
have it in your SmartWatch it comes up
in an easy fashion where you can look at
your watch and not have to take out your
phone and scroll through everything that
you need but then after that you of
course have the smartphone which is
basically at this point the hub of all
of our technology and all that we use in
order to communicate with not only other
people put the world around us and I
really do think that's a great it's a
great future that we're looking at and
Google of course is leading the charge I
want to just say thank you for being
there with us at Google i/o being there
with with me as I low as I loan go
through all of the coverage that was
here I hope that you guys enjoyed all
the coverage that we had and I certainly
enjoyed myself even though it was pretty
much eighty-five percent all about the
work but you know when you look down at
all the people who are walking at this
second floor down here we realize that
the future of the technology that you
have in your pocket that you have in
your hand it's kind of the crux the onus
is on all of these people to create the
experiences that eventually you will end
up enjoying and you know what I got to
give thanks to the developers I am so
far away from what a developer can be
described after all my badge is red
which means that I'm press and usually
what people do when they see the red
badge as they kind of point me to the PR
people which is fine that's fine but I
do have to say that the developers are
the ones that we should be giving a lot
of things to because they work very hard
to put together all these applications
that eventually wind up using and make
our lives better and they're all here to
learn how to make their own products
better so that they can help make your
lives better so a big shout out to them
I also want to give a shout out to
anybody who may be watching this video
who actually came and said hi to meet or
maybe about half a dozen people who said

recognized me from these videos and one
