Authority what's going on everybody
and supposedly maybe for the last time
I'm gonna be coming to you live from
Google i/o 2014 here at the Moscone
Center in now sunny San Francisco it was
really windy and kind of gloomy last day
but yeah just kind of giving you my
reactions to this year's i/o there were
a lot of great announcements at the
keynotes the near three hour long
keynote that is and despite a couple of
protesters that couldn't bring down the
spirit of development and the spirit of
the future of technology here at the
Google Developers Conference you can see
all the people behind me there are a ton
of people just lining up everywhere for
various sessions now I will say real
quick that I didn't want to attend a
session but I was not able to because
well this year's i/o was cut short by
one day last year we had three whole
days to be able to do a lot so when I
was there last year the first day was
about getting all of the keynotes
announcements on tape and then the
second day was about going to sessions
and catching up on anything we missed it
and third day was all about fun I had to
kind of condense the last two days of
last year into this one day today so you
saw Android auto in the nice demo
Android TV also in a pretty nice demo
and after that I was able to actually go
around a little bit and actually uh have
fun with a couple of the boots that are
actually upstairs because the second
boot that the second floor rather is
where a lot of the sort of developer
centric areas are this community lounge
where people can actually code and learn
about code and one about the development
of their applications and the
distribution of their applications
upstairs there were a few games I played
a couple in particular one of them was
with project tango where I was able to
demo their actual zombie game zombie
gunship reality and have to use the dev
sensors the entire project tango suite
in order to destroy or rather kill the
zombies there by running around in the
small space
after that was a quiz that I was able to
actually I did win I I got this large
shirt with the icon of the player that I
was playing and it was the cyclops the
devilish cyclops it was called the big
web quiz and here is the Cyclops right
here it's too bad they didn't have any
small these are large I don't know what
I'm gonna do with it but I have it in my
possession it's just my trophy for
winning that quiz but yeah there is fun
to be had here and there's a lot to be
able to do at Google i/o I will say that
it is not the best conference for the
general consumer that's something we
said last year as well
but the consumer can have a lot of fun
here learning about the new products the
new devices that might be coming out
based upon the new software that
developers are creating but as far as
devices go everyone was expecting
something like Nexus 6 or maybe the new
Nexus tablet or first for for some
reason but also we had Android TV which
is great Android auto but the main
announcements when it came to devices if
you were just looking from a purely
consumer standpoint were the
smartwatches and I'm wearing my LG G
watch right here I'm having a lot of fun
with this G watch I still have to film
my reactions not really reactions my
first impressions on the LG G watch
after you may have seen already my
unboxing and my initial setup but for
the most part I do really like the way
that all of this is put together and you
know even with all of the cards one
thing I will say just in this video is
even though a lot of people were afraid
that you might have to scroll a whole
lot just to get to where you want to go
that's not really the case it it the
crux of it is primarily from your
notifications so as you dismiss your
notifications so to do you dismiss all
of the different cards that are going to
show up eventually you're just gonna
have the watch face and that's all
you're going to have from there though I
did want to talk about the new L preview
and the L preview is essentially going
to be what we will call I don't know
what we're gonna call it maybe lemon
drop lemon bar I would love lemon bar
that'd be great lollipop is kind of
funny licorice is kind of funny but we
don't know what it's going to be called
- it's called the L preview right now
that has some new graphical elements to
it and right now it's being called a
material design I do think the material
design is pretty nice
we already saw it kind of in the new
Google+ application update and when it
gives a center stage to a number of the
elements that are available inside of
your application it does make it look
really seamless and all of the
animations look really nice your going
to get a preview of what material design
kind of looks like when you get when and
if if and when you get your SmartWatch
whether it's the Moto 360 which does
look really nice the Samsung gear live
or the LG G watch so we do have a lot to
look forward to in the world of Android
but in the world of just Google in
general it was very much about the code
developer centric aspects there was a
whole section in the middle of the
keynote that I really a lot of stuff
went over my head because I I do think
that if I was a developer I would be
excited about all that was act that was
announced at the keynote the one that
did really get me though was Android one
and I suppose the Moto e was probably
our our best example what Android one
was going to become eventually in that
we had a device that was literally made
just for emerging markets and it was
very competitively priced in that market
somewhere maybe around $100 in the case
of the Moto e it was it look just a
little bit more than that but it may not
come with all of the best specifications
and even sundar sundar Pichai said
himself he uses high ends best high-end
spec phones all the time but by using
one of the Android one devices that are
made for the India market currently he
was able to have a lot of fun with it so
and it was perfectly fine personally I'm
really excited to see where the wearable
tech division goes we did have I did I
did mention in my we are here at Google
i/o video that there was a term that I
saw describing one of the sessions that
I wish I was able to attend and that was
ubiquitous technology and in a way what
we have in front of us with Google
leading the charge is a Lou of
smartwatches Google glass and all of
these smart phones obviously that are
created by the various manufacturers and
that when you have your technology and
people are trying to get in in touch
with you people trying to reach you and
you're trying to get information about
anything let's say this week it was all
about the World Cup go Team USA I'm
sorry that they lost today
the the the point of ubiquitous
technology is when you get that one
piece of information that you need it
gets to you in every which way possible
if you have Google glass on it comes up
right away it becomes a part of your
world when you have it in your
SmartWatch it comes up in an easy
fashion where you can look at your watch
and not have to take out your phone and
scroll through everything that you need
but then after that you of course have
the smart phone which is basically at
this point the hub of all of our
technology and all that we use in order
to communicate with not only other
people but the world around us and I
really do think that's a great it's a
great future that we're looking at and
Google of course is leading the charge I
want to just say thank you for being
there with us at Google i/o being there
with with me as I low as I alone go
through all of the coverage that was
here I hope that you guys enjoyed all
the coverage that we had and I certainly
enjoyed myself even though it was pretty
much 85 percent all about the work but
you know when you look down and all the
people who are walking at the second
floor down here when you realize that
the future of the technology that you
have in your pocket that you have in
your hand it's kind of the crux the onus
is on all of these people to create the
experiences that eventually you will end
up enjoying and you know what I got to
give a thanks to the developers I am so
far away from what a developer can be
described after all my badge is red
which means that I'm pressed and usually
what people do when they see the red
badge is they kind of point me to the PR
people which is fine that's fine but I
do have to say that the developers are
the ones that we should be giving a lot
of things to because they work very hard
to put together all of these
applications that eventually we end up
using and make our lives better and
they're all here to learn how to make
their own products better so that they
can help make your lives better so a big
shout out to them I also want to give a
shout out to anybody who may be watching
this video who actually came and said hi
to me there were maybe about half a
dozen people who said what's up to me
just because they had recognized me from
these videos and one that I do love you

want you

could possibly give you the experience
of Google i/o whether that's through the
after-hours party that I'm going to give
that video on in a little bit you're
gonna love that after-hours party if I
wasn't able to make a fun reel this year
regarding you know all the fun that I
could have on the floor of Google i/o
well the after-hours party after the
first day the night of the first day was
just an absolute blast and I'm gonna do
go I'm gonna definitely give you that
video in a little bit but after that you
could just see the hustle-bustle behind
me and I wanted you to be just someone
