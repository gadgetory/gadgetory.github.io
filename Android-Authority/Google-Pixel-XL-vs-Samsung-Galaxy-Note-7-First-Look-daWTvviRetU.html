most literal terms possible the very
best that Samsung has to offer goes up
against the best that Google has to
offer instruction for gar from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
here we have a quick look at the pixel
XL versus the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 now
right off the bat it's obvious that both
of these phones are very different but
the question between these two could
actually be a matter of productivity
while with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 you
have the obvious addition of the s-pen
and all the note-taking and even almost
mouse-like capabilities that the pen can
bring to the Android experience Google
is now injecting a lot of what it has
been building over the last number of
years into what they call the best of
smart AI in a smart phone and that of
course is Google assistant part of
Android 7.1 nougat that is available
only on the pixels at least for now but
before we get to all of that the designs
first where we have the dual glass
panels that have edges on the front and
the back so that they come to meet a
very smooth middle in the frame of the
samsung galaxy note 7 it's one of the
sleekest devices that Samsung and
probably any phone manufacturer has made
and it goes up against a more bare-bones
looking phone in the pixel Excel now
bare-bones doesn't necessarily mean
anything bad it's just that it focuses
more on capabilities rather than being
flashy in its aesthetic the big G on the
back makes it clear that this is a
Google phone and of course there is the
slab of glass at the top third that
encompasses the rear-facing fingerprint
reader and the camera optics reaching
all the way to the top now Samsung does
get a leg up in this category because it
does have a I P 68 rating meaning that
it is dust tight and can be immersed in
water up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes
both displays are AMOLED displays in the
case of the samsung galaxy note 7 it's a
Super AMOLED display the pixel XL is
still a beauty to behold with its 5.5
inch screen that should be able to
provide a quad HD resolution a lot of
the same experiences that you will get
on the note 7 that said however the note
7 does have always-on display which can
be catered to your taste
so you can always have certain
information on hand
in terms of performance the newer
devices of course going to have the
upper hand and that is the case with the
Snapdragon 820 one with four gigabytes
of RAM that you get in the pixel and the
pixel XL however when it comes to the
extra capabilities the pixel Excel
actually falters a little bit it does
come in variations of 32 and 128
gigabytes but the samsung galaxy note 7
comes in just 64 gigabytes with
expandable storage via a micro SD card
slot
however the pixel excel is trying to
bridge that gap a little bit by
providing unlimited storage at full
resolution for all photos and videos so
there is an easy way of freeing up space
if you so need to now battery life
should actually be a bit similar as both
phones feature nearly identical
specifications the note 7 does have the
slightly bigger 3500 milliamp hour
battery but that's only 50 milliamp
hours over that of the pixel XL but also
both have fast charging capabilities
with the pixel X I'll able to get seven
hours of battery life in just 15 minutes
worth of charge which more or less
should be about the same as what the
note 7 is capable of getting in a very
short time but when it comes to security
yes the fingerprint readers are very
good on either of these phones and we
expect them to remain so but Samsung did
put in the iris scanner which is a new
way of getting into the device and
locking certain portions of it by using
one's own eyes butts in the cameras that
we're really going to enjoy going
through the comparisons here because the
note 7 has a very wonderful camera that
was derived from the Samsung Galaxy s7
that comes in at 12 megapixels with AF
1.7 aperture optical image stabilization
and that dual pixel setup for large
pixels but also improved light intake
and better autofocus faster autofocus
actually but the Google pixel XL is
actually not that far behind it too has
a twelve point three megapixel camera
but it does not have oh is it relies on
e is which is a software based
stabilization it also should have some
pretty fast autofocus but probably not
as fast as that of the note 7 and it has
an F 2.0 aperture however it does have
what is supposed to be really great
video stabilization and it's low-light
should be it pretty good especially when
you consider that the pixel XL was given
a very high rating by DX Oh Mark a fact
that Google was very keen on letting
buddy now now the user experience will
pretty much predicated on Android and
multitasking preferences now you have
two different versions of Android here
where the note 7 is definitely not going
to have at least 4 now the features of
Android 7.1 new get that is coming on
the pixel Excel and that main feature is
Google Assistant essentially replacing
Google now on tap that we have enjoyed
on a lot of different Android phones by
now Google assistant is incredibly
contextually aware and has a wonderful
speech recognition technology that will
allow for all queries and requests to
actually be taken to task inside of the
Android software itself even with the
short time that we had we could not find
anything that the Google assistant was
not ready to search for and it was even
able to pop up all of the appropriate
applications based upon what our
requests were but on the other hand you
do have the note 7 with its s-pen that
also comes with all of Samsung's
additions that of course make it a very
feature heavy device you have the multi
window pop-up view you also have the
ability to do screen off memos at any
time and you can take notes and even
capture the screen or scroll through a
website that will allow you then to
write onto it with the pen so you can
make notes on pretty much anything that
you're looking at with that in mind it's
easy to say that the pixel Excel might
be limited by what the vanilla Android
experience has to offer but vanilla
Android has actually been getting a lot
of flavor over the last number of years
and now with Google Assistant it might
become one of the best productivity
phones that are out there it simply
comes down to the way that you want to
get your stuff done either you take
notes all the time and you actually use
all the multitasking features of Samsung
or you're willing to do a lot of what
you need on the pixel excel or the pixel
using just your voice now this might be
one of those few comparisons where the
pixel excel which is a very premium
device comes in at actually less money
than that of other phones that's
compared to and the note 7 is one of
those phones the note 7 years around
$900 in some US carriers and the pixel
itself is $649 with the pixel excel in
question here coming in at seven hundred
and sixty nine dollars and obviously
until we get our hands on a review units
we will not be able to answer that
question of whether or not that much
money is enough for what is androids
reference device but Google is really
trying to
move forward with its platform not only
in the pixel but across a lot of devices
that will use Google assistance in the
mean time however the galaxy note 7 does
have its own advantages and it is still
one of the best productivity phones that
are out there keep it tuned to Andra
thority for a full comparison between
these two phones including camera
comparisons which we're very excited to
do and don't forget to check out our
full hands-on with the pixel and the
pixel XL which you can find here at
