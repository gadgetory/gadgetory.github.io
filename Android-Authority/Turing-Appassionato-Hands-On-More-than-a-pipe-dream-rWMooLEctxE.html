everybody and this is our first look at
the turning apassionata now the last
couple of years for turning robotics
industries has been well complicated the
last one was highly anticipated by a
large amount of you but there were some
unfortunate circumstances that kept the
phone from sticking to Android or even
coming out at all
now two years after I looked at the
original Turing phone the company is
back with a new offering that not only
sticks to its Android promise but brings
one insane capability you won't find
anywhere else the phone is still made of
liquid morphia this time a version 2.0
special alloy that is one of the
strongest materials used on any smart
phone ever but that's about all that the
appassionato has in common with its
ill-fated predecessor as much of what TR
I tried to do in the past is simply not
part of the present the original Turing
phone in the name of security did away
with the headphone jack and put a
proprietary charging port on it but with
the appassionato you get the USB C port
and a headphone jack returning there's
really one word that came to mind when I
got my hands on TR I sophomore attempt
shiny there are a couple of versions of
the appassionato that come in black and
silver chassis though I was given a
limited Gold Edition that will not be
making it to the masses until a little
bit later and all versions the Nano
injection molded body is complemented by
Gorilla Glass on both sides and sports
an artsy feathered design it might look
like a peacock but in reality it's
actually a Chinese black rooster a 2k
AMOLED display comes in at 5.5 inches in
size making the phone just a bit bigger
than might be comfortable for one-handed
usage and of course with that gorilla
glass on the back and also the metal
sides the phone might slip out a little
bit but the AMOLED display is a good
step forward for color saturation and so
far it looks pretty good underneath it
all the phone tries to keep up with
high-end specifications despite there
being a Snapdragon 820 one in this phone
which puts it behind the eight thirty
five you get a gigabytes of RAM and 128
gigabytes of on-board storage the camera
is practically the same camera from the
pixel it's only IMX sensor
at 12 megapixels and comes with all the
typical modes including 4k video
recording the front-facing camera is an
8 megapixel shooter though we will have
camera samples available for our full
review so stay tuned for that which
brings us to the software which was a
big story from the original turning
phone Android eventually got mixed for
sailfish OS which was highly unfortunate
but Android returns in the appassionato
with version 7.1 point 2 TR is security
features were supposed to bolster
Android 5 but now Android 7 is plenty
secure so they have shifted their focus
instead t.ri wants to provide a
streamlined Android experience and what
you get on the appassionato is
essentially a stock Android experience
you can even swipe up on the home screen
to bring up the app drawer much like on
the pixel and there are no bells and
whistles or extras added onto the stock
experience which makes this a much more
accessible version of Android than was
found in the original touring phone but
keeping the software guts simple allows
the appassionato to really showcase its
main feature ceralun
what we have right now our digital
artificial intelligence assistance
however what t.ri is trying to do is add
a human touch to all of that TR eyes
philosophy claims that current digital
AI assistants is rather limited as it
needs to be given as much information as
possible but will eventually not be able
to follow up on the other hand there are
full concierge services that are
included with certain tech products like
those from virtu however phones like
that have a price point of upwards of
$10,000 instead t.ri is trying to make
the appassionato merge the two google
assistant is currently available as the
digital AI assistant and for everything
else ceralun is at your beck and call
built into the app our suggestions for
local spots and events that users might
be interested in though right now they
seem to be focused on specific cities
but what if you need to take things
further a team of human assistants will
be able to anticipate further needs of
users and be able to follow up and they
are not only available through certain
functions of ceralun but they are also
available 24/7 via calls or email you
can even just call us or Allen
representative whenever you need to for
just about any task you need to get done
Oh excellent
you must be Joshua Vergara yes that
would be me and we are available to you
24 hours a day we assist with everything
quick questions
research travel requests we've had
clients look for something a piece of
art to purchase of a rare breed of horse
a an antique car whatever people think
up you know what inch of you is what
interests us so if you make certain
requests we have certain themes and
topics we make note of it and we
personalize your profile well I'm
sitting in the Langham Hotel out in
Pasadena right now and I was just
curious what the name of the restaurant
here is and what its reviews were so the
Royce is known for Australian Wagyu beef
and it is the it looks like the
preeminent restaurant there and lends
now if you want a dining reservation or
or you know lunch or anything it's 1:30
so I imagine they're probably getting
towards the end of lunch service but if
you'd like a dining reservation let me
know ok you Joe
Ola I'll call back if I investigate all
right well fantastic nice of hearing
from you mr. Berger thanks so much for
your call to Sir Alan concierge and have
fun with the service and sort of take it
to the limit if you'd like them or just
use it for day-to-day and however you
feel most comfortable
ok I'll definitely try to do that thank
you very much ok all right thank you
have a great afternoon alright bye bye
YouTube GRI hopes that sir Alan's
capabilities will go far and beyond what
we're used to with services like Google
assistant but of course it is about
merging the two together imagine using
Google assistant to discover a concert
that is happening in a week and instead
of scouring the internet yourself for
the best ticket a quick call to Sir Alan
will put your assistant to work for you
a step forward in what might be called
amplified intelligence makes the
appassionato a phone that is less of a
straightforward simply fancy Android
device and more in addition to one's
overall lifestyle though it sounds like
a very expensive feature to add it is
actually included into the price of the
appassionato which is 999 dollars with
the 999 dollars as its price point you
get the high-end luxurious appassionato
along with two years of ceralun service
after which time you can move on to the
next turning phone and then you will get
another subscription to Sir Alan
included with it
now I don't blame anybody for taking all
of this information with a grain of salt
after all the previous phone didn't make
it into everybody's hands but this time
around GRI has partnered up with TCL one
of the biggest manufacturers that is
responsible for the hardware for
companies like blackberry and even virtu
so a lot of the issues that plague to
the original Turing phone should be
alleviated but we're going to obviously
see when it comes out in the fall we
will have a full review of the turing
appassionato in the weeks to come and
we'll do a more in-depth look at the
amplified intelligent system sir Allen
and you can stay tuned for even more
about TR is a latest device here at
Android authority so make sure you
subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already and stick around because we are
your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
