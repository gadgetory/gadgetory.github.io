by Toyota hey guys the Stars lack of a
here with android authority reporting
live at CES 2014 we're here as
showstoppers we have the privilege of
visiting epson I'm here with Eric Musa
fuka he's a product manager with epson
and they have some really incredible
augmented reality glasses that have some
pretty profound application but this
gentleman can speak to a much better
than I can absolutely so we're here to
introduce the epson mo very oh BTW 200
smart glasses what you can see is that
we have two displays that are centered
in your field of view so effectively you
get a large floating image right out
there in front of you in addition we
have motion sensors a front-facing
camera that allow you to fully sense the
environment or augmented reality and
best the best get we run Android yeah so
via this touch controller we run Android
40 and it does run off a touchpad
interface yeah and you do get a six hour
battery life nice and that powers the
whole unit how is the whole unit two
bright displays and the cool thing you
can render 3d content since we're
binocular you can render 3d content in
your actual environment let's talk
connectivity for a second here
absolutely so if you want to beam
content we actually are seeking miracast
certification okay but we are compatible
so you can beam content from a mere cast
device to this and you can also be MIT
out of this to a meerkats Wi-Fi
Bluetooth NFC in terms of
activities your smartphone is there any
sort of you can absolutely Wi-Fi tether
and we do have bluetooth as well so talk
about a person buys these what sort of
expectations should they have and what
it can actually do right now so right
now we have some very cool kind of light
virtual reality games that you've
probably experienced many games are we
talking um we've got three that are
being demoed by a developer named sean
mccracken of imaginary computer is
actually a very well-known glass
developer iraq and very popular and
namco bandai has an augmented rahman in
action exactly has an augmented reality
tabletop virtua fighter game really cool
yeah and you know we have a number of
partners as a streaming media on the
streaming media site in any Android app
you can basically side load onto the
divider tap on start the play button yep
plate and then you're going to drop you
in a city scene so if you sweep your
head around it's kind of an
environmental I can still see the
reality which is less appealing than
what I see on the screen and once the
timer starts counting down okay I see a
red ring now okay the red ring is your
target or basically retarget you want to
point it at some of the alien spaceships
and don't let them destroy the bell come
in and don't shoot the buildings oh it's
amazing so it runs android port 10 six
hours battery life what's the price
point 699 okay and you can order on our
website now by a pre-launch com yeah
that'll get you first in line and we're
going to be shipping in March but of
course you're going to send one to
Android authorities so we can share with
all our loyal viewers absolutely and we
would love for some Android developers
to come up with some cool concepts for
what can be done in augmented reality I
mean something like this has I mean all
these things that are augmented reality
capable they have such limitless
potential that we're just trying to get
a head start centrally so
can understand because we were at the
very beginning absolutely long paradigm
shift and how we use our technology
absolutely and we're really excited to
be at the kind of leading edge of that I
can feel the love yeah and for more
information you can visit epson calm /
mulberry o mo ve are I oh okay or follow
