event here in New York City for the HTC
One m8 we got our hands on it with a
review unit so you already know what's
coming up next because it's Josh regard
from Android I thought oh what's going
on everybody and it's time to unbox and
give my first impressions on the HTC One
m8 alright in here it is the box for the
18 t version of the HTC One m8 s now one
thing you will notice is the branding on
a lot of these boxes if not all of them
will not have the ma 2 there if they do
it will be very small and subscripted on
the name primarily because when HTC
wanted to make here is a new model of
their flagship phone so that whenever a
customer comes into one of the stores
they will ask for the HTC One and
they'll be pointed directly to the
newest one it's just the way that
they're hoping the rest of the models
will be from now on
which is a pretty sound type of deal
that they want to make and in this case
we have the brand new version that was
newly announced and released today and I
got my hands on one so we're going to go
ahead and jump right into the unboxing
and here we go now the one takeaway that
you need here is that in order for HTC
to retain its customers in a way that's
what their philosophy is if you drop
your phone within the first 6 months of
using it and the screen breaks they will
replace it for free now that's one
really cool part of the of the HTC
advantage and also the fact that the
software will be updated for the next
two years at the very least so that's a
that's the first layer of it we have the
device over here as you've been probably
seeing already and of course I got the
gray version as is probably what a lot
of people got with the review units and
here you go with all the plastic that's
around but we'll get to that in a little
bit all right pilling off the next layer
we're just going to put that one aside
we have all the bits and pieces
including our sim card here from UT as
far as the accessories go we have of
course the plug adapter for the micro
USB cord we have the micro USB cord
itself and then from there we also have
the inclusion of some stereo headset
headphones these look like they are
the red color that now remember
HTS the HTC One m8 does not come with
Beats Audio that's a branding that is no
longer a part of HTC's wheelhouse and
what we have here are some nice-looking
ones
ironically these do kind of look like
the Beats Audio headphones in terms of
the shape but they are definitely not
and there you go after what amounted to
be a pretty long and lengthy Buddha
process we finally got into the
operating system and went through the
setup and here you go this is
essentially the Sense 6 UI or The Sixth
Sense as they were calling it in the
show and you can see that everything
kind of moves along very smoothly the
Snapdragon 801 does its job and works
really nicely here I'm going to start
getting some notifications in a little
bit but that's fine haven't really set
up my accounts on here just yet but the
first thing that we did get greeted with
was blinkfeed right over here and
basically what we're seeing here on
blinkfeed is the initial setup we can
swipe to the right from the side in
order to start putting in our new
sources and our social media outlets and
of course if I was going to click on one
of the places to start getting started
if I was to select all of these
different services here I would have to
sign into every single one of them
that's something I'll probably just
handle a little bit later but one of the
best parts about this updated version is
the fact that you have the power of wit
here and this is always a great prospect
this allows you really easy access to
all of the most important things and
it's also customizable so you'll be able
to add all of the different shortcuts
that you want there and with that tiled
interface it actually looks quite nice
one in four in terms of the actual
handling in the feel of the device I
have the same impressions as I did in
our first look and hands on I actually
really liked that the aluminum is now 90
percent of the phone and comes around
the sides and makes things very smooth
and rounded on the sides to make it
easier to hold the rigidity of the
original m7 was something that I just
couldn't really get past and the curve
on the back still does a good job of
making it very comfortable in the hand
and there's only really one thing about
the HTC One that you cannot do
when you show it to anybody who may or
may not have had the phone in the past
it is still I caching whether or not you
like the hairline as you can see their
brush aluminum finish on the back is
really up to you but it still catches
your eye and that's something that you
can't really deny the phone it's still a
very attractive one to boot so there you
go this is the unboxing and first
impressions on the HTC One m8 stay tuned
for the rest of our coverage of this new
HTC flagship phone stay tuned for the
future focus videos especially on the
camera which we're really excited to put
through its paces and also for all of
the best coverage stay tuned to Android
