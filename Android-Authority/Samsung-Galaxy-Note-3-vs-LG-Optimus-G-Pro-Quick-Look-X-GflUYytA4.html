closest competitor it's Josh of agar
from Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is a quick look at
the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and the lg
optimus G pro we're dealing with very
similar form factors here in this sub
5.5 inch game with the Optimus G pro we
have the 5.5 inch screen with a general
look and feel similar to the note 2 with
its glossy plastic and removable back
cover
there is no S Pen equivalent in the G
Pro however so it is closer to a general
smartphone than what the note line
offers in the case of the note 3 a
thinner bezel all around the screen
lends to a slightly larger 5.7 inch
screen but it is lighter thinner and
narrower in size all around than the G
Pro Samsung wanted to start changing the
game up by doing away with the glossy
plastic and employing textured plastic
that is honestly much better in look and
feel the G Pro might be a little
slippery due to its plastic and it's
fingerprint prone all of which the
textured plastic fixes on the note 3
these phones are quite similar but the
real differentiator here is the s-pen if
a stylus experience is what you want the
choice is actually pretty simple here
the display is take on the typical LG
vs. Samsung Battle of IPS versus Super
AMOLED both phone screens are capable of
1080p resolution and provide very good
performance for people who want a great
media experience through a larger
display while the high saturation brings
very vibrant colors to the note 3 the
Optimus G pro screen is no slouch and
the IPS type brings great brightness
when it comes to performance it's a
matter of which phone came out later the
Optimus G pro has been out for a little
while now but was one of the first
phones to support the Snapdragon 600
clocked in at 1.7 gigahertz it's very
fast processor that complements the
Optimus UI quite well lending to a lot
of multitasking with the Q apps and
functions the note 3 gets the updated
Snapdragon 800 clocked in a 2.3
gigahertz and gets the updated at Draino
330 its performance in our initial
testing was very good remaining snappy
and very smooth a bump up to 3 gigabytes
of RAM helps the note 3 achieve even
more multitasking when you consider the
new s-pen functionalities in cameras the
G pro camera is slightly dated
especially one considering that the LG
g2 has an updated and more full-featured
application
don't recording was a first in the G Pro
but a number of functions that the note
3 is capable of help put it over the top
much of the note threes capabilities in
the camera were originally found in the
s4 so its quality is expected to be
quite good the G Pro is capable of good
photos as well it just doesn't have as
many creative modes finally in software
it's all about multitasking the G Pro
helped bolster the trend of the cue apps
and functions all of which add various
functionalities like multi windows and
small apps on top of what is already
being done a cue button in the top left
corner allows for easier access to a
specific function including quick memos
similar functionality is available in
the note 3 and all are centered around
the s-pen whose nuaire command menu
grants easy access to these functions
action memos and pen windows and as
searches are all available at the tip of
the pen ultimately it comes down to the
s-pen and if that appeals more to you as
the TouchWiz and optimist you eyes are
pretty much capable of very similar
functions and so there you have it these
two are definitely closer in comparison
not just in size but in functions if
anything the Optimus G pro is due for an
update since the g2 has just been
released so it's exciting to see what LG
can do to blast back at the note 3 until
then stay tuned to android authority for
all of the best coverage of the note 3
and of Aoife in berlin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
