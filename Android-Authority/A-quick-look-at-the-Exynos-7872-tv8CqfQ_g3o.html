comb has a large market share with its
kind of it's 600 Snapdragon 600 series
in Snapdragon 400 series however Samsung
have now released a new Exynos processor
the external 787 - which is directly
aimed at devices in the mid range in
fact it features in the new me a zoo
handset that was released recently so
the question is what is the X nos 787 -
and how does it work well please let me
explain
so of course we often get excited and a
very enthusiastic about the latest
flagship processors that come out we're
looking at the performance we're looking
at the GPUs and all that kind of thing
but actually a lot of people don't buy
flagship devices they buy mid-range
devices and so the quality and the
performance of processors in the
mid-range is vitally important to many
many consumers and to that end Samsung
have released the xnor 787 - so what is
it well it's a 64-bit processor but it's
not an octa-core processor as we're very
familiar with this is a hexa core
processor
now why have they gone with a hexa core
setup well in the low end there are four
energy-efficient cortex a53 processes
and the cortex a53 is what we find
across so many processors even in an
octa-core configuration is just all
eight of them or as part of a big drop
little configuration now that's fine
that's great and it's a very reliable
and very efficient processor now
normally in the mid rays there might be
another four of those clock that may be
a higher clock rate and that kind of
gives you that mid-range processor but
actually what x-naught have done Samsung
have done this time in the Exynos is
there are two so it's a hexa core setup
there are two cortex a 73 processors and
the core today 73 is a good fast
processor and what they've done they've
sacrificed the space of those four cores
and put in there to much higher
performing cause now what that means to
the average consumer is that the user
interface will feel much more fluid
downloading webpages will feel much more
fluid anything that is kind of single
task concentrating will feel much faster
and of course there will be situations
where all six cores are firing off doing
their work and even those will
very fast now while the CPU is actually
quite an exciting setup hexa-core with
two of those a 73 calls on the GPU side
we have a very good GPU in the sense
that it's thick Marley G 71 which is an
excellent GPU however this only has one
GPU core now if you compare that to a
high-end device I mean the last Exynos
processor had 18 G 72 or 20 from the G
7120 cores
this has one core so that's a huge
difference to what you get at the
flagship end and we really will have to
see what the gaming performance is like
when this is actually put to the test
other things worth mentioning is built
on a 14 nanometer fabrication process it
uses low-power ddr3 rams that's going to
be a bit slower it doesn't support your
camera only supports single camera at 21
megapixels but it can do full HD
recording in h.265 and h.264 it's also
got a 300 megabits a second LTE 4G modem
and I've got Bluetooth 5 built into it
now the main competitor to the 787 2 is
the Snapdragon 650 it's also a hexa core
setup but at the high end it's got the
cortex a 72 calls not the cortex a 73 so
from that we can say that the 78728
definitely can be faster than the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 however the 650
does have a couple of advantages for
example it can do 4k recording Wix the
787 to card
and of course Qualcomm also have another
couple of other iterations in the 650
line there's a 652 and the 653 which
actually have got octa-core setups with
for high performance calls rather than
just the 2 that you find in the hexa
core setup so what we intend to see when
these kind of devices are compared
side-by-side which one comes out on top
I'm really hoping that single core GPU
is not going to be a letdown 47 872 I'm
going since Randor Authority I hope you
enjoyed this quick overview of the xnor
78
- for the midrange if you did please do
give it a thumbs up don't forget to
