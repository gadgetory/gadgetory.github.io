Authority what's going on everybody and
as you can see behind me i am at ctia
2013 here in the scorching hot las vegas
nevada area it's closed a triple digit
degrees outside it's probably going to
get worse through the end of the week
but at least i'm inside in an
air-conditioned area at the sands
convention center where the convention
is being held
so at this conference it's basically
like a smaller Mobile World Congress
there aren't going to be that many big
announcements primarily because all of
the top-tier devices and products are
already out for 2013 however it is still
a great place for everyone to just sort
of come together and talk about the
future of mobile there are a lot of
great solutions and products that are
still available for us to cover I'm
going to do just that for you it is Las
Vegas so you are going to get the
typical you know there's booth babes and
there are a lot of really flashy kind of
sensory overload displays that are on
hand here on the show floor but that
just makes it all the same kind of
experience you would have in other
conventions of course like I said before
it's just a little bit smaller but we do
have a lot of great things to talk about
and I'm going to be bringing it all for
you where android authority over your
source for all things android and once
again we are here at ctia 2013
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
