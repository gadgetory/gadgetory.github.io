brought to you by domain.com hello
buggin ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe
Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to android apps weekly we
got some news let's talk about it a new
study came out this week that shows that
three out of the top floor regularly
used apps belong to Facebook the main
application whatsapp and Instagram all
owned by Facebook are in the top four
with blackberry messenger clocking in at
number two also there is Twitter
snapchat we chat and an application
called average while we're on the
subject of Facebook they've also started
testing out what's app integration in
some cases you now have the option to
send things to people directly to
whatsapp from the facebook application
which is interesting because the
services have remained separated for so
long it's not available for everyone so
if you want to try it out you'll have to
be patient a new humble bundle is out
right now you can pay whatever you want
to get bound in ro and a ver no escape
from the pits if you pay the average
which is around four dollars and 18
cents right now you can get 80 days
kingdom rush origins and riddick at the
merc files as always it's a great way to
give to charity and buy some awesome
games on the cheap reports are out that
say that youtube is preparing to launch
a subscription option that removes
advertising from all youtube videos
they're still working out the details
and we don't know how much it'll cost
but we do know that it's happening soon
you can pay to remove all the ads from
youtube and users rejoiced in our last
bit of news this week amazon prime
instant video is now officially
available for tablets this was some key
functionality that's been missing for a
long time but it's there now and you can
watch it it's a little convoluted to
install and it's a bit shaky to use but
it's there and now we wait for
chromecast support if you want to see
even more headlines updates and new
releases don't forget to check out this
week's newsletter we send it out every
Friday along with the show so give it a
bookmark and check out all of this
week's biggest android apps and games
news you can also sign up with your
email address if you want to ok folks is
take a look at the big applications that
made a splash this week playworld
superheroes is a new kids game that's a
mixture of a crafting game and an
action-adventure game players can crack
various costumes and such in the
treehouse and then take to the streets
to thwart bad guys the graphics and
gameplay mechanics are phenomenal and
this is definitely a step above most
kids games there are also no in-app
purchases app slinger is an application
that helps you find other applications
the premise is pretty civil because it
only shows you Apple
nations that are free to use this is
great for Android users on a budget and
those who don't want to go surfing
through the Play Store to find the good
free stuff the recommendations are
customizable and the app claims to never
show you the same application twice it's
interesting and so far has pretty good
ratings so it's worth a shot KX player
is a free music application with a dark
theme and some basic features it's not
trying to compete with something like
power amp but it's a good option for
those looking for something minimal
small and simple it has a built-in
equalizer including face boost and sound
effects and basic controls like editing
playlist and using repeat and shuffle it
is simple and it does lack some features
but it's also entirely free chroma
selleck is a unique game where you play
as a cell as you make your way around a
strange world by moving other microbes
and sells out of your way the mechanics
are simple and the graphics are colorful
and retro it also features an ambient
soundtrack it's definitely a designing
game type we don't see every day and
this exploration style gameplay is quite
enjoyable it's also only 99 cents and
there are no in-app purchases adventures
of poco eco is a beautifully designed
adventure game with colorful 3d graphics
and a story that has you helping poco
find his tribe it features atmospheric
music simple gameplay mechanics and
really focuses more on the whole
experience than any individual part of
the game it's a mixture of a puzzler and
an adventure game and it really is a joy
to play it's one dollar and ninety-eight
cents and there are no in-app purchases
for this one either okay folks thanks
again for watching but let's talk about
some serious business for a second the
next time you have a great idea to start
a website your first thought should be
domain.com for all of your hosting and
domain name needs with domain.com you
immediately get the power to control
what people find it when they search for
you online and let's face it folks
nothing looks more credible than having
a calm or dotnet domain name and isn't
that what your business and website
deserve the people over at domain.com
are going to hook up our viewers with a
great offer if you use the promo code
android at domain.com checkout you
receive fifteen percent off domain names
and web hosting services again that
promo code is Android when you think
domain names think domain.com once again
