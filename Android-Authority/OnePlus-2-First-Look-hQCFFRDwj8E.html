the hotly anticipated phones of this
year hey it's Josh of agar from Andhra
thority what's going on everybody and we
invite you to see our first look at the
one plus two at first glance and feel
the oneplus 2 does bear some
similarities to the oneplus one mainly
in its shape but also somewhat in its
size after all this is a 5.5 inch screen
returning again but the overall
footprint of the oneplus 2 is just a
little bit smaller than that of the
oneplus one which makes handling that
much better however looking on the front
you already have a very big change
that's very noticeable on the bottom
there and that is a home button now i
say button but it's not really a button
because you can't necessarily press down
on it instead that is a small divot in
the screen panel up front that is a area
designated for a fingerprint reader now
you basically just have to even if the
phone is off put your finger there and
it will read your fingerprint in turn on
the phone and unlock it right away
however because that whole area is also
the home button we do find that well if
you don't really press it in just the
right way it could cause the home button
to not necessarily work as reliably as
you would want it to but flanking it are
back in recent apps buttons that are
designated by just those little lines a
little bit different in terms of design
for the button layout of the oneplus one
and the functions of the two buttons can
be reversed if you want a left-handed or
right-handed perspective moving around
the metal frame which again gives it a
very solid feel will find the full
button layer on the right side the power
button underneath the volume rocker and
they feel very solid that's far in these
units that we're testing out the
headphone jack is up top and then when
we get to the left side we have a
notification toggle the notification
taco has three different positions and
pretty much pertains to the way that
Android currently provides notifications
either you have all notifications coming
in no notifications at all coming in
aside from of course your alarms and
then priority notifications which is the
middle portion of that toggle and really
it's a nice input to have that is
different for an Android ecosystem
definitely something that we've been
needing in android just a new type of
input especially for something like a
silenced toggle which we think is quite
useful and if it's customizable in the
future it could provide a lot of new
possibilities down on the bottom is the
brand new port they want
- we'll be one of the first phones if
not the first phone to provide USB
type-c it has its port now the cable
that comes with the oneplus 2 packaging
has a reversible side so you have the
USB type-c that can be put in in either
orientation and the same thing goes for
the other side where you would connect
it to your charger or to your computer
for example however USB type-c also
provides another benefits in the case of
the oneplus 2 and that it only costs
about five dollars it's going to be sold
at cost which makes the oneplus 2 cable
for USB type-c one of the easiest entry
points into what will become the new
standard for all smartphones and release
in the Android space now we do find it
just a little bit of a bummer that the
screen is not of a quad HD resolution
but we also think that's kind of
understandable considering the price of
the phone which would kind of get bumped
up if the resolution of the screen was
really high that being said the Full HD
display on the oneplus 2 does provide
some nice viewing experiences the
viewing angles all seem pretty great and
in my opinion it does seem a little bit
brighter and has a little bit more
saturation compared to the oneplus one
but really it will provide the kind of
experience you would expect from a
high-end smartphone and really we have
no complaints thus far and we'll have
more when we get our review units which
brings us to performance and the
Snapdragon 810 backed by the Adreno 430
and 4 gigabytes of RAM which is really
great however the Snapdragon 810 is at
version 2.1 which hopefully is going to
alleviate some of the problems that
Snapdragon 810 users had in other phones
mainly overheating issues and we've been
told that that has definitely been
addressed in the oneplus 2 on top of
that however oneplus has been saying
that they've worked very closely with
Qualcomm to make sure that their oxygen
OS is as optimized for the processor as
possible and thus far we've seen quite
quite a bit of speed and smoothness from
here really no stutters whatsoever the
kind of performance you would really
expect from a high-end smartphone
especially a flagship killer as it is
called in the oneplus 2 when it comes to
hardware there are a few new tropes with
the oneplus one one of the main ones
being that this phone will be dual SIM
everywhere now we understand that in the
West it might be a concept that's lost
on a lot of general users but we do like
dual SIM phones and if you are a
traveler it's going to come in very
handy for you when you're out in a place
where you need to have another SIM card
to be able to use mobile internet and
then when we go to the bag you'll see
this backing is removable and style swap
covers will be made available
immediately at launch and there are a
number of different kinds I have a
separate video showing off the different
style swap cover options but rest
assured that the cover on this one plus
two is very easy to replace and all of
the different styles look quite nice
from bamboo to even Kevlar and all of
those you can see in a style swab
comparison video that I have available
here again at Android Authority when it
comes to the camera we do like what we
see and we can't wait to really
scrutinize the camera experience once we
get our hands on review units but with
aperture F 2 point oh oh is and laser
guided autofocus there are quite a few
features on this camera that hopefully
will put it over the top when compared
to a lot of other flagships that being
said we do have some sample photos here
and this is not final software so you
can just sort of see what is in the
pipeline for the oneplus 2 but just rest
assured that oneplus has another version
of the software that's going to be made
available for the oneplus 2 once the
units go out and our review units are
received really though the camera
interface is pretty easy to use and the
ability to do various options like a
time-lapse and even 4k video recording
are all available in the oneplus 2
camera so we are excited to really test
it out once we get our hands on our unit
so make sure you stay tuned for that and
any camera shootouts that will follow
and finally in software we have a return
of oxygen OS this time we have oxygen OS
2.0 based on Android lollipop 5.1.1 so
it is updated quite a bit and oxygen
still retains the look of stock Android
for the most part it does provide a few
extra features but just looking through
the interface right now if you have used
any stock Android devices or even other
devices that have the stock like look to
it without too many other additions
baked in you pretty much know what to
expect here we do have some one-plus
centric additions that were in oxygen
1.0 like the button layout that can be
changed to an on screen navigation bar
rather than using the actual capacitive
keys on the bottom and there is also the
ability to add gesture so that if you
have the phone off you can do things
like double tap to wake or draw a circle
in order to open the camera but those
are all things that you've already seen
on oneplus devices before what has been
added in of course includes the finger
print reader but also the dark mode
which is a customization mode that
allows the phone to be pretty much
widely dark with only just white
accented colors in order for you to be
able to read it in dark situations like
for example if you're lying in bed and
then the other big main addition is the
shelf now the shelf replaces what could
be considered a Google now page all the
way to the left of your home screens and
essentially it is a nice-looking couple
of widgets you'll get frequent apps in
the middle there as you can see and they
have all of the many apps that you would
use the ones that are used in most are
going to be lined up in order and then
frequent contacts underneath that will
populate based upon the people that
you're calling and the people that
you're texting you can also put a little
cover on the top there that will allow
you to customize it and then if you have
this page open you can get to your most
used apps and contacts very easily now
shelf might change in look we're told
but really it's just a nice little
widget that's been made into a full
homescreen on the side of the oneplus
two's home screens all in all however
oxigen 2.0 is really an incremental step
forward out we do think that oxygen 2.0
is going to need even more features in
OTAs in the future in order to really
differentiate itself from other versions
of Android that are pretty much as stock
as you can get because that's what
oxygen still kind of feels like and so
there you have it for your first look at
the oneplus 2 whether or not it is going
to be the flagship killer of 2015 has
remains to be seen and when we get our
review unit we will put it through all
of its paces against all the other
phones in the market but thus far there
are some really compelling features on
here including some editions of input
including the fingerprint reader and
that notification toggle that provide
somewhat of a different experience that
do differentiate the oneplus 2 from the
rest the software may not do quite as
much in that regard and differentiating
itself but really what we're looking for
here is a solid experience at a low
price and that's exactly what you get
here for three hundred and eighty five
dollars you can get the 64 gigabyte
version of this phone and that is still
a pretty good price for a phone that is
not only unlocked outright but takes
dual Sims and has all of that storage
built in with all the power underneath
so stay tuned to and rathore e for even
more about the oneplus 2 and when we get
our review units we will be able to give
you even more coverage and give you our
full review once the time comes so make
sure you keep it tuned to Android or
because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
