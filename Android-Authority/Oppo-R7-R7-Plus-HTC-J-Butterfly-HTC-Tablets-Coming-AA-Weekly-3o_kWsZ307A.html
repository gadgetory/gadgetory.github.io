brought to you by Full Sail University
so looks like we got new phones and new
tablets coming down the pipe so let's
start with Oppo and Oppo has released
their own commercial for the r7 and the
r7 plus the r7 and the r7 plus have been
revealed in a couple of ads that are
already airing in China opal seems happy
to show off its new devices which is
refreshing change following years of
secretive over-the-top releases opal
even released a couple of Prescott's of
the new r7 and r7 plus showing that the
Plus version packs a fingerprint sensor
on the back similar to the oppo n3 the
r7 plus will also feature on-screen
navigation both phones seem to feature
metallic unibody constructions with 2.5
d glass on the front the r7 is expected
to feature a 5.2 inch display while
judging from the images the plus version
will be closer to 6 inches fast charging
one of the key features of the Oppo r5
and Oppo find 7 before it will of course
be included in the package Qualcomm
quick charge tech has made fast charging
widely available in modern flagships but
OPOs approach is superior according to
the Chinese company now for those of you
who were disappointed with the HTC One
m9 this may sting a bit
while HTC One m9 has its fans there are
a number of people who have criticized
the latest flagship for not doing enough
to set itself apart from its predecessor
not only is the design very similar to
the m8 but even the specs aren't a
dramatic jump forward especially when it
comes to the 1080p display for those
that were hoping for a bit more from the
one m9 you may want to take a look at
the latest iteration of the HTC J
butterfly although the body of this
phone is plastic instead of metal the
insides are as premium as ever with a
5.2 inch qHD display as Snapdragon 810
processor 27 hundred million power
battery 3 gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes
of internal storage with a micro SD card
slot boomsound front-facing speakers a
twenty point two megapixel duo camera
and a 13 megapixel front camera
the J butterfly is available in three
colors red white and blue and it also
sports water resistance now although
this phone is only exclusively available
in Japan for the moment it clearly is
better than the HTC One m9 so I got a
voice what all of us are thinking HTC
what the f but this may comfort you HTC
lovers out there HTC is looking at
creating more affordable tablets talking
to the Chinese media at the Taiwan
launch of the one m9 plus the HTC North
Asian boss Jack Tong said the company is
looking closely at the entry-level and
mid tier tablet market and I quote there
is less room for product differentiation
and a fierce price war so we must be
very cautious about running that
business we will see if we can get
better returns on smartphones or other
businesses but we are looking closely at
it Tong said now Tong did not confirm or
deny that HTC has an affordable tablet
coming down the pipe but his statement
is a reversal from what he said in
November when he hinted that HTC was
interested in the upper segment of the
market
Tong's comment seems to be related to a
rumor started by up leaks and picked up
by several websites earlier this week
HTC is working on low-end tablet devices
codenamed
h7 that should launch in q2 of this year
according to up Leakes who has a solid
track record when it comes to HTC
rumours no other details about the h7
are known just yet now for all the
growing number of Xiaomi fans out there
you'll be happy to know that there's a
rumor surrounding a new redmi chemise
popular redmi series of handsets could
be in for another revision if the recent
leak from up leaks is to be believed
known as the Xiaomi h3y or Curry's for
now the next potential entry into the
redmi series could end up housing some
interesting hardware although the
display size isn't known yet the rumor
suggests that the phone will arrive with
a 1080p resolution previous redmi
devices have shipped with 720p at a 4.7
inch display so the bump up to full HD
would provide a boost to the viewing
experience the processing package looks
like a mediatek mt6752 octa-core chip
utilizing a familiar
2.2 gigahertz cortex a53 setup arranged
in two clusters of four this is backed
up by two gigabytes of RAM now
personally I have really high hopes for
Xiaomi they're doing really well at
marketing and they're about to make this
big push to an online store so the rest
of us in the West we can only hope are
