Hindy the android authority app guide
Android has always been lacking in
really good sports games in this review
we're going to take a look at slam dunk
too will this help fill the void in the
sport genre in this video we're going to
find out if you were expecting a full
fledged basketball game you may be a tad
disappointed because slam dunk two is
not one of those what it is though is a
pretty fun little time waster game where
you tap and slide your finger to shoot
basketballs it takes very little time to
play so it's great for those casual
gamers out there the game takes place
solely and multiplayer it has google+
and facebook login support so there is
that there are also a variety of game
types although most of them fall under
the scope of a tournament match or a
head-to-head match tournaments are
simply head-to-head matchups against
multiple people in a bracket style
tournament the prizes are simple each
game costs coins if you win you get your
coins and the coins of your opponent and
you can guess what happens when you lose
the game itself is fairly easy to play
there are guidelines for the balls so
you can make it into the basket
practically every time the difficulty
isn't whether or not you'll be able to
make baskets because inside of a week
you'll hit nearly every shot the
difficulty lies in the speed as your
quickness can result in thousands of
extra points in a game there are a
couple of minigames that have absolutely
nothing to do with this title and I
don't anticipate any one really enjoying
them I mean we're here for basketball
who wants to play slots other than this
the game is pretty fun it won't appeal
to hardcore gamers hardly at all but
casual gamers should find some enjoyment
with this title the game is well
designed the menus are easy to navigate
and don't take any guesswork buttons are
well defined and the graphics are crisp
and colorful there are some slick
animations here and there and moving
around in the game could be described as
enjoyable games like asphalt 8 or angry
birds go could learn from the effective
yet simple menu designs in game it's the
same story the graphics are crisp and
the seam is colorful and appealing to
the eye you can unlock and purchase
several different basketballs with coins
which is also a nice touch as you
progress you can unlock more courts by
playing in more expensive tournaments
while the graphics are pretty nice the
game itself is simple so there isn't a
lot of change what you get is nice but
there isn't all that much in terms of
music the theme playing is reminiscent
of late 80s drum heavy rap me
which I actually kind of liked it gives
it a street urban feel which was kind of
nice okay so here's what we liked the
game is fun to play it doesn't require a
lot of skill to do well so it's good for
kids and adults it's quick so you can
play it anywhere and it's a good little
time waster the graphics and music are
well done nothing is overly cheesy or
inane the graphics get right to the
point everything is clean sharp and
good-looking the old ways online
multiplayer is a nice touch it would
have been easy to code in some crappy AI
and make the gamers face the same
opponent over and over again with a
matchmaking system and add some
randomness and unpredictability which is
detrimental to a simple game like this
if you run out of coins you can get free
ones every hour while this bottleneck is
a little bit annoying it's a way out of
having to pay real money for more since
that is also an option we only wish you
could take advantage more frequently
than once per hour and here's the bad
I'm concerned with the longevity of the
enjoyment in this title at the end of
the day you're just tapping and swiping
a ball into a hoop as quickly as
possible even though the multiplayer
aspect makes this challenging and
enjoyable the repetition will eventually
negate that the NEP purchases are geared
toward people who are terrible at this
game you can play as often as you want
as long as you have enough coins and
thus the winners never need to buy coins
because they already have enough to play
the losers on the other hand can either
wait an hour to get enough corns to play
one single game or pay to get a lot more
and I thought that was a little bit
heavy-handed the minigames are kind of
stupid one is a slot machine and the
other is a scratch-off lottery ticket
neither of these things have anything to
do with basketball and they both cost
real money to play in other words there
is no point to their existence I was
expecting something like trickshot or
bounce shot or something like that but I
got a slot machine and I'm not too happy
about it lastly I have no idea how the
scoring system in this game is supposed
to work you make all but one shot in one
game and you get like 900 points and
then you miss three shots and get like
20 100 points then there are people like
my opponent here who managed to rack up
more points in one game then I scored
during my entire testing session it'd be
nice to have a guide or a pop-up box or
something to explain how all of that
works overall this is a relatively solid
offering it's a fun game to waste a few
minutes and it is sports oriented which
is a genre that Android sorely lacks the
graphics and music provided enjoyable
atmos
fear and the gameplay is quick to grasp
so people who won't have problems
sliding right in there and having some
fun there were a few problems sure but
there are always problems even with the
best titles obviously the hardcore
gamers of our viewership probably won't
find this game very interesting but if
you're in angry birds or a temple run
sort of casual gamer who likes
basketball then you will probably enjoy
this title once again I'm Joe Hindy the
