by Toyota and now we have the mini
version of a concept that I have always
always been a fan of hey Josh Oh Garf
manager I thought it wasn't going
everybody and now we have the asus
padfone min all right and like you saw
in the intro yes this is a four inch
phone right here that powers an entire
tablet when you need a much larger
screen to work with it slides in
beautifully onto the back right here
this is always really fun to do so as
you can see here there is the base and
we have the slot right here and right
into the seven-inch tablet goes the
phone and there you go we have a full
7-inch tablet at your fingertips this is
a really really great concept I remember
seeing this at MWC much earlier in 2013
and I thought it was such a great great
great idea that actually is implemented
so well given the great guys over at
masseuse now of course the entire tablet
is powered by the little guy right over
here and we'll go ahead and talk about
what that is like so as you can see the
phone is out right there and it is
powered by a Intel Atom processor that
clocks in at 1.6 gigahertz and that 4
inch screen has a resolution of 800 by
480 but now let's take a look at the
tablet itself I'm going to go ahead and
reinsert the phone here again I'm
talking about such a great feeling to be
able to do that and all of a sudden you
have a great tablet in your hands the
7-inch screen comes in at a resolution
of 1280 by 800 which provides a very
nice experience for general media
consumption and also even games and as
you can see here we do have the Zen UI
which is what we have been seeing from
the Zen phones it's not it's an early
build still so there's still some
features that have to come through as
you can see there's a notification drop
down I'll go ahead and dress adjust the
brightness a little bit so you can see a
little bit better and there is you know
all of the circle centric or the
concentric circles whatever term you
want to use but a lot of the elements
are made up of circles and it makes for
a very clean look that allows it to be
very functional at the
time now when it comes to battery life
the little phone itself comes with a
1170 milliamp hour units that will
provide it some good longevity
especially since it is a small phone it
will probably go for quite a while
because that battery is big for such a
small 4-inch phone however the station
itself actually comes with a 20 100
million powered unit so don't worry
about losing battery life quickly just
because you're using one unit to power
essentially to the station comes with
its own battery which is a great feature
that allows it to you know have a little
bit more longevity so if you really need
to use the tablet more than the phone
then you have power for that when
combined this whole unit comes in at 376
grams which is a very very nice weight
for this it is not too heavy but also
not too light that to make you question
its build quality and as far as build
quality goes we do have a nice luster
back here that makes it look feel really
really nice it's not it is still plastic
it is not metal but it definitely has a
much better sort of countenance to it so
it's not going to get a lot of
fingerprints on the back or smudge it's
actually for that matter and finally we
do have an 8 megapixel camera on the
4-inch phone here that does come with
the pixel master software that Zeus has
put into their cameras that allows for
400 percent brighter photos in low-light
great low-light performance in that
camera right there so that is the
PadFone menu this is another one of the
innovations that comes from a sous that
was announced yesterday this is another
iteration of the pad phone here that is
a concept I have always been a fan of so
that is us from a sous here at the Trump
Towers this is Josh burger from Andhra
Authority but coming to you live from
CES 2014 and once again thank you to
Toyota for sponsoring our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
