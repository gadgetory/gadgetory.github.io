Authority and I'm joined by my good
buddy David and we're here doing a quick
camera comparison between all of the
Motorola phones in all different price
ranges especially since the release of
the z3 or the announcement rather we
thought it'd be interesting to do a
camera comparison and see what
difference you're actually getting
between all the different price ranges
so we have the e 5 plus the e 5 play the
G 6 the g 6 play the Z 3 play and of
course the Z 3 and we just have a few
cameras and parallelism that we're gonna
go through and just look at how much of
a difference you're getting in picture
quality when you go from the lowest end
to the highest end yeah so Motorola has
like a lot of phones out so you probably
want to decide like how much money you
want to spend to actually get that good
photo quality and they're pretty
drastically different so we kind of used
the z3 as the standard image that we're
comparing everything against because
technically it's the most expensive
should have the best camera yeah so
we're just gonna get into it all right
so we have a few different camera
samples here from a variety of
situations and the z3 is the image that
you see on the left that is our control
and the image on the right will be all
the different Motorola devices from the
e series the G Series and of course the
z3 play and we're basically starting
from the lowest to the highest end so
right now you have the z3 against the e5
play here on the right and you can see
there's a very significant difference in
the image quality here the z3 obviously
has better colors better dynamic range
that I liked a little bit better even
though they're still slightly blown out
you really can't see a whole lot of
detail on the e5 play here and if you
zoom in and take a look at the just the
amount of detail here yeah quite a bit
of a difference and what you see here
yeah even on the text there on the cup
it's a really really soft on that a5
play yeah yeah and and of course you get
a better look at the colors here as well
you just have a more contrasting look on
these III whereas the if I play just
very very washed out in the entire image
yeah overall I think the contrast is
just way better okay so let's move on
here to the next tier up which is the e5
plus and the results are a little bit
closer and I would say thing actually
yeah fairly similar really close I think
the play is slightly better in this
circumstance it could have just been
random chance that it was you know
decided it was gonna be slightly out of
focus but alright it does look a little
a little cleaner yeah the gap is
definitely not as big going just going
one tear up on Motorola smartphones the
gap is definitely not as big as I
thought it was gonna be yeah so let's go
ahead and move on to the next one here
which is the g s-- the g6 so this is the
g6 here and again very close I would say
now looks really good too to be honest
like you see more color in that one the
coffee cup on the right looks a little
more like you feel like you get a little
more dynamic range with it the text is
really clear yeah I'm actually surprised
that this camera it looks pretty good
yeah it's it's the results are
surprisingly really close it there's a
little bit of a difference in warmth the
g6 does have a slightly more of a
yellowish tan yeah I see I can see that
on the cup yeah but that also could be
the lighting changing from outside as
well affecting that so but otherwise
like it's a pretty with it's pretty
close pretty close but let's move on
here this is the g6 play and pretty big
difference in the highlights yeah the
highlights are more blown out and then
the darker areas are actually darker so
it looks like there's more contrast yeah
but it still didn't handle the
highlights that well right and you can
definitely see the difference in the
coffee here if you look on the car kind
of love it's illuminated in the bottom
right and it's quite dark on the g6 play
here so it was a very very big
difference in just the overall contrast
and with the shadows there and so let's
move on to the last one which is going
to be
the z3 play which supposedly has the
same exact sensor so we're expecting the
images to look completely identical but
they they don't they actually look quite
different here and all the highlights
look way better on a z3 play a little
warmer slightly
yeah the contrast looks pretty similar
but the highlights have definitely
managed a lot better on yeah yeah and
the focus point is mostly on the left
coffee cup on both images so we expected
their results to be fairly similar but
that just wasn't the case which is kind
of interesting but maybe we took the
photo again on the z3 it would have been
exactly the same the colors on the
coffee the contrast on the coffee cups
looks pretty similar but if you look in
the background the the highlights are
just there's a huge difference yeah and
that's really the the main difference
with these two images here but yeah I'm
gonna say this is probably a little bit
of an outlier here because I think if we
took this again it might be a completely
different result yeah because this one
did come out a little bit blurry so yeah
alright so on this one I had lawn take a
picture of me now this was a really
ideal lighting situation it was right
next to a bright window so there's a lot
of the nice exposure the other side of
my face is a little darkened but as you
can kind of see so we're comparing the
z3 versus the e5 play and the e5 play
just has it's just really washed out
like it just feels like it doesn't have
that that contrast it doesn't have that
color and and overall like yeah you're
just getting less yeah you can also see
like a huge difference in your skin tone
I know it's just you look a lot more
pale or you it looks more natural yellow
and warm yeah exactly and the highlights
of course on the left side of the wall
here are gonna scream the glow now yeah
so very significant difference yeah
let's move to the e5 plus again a lot
better yeah just just like the previous
photo that we looked at the gap is
significantly smaller hmm I mean for the
most part there's not a huge difference
again a skin tone yeah totally different
I still think that the z3 handles the
highlights a little better yeah I can
see on the edge of my face it's just
it's not as blown out as it is alright
and if you also
zoom into this window here in the back
you can definitely see a slight
difference in the detail here you get
more from that window on the XIII there
yeah but but overall I mean that even
the detail on my face on the plus is
pretty good this is the g6 here yeah
definitely much warmer softer too right
but overall still a pretty good image
from the g6 here in terms of just the
color the dynamic range is not bad
either yeah it's pretty good let's see
what the g6 plus has to offer here and
what do you think about the way the g6
plus compares it's pretty good yeah I
mean again this was super ideal lighting
I think the sharpness looks a little bit
reduced compared to the z3 and there's a
little less color to I'd say it's like
slightly more washed out definitely but
not a lot I mean you can see the darker
areas of my skin on this e3 are more
punchy yeah
but overall yeah I'd say it's a little
bit why I still prefer the XIII's image
overall again the highlights are much
better as well you can see on the side
of the wall there
blown out is definitely a big difference
there but overall again pretty close for
the most part but the z3 is still edging
it out and this last one where this is
the z3 play actually a pretty
significant difference in colors yeah
it's pretty much - yeah like the your
shirt doesn't look quite as grey and
definitely more color on the v3 there so
kind of interesting that there's that
big of a difference but at the same time
Ares yeah the z3 does have that
monochrome sensor which does make a
difference in detail yeah and affects
the color as well so all right so this
next image that we have is an outdoor
shot really good lighting and it's also
sort of it a landscape shot of building
with a lot of detail a lot of text cars
passing by as well I think the biggest
difference that I know is just by
looking at the images at the hole is the
color reproduction
the color is really different it's more
of a teal on the right
definitely the sky is like kind of weird
the big thing I see here actually is
dynamic range right you know there's
really kind of like the difference
between the sky and the building on the
right is like not great there's like
blown a highlights and then the dark
areas feel too dark yeah and you have a
lot of unnatural looking blues here on
the e5 as well so so let's move on to
the 'if I've + you see how difference
how much of a difference there is on
this one here and first thing I can see
already is that the dynamic range is
definitely better the sky looks a little
bit more natural
not as many blowing highlights yeah I
think it could do to raise the shadows a
little more it's definitely not as good
as those III in terms of like you know
getting that pixel look
but overall the colors are way better
for sure yeah yeah I definitely agree
with the shadows they are a lot more
crushed on the e5 plus here you don't
see quite as much detail in the sign
alright so this next one is the g6 and
this is doing pretty well the dynamic
dynamic range is better than the e5 play
but the hue again of the skies are
leaning more towards that teal area
especially right above the top of the
building it's a really teal again like
the sign is a little you can't see the
detail like you can see in the z3 with
like all the LEDs mm-hmm
but I mean overall I like that the
shadows are raised yeah yeah alright so
here we have the g6 play and again the
color is a little bit different yeah I
think the dynamic range is actually
fairly close they're relatively similar
yeah yeah the the shadows could be
raised a little bit more if they wanted
it to be more like those III just a
slight that's very small amount it's
harder to see on the sign because it's
time changed a bit
but the red looks a little more royal on
the right relatively similar though
really the dynamic range is just a
little bit brighter on those III yeah I
definitely agree with that but again
like the the gap in image quality is
definitely just closes yeah pretty
significantly as we go up in price range
which is which is what we sort of
expected let's move on to the last one
which is the XIII play again
fairly similar I would say the XIII play
is a slightly warmer image here and it's
a color but as far as just the overall
detail the way the image looks in terms
of color I think they're actually fairly
close they're both very appealing images
yeah that's slightly different it's
pretty contrast yeah I think yeah I
think like you said with the warmer tone
you can feel it in the white in the
white of the building it's just
definitely a little more like warm and
even maybe a little bit green yeah yes
slightly green so but the detail of the
sign you can see the LEDs and like most
of it so there's there yeah I mean this
is the XIII play so it should be you
know relatively close and I'd say that's
true but it's definitely shifting more
towards green yeah yeah and I would say
now that we're zoomed in on both these
images that the XIII is a little bit
sharper and the signage you can see the
LEDs the separation and LEDs a lot more
yeah so there's a little bit more detail
but fairly close images overall okay so
for this last shot we went out at
nighttime because we really wanted to
see the low-light happening here the z3
actually on the left really captures the
highlights that are available pretty
well in the window they're pretty blown
out but on the main point of interest
that we took a picture of you can see
that reflection off of it it's a little
bit soft but overall it kind of captures
the area at least so whereas the e5 play
is definitely like it's just really dark
like you can't really see the object
that you're trying to take a picture of
at least the you know through the window
is less blown out but that's not that
right right yeah cuz the the whole point
is just the the object that you're
focused on and it does III definitely
captures the detail better yeah
and you can see a lot more softness and
more noise when you're home and yeah so
when you're zooming in there you can
really spot the differences very easily
here there's a lot of noise in both but
like it yeah is it awful yeah the z3 is
definitely a much cleaner image overall
you just look at these little circle
pieces and the center column here you
can't really see them yeah you can't
really make them out that well on the e5
players though but again the e5 play has
been our worst camera throughout this
run yeah which which we sort of expected
yeah okay so let's go ahead and switch
over to the plus here and see what the
difference is and okay interesting
definitely a little bit closer but the
z3 is still a much better image in terms
of just giving you more detail it's a
little bit brighter this is just a
really dark photo just really dark yeah
I mean I think it's a little cleaner
it's definitely cleaner and less I feel
like the the e5 play had that weird like
gray hue over the entire thing all the
time but like there's a little bit
cleaner and but the blacks are
definitely like a really crushed yeah
it's not raising yeah I can definitely
see a little bit more detail in the
center column here with this image then
with the e5 play so a little bit more
detail but still not quite as good as
the z3 yeah it does again kind of do the
highlights a little bit better but I
think that's on because the image is
darker and here is the g6 okay and the
g6 is actually a much brighter image
then if I play for the e5 plus and it
looks a little bit earlier actually it's
got a warmer tone if you look in the
main center column of the object it's
definitely like a warmer brass color but
overall noise seems relatively similar
it's a little summer yeah I think yeah I
think the g6 is definitely a little bit
softer in detail the colors again like
you mentioned looked a little bit
different you can see that in the graph
see that in the actual object itself but
overall I again have to give it to the
z3 here you can see the building the
background doesn't look quite as clean
either yeah so definitely a lot of
detail that is missing on the g6 and
here we have the the g6 play Wow and a
very significant a very significant
difference in the quality and you can
really spot the differences pretty
easily it just looks insanely blue even
if you look at the blown out highlights
there's straight-up blue and like any
highlights and the entire image or like
they get like a blue feel yeah yeah I
feel like it has a very like greenish
blue tinge yeah the entire photo yeah
you can see that in the grass the
building in the background and just
everywhere in this photo really yeah the
highlights are slightly better you do
see a little bit more detail in the
highlights but again the main point of
focus and just the overall colors are
not really that appealing yeah and then
finally on to our last one here which is
the z3 play again same main sensor but
different secondary sensor and I think
that plays a role here as well after for
sure definitely softer I think the z3
play is also a little bit more washed
out in color the black levels look a
little bit on the right side yeah you
can definitely see that in the building
in the back though the subject itself
looks really washed out doesn't have a
whole lot of saturation and kind of like
we talked about last time it's got that
green hue a little bit mm-hmm kind of
weird but even if you look at the sky
like it's it's more gray than it is
black yeah yeah overall though I'd say
for most situations the z3 is gonna win
out but the surprise contender
absolutely the e5 plus yeah like in most
lighting situations that one was great
yeah and and like it's for the price
it's very impressive
what you can get from that camera and it
was very surprising to see how well it
actually stacked up too you know you
know Motorola's main flagship which is
the z3 and a lot of the results were
fairly close I mean you could spot some
differences for sure but I mean for the
price you're getting a pretty good
camera with the e5 plus there so that
was a very yeah interesting to see with
this comparison here and death
wasn't optimized for low light but if
you're just taking general photos it was
pretty clean mm-hmm yeah yeah but that's
really it for our quick camera shuddha
our motorola camera shootout hopefully
you guys enjoyed it and we had a lot of
fun doing this and it was actually
pretty cool to see the differences
