Android Authority now if you've watched
my videos about VPN or about encryption
you'll have noticed that I've said
several times we must be careful when
using public open Wi-Fi hotspots now the
reason for that is because the
information the data that's sent from
your smartphone or from your laptop to
the access point is actually broadcast
in every direction for anybody to
collect and to to analyze and so
therefore that obviously poses a whole
bunch of different problems but the
question is how easy is it to actually
collect data collect network packets on
a public open Wi-Fi system well let me
explain
so when you connect to a public open
Wi-Fi the connection between your device
and the Wi-Fi router is in the clear
it's not encrypted and that's because
people want you to connect to it to use
it while you're in their shopping mall
or in their coffee shop for example and
therefore the data that's sent is
completely open and as I said a moment
ago it's sent in every direction it's
not just sent kind of like directly in
the line of sight of the router and if
you have the right equipment anybody can
pick up all those data packets that are
floating around in the air now normally
a Wi-Fi adapter whether it's one for in
built into your laptop built into your
phone or one that you use through USB is
in what they call managed mode and that
basically means it just wants to talk to
a Wi-Fi hotspot it wants to send and
receive data and it's not really
interested anything else that's going on
however the Wi-Fi standard allows these
chipsets to be put into several other
modes and one of them is called monitor
mode now in monitor mode the Wi-Fi chips
it can actually pick up and receive the
packets that are going anywhere in the
air whether they're going to the guy on
the table next to you whether they're
going to a guy who down the shopping
more a little bit you can receive all of
them because Wi-Fi signals are pervasive
they go absolutely everywhere when they
are sent out now not all Wi-Fi chipsets
can do this it's cheaper just to make a
Wi-Fi chip set that just sticks in
managed mode because the firmware and
the hardware logic is much simpler and
that's actually the kind of a 99% news
case that people just want to connect to
a hotspot and to send and receive
traffic home if you get hands on the
right piece of equipment then actually
you can put it into miter mode now for
example I have here a dongle that I
bought from Amazon you can get it for
under $20 it's by tp-link and it
actually has the right drivers that you
can set this thing in to monitor mode
now to do this you're going to need a
thing called Kali Linux as a special
Linux distribution but you don't have to
install it on a laptop and then kind of
over install windows or anything like
that you can run it as a virtual machine
and if you run it as a virtual machine
you can then plug
the USB adapter and you can actually
associate it with the Linux distribution
and it's like you're running on a
separate meter with virtual machine now
I've done some testing using my laptop
and using my virtual machine for color
dips and everything I'm going to tell
you now is actually what I've done
myself that and step by step I've
actually proved that this works now
rather than give you all the actual
commands here during the video which
will be hard for you to follow go over
to the Android source comm website and
look at the article that go to this
video because there I've listed all the
commands that you need and they're easy
there for you to cut and paste and to
read and to study to see what I'm doing
but basically you first of all you boot
up Kali Linux and then you plug in your
USB adapter you make sure it can be seen
and then you switch the adapter into
monitor mode and you use some tools from
the aircrack suite to do that and then
once you've found the Wi-Fi network that
you want to listen to you then basically
just say to the air crack suite use this
Wi-Fi adapter to just capture all the
packets that are going around in the air
and they will be captured onto your hard
disk and then once they're in your heart
is you can use tools like driftnet &amp;amp;
Wireshark
to examine all of that data and see
what's there now very quickly you'll be
able to grab out some URLs you can see
what websites people have been visiting
and you'll also be able to grab any
pictures that have been flowing around
in the air to see what people have been
viewing now to test this I put my own
Wi-Fi hotspot here in my house it was
completely opened so maybe for a few
days my neighbors were able to get a bit
of free internet access but I'm sure
they've all got into axes anyway and
basically I use one laptop connected to
that Wi-Fi hotspot and I use my hand
with phone kicked a hotspot and then I
use my laptop running Kali Linux along
with this Wi-Fi adapter and I just
captured all of the stuff that was going
out and you can actually find that you
can pretty get hold of a lot of
information particularly for example I
went to a particular football website
soccer for those in North America and
all the player pictures that I was
downloading and looking at
I've now grabbed from the Wi-Fi dongle
and it's actually I've got stored on my
hard drive and I wasn't even connected
to the same Wi-Fi router that's the
beauty of monitor mode you can actually
grab things out of the air as they're
they're whizzing past now obviously if
this was the case that absolutely
everything it would be a disaster every
email you read every time you went
somewhere to an instant messaging
everything would be open now thankfully
there is this thing called HTTPS you've
probably seen it when you type in a URL
and when you go to a website that's
using HTTPS you'll see that little
padlock sign now the s and the padlock
sign are showing this is secure it's in
encrypted connection so even if the
packets are flying around in the air
freely between your device and the Wi-Fi
hotspot once those packets have been
grabbed from the air if you have a look
inside of them it's all gobbledy good
because it's encrypted you can't see
what's in this all the pictures are
encrypted or the URLs and crypto all
your emails are encrypted and so on and
that's great now the number of websites
that use HTTPS now is is increased a lot
and that's thanks to project likely
let's encrypt project and also the free
availability of orbit relatively free
availability of SSL certificates now
what that means is that when you connect
to a website in Google for example for
their search and for everything that you
do on Google including Gmail all over
HTTP so whatever you're reading on
Google whatever your search on Google
can't be seen when you're on a public
free Wi-Fi hotspot however many sites
only use HTTPS when you're doing the
login so at least your passwords
protected and when you're doing the kind
of the check out with what you've
purchased if it's a commercial site so
that's come as well but in between time
when you're browsing all the different
products they are freely available
because they're in the clear however
that's changing in Google have a report
card available which kind of gives you a
list of all of the sites that use HTTPS
from end to end so things are really
improving on the web browser front and
of course you've got that little icon
that tells you whether you're connected
securely however things aren't quite as
simple when it comes to Android apps
whenever you use an Android app and it's
getting data it might beginning advert
data it might be sending some personal
profile data about you you might be
using a network service whether it be
social media whether it be instant
messaging or where it multiplayer gaming
whatever you're doing you don't know
whether that connection
Oh encrypted connection and that's
because there is a little padlock sign
there is no little green sign to tell
you that everything's going okay you
just have to trust that app are not all
apps by any measure use encryption
during the networking part of their
design
now unfortunately is no easy way of
telling which apps do in which apps
don't you actually have to sit down with
a Wi-Fi adapter like I've got and start
to monitor this traffic and see what's
available and that's obviously time
because you know some people have
written reports about this and they are
out there to fine however it's really a
problem we can't find out quickly
whether an app uses encryption or not
now
if we take an app like whatsapp they
have declared public clean it even says
so in the app that everything you do
over what tap is encrypted so even if
I'm using it on a public Wi-Fi hotspot
then it will be encrypted doesn't matter
if someone grabs all those packets out
of the air you can't see what's inside
of them however other app like get
Google's allo messenger has clearly
stated it doesn't use encryption only
when you're in incognito mode now I
haven't tested it to see how bad that
situation really is but it is
interesting that even popular app by big
companies aren't necessarily using
encryption so do be careful when you're
using an app on your phone be sure that
you're 100% you know that it's using
encryption otherwise it could be stolen
when you're connected to a Wi-Fi hotspot
now grabbing things out of the air is
one thing that can happen on a Wi-Fi
hotspot but it's not the only thing that
can happen on a Wi-Fi hotspot another
problem can be is people can set up
rogue access points fake access points
deliberately just to lure you in so that
you connect to them and then they have
control over your traffic so for example
maybe you go to a particular coffee shop
and it doesn't have Wi-Fi and then one
day you see that it does you know great
the shop got Wi-Fi I'm so happy I want
them to have Wi-Fi for a long time and
actually it's not there's a guy two
tables down with his laptop and with a
Wi-Fi adapter like the one that I've
gone he set up his own access point all
the tools for that are available on
Linux distributions like Kali Linux that
I mentioned earlier on and then what
happened is everything that you send to
the internet actually goes to his laptop
first where you can store it and he can
also manipulate it and worst of all he
can
Directive so you think you're going to
amazon.com and in fact what comes up is
a website that looks very similar if
it's a clone of amazon.com but really
it's a fake website that he put up
deliberately just to capture your login
passwords you then go and login it says
login fail and then it will probably
redirect you to the real website where
you log in and go oh I must have typed
in the password wrong but actually
you've now given him your username and
password so that's a danger of using
untrusted Wi-Fi access point and that's
the problem when you go to a shopping
mall there might be like 10 20 30 40
different Wi-Fi networks listed okay and
someone will open some of them are not
and they all look legitimate because
they're all names of the shops that are
around you you think I'll well I'll
click to the Starbucks Network I click
to the to whatever network and actually
there could be a guy sitting on the
bench behind you who set up that Wi-Fi
network so be careful and there's a
third thing that can happen when you
click to public Wi-Fi and that is a
thing called art spoofing now every
single network card in the world has a
thing called a MAC address even this
thing has a MAC address and that's the
media access control address and it's
unique they're established in the
factory when it goes out of the door and
everyone in the world is different it's
a PC it's a laptop it is a an adapter
like this whether it's your smartphone
they've all got these adapt unique
addresses on them and what happens is
when you have an IP address that's to
the Internet address what happens is
that another PC or another devices hey
who owns this address and it uses the up
the address resolution protocol to say
who owns it and then it says I do and
the MAC address is sent back in out in a
normal security environment that's
absolutely perfect that's how it works
but actually when you're an open public
Wi-Fi you can spoof that so someone
comes along and says hey who owes his
address and you say I do but you don't
you don't own it at all but you lie you
get your PC to lie about the fact that
it owns the address and that means now
traffic that was going to go to one
place probably the router now comes to
you and once it comes to you again you
can then do lots of different things
like phishing attack man middle attacks
you can actually set it up so that all
the data is restored on you and then you
redirect it to some relatives they're
going somewhere simple like a news
website you just redirect
if they're going to somewhere that
you're interesting their past or as
PayPal eBay Amazon whatever then you can
send them over to a fake site and try to
do a phishing attack on them to try to
capture their username and password so
there's three things that can happen you
can capture the package out of the air
using monitor mode on the Wi-Fi adapter
you can set up a fake Wi-Fi hotspot to
lure people in and in to capture their
information and ARP spoofing allows
people on open Wi-Fi networks to
redirect traffic and you really don't or
not even none the wiser about what's
going on and then with web browsers we
must be careful we're using HTTPS that
you've got that sign up there on the
padlock sign the little green box saying
everything is ok but on Android apps
it's much harder to know whether the app
is using SSL or not so be careful unless
it's something like whatsapp or other
apps have declared publicly they're
using encryption be careful when using
those apps over a minute what my name is
