why Huawei may not be selling the phones
in the u.s. that we may have hoped
samsung's new budget-friendly j2 Pro and
how Qualcomm is hoping to triple the
hours of bluetooth usage so remember we
got all excited a couple weeks ago about
Huawei possibly partnering with US
carriers to make their great best bang
for your buck phones more accessible oh
well maybe not now we don't exactly know
why the deal broke down but the
information has some speculation AT&amp;amp;T
allegedly called off the deal due to
quote political pressure after the
Senate and house intelligent committees
sent a letter to the FCC raising quote
fresh concerns about Huawei's plans the
information said that the letter quote
cited an intelligent committee report on
Huawei's alleged ties of the Communist
Party as well as China's intelligence
and security services unquote now in
this case it's sort of hard to know
where the legitimate security concerns
end and racism begins maybe it's a
little both but it's not the first time
that Huawei has been accused of being a
security threat
in 2012 a Republican Committee Chairman
Mike Rogers said on 60 minutes quote if
I were an American company today and
you're looking at hallway I would find
another vendor if you care about your
intellectual property if you care about
your consumers privacy and you care
about national security of the United
States or maybe it's just good
old-fashioned US companies lobbying
their US government to defend their
business interests what are you thinking
now we know many of you are like me you
cling on to your wired headphones for
dear life because as much as I want to
Bluetooth headphones just don't cut it
when it comes to sound quality and
battery life but a Qualcomm is trying to
deal with the battery life problem a lot
Qualcomm is aiming to solve this problem
with a newly unveiled qcc 5100 series of
low powered audio system on a chips the
qcc 5100 is a fully integrated Bluetooth
audio solution packing in a Bluetooth
radio Class D headphone driver 192
gigahertz 24-bit codec hybrid active
noise cancellation and sensory
processing and a
KTX HD technology whoo all in a single
chip
the new design boosts power efficiency
processing capabilities and supports new
use cases the bottom line is that
qualcomm states that the qcc 5100 series
can help reduce battery consumption by
up to 65% over previous chips and it
estimates playback time could triple
when compared to today's Bluetooth
devices
ok Qualcomm my interest is piqued as I'm
sure many of you are now OEMs take that
new technology
don't make them look geeky like they're
too baby suckers sticking in my ears
make sure they stay in my ears and for
the love of God improve the sound
quality now let's talk about the
official budget-friendly Samsung j2 Pro
the galaxy j2 Pro 2018 has a quad-core
CPU clocked at 1.4 gigahertz 1.5
gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
storage the device supports both microSD
cards for expanded storage up to 250
gigabytes and dual SIM cards instead of
using a hybrid microSD SIM card slot
Samsung included dedicated slots for
both that means you can expand your
storage and use dual SIM cards at the
same time as for the display the galaxy
j2 pro 2018 carries a five inch Super
AMOLED display with 960 by 540
resolution just above the display is a 5
megapixel camera with dedicated flash
and around the back we have an 8
megapixel shooter that can filmed 1080p
video much like the rest of Samsung's
lineup the galaxy j2 pro 2018 retains
the headphone jack
whoo hopefully that's a good omen that
Samsung flagships will do the same this
year but don't bet on it now if you want
to get serious about branding yourself
