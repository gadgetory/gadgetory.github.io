this is Android authority now Nokia have
made a brilliant comeback into the
smartphone market and it seems as if
they have a smartphone for every price
point now recently they launched the
Nokia one they cheapest Android
smartphone to date so I got hold of one
and let's see what I found out not his
naming scheme is simplicity in itself
the higher you go the better the phones
at the top end you've got kinda like the
Nokia sever the Nokia 8 there's even
rumors over Nokia 9 if you want
something in the middle you might go for
a Nokia 510 towards a low end you get
the Nokia 3 and now there is the Nokia 1
now the key to the Nokia 1 is its price
I'm out to pick up my unit for seventy
five euros off contract just from a
retail store that translates about a
hundred US dollars so as we look at this
device everything that we talk about is
going to be in the context that this
phone costs $100 it doesn't cost two
hundred dollars it doesn't cost $400
doesn't cost a hundred it cost just one
hundred dollars and yet you'd have
Android Oreo 8.1 running on it you've
got the full working touchscreen
smartphone with GPS and Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi and everything else you'd expect
so what does a hundred bucks buy you
well let's find out more so when you
look at this phone it certainly is
old-school what I mean by over school is
you know it's got a removable back it's
good removable battery the SIM cards
don't go on a tray they kind of go in
their own little slots once you take the
back off and you can get access to them
and it really does look like a phone
from maybe 2011-2012 that kind of era
and that isn't necessarily a bad thing
I actually do like the idea or phone
that you can change the batteries I like
the idea here to take the back cover off
and we have to change it with different
back covers but here on the Nokia one
what Nokia are really going for is
affordability and to do that they need a
bit of manufacturing easily which means
it's not going to be very particularly
complicated with aluminium this and
champagne edges that and all wraparound
glass the other this is going to be you
basic plastic phone with a Popoff back
cover and that's fine because you're
only paying $100 for it now on the
downside of Nokia opting to use the
easiest to assemble design is that
actually the bezels are quite thick on
this thing and that's fine again if you
take the hundred-dollar context into
consideration but just remember this is
not going to be any kind of edge to edge
display we're looking at a very very
simple design process here there are
some plus points Lister's I know as I've
said you can now get exchangeable covers
which you can which are sold separately
by Nokia you can always buy yourself a
spare battery and pop that in so if
you've got a spare battery with you at
any time there are two SIM card slots in
the model that I picked up an SD card
slot because it's not using the tray you
actually can use two as a SIM cards and
an SD card or at the same time without
any problem so there are advantages to
this older way of designing smart phones
now moving on to the display this really
is a quite a weak display in the sense
it's got a very low resolution just 480
by 85 for that kind of sticks it into
the realms of phones that we saw as I
said earlier 2011 2012 you're not
getting great brightness from this
display it works indoors perfectly it
works outdoors quite well but in strong
sunlight you would have trouble reading
it well the plus side it is an IPS LCD
display which we don't have that problem
we have twist the phone you can't see
what's on the screen you've got wide
viewing angles which is always good and
the color reproduction isn't as bad as
actually it could be at this price point
moving on to the internals here we have
kind of the lowest end possible
processor available cuz it's again price
here is the main thing you've got a
quad-core MediaTek device with four
cortex a53 cores and the court is a 53
is a 64-bit processor however the
version of Android running on this
device is actually a 32-bit version of
Android there's also a very simple Mali
T 7 20 G PU which will handle games like
subway surfer I've tried it out it plays
quite well but don't expect to be
playing any of these high-end sort of
first
person shooters or any of these
complicated 3d games that you can get on
the Play Store there's also one gigabyte
of RAM and eight gigabytes of internal
storage now obviously eight gigabytes is
a very small number today again that
harkens back to phones of several years
ago now what they've knock you have done
here is that using Android Go which I'll
talk more about in a moment but one of
the up shots of using Android Go is
actually there is four gigabytes of free
space out of that eight gigabytes which
is actually pretty amazing my note 8 has
11 gigabytes use just by Android and the
pre-installed apps but this so manages
to get all that down into kind of round
four gigabyte leaving about half of the
internal memory free for photos and
music and media and apps
it's also worth mention this is a 4G
phone you've also got Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth 4.2 on the back of the phone
you'll see a small little hole where
this external speaker is and the
external speaker is really pretty bad
it's tinny it lacks depth but it will
ring when the phone rings you can hear
game music coming through it and you
could probably even use the phone on
hands-free without it being a terrible
terrible experience but don't expect any
kind of fidelity here to any music that
you'll be listening to
I found an option called best loudness
in the options in the settings there and
I don't really know where it does but I
kind of told it or enough a couple of
times I think the external speaker
sounds better with it off and with the
volume clever tapped down a couple of
notches so you don't get the distortion
pulsing its way through that tiny
speaker the good news is when you put in
headphones the music quality does
improve drastically however the the
audio circuits in this phone still lack
clarity and there's definitely a lack of
punch down in the bass tones the good
news is it's a 2150 million power
battery which for a phone with only a
4.5 inch display with that low
resolution without all with other fancy
stuff that goes with it actually gives
you a lot of battery life in fact you'll
easily get seven hours of on screen time
out of this device maybe even eight if
you
pending on your usage there's no quick
charging included however you can charge
the phone from zero to 100 percent in
about four hours so basically looking at
charging it up overnight I remember the
days of when Motorola released the first
Moto G basically you didn't get anything
in the box with the device luckily with
the Nokia one you do get a charger you
do get a USB cable and you do get some
very very simple earbuds the ones
without any rubber cups on them just the
plastic ones that you put in kind of
this whole unit which I can't wear but
that's a whole different story and when
it comes to software the Nokia one uses
Android gonna Android Go is a version of
Android that goog will have optimized to
work on devices with one gigabyte of ram
or less they even say or less I'm Gavin
okie one got one gigabyte with Android
goes actually quite a pleasant
experience there's also some cut-down
versions of the popular apps for example
there's a gmail go version there is maps
go for example which gives you kind of
Google Maps a functionality but by the
way without any turn-by-turn navigation
but you also get the Play Store and the
Play Store of course gives you access to
all of googles apps including the full
version of Gmail including the full
version of maps lime install both of
those on here and they work absolutely
fine as well
what's also talking about the Play Store
version is it will recommend for you
apps that are particularly tuned light
apps or go apps that are particularly
tuned for Android go so that's good well
you've got a choice to make it will
recommend one that works better on these
low-end devices other than that it's a
pretty vanilla Android experience which
is good there's no skins on top there's
no thing to slow the phone down in that
way and also there's a couple of other
neat built-in features for example there
is a data saving option and you can
actually switch that on in chrome so
that you can get your data compress
before it comes down to your phone of
course the idea is here's if you're on a
plan from your carrier that doesn't have
much data included into it you're not
wasting it on downloading kind of data
from the internet but the downside is
this data has to go first of all to
Google servers will then be compressed
and then it
it's sent down to your device so there
it could be a privacy concern there for
you also Android go is very friendly
toward SD card which is absolutely
fantastic because Google for so long
I've kind of not wanted us to use SD
cards at all but here in Android go
because they know they're aiming for a
particular market where people might not
have large access to data plans or they
might not have high-speed access to the
Internet this device actually is very
friendly toward SD cuz when you pop in
an SD card it will say do want me to
turn this into internal storage which
you can say yes you can also opt for it
to be portable storage and if you pick
internal storage then it's actually
fairly easy to move apps and data from
the actual internal storage over to the
SD card by kind of going into the
settings finding the app and saying move
so it moves over to the internal soldier
and that's a great way or be able to
expand the internal storage on the Nokia
while it actually support up to 128
gigabytes microSD cards and finally we
come to the camera base you got a 5
megapixel shooter on the back two
megapixel shooter on the front and it
will record in 720p HD now the camera is
not very good I'm there's nothing more I
can say about it it's slow there's very
little features in the end the app that
comes with it it will take photos I
found that if I kind of clicked you know
and took the photo and then moved too
quickly afterwards just after I've
clicked it then you kind of get ghosting
so I learned to have to kind of click
and then wait hold my breaths not move
the phone and then move on and that did
improve the quality of the photos from
dramatically but basically it's gonna be
OK for emergency situations and it's ok
if you've got no other camera whatsoever
you this is your first smartphone then
you know it's better than nothing at all
but don't expect much in the way from
these cameras and so there you have it
now the context again here is the price
for $100 or 75 euros you can't really
compare it to devices that are much more
expensive I didn't even bother to
benchmark this thing because I know
there's no point in quoting the numbers
question is can you use it is it usable
and the answer is yes if you don't have
the money for a more expensive
smartphone then this is a great way to
get into the connected world of Android
you can add this to the Play Store
you've got Wi-Fi you've got Bluetooth
you've got 4G okay you can take photos
you can play games you can use social
media it's a great way your first step
onto this ladder personally my
recommendation would be if you have a
bit more money then go for the Nokia 3
Nokia 3 it's got a better display a
better processor
better everything basically and it it's
more expensive but it's not much much
more expensive so in your market do look
out for the difference in the price and
the Nokia 1 and the Nokia free if you
can't afford the Nokia 3 or similar
phones and you want a smart phone
definitely get the Nokia 1 but there are
limitations and you have to know those
limitations well my name is Gary Sims
and this is Andrea authoritative Inu
please do give it a thumbs up you also
know what else I'm going to ask you
