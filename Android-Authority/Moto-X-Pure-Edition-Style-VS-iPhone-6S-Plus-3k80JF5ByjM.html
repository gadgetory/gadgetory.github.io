Authority and it's pretty clear that
large smartphones have grown in
popularity over the years but how does
Motorola's $400 flagship compared to
Apple's latest this is the Moto X pure
edition versus the Apple iPhone 6s plus
so the easiest place to start with these
two devices is the design now the one
our drastic changes from last year's
model and in the case of the iPhone it's
pretty much the same design since this
is an S year the Moto X pure edition
looks a lot like the Moto X 2014 except
it's a lot bigger due to the bump in
screen size but it still has the same
metal frame same button import placement
and same curve along the corners and
backside the signature motorola dimple
is still there but it's now housed in a
metallic strip along with the camera and
flash and the dimples back to a much
smaller more subtle size in the case of
the iPhone 6s plus like I've already
mentioned it's the same design as last
year 6 plus but unlike previous models
where Apple typically makes the phone
thinner and lighter the iPhone 6s plus
is actually slightly thicker and heavier
and this is due to a couple of reasons
these 6s plus is now made of a stronger
7000 series aluminum which makes it less
likely to bend and there is now a
pressure-sensitive layer underneath the
display that allows the 6s plus to
utilize what Apple calls 3d touch and
this allows you to physically press
harder on the display to activate
certain actions but we'll get into all
of that a little bit later in terms of
size the Moto X is the thicker phone out
of the 2 but in every other dimension
like height and width it's surprisingly
smaller than the 6s plus despite having
a large display which makes it a little
bit easier to use in one hand much of
that has to do with the very thin bezels
on the Moto X whereas the 6s pluses are
quite a bit thicker on both the sides
and top and bottom one area that the
Moto X just simply can't be beat is in
the color options and customization the
remoter maker you can pick your own
colors materials accent colors and even
add custom engravings and greetings to
make the phone truly your own with the
iPhone things are much more simple
you've got the standard space grey gold
and silver but this your Apple decided
to spice things up a bit by adding a new
rose gold color into the mix if that's
what you're into
for the display you're looking at a 5.7
inch screen on the Moto X and a 5.5 inch
screen on the 6s plus both are IPS LCD s
but the Moto X has a higher resolution
at 1440p over the 1080p of the 6s plus
the Moto XS display is obviously sharper
due to the high resolution and pixel
density which is great for watching
videos but the 6s pluses display is no
slouch by any means both displays look
fantastic in their own right but when
comparing them side by side you will
notice some differences the 6s Plus
display gets significantly brighter and
the colors are much more natural over
the warmer more saturated color tones of
the Moto X this is how the Moto X is set
up by default and the saturated look can
be appealing to the eye
but if you find that it doesn't quite
suit your taste you can easily change it
in the settings when comparing the
performance of an Android device to an
iPhone it's always sort of a tricky
thing to do because you have to look
beyond what you see on the spec sheet
with the Moto X you're looking at the
Snapdragon 808 which is a hexa core
processor and three gigs of ram over on
the iPhone 6s plus you've got apples a
nine chip and two gigs of ram a pretty
significant bump up from the one
gigabyte of ram on the last couple
generations of iPhones you would think
that with more cores and more RAM the
Moto X would completely smoke the 6s
plus but that couldn't be farther from
the truth has always been known to make
great performing devices with what
appears to be lesser specs and while
both devices perform extremely well in
all aspects including multitasking and
gaming the 6s plus performs considerably
better in benchmarks like Geekbench with
a little over double D single core score
of the Moto X and a significantly higher
multi-core score this doesn't mean that
the Moto X is a slow phone by any means
because it's one of these smoothest
performing angel' devices on the market
right now but you are going to get an
overall more consistent experience on
the 6s plus when it comes to things like
gaming for storage the Moto X pure
Edition starts at 16 gigs with 32 and 64
gigabyte options also available and on
the 6s plus storage also starts at 16
gigabytes and jumps up to 64 and 128
gigabytes from there 16 gigabytes is not
a lot of storage but on the Moto X you
can probably get by perfectly fine with
that amount of space because the storage
is expandable via microSD whereas on the
iPhone you don't have that option so if
you decide to go with the 6s plus
do yourself a favor and get the 64
gigabyte at the least when it comes to
speaker quality the 6s plus just doesn't
compare to the Moto X the Moto X has
dual front-facing speakers that are not
only loud but also sound extremely good
which makes them awesome for videos and
games the 6s plus the speaker isn't bad
by any means as it does deliver some
pretty decent audio but considering it's
only one speaker mounted at the bottom
of the phone you're not exactly getting
the most impressive audio experience on
a smart phone one piece of hardware that
the iPhone has the leg up on over the
Moto X is a fingerprint sensor mainly
because the Moto X doesn't have one but
also because it's a really good
fingerprint sensor touch ID is faster
than ever and it's almost too fast which
sounds like a really weird thing to
complain about but simply just pressing
the home button will instantaneously
unlock your device it unlocks so fast if
you're trying to glance at your
notifications or access the camera from
the lockscreen you won't be able to
there are however some workarounds to
this with the trusty side mounted power
button being the most obvious one or you
can just do what I've been doing and
pressing the home button with only a
part of your finger on the button which
will prevent it from reading your
fingerprint and unlocking so quickly as
far as battery life goes the Moto X is
packing a 3000 milliamp hour battery and
the 6s plus has a 27 50 milliamp hour
cell battery life is pretty good on both
and I'll get at least a full day on
either one and sometimes a day and a
half on the 6s plus where the Moto X has
the advantage here is in charging with
Motorola's turbo power charger the Moto
X charges extremely fast which makes it
very easy to fill up for top off and in
my experience I've been able to go from
0 to full in roughly 75 minutes the 6s
plus uses apples proprietary lightning
cable and while you may not get any fast
charging capabilities out of it the
cable is reversible which sounds like a
minor thing but it makes plugging it in
that much more easy and convenient
historically smart phone cameras have
always been Motorola's biggest weakness
and as for Apple that's always been one
of their biggest strengths this year
Motorola promised a much improved camera
experience on the Moto X but Apple also
make a few improvements themselves just
like you would expect them to each and
every year with the pure addition you're
getting a 21 megapixel rear camera with
dual tone LED flash and phase detection
autofocus
on the 6s plus there's a new 12
megapixel sensor and because this is the
plus version of the iPhone there's
optical image stabilization onboard this
is a pretty significant bump up from the
8 megapixels on the last few generations
of iPhones and this new sensor finally
allows the iPhone to record video in 4k
another new feature to the iPhones
camera is what Apple likes to call live
photos and it's nothing crazy or out of
the ordinary but basically what it does
is records one-and-a-half seconds before
the photo is taken and one-and-a-half
seconds after and you'll know it's doing
this from the live indicator that shows
up on the screen to see them you just 3d
touch on the photo you took and the
image will instantly come to life in the
form of a short video but if you have
this feature turned on you want to make
sure you remember because most of my
live photos is just me putting my phone
away the front camera has also received
a significant upgrade where they bump up
to 5 megapixels over the one-point-two
of last year's iPhone there's a 5
megapixel front facing shooter on the
Moto X as well but the most interesting
part about the Moto X is front camera is
the front-facing flash that's supposed
to help with lower light selfies the 6s
plus doesn't have a front-facing flash
but it has what Apple likes to call
retina flash which is just a fancy way
of saying that the screen lights up a
bright white when you take a photo now
the one is groundbreaking or
revolutionary by any means but Apple
so-called retina flash does work a
little bit better at evenly illuminating
your face and isn't as blindingly bright
as the front-facing flash on the Moto X
another difference between these two
front cameras is that the Moto X is a
wide-angle lens whereas the iPhone is
not so you're going to have a much more
difficult time trying to fit multiple
subjects into the frame with the 6s plus
due to its narrower field of view the
Moto X has proven to have a pretty good
camera this year but when compared to
the images of the 6s plus there's a big
disparity between the way these two
cameras process images the Moto XS
images are a lot more saturated and
contrast II whereas the 6s Plus
maintains a much more natural look and
which one you like better is just a
matter of personal taste but where the
6s Plus really outshines the Moto X is
in dynamic range there's a lot more
detail in darker areas like shadows and
highlights aren't blown out like they
are on the Moto X the same goes for
low-light shots the photos aren't bad on
the Moto X and is a huge improvement
over last
model but again the highlights are
typically blown out and there's quite a
bit of noise reduction and over
brightening of the images which results
in a much softer and noisier photo for
not having optical image stabilization
it's a decent performer in low-light but
definitely pales in comparison to the
much sharper cleaner looking images of
the 6s plus as with any Android vs.
iPhone comparison you're looking at two
completely different software
experiences and ecosystems with the Moto
X you have a pretty near stock Android
experience with android 5.1.1 which
helps keep things running smoothly and
should provide for some speedy updates
now I say near stock because there's a
lot of really useful features baked in
by Motorola like moto voice which you
can customize with your own key phrase
to call on your Moto X at any time even
when the phone is asleep then there's
moto display moto actions and moto
assist that allows for a variety of
different things like subtly peeking at
your notifications twisting your wrist
launching to the camera or automatically
quieting your phone during the hours
that you need it to with the 6s plus
you're looking at iOS 9 and if you're
coming from previous iPhones there won't
be too many surprises here and you'll
instantly feel right at home
aesthetically it still looks pretty much
the same as the last couple major
releases of iOS and it's still the same
grid of icons as it's always been which
isn't a bad thing if you prefer an
experience that's pretty straight
forward the most notable change with the
iPhone this year is the addition of 3d
touch and with 3d touch you can do
things that Apple likes to call peek and
pop now 3d touch is not the same thing
as a long press you can still long press
like normal but with 3d touch you are
physically applying pressure on the
display and depending on how much
pressure you apply this will allow you
to access certain features and functions
for example within the mail app if you
press down on an email you can peek into
it without fully opening up the email
and if you decide it's something you
want to take a look at you just press a
little harder and it pops you right into
the full email this can also be done
with applications on the home screen so
if you were to 3d touch on the camera
app for example you can quickly take a
photo record a video and even take a
selfie
most of Apple's own applications already
support 3d touch and there's only a few
third-party apps that support it right
now but that number should grow as more
developers update their applications
even without a heavy amount of
third-party support there's still a lot
you can do with three
like easily moving the cursor around by
pressing down on the keyboard or jumping
into the multitasker by pressing and
sliding in from the side it's almost
kind of fun to poke and prod just to see
what works and doesn't work and from the
looks of it it's a feature that's going
to have a lot of longtime potential for
Apple the Moto X pure Edition is easily
one of the most affordable flagship
smartphones currently on the market
starting at $400 you can get yourself a
fully customized Moto X and it's pretty
amazing what Motorola was able to put
together for half the cost of other
flagships the 6s plus on the other hand
will run you $750 for the 16 gigabyte
version and pricing goes up from there
based on storage the 6s plus definitely
isn't cheap but you do have the option
of financing or subsidizing with
two-year contracts through carriers
which you don't have with the Moto X
since Motorola took a direct consumer
approach you can't really go wrong with
either one but if you're looking for a
customizable smart phone a clean
software experience and microSD card
expansion all without breaking the bank
then the Moto X is definitely a phone
worth considering the iPhone 6s plus
will offer everything you've come to
expect from previous iPhones and adds a
few key improvements like the camera and
3d touch so if you absolutely have to
have an iPhone well the 6s plus is the
best one money can buy as always thank
