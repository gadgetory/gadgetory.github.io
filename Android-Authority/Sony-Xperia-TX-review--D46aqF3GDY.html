this is April and you're tuned into the
Android Authority channel on YouTube
Sony is one of the very few companies
that make gorgeously designed Android
phones several of its phone designs
generally break away from trends
established by its competitors making
phone design one area where a Sony
Android phone can really stand out in
this review I'll take a closer look at
one of such gorgeously designed Android
phones the recently released Sony Xperia
T XLT 29 I I find it a very pretty
lightweight and palatable phone let's
find out whether its performance and
features are also pretty even with just
a glance you'll instantly see the black
pearl silver color theme on the phone's
exterior this color combination projects
class and sophistication it isn't loud
and flashy but it is firm and confident
the all-black front is extended by the
Sony and Xperia word marks and silver no
capacitive buttons or physical buttons
here as you can see the 1.3 megapixel
front camera LED notification phone
speaker grille and sensors are here the
front is surrounded by a glossy pearl
frame that bevels very slightly to this
narrow strip of Chrome if you actually
look out the side from a corner you'll
see that it's not a straight edge rather
it's angular and looks very nice the
shiny chrome frame adds a touch of class
to the phone the physical buttons are
aligned to this chrome frame and they
are extended in matte silver here's the
silver power button on the left with a
hook for hanging accessories down here
on the other side are the microUSB port
with a silver volume rocker next to it
and down near the corner is a silver
camera shutter button which I appreciate
much the headphone jack is at the top
side and the microphone hole is at the
bottom the phone's back is matte pearl
it's made of hard plastic one thing I
like about this backplate is that
fingerprints don't stick to it so it's
not prone to smudges notice how the
elements here are all aligned along the
vertical Center 13 megapixel camera LED
flash video microphone Sony
logo Xperia logo and loudspeaker grill
another nice thing about this backplate
is that it is removable the near-field
communication or NFC chip is here on the
underside the battery is also removable
this one's lithium polymer with capacity
of 1700 mAh here are the micro SD and
the Micro SIM card slots I find the back
of the Xperia TX very elegant there's
also something interesting about the
shape here the top and bottom edges
curve inwards towards the middle as you
can see here the left and right edges
however curve upwards I realize that
when the phone is placed on a flat
surface such curve makes the phone a
mini seesaw
but this curved design works to the
phone's advantage because the
loudspeaker grill is not completely
covered when the phone is placed on its
back we've seen mostly the phones pretty
exterior let's now check out the phone's
performance and software features the
Xperia T X comes with Android 4.0.4 Ice
Cream Sandwich and Sony Timescape UI
navigation is smooth and nearly seamless
with very minimal lag this phone's
processing hardware includes a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 MSM 82-68 chipset
dual-core 1.5 gigahertz Krait CPU Adreno
2 to 5 GPU 1 gigabyte of RAM and 16
gigabytes of internal storage we were
able to play games well although there's
some noticeable stutter overall
performance though is generally
acceptable though I must say that this
phone could have done better with a quad
core images and videos look very vivid
and crisp on the display thanks to the
high pixel density of 323 PPI provided
by this 4 point 55 inch TFT LCD
touchscreen display at 1280 by 720
pixels resolution it works great for
outdoor use because the screen remains
brilliant even under broad daylight
photos and videos that you capture on
this phone will look wonderful capturing
them will be easy too since the phone
has a dedicated shutter button outdoor
images turn out bright and vibrant and
RJ
of great quality indoor images however
aren't very nice despite the cameras low
light features autofocus works great but
takes a moment to latch on to a subject
there's a two to three second shutter
lag - although that doesn't really
bother me a lot as for battery life the
Xperia TX provides more than enough
juice to last up to 18 hours of music
playback or 4 hours of video playback or
about 6.6 hours of talktime on either 2g
or 3G we did a two hour battery test
just to get an idea of battery life
first hour we played looping video next
hour we browsed graphics heavy websites
result 49% of power left after two hours
with casual to moderate views the phone
can last probably up to 8 to 10 hours in
some the Sony Xperia T XLT 29 is a great
phone for those who want a lightweight
profitable and curvaceous Android
smartphone with a simple but elegant
design and with very vivid and vibrant
display it's hardware and battery are
more than enough for moderate gaming
browsing and multitasking it's also a
great phone for capturing outdoor photos
and videos multimedia playback both
music and video are Sony quality which
is my way of saying nice and awesome
