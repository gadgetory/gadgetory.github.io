lightest Chinese manufacturer vivo seeks
to bring these traits even to their
latest mid-range offering hey guys film
yer note with Android authority and this
is the review of vivos x5 pro the design
brings back again the seemingly popular
glass sandwich design with smoothly
polished aluminum sides slightly curving
into carefully machined champers on the
front and back the front and back panels
meet the aluminum frame almost
seamlessly leaving the glass panels
rising just a bit higher than the frame
along the aluminum frame on the left is
clean with no peripherals up top only a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack rest solo
on the right we have an aluminum volume
rocker and power switch and then the SIM
card slot which itself has two features
on the one hand you can use the first
since lot to store your standard SIM
card then the slot above can take
another SIM card if this phone maybe
doubles as a work and personal device or
you can use that second SIM slot for
expandable storage up to 128 gigabytes
it's a neat hardware feature that a few
manufacturers have adopted giving more
options and versatility to the consumer
the front glass panel sports an 8
megapixel front face and a green
lighting notification light with 3
capacitive buttons at the bottom an
options key left home middle and back on
the right on the back of the phone the
camera module is in the upper left with
a single LED flash the vivo branding
sets square in the middle
although oriented sideways the total
result is a device that carries a
premium design aesthetic is fairly
pocketable and is relatively comfortable
to hold despite being only six point
four millimeters thick the x5 pro boasts
a 5.2 inch 1080p Super AMOLED display at
424 pixels per inch and it's that Super
AMOLED that really shines here the
screen produces rich colors that look
great indoors and especially outdoors
the screens calibration leans slightly
on the warmer side and the screens
brightness while not the brightest on
the market is certainly bright enough
for my use normally kept at around 75%
the very popular budget smartphone CPU
the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615
makes a return here in the X
five pro bolstered with the Adreno 405
GPU and two gigs of ram while some of
the other cheaper phones with lower
resolution displays blazed through
performance metrics with this EP you
hear the x5 Pro stumbles every so often
now opening apps almost always comes
with a few seconds of delay before it
finally gets you into the app and most
times besides that it's a fairly fluid
experience but there are times many in a
day where it will lag up playing
catch-up waiting before registering a
scroll down a web page and stuttering a
few times on its way down it doesn't
happen so often that it makes the phone
a headache but often enough that you'll
notice it after use in a day
now unfortunately the x5 Pro does only
come standard with 16 gigs of storage
but again you can ramp that up to 128
gigabytes through expansion now despite
having to speaker grilles on the bottom
the x5 Pro only has one speaker that
fires from the left
regardless it's loud enough for media
consumption without headphones but lacks
the richness in low-end to make it a
solid choice for sharing music with
friends and the battery here is on the
smaller side especially given the larger
footprint of this 5.2 inch display phone
it comes in at 24 50 milliamp hours and
is almost always a sure shot for full
day's use with moderate by consistent
use using mostly apps web browsing
camera and phone calling I ended the day
with about 40% left but on a day when I
focused on app and video use
consistently I ran the battery down by
the end of the night to about 13%
because the built-in UI doesn't allow
for battery status checking or screen on
time I had to use a third-party app
which didn't seem to register as
accurately as I'd hope the screen on
time of three hours shown seems to be
less than what I actually got on the day
of heavy use vivos camera choice here is
a 13 megapixel shooter it doesn't scream
extraordinary but functions as most do
in this price range well it shots turn
out okay with colors tending to lack a
bit of saturation appearing somewhat
dull indoors without flash expect shots
to have a great deal of noise and less
steady hands can expect a bit of blur
for those darker picks features like HDR
and face beauty help add some pizzazz to
your photos to help compensate for the
sometimes dull standard shots and
features like touch to capture help to
facilitate the actual photo taking
process
on the front somewhat larger than
average 8 megapixel camera takes
high-resolution images but even in good
lighting conditions finds focus
difficult to achieve it almost never
gets the image without a bit of blur
vivos take on software is their fun
touch OS 2.1 layered over 5.0 point 2
lollipop which in its basic appearance
greatly resembles iOS with icons like
music seemingly all too familiar and the
quick settings accessed by way of a
bottom swipe upwards
although giving many more options like
data on/off and recently used apps
another unique feature is the left
capacitive key which is an options key
that changes based on the app you're
using so if on the home screen it will
behave partly like other Android phones
when holding down anywhere on the home
screen bringing up the widgets and page
swiping effect settings on other apps
like Chrome it'll bring up the list of
options to select a new tab bookmark
check history and so on now since the
capacitive key is normally used to bring
up the list of open apps vivo has
implemented their own widget for this it
shows the number of apps currently
running the percentage of RAM used and
the efficiency of the phone clicking on
the wheel is the equivalent of clearing
all unused apps
tapping left allows you to go into the
app giving more detail and allowing to
clear any specific tasks a lot like
windows task manager the theme app also
makes a return here as well as a device
manager app that grants or refuses
permissions to certain apps expect the
pricing of the vivo x5 Pro to be around
just under four hundred and forty US
dollars so a rich beautiful screen a
great build and an interesting OS take
on Android or some of the highly
features to consider when comparing with
other mid tier smartphones but will that
be enough with budget smartphones
consistently decreasing in price and
rising in production quality well guys
