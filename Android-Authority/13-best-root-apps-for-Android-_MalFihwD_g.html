handy the Android authority app guide in
this quick video we're going to take a
look at the best Android route apps
first up is flash of five this simple
application lets you do a range of
things such as downloaded install
various recoveries scheduled roms and
other zips to be flashed and a whole lot
more it's a great tool for root users
full screen is an application that
removes the soft keys and replaces them
with something else you can choose from
a pie menu two corner buttons and a
whole lot more it's a fun alternative to
the standard soft keys GMD auto-hide
soft keys is another application that
will hide your soft keys from sight if
you don't want them to be seen the
mechanics are slightly different but the
idea is pretty much the same and it's
another option for those who want to
hide their soft keys goo manager is the
mobile application for the go IM website
there you can find all sorts of stuff
like recoveries to download and install
roms
gaps and a whole lot more it's had its
ups and downs but it's generally pretty
solid it greenify is an application that
analyzes what apps run when and how
frequently you can shut down those
applications they don't eat up to a
precious battery life it's considered a
must-have for root users and we agree
WIC food is both an application that is
absurdly simple but insanely useful it
allows you to boot directly into
recovery bootloader mode or download
mode it's a must-have for pretty much
all route users rOM Toolbox is a sort of
all-in-one option that allows the
install of recoveries managing
applications and there is even a
built-in route enabled file browser just
be careful when using it because some
options are for advanced users only and
it can mess things up a little bit
routes Explorer is a route enabled file
browser it's a solid option with a good
set of features and you can even use it
to change file permissions the interface
is simple to use even if it's a bit
old-school SD fix is a ridiculously
simple application that tries to fix the
lockdown SD card issue found on KitKat
and lollipop devices I personally tried
it on four devices and it's worked every
single time for me it won't work on all
devices but you should still give it a
shot super issue is the de-facto super
user application available on Android
and chances are you have it already it's
developed by chain fire who is a
well-known icon in the root and mod
scene if you don't have it you should
definitely get it Tasker is a very
powerful application that gives you the
power to do pretty much whatever you
want to do with your device it has a
deep learning curve but the
possibilities are virtually limitless
all tinker's should definitely try it
out Titanium Backup is quite possibly
the most recommended root application of
all time and for good reason with it you
can uninstall bloatware freeze
applications so they can't run and
perform backups on your apps and app
data it's a must have and you should
already have it exposed framework is
likely the number one reason people
still root their devices these days
exposed is a framework that other
developers can use to create modules
that do literally all kinds of things
for many it has replaced flashing roms
and it's an integral part of the route
experience now and that about does it
for this video folks the video likely
won't be updated again but the article
definitely will be so stop by from time
to time to see what's new also if you
have any recommendations leave them in
the comments below because I'm always
looking for more awesome applications if
you haven't already don't forget to
follow and subscribe to android
authority as always thanks for watching
everybody and have a wonderful day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
