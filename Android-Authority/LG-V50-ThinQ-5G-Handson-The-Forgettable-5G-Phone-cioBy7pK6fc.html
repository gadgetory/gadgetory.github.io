Android Authority and today we're at MWC
2019 taking a look at the brand new LG V
50 thank you
this is LG's very first 5g phone and it
doesn't want to be outdone by Samsung
with the new Galaxy S 10 5g so it
decided to launch its own 5g phone now
on the surface you probably won't notice
many differences between the LG v 50
thank you and the v40 from last year it
looks very much the same it has the same
triple rear camera setup on the back
basically the same design although
there's no camera hump on the back we
also had the same six point four inch
plastic OLED display we saw in last
year's model again it's not quite
Samsung level OLED but they are pretty
decent perhaps the biggest change on the
hardware front is the fact that the V 50
is running on Qualcomm Snapdragon 855
chipset we actually just reviewed the
Xiaomi me9 which also has the Snapdragon
855 chipset so if performance on the V
50 is anything like the me 9 we're
really looking forward to using this
everyday performance definitely
shouldn't be an issue here just a quick
note that our MWC coverage this year is
brought to you by digit daily your daily
dose of text straight to your inbox
check out the description below to learn
more
so aside from being able to utilize
Sprint's 2.5 gigahertz spectrum support
for 5g on the v50 thinkyou enables the
phone to utilize LG's new dual screen
accessory basically this is a 6.2 inch
OLED display baked into a sturdy folio
case and it just connects to the V 50
with pogo pins once you place the V 50
into the folio case attachment it
basically enables you to use the second
screen for pretty much anything you can
run side by side apps you can send
content to one screen or the other or
even use the second screen as a virtual
Bluetooth gaming controller so with 5g
support and the fact that it might be
powering a dual display unit while
gaming there's the potential for the
phone to get pretty hot but LG says it
equipped the phone with a new vapor
chamber heat dissipation system that
should be more effective at keeping
internal temperatures low so performance
shouldn't really suffer from this
now the problem is the LGV 40 received
pretty lukewarm reviews across the board
and the V 50 is essentially the same
with 5g support and a new processor I'm
not sure if the dual display accessory
is enough to move units but we'll have
to see once we get one in for our full
review for more MWC 2019 coverage be
sure to go to android authority comm and
check the link in the description below
for even more LG coverage as well LG
also announced the LG g 8 thin q which
is actually a pretty cool looking phone
so go check that out as well
and again be sure to stay tuned to
android authority this week for even
more Mobile World Congress 2019 coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
