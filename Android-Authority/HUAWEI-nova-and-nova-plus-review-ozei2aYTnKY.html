authority now to e4 this year while we
announced two new mid-range phones
though Nova and the Nova plus now the
Nova has a 5-inch display and the Nova
plus has a 5.5 inch display now if
you're after a smartphone that doesn't
come with flagship pricing but still has
a lot of interesting features and I
think you're going to find these two
phones quite interesting so let's talk
about design for a moment normally when
you have a handset that comes in a
normal and a plus variant the two phones
are really carbon copies of each other
with the Plus version being just
slightly bigger well that isn't the case
with the Nova and the Nova plus well
actually it is the case but not really
let me show you in any way the two
phones really are quite identical if you
look at the construction they both have
this same unibody metal construction if
you look at the layout they're both
almost identical you've got the volume
rocker on the right-hand side along with
the power button on the left-hand side
you've got the SIM tray that can be dual
SIM or one SIM and a micro SD card down
at the bottom we've got the micro USB
port along with a single speaker the
Nova plus actually has two speaker
grilles but only one of them has a
speaker behind it you've got the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack at the top and
the same kind of general feel when you
look at them from the front or from the
side however when you flip the phones
over things actually look quite
different the Nova had a round
fingerprint button and a camera that's
up towards the top toward one side on a
white band but when you flip them Nova
Plus over things are a bit different you
have a square fingerprint reader and the
camera is housed in the centre along
with a camera bump because of the metal
unibody both phones are easy to hold in
the hand they feel sturdy and the build
quality is really quite good so on the
one hand these phones look very similar
to each other on the other hand they
don't
in terms of display both have full HD
IPS LCD panels one is of course five
inches and the other is 5.5 inches that
means the 5.5 inch one has a slightly
lower pixel density however overall both
displays look very nice there are good
viewing angles and good colors in fact
during the settings you can actually
change the color temperature of the
display on both devices however I found
the default settings to be very nice
when you put the two displays
side-by-side they look very very similar
and if I had to call between the two if
I had to make a judgement I always say
that the Nova plus has the slightly
better display in terms of brightness
both displays produce 415 it's of
brightness and I've actually had really
no problem at all using them indoors and
outdoors with maybe just one exception
if you've got bright midday sunshine
shining directly down onto the device
you might find it a little bit difficult
to read but for 99 percent of the time
it's absolutely fine now the internals
of these two phones really is quite
identical they both have the same amount
of RAM they both have the same processor
they both have the same features like
fingerprint reader they both run the
same software really the only big
difference between the two is in the
camera package and we'll talk about that
in a moment but think about the
internals you get three gigabytes of RAM
which is really quite nice for a
mid-range phone they could have put two
gigabytes in there and it still would
read of qualified as a mid range but
they've gone with three which is really
quite nice you also get 32 gigabytes of
internal storage again they could have
put in 16 but 32 is certainly a welcome
addition here and you also get a micro
SD card slot again something very much
welcome both devices come with
fingerprint readers and really while we
have made some excellent fingerprint
readers in their recent devices
including the mate 8 and the huawei p9
and p9 plus and these two devices carry
on that tradition the fingerprint reader
is fast and it's accurate I've had no
trouble using it whatsoever
I also like the fact you can unlock your
phone and wake it just by putting your
finger on the on the fingerprint reader
and instantly it's ready for you to use
additional features for the fingerprint
reader including swiping through the
gallery and taking photos so the huawei
software certainly
make full use of the fingerprint reader
now when it comes to the processor this
is really where we see the mid-tier
specifications of this phone you're not
going to see a flagship processor here
in fact what we have is an octa-core
64-bit processor from Qualcomm the
Qualcomm Snapdragon six to five now the
six to five uses eight cortex a53 cores
from arm now the court is a 53 core is a
brilliant core in terms of power
efficiency however it's not got as great
performance as some of other of ARM
cores like the a 57 the a 72 and the a
73 so it's definitely down the lower end
of the performance range however great
on performance and that's reflected in
the battery life which we'll talk about
in a moment however the 625 does have a
couple of tricks up its sleeve first of
all it comes with an Adreno 506 GPU
which supports open GL es 3 point 1 so
it's an advanced GPU but maybe not the
fastest secondly it's also built using a
14 nanometer process now the 40
nanometer process is the same process
that the leading flagship processes are
built on today so you get the best in
terms of efficiency power efficiency and
the best in terms of speed in fact the
cause in this phone all clocked at 2
gigahertz which is really quite nice and
that means the overall performance is
actually very very good for day to day
use for email video web browsing social
media taking photos all that kind of
stuff you have seen no problem with this
device at all in fact also because
you've got three gigabytes of RAM the
the multitasking also works very well
you can even play 3d gaming on it
without too much of a problem I test it
with Riptide and with asphalt 8 airborne
and they both ran absolutely fine
now hardcore gamers will see that this
is not a top quality GPU they'll see
that there are maybe some drop frames
and they'll still maybe want something
else but if you're just a casual gamer
you just want to get out a racing game
where you're waiting for the bus where
you just just do something really minor
in 3d then it ain't going to be a
problem it is just going to be perfect
for you and the rest of the package in
terms of social media and web browsing
and email all that stuff is absolutely
fine so it's not a flagship processor
but actually it does have a low
to offer in terms of audio both phones
feature a single speaker on the bottom
edge now like most smartphones that
sound can be a bit tinny a bit
screeching in the higher end however
it's certainly very loud in fact too
loud sometimes and you may find you get
better sound quality if you've actually
reduced the volume down a notch or two
comparing the two phones side-by-side
I'll definitely say the Nova plus has
the better audio setup probably because
it has a slightly larger chassis in
terms of battery both devices come with
larger than 3000 milliamp hour batteries
and that's really quite impressive when
you consider it phones like the Samsung
Galaxy Note 5 or the LG g5 have three
thousand or less milliamp hour batteries
in fact you Minova get three thousand
and twenty milliamp hours and in the
Nova class you get three thousand three
hundred and forty milliamp hours now
basically the Nova plus has a bigger
battery because it has a bigger screen
and it's really just to compensate for
that bigger power needed to power that
screen overall they both actually give
you roughly the same kind of battery
life and that battery life is quite
impressive playing 3d games you'll be
able to get at least five hours of
gameplay from a single charge and that's
pretty good because some phones don't
even give you five hours on screen time
just for doing simple tasks like
browsing the web and this is for 3d
games in fact when it comes to things
like browsing the web or watching video
you're going to get 10 or 11 hours of
on-screen time using these devices and
so if you mix that all up between
playing 3d games social media web
browsing email taking photos answering
some calls then I reckon you get between
seven and nine hours of on-screen time
from every single charge and that's
really enough to get you through an
entire day without any problem
whatsoever
and actually depending on your usage you
may even get two days of battery life
out of this phone so it's a really good
feature of these two devices talking
about trees are also some great software
features that help you extend the
battery life for example there are some
power saving modes including an ultra
power saving mode which kicks in a
monochrome user interface that can
really extend that battery life when
you're in a squeeze and you don't have
where to plug your phone in now both
phones come with Android 6.0 marshmallow
with while weighs emotion UI on
now the biggest difference about a while
weighs in motion UI is the fact it has
no app drawer so you'll have to organize
your apps using folders on the home
screens our person that's not a problem
for me if it is a problem for you you
can always install an alternative
launcher now built into the software are
lots of extra features that take
advantage of things like the fingerprint
reader you've also got motion gestures
you've also got knuckle gestures that
allows take things like screenshots by
just double tapping on the screen with
your knuckle there's a whole bunch of
other features that while we have built
in and you want to find out more about
all those features do head over to the
androids comm website where you'll find
is written companion it tells you more
about the software that comes with this
device now as I said previously one area
where we've seen this phone is really in
the mid tier is because of the processor
package another area is the camera setup
now the Nova comes with a 12 megapixel
camera and the Nova plus comes with a 16
megapixel camera now both cameras have a
lot of good features for example they
can both do 4k video
the Nova plus for example also has
optical image stabilization and the
camera app that you get with both
devices is excellent there are so many
different features you can do in there
but I really haven't got time to cover
now but you've got HDR you've got
panorama and there's a whole load of
different effects like slo-mo and Knight
trails and new beautification mode and
it's really an excellent camera effect
on both cameras there's even a full
manual mode that even lets you do manual
focus that's not something you see on
every smartphone so there's a good load
of things that are good positive about
these cameras however when you start to
take pictures they aren't quite up to
high standards if everything is well if
you're outdoors it's a nice sunny day
you're going to get some good shot and
they are really quite some good shots
however as soon as you go indoors into
lower light situations or using it
artificial lighting then you'll start to
see a lot of noise creeping into the
pictures both phones also have a nice 8
megapixel front-facing camera which does
actually produce some fairly good shots
so there you have it the Nova and the
Nova plus good full HD displays good
viewing angles good color reproduction
good internals 3 gigabytes of RAM 32
gigabytes of internal storage
you've got the fingerprint readers on
both phones got good
to where you've got a lot of features
including in that software that take
advantage of the fingerprint reader and
lots of other things like motion
gestures and knuckle gestures
however the processing package is a
little weak and the cameras are as
necessarily as good as you're gonna find
in other mid-range devices
