and I'm here with Keith from FLIR one or
rather that's the name of the product
from FLIR and he had a really cool
product to show was here at the booth at
you can see the booth behind us here for
Android Authority and he wanted to kind
of talk to us about it we thought was a
really nice product so I'm gonna like
Keith explain what exactly this little
peripheral is that connects to a
smartphone so let's go ahead and do a
little bit about this yeah so this is
the FLIR one thermal imaging camera it
essentially allows you to see the
invisible world of infrared light we
call it super powers it turns your
Smartphone into a brilliant phone so at
CES this year we've launched two
versions this is the pro version here
you'll be available in the second
quarter for $399 and then we have a
entry-level model that's $199 okay so it
always it's always nice to have a
different way of looking at things you
know infrared heat vision some like that
as they said they call it super powers
but I guess the main question that would
be on a lot of people's minds is what
kind of applications are we looking for
for a thermal or rather an infrared
imaging camera like this yeah so the
primary applications would be DIY
do-it-yourself activity so checking
windows and doors for drafts energy
efficiency you can also use it for
vermin infestation it can detect heat
including bees nests and what have you
it's also great for detecting water
leaks even finding studs on exterior
walls it's also good for finding
blockages you can also use it in car
maintenance Diagnostics if you're having
a blockage in your a/c or heat system
you'd be able to type that pretty easily
with this device and really the
possibilities are endless so what kind
of technology I can see on the
peripheral here they have a couple
cameras there
what exactly is what exactly is the tech
that's causing this to happen yeah so
there's essentially it's a two camera
system okay so there's a thermal imaging
camera here it's called the lefthand
thermal imaging sensor and then we
have a 2-megapixel visible camera so we
have this process called multi spectral
imaging also known as MSX that basically
embosses the edge detail of the visible
camera onto the thermal data so it gives
you a richer and a lot more richer image
and a lot more context
okay well I'm sure there's going to be
some b-roll of the application itself
the FLIR one if I'm coming that's
correct so the app will be able to
record the video and to request a photos
but in either sense right so the regular
camera will be able to take regular
photos but then you can always overlay
the imprint on top yeah okay yeah so you
can actually you shoot in just thermal
imaging and then you can also shoot in
the visible with just the visible camera
and then you can do the MSX so that's
really three ways that you can use this
device okay I'm looking at the
peripheral right now and I notice it's a
USB C port plug yeah so from what I
remember after after Keith came earlier
to show us the product he was using a
Google pixel so with that in mind I have
my pixel which is actually right here
and you'll be seeing footage right now
of the show floor here at CES we're just
walking through the show floor and I'll
be cutting in and out as you can see
here with the thermal camera with the
FLIR one and with my camera so you can
kind of see the difference there so
aside from applications when it comes to
consumer grade products like this what
kind of price point have you guys put on
here for Africa tumors yeah so for the
entry-level consumer model that's $199
and that's the least expensive thermal
imaging camera ever created oh great
very exciting and then we have an
upgraded 399 version called the FLIR one
Pro and this provides a little bit
better image processing there's more
diagnostic capabilities and also
OneTouch reporting so if you're a
plumber or electrician and you notice a
problem you can take a picture and then
produce a report and then send it to
your client and let them know the issue
okay I'm guessing you may or may not
have different plugs for other phones as
well
I know USBC is the future but there are
some micro USB micro USB out there yes
so that's something that we're
discussing right now actually and we may
include an adapter with this device that
will allow you to go from usb see to
micro USB okay any plans in the future
for because I've been saying this for a
few different peripherals where it's it
would be great to see for example 360
cameras or even just different kinds of
cameras built into smartphones yeah we
would youwould you be would like is that
in the plans at all to see this kind of
technology at least from your standpoint
I got built into a phone yeah actually
that's already happened oh there is the
cat s60 Android from headphones yeah
produced by a company called Bullock
grouping it's a phenomenal device and
it's basically a filly r1 embedded into
an Android watch yeah that's great all
right wonderful
oh one thing I should have asked earlier
you gave us the price points but where
can the people find these devices or
many vendors or online Amazon you guys
website yeah so this this device will be
available later this year but we do have
what we call the FLIR one generation 2
available ok and you can buy that clear
calm amazon bestbuy.com
also will be oh that's great yeah so I
can't say what the distribution is more
yet for this device of course but you
can expect something soon okay great
well hopefully you're seeing the image
right now of the difference between a
regular pixel camera and then you'll be
able to see everything with your super
powers through they through the infrared
imaging of the FLIR one keep it to to
Android authority for this and even more
wonderful little accessories and
peripherals like this taking a little
bit of out of box thinking that way you
have a different way of actually
experiencing your smartphone's then
Keith thank you so much for coming by
you have a safe flight back I know that
the snowstorm is gonna be a little bit
rough on you yeah I was actually
supposed to go back last night oh yeah
exactly that's why he's here with us so
it all worked out in the end
yeah I kind of worked that so hopefully
you guys enjoyed that and all of our
coverage here at CES 2017 make sure you
keep it tuned to Android thority and all
of our properties for even more because
we are your source for everything and
your
and more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
