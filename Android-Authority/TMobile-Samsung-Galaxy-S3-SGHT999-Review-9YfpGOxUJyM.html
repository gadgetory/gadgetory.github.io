for tuning in this is Clayton
representing android 30.com your number
one site for all things Android today
we've got a review of the Samsung Galaxy
s3 as you can see we've got the pebble
blue version and this is also the
t-mobile variant of the galaxy s3 you
can see there we've got our carrier
branding so before we get into the
software and all the other great
features of the Samsung Galaxy s3 let's
just give the body a quick overlook you
see here on the left we've got our
volume rocker we can go up and down
we're back here we have our LED we've
got our camera and then our speaker
here's our power button now on top we've
got our headphone jack in our little
area that we can pop the back off on
bottom we've got our microSD as well as
a little mic now I'll just peel the back
off to show you what it looks like in
there now there are some questions
whether or not the back might lose its
finish with a continuous bending but as
you can see there it's not really a you
know causing any damage this is a pretty
strong backing here so it's not going to
peel off anyways we've got our SIM card
slot or expandable storage and then our
battery here capable of NFC we've got
our near-field communication will pop
the back back on very quickly really
nice the back goes on and off and just
an incident anyways we've got our
front-facing camera right here which is
1.9 megapixels our rear facing camera is
8 megapixels we've got our physical home
button here and then you almost can't
even notice we're a place for the
capacitive haptic buttons are down here
but when we turn them on you can in fact
see them Samsung has done a really great
job of hiding the buttons within the
pebble blue finish if any as we turn
that on we've got our lock screen the
same lock screen as all of the galaxy
s3s there's not going to be much
difference in the t-mobile vairy enter
the Sprint or Verizon or even the
international version now as we move
through our home screen we can see we
have a lot of pre-loaded widgets there's
not actually too much bloatware pretty
much all of it is located right here
we've got our visual voicemail t-mobile
mobile hotspot
access t-mobile the Amazon Appstore got
some bonus apps some nice widgets
included but we're just going to walk
through the basic features of this foam
then Amy's we pull down the notification
bar we have all of our different toggles
Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS screen rotation
airplane mode sync we've got our
notifications here we can actually go
into our settings where we have our
Wi-Fi Bluetooth data usage under more
settings is where we can actually enable
our NFC and our Android Beam and also
enable the S beam and we have some cool
settings there now going back we have
our sound settings now we can choose our
device ringtone device vibration the key
tones choose if there's touch sounds we
can play the screen lock sound we can
also enable and disable haptic feedback
which I'm a fan of anyways we've got our
motion settings our LED indicator
settings our LED indicator is located on
the top left and it flashes a nice
little light whenever we have a
notification we have our power saving
mode we can go to our battery options
see what's been draining the battery as
you see here on cell standby the phone
is lasted for two days one hour and 48
minutes and is 49% in discharging and
actually see how long each individual
thing has been going when we click the
battery news we have our accounts and
sync options we have our location
services and then we have our developer
options that are native with the Android
Ice Cream Sandwich operating system now
when we go to the about device we see
here we're running Android 4.0.4 we've
got our stock kernel and this is running
the TouchWiz 4 overlay over the Android
Ice Cream Sandwich operating system
nothing our developer options we can
choose to enable USB debugging we can
show touches we've got a nice little lot
cursor there we can force GPU rendering
which is the the use of 2d hardware
acceleration in applications as you see
here we have all of our preloaded apps
on here I haven't downloaded any really
and we have infinite scrolling where we
can just go all the way through we also
have our widgets and under the widgets
there's a lot of cool clocks we've got
our s play
manor we've got our email Gmail Google+
we can choose our audio settings right
from there we've got our s suggest which
suggests apps got our S Memo and this
has infinite schooling as well you can
watch on the bottom as it goes through
and back again anyways how you would add
one of these to the home screen you just
grab it
and you can bring it over and you can
add it to the screen of your choice you
can also create a folder create a page
get the app info or delete it now when
you bring delete it also uninstall zaps
now anyways we will just click that
that's fine we'll cancel that widget
anyways a lot of the cool customizations
we'll go through here go to the settings
menu so wonder our lock screen options
we can show an information ticker which
is really awesome
you have camera quick access we can
enable we can show our clock including
the dual clock and we actually turn our
weather on a lot of cool other security
features we have our face on lock we can
also use a pattern or a pin and a lot of
other ones there's some cool stuff now
in conjunction with the face on lock our
front facing camera actually has the
smart stay feature where the phone can
actually track the movement of your eyes
and shut the screen off if you are not
directly looking at it we can also
change the font style on the font size
and we cannot access the brightness from
here there is no master brightness we
can access our settings here we can
create a folder easily like this and we
can edit the home screen just like that
and also access that by simply pinching
and we get all of our home screens we
can choose which one is our default home
screen so these will just go into the
camera and test it out we've got a lot
of cool camera options without a burst
shot on we can just simply click as it
does have very very fast picture taking
abilities now if we access our settings
we can have a self portrait and turn our
flash on and off under our shooting mode
we have the option of single shot burst
shot HDR smile Beauty panorama cartoon
and we can also use our share shot which
instantly uploads it via Wi-Fi we can go
to our scenes here with a bunch of
different scenes our exposure values
there our focus mode where we can choose
auto focus macro or face detection and
choose our resolution or white balance
ISO we can enable anti-shake we have
Auto contrast GPS tagging can choose our
image quality superfine finder normal so
anyways the video capabilities are very
awesome the 8 megapixel camera is great
and then we also have our front-facing
camera which works very very fine as
well anyway as we go back while pressing
the home button can actually allow us to
remove our applications and also access
the task manager then accessing the task
manager we can free up our memory view
which applications are active clear
memory just like that we have got a lot
of memory this model has two gigabytes
of RAM and a Snapdragon s4 dual-core
processor at 1.5 gigahertz so we'll just
run a quadrant standard benchmark on
this phone this will give you an idea of
how fast it is our two gigabytes of RAM
are really going to help the speed out
okay so our device ended up scoring a
forty eight hundred and thirty eight
score which is very very high the CPU
scored seventy seven hundred and
sixty-one and the memory scored
extremely high so you can see the memory
is uh represented by the red bar and it
has a lot more memory than any of these
other phones the two gigabytes of RAM
actually helps this phone out immensely
now anyways we'll go back and we'll go
over some of the more intuitive features
of the galaxy s3 starting with our s
voice navigate to Burger King and it
brings up navigation we can actually do
that I'm just going to go ahead and go
back search the web for Samsung Galaxy
s3 t mobile version
there we go we have our voice
confirmation from the little assistant
and we successfully went to our web
search of the galaxy s3 t-mobile version
now anyways our web browser is very
intuitive
it comes with Google labs as well as our
tab browsing just like that we have our
incognito mode here and we can scroll
through our tab just like this remove
them simply by tapping the minus button
there we have our web options here we
have to choose our individual brightness
right here actually we can access our
downloads there remind me to wake up at
9:30 on June 30th there we go and
basically it's just a really really
intuitive feature the s voice is very
awesome it just worked perfectly right
there I was able to set the alarm
navigate search the web anyways we've
also got our S Memo which is a nice memo
application you can simply draw or you
can also use your gestures and whatnot
anyways guys if you've got any more
questions I just want you to post them
in the comment section we'll be sure to
keep up with them and that was our
review for the t-mobile version of the
Samsung Galaxy s3 in pebble blue if you
