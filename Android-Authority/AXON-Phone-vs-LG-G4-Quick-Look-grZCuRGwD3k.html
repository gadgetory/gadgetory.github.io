Android authority and the axon phone was
just announced but how does it compare
to LG's latest flagship well that's
where we're about to find out with this
quick look of the axon phone versus the
LG g4 when it comes to design the axon
phone looks like a combination of the
HTC One X and the HTC One series that
followed it boasting a premium full
metal unibody construction and the
design is further enhanced by a somewhat
unique grille design that covers the
front facing speakers and also makes an
appearance on the back in between the
two lenses of the dual camera system on
the other hand the LG g4 brings together
the best design elements of their last
two high-end offerings the G flex 2 and
the LG g3 culminating into the LG g4
what's its subtle curve to the display
that is more pronounced when turning
over to the back as well as the
signature LG rear button layout while
the design isn't a dramatic departure
from the company's norm what LG tried to
do in terms of its uniqueness is seen in
the material options available for the
rear panel available in a plastic
backing with a ceramic finish or in a
leather with a variety of color options
the LG g4 does have its own way of being
a head-turner both devices feature 5.5
inch displays with dimensions that are
quite similar as such the handling
experience is also similar between the
two with the exception of the axon phone
being slightly taller
although the LG g4 does get some points
for easier access to the buttons
courtesy of the unique position on the
back compared to the more standard
placement found on the axon phone both
these smartphones look great but it can
be argued that the excellent phone
provides a more premium feel because of
its full metal construction either way
design is one department in which both
smartphones won't disappoint as
mentioned earlier both the LG g4 and the
axon phone feature 5.5 inch displays
with quad HD resolution resulting in a
pixel density of 534 PPI the difference
comes in regards to the underlying
technologies with the g4 employing the
tried and tested IPS LCD enhanced to
what LG calls a quantum display while
the other uses CG
or continuous grain silicon technology a
big focus with the LG g4 was also
unmaking this display rival the DCI
standard found in general television and
cinema with the quantum display hitting
ninety-eight percent of that mark it is
also worth mentioning here that despite
the g4 coming with a curved display the
immersive effect available with the more
significant curve on the G flex doesn't
entirely make its way over the LG g4
display may not pop as much as the
amyloids of the world but the color
reproduction is certainly very accurate
and there are no issues with brightness
or viewing angles on the other hand the
display of the acts on phone looks like
it stacks up well to the g4 it's
extremely bright vivid with great color
reproduction and viewing angles so
either way you decide to go here you're
going to come out a winner
both the LG g4 and the axon phone are
being powered by Snapdragon processors
with the g4 running on the 808 and the
810 on the axon phone the axon phone
does get a leg up over the g4 by coming
with four gigabytes of RAM which is one
more than what is available with the g4
performance with the g4 is absolutely
fantastic and the usually somewhat
sluggish LG UI now runs as fast as it's
ever been even at the OS isn't
particularly lacking in features or as
light as the skin on the axon phone the
same can pretty much be said about the
axon phone and in our brief time with
the device performance was snappy and
responsive making the device a pleasure
to use and with four gigs of RAM the
axon phone is going to be a multitasking
beast of course many are still leery
about the Snapdragon 810 due to its
overheating issues obviously we'll have
to wait and see if that has truly been
resolved but so far things seem to be
promising both smartphones come with 32
gigabytes of on-board storage but the LG
g4 offering expansion firon microSD up
to 128 gigabytes something that isn't
possible with the axon phone the big
plus with the axon phone is it's the
first phone sold in the US with hi-fi
audio playback which can be taken
advantage of by even the most
inexpensive of earbuds both smartphones
also pack 3000 milliamp hour batteries
but the g4 comes with the added
advantage of the battery being
replaceable giving users the opportunity
of carrying around a spare the battery
life with the g4 has been quite
impressive and given this
similarities between the two battery
life should hopefully be similar to the
g4 or possibly even better on the axon
phone in the case of the g4 af 1.8
aperture package outshines the
competition with a larger sensor over
ones found in other flagships OAS is
also enhanced with a wider stabilization
range color has been given a big focus
with LG adding in a color spectrum
sensor found right next to the optics
that would analyze the scene to help
achieve the right white balance
automatically and accurately the manual
mode is another big story as LG has put
in all the big features photographers
get in full cameras a full white balance
gamut a lot of ISO stops manual focus a
histogram and even the ability to shoot
in raw and JPEG simultaneously overall
the LG g4 camera is one of the best in
the business and is certainly a very
hard act to follow the axon phone
features a dual camera setup similar to
what HTC did with the One m8 with a 13
megapixel main shooter accompanied by a
2 megapixel sensor to allow for better
depth of field shots faster autofocus
and refocusing of shots after the fact
the camera is also capable of video
recording in 4k and comes with twin
microphones along with some of the best
and noise suppression technology to help
eliminate background and wind noise when
recording concert videos and voice calls
there is also an 8 megapixel
front-facing camera which is a fantastic
choice for all you selfie lovers out
there in software the g4 comes with a
very familiar user interface that hasn't
changed much but an optimized processing
package allows for lag and stutter to be
kept at a minimum many of LG's features
have been retained here ranging from the
useful knock code and multi window to
the not so useful features like smart
bulletin and smart notice the axon phone
runs a custom version of android 5.1.1
lollipop the user interface is very
minimalistic and things look to be very
light which is one of the reasons why
performance is as smooth as it is and
the skin manages to keep Google's
material design aesthetics intact like
the notification shade and the overview
screen for example for a much more stock
like experience applications like Argus
and rock my run can also be found
pre-installed on the axon phone to help
you achieve a healthier lifestyle as
always guys thank you so much for
watching this video hopefully in
this quick comparison of the acts on
phone versus the LG g4 and the acts on
phone looks to be doing some really
great things especially for the price
point and there's no doubt that this
phone is going to be able to hold its
own against the major ball players but
only time will tell how well it really
stacks up anyways guys thank you so much
