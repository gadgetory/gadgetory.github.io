Galaxy S a review and you know that this
phone is incredibly solid has a bunch of
features and is an aid easy to handle
package also it takes a pretty damn good
picture now whether or not the SI is the
best phone on the market is something
that we kind of stopped short of saying
and it's hard to give a designation as
to what exactly is the very best phone
out there after all it's about your
needs and whether or not this phone is
going to tackle everything that you
require from it now with that said there
is one thing that gave us pause about
the Galaxy s8 and it's what we want to
talk about in this video it's Joshua
Vergara what's going on everybody and
the one thing missing from the Samsung
Galaxy s8 is a dual camera now in this
video I'm not going to really say that
any other cameras with dual lenses are
better than the Samsung Galaxy s8 on the
contrary the SI is still one of the best
cameras that's out there it's just a
matter of exploring this new trend that
we have with dual cameras and why the SI
might be falling behind a little bit by
not providing that level of choice after
all smartphone photography has really
boomed over the last couple of years and
we've come a very long way we've gone
from the sony cybershot cameras with
like 1.2 megapixels in them and now we
have everything we have now is an
exciting time for fotox and the
smartphone has become not necessarily
just the camera you had on you but it
has now become a viable secondary
shooter for any experienced photographer
now it's not really supposed to be that
way smartphone photography for all
intents and purposes is supposed to suck
and historically it did but why well the
laws of physics a camera sensor has to
flood in all of the possible light in a
scene in order to accurately and
effectively create an image users and
reviewers used to be grudgingly compared
smartphone sensors to the kinds that we
find on DSLR or now mirrorless cameras
knowing that they was probably unfair to
do so so as a response to all of this
companies tried very hard to find other
ways of getting very good photos out of
the data they could collect taking in as
much data as they could in that small
little area on the back of their
smartphones they turn to software and
the interpretation of that data to
create what would be a nice looking
photo and I actually remember when I
thought that the companies were getting
better at this again it was Samsung back
at MWC 2015 with the galaxy s6
okay I'll go to the note 4 it'd be nice
to revisit Samsung's cameras and see
what we're going to find out you know
what we're going to get in the next one
and then as in the s6 I have to say all
what all of you are saying alright this
is one of the best cameras on this
ecosystem and it's and it's incredible I
love this thing just got you know bumped
by the edge is great but it's like wow
what I want is the s6 is 1.9 at manual
focus oh yeah that's exactly what I
can't wait for because like there is a
focus on the camera UI on uh yeah there
is
yeah j6 exactly that's what I can't wait
for Ava and this camera over the last
just 18 hours I'm ready and back in love
with this phone I've reconverted
actually but going back to the single
lens hardware a lot of companies were
trying to find hardware ways of making
their photos better and one way they
were trying to make their pixels a lot
bigger now this is something you might
recognize from the HTC phones where they
call them the ultra pixels now the
problem with that was you ended up
getting photos that were a lot smaller
than your other counterparts that had
maybe three times or even four times as
many megapixels in their camera sensors
a more recent trend has been to make the
megapixel count somewhere around 12 with
the pixels being as big as possible
Samsung then returns by making these
pixels focus pixels adding InFocus
diodes that allowed for the focus speed
to be incredibly fast on the galaxy s7
so that's a brief history of Samsung's
attempts to improve the camera game
taking the one sensor that they have on
the back of their smart phones and
making it as good as possible the end
result of being the s8 however somewhere
down the line these companies started to
think outside of the box and that's
where these dual cameras come in
you might remember an extra eye
appearing on the top of the HTC One m8
seemingly made to capture depth data so
that users could harness bouquet like
never before and if you remember how
that went it was a good idea with some
pretty poor execution but this idea
would be taken further by companies like
Huawei and honor but instead of a depth
sensor it was a monochrome sensor that
helped in capturing detail this would
actually be while Waze trend leading up
to the more recent P 10 and P 10 plus
phones that have gone some pretty high
praise for their photography sure enough
other companies in the Android space
would soon be following suit adding dual
cameras in their own little flavor so
that you can get more choice with
smartphone photography the LG v10 is an
example that comes to mind that put a
dual camera on the front so you can fit
more people
into your frame when taking a selfie
however that same idea was moved to the
rear when you got the LG g5 and that was
when the fun really began hardly anyone
would call the g5 the phone of the year
but once you got past the failed attempt
at modularity the phone certainly had
one great thing going for it the dual
camera what she had here was a regular
camera and then a wide-angle lens that
allowed you to get almost GoPro like
action camera shots and those were
incredibly fun to use even when you
turned it around and you took a selfie
fitting in literally everybody and
everything that was around you that
continued with the LG v 20 which I did
use for a blogging with a smartphone
segment here on Android Authority back
at Aoife 2015 and manual controls for
video also made it an even better
shooter for choice in the Android space
and this craze for dual cameras went
outside the world of Android you can
obviously think about the iPhone 7 plus
which added optical zoom by adding an a
telephoto lens aside from its normal
wider angle counterpart and more
recently I was just able to take a look
at the brand new Salmi me 6 which took
the same idea and put it onto an Android
device with all of its own fixings so
it's pretty obvious why I'm trying to
say here I love dual cameras and I think
that the trend has really shown the kind
of innovation that you can see in
smartphones today now that's not to say
that any single lens cameras are worse
than dual cameras
it's just that with a dual camera you
can eke out even more detail from those
photos like Huawei has and you can also
get more choice and more flexibility
with cameras like the LG G 6 which I
will admit is one of the first phones I
go for because of that choice so the
Samsung Galaxy S a is still one of the
most highly recommended phones that
we've seen so far this year but if you
want to have a little bit more choice
again knowing exactly what your needs
are then maybe you would want to go to
one of these other cameras that has a
dual sensor that way you'll be able to
get in the case of the g6 a wide-angle
shot on top of having the regular shots
all put into the same package and that's
something that this Galaxy s8
unfortunately it's just not able to
provide yet maybe Samsung will put a
dual camera in one of the phones in the
future but at that time we could
probably expect Samsung to do something
pretty spectacular with it because
evolution just goes that way we've had a
couple of years of dual cameras and
attempts at dual cameras so maybe one of
these companies like the next pixel or
the next
Samsung Galaxy device are going to
really show us something special when
you use more than one camera keep it in
2 and row 34 even more about the Samsung
Galaxy S a and don't forget to check out
