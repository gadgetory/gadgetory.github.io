by bitdefender mobile security the
second generation of Samsung's gear
SmartWatch ditches the galaxy branding
and with it
Android in favor of Tizen Samsung's long
coming Linux based operating system that
was just introduced here at MWC hey it's
Josh freghar from Android 30 what's
going on everybody and thus we have for
you the first look at the Samsung gear 2
instead of an awkward bulge on the strap
the gear 2 seamlessly integrates the
camera inside its body
moreover the strap itself is thinner and
more flexible which makes the device
feel better on the wrist straps are now
interchangeable too so you can adapt at
the gear 2 to your own style and in
terms of the general design the gear 2
isn't really straying far from the
direction set with the first generation
but with these optimizations it is
overall slimmer lighter and we think
better looking now the button that was
originally on the side of the gear for
standby and waking the gear has been
moved over to the bottom center of the
body basically simulating a home button
kind of feel it works just like the
standby and wake button however no
matter how you use it
Samsung managed to greatly extend the
battery life of the gear 2 also to a
very reasonable two to three days with
typical usage and up to 6 days with more
frugal usage for comparison the original
gear makes it through maybe about a day
meaning that you had to charge it every
single night that probably and most
likely will not be the case with the
gear 2 functionality on the gear 2 is
also not in shortage as a few new apps
have been added in one in particular is
the gear two's built-in music system 4
gigabytes of on-board storage are
available for you to put some music on
there and when you pair a Bluetooth
headset to the gear 2 you will be able
to listen to some music without needing
a smart phone nearby some fitness apps
are also available for those who really
want to keep track of their fitness and
a heart rate monitor on the back of the
unit itself uses an infrared light to
check your heart rate when you need to
after that there is actually also a
watch on application that allows you to
use the infrared sensor built into the
body in order to control some of your
other media devices overall we do like
the gear 2 mainly because its
functionality has been brought up as
specially with that built-in music
player so you don't need to have a
smartphone around to listen to some good
tunes also the fitness applications are
quite nice and overall it does look like
a solid update to the opening gear and
if the price is right we should be
seeing it become more successful than
its predecessor stay tuned to android
