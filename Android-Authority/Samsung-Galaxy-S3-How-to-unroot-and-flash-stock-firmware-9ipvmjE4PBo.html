Youngberg coming at you from the best
Android site on the web Android
authority calm today I'm gonna be
showing you a quick tutorial on how to
flash a stock firmware on your Samsung
Galaxy s3 now when you flash a stock
firmware it also unroot your device so
if you need to return your Galaxy s3 for
warranty purposes this is a perfectly
fine method of doing so anyways the
first thing we're going to do is go to
the xda-developers page that I have
linked in the description and we'll find
the most recent software update which is
the i-90 300 x x.b lfb now mind you this
is for the galaxy s3 I 9300 version and
it won't work for any of the others
don't try and flash the stock firmware
on any of the other variants of the
galaxy s3 anyways we're going to need
the i-90 300 x x.b lfb download or the
newest one whenever this whenever you're
trying this method todays we're going to
click download on Mac and it will
download to our computer and we're also
going to need to download odin version
3.0 point-four that's a zip file so
anyways on my computer I've moved the
stock firmware to the new folder it
comes in this zip file we'll just
extract it we have the SS DLL file and
then we have the firmware file which is
a dot ta r also we have our odin which I
downloaded and when we open Oh Dan will
need to open it from the folder and
download it in and if you move the
program out to the desktop it will not
work so keep that in mind anyways the
first thing we're going to do is power
down our galaxy s3 I'm going to need to
put it into download mode so we're just
going to power off and once the device
is off we're going to be holding the
home button the volume down button and
the power and just hold those until it
boots up you'll get this screen it says
volume up to continued volume down to
cancel and restart the phone we're going
to continue by clicking up see we're in
download mode now now we're just going
to want to plug our galaxy s3 into our
computer and open the odin program once
the odin program is open you'll see the
zero comm 7 or it could be come with a
different number but it doesn't matter
anyways what we're going to want to do
is click the PDA button and then we're
going to want to uh surf in our
downloads or desktop wherever we moved
it to our stock firmware file
so I moved it to a new folder and here's
our firmware file file it's a dot r dot
MV v that just goes in the PDA make sure
repartition is not checked and click
start you'll see when it's finished we
have our past symbol there we can just
minimize Odin and our galaxy s3 is a
beginning its reboot we can unplug it
from the computer at this point and
we'll just wait for the setup screen to
start ok guys if you're stuck in a boot
loop where all you see on the screen is
just the Samsung logo which may happen
when you flash a stock firmware you're
just going to want to remove the battery
and then you'll put it back in hold the
volume up the power and the home button
and then you'll just start it up this
will boot you into the stock recovery
because you will be unrooted and once
you see the little Andie there with his
orb flashing you're going to want to go
to the wipe data/factory reset and
confirm that with a yes then after that
you're going to want to wipe the cache
partition and then you can reboot system
now and you'll reboot with a fully
functional galaxy s3 completely
unrelated and running me stock firmware
anyways guys if you enjoy the tutorial

be updated with everything Android for
as long as you're there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
