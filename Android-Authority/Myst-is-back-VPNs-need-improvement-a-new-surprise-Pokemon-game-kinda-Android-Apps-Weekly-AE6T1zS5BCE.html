Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 176 so let's get
started it was announced this week that
the team behind the intensely popular
altos adventure is coming out with a
skateboarding game called skate city
based on the footage it'll be a to these
runner with 3d graphics and it appears
as though you'll also be able to perform
tricks the game should be out sometime
in 2017 and it'll be one of the better
free-to-play games of Alton's adventure
was any indication Google is currently
fighting a new set of advertising that
automatically downloads apps Google
removed a few thousand of these self
clicking ads back in 2015 and then had
to remove over 23,000 of them in 2016
that's a pretty clear indication that
the problem is getting worse the report
went on to show that Google remove a
total of 1.7 billion bad advertisements
in 2016 alone it's a fight that will
take some time to win but at least we
know about it right now an interesting
piece of ransomware made its way into
the Google Play Store the app would open
ask for permissions about your contacts
and SMS messages and then give you a
message that the info was up for ransom
as you can imagine it wasn't a great
experience thankfully the app is no
longer currently available in the Google
Play Store it goes to show that some
trouble can still appear in the Play
Store however these occurrences are
still exceedingly rare as it turns out
VPNs on Android really need to step up
their game a research study came out
earlier this week that shows a lot of
VPNs aren't doing a great job to give
you an idea of how bad it is eighteen
percent of VPNs don't encrypt traffic
whatsoever eighty-four percent leak
traffic and most of them use third-party
tracking considering that people use GPS
to avoid literally all of those things
this is highly disappointing Google
staged reading platform is now open
season for app and game developers that
means that won't just be for the select
partners that can release applications
anymore there will be an approval
process for daydream asked to make sure
they are up to Google's very strict
standards and that should help keep the
experience consistent between apps they
should also help increase the overall
selection quite a bit real missed is a
port of one of the most unique pc games
of the 1990s the port features the
entire game of missed along with the
rhyme age expansion for those who
haven't played the game you are
essential
dropped into an open world and left to
your own devices there are puzzles and
riddles to solve to make it to the end
of the game it also comes with improved
graphics a federation guide and a whole
lot more it's six dollars and
ninety-nine cents with no in-app
purchases but it has had some early bugs
so you may want to wait for the game to
update before getting it core is a
multimedia platform for those who like
to watch video games being live-streamed
it features prominent streams from a
variety of posts that are all easily
accessible you can also find streams
from twitch YouTube and other sources
without having to switch apps the app
design is a bit cluttered but it isn't
too difficult to learn how to use it's a
good spot to find some popular game
streams very quickly if you like that
sort of thing the application is also
completely free skydancer is a
beautifully done infinite runner the
game has you jumping from platform to
platform while also making dramatically
large jump down to other parts of the
level it features simple controls
minimalist graphics and a fun little
soundtrack to keep you in the mood it
also has 10 characters various
challenges leaderboards and a whole lot
more it's a bit simple but it's
excellent for killing a few minutes and
it's also a premium game just in case
you wanted to know vendor released their
first Android app this week it's a
guitar tuner application which doesn't
come as all that much of a surprise the
application is very simple with clear
controls and functionality it has 22
available tunings including standard da
DG ad dropsy drop D as well as half
steps and full steps up and down there
are also some tuning tips manual tuning
if you tune by ear and a whole lot more
it's not the most innovative guitar
tuner that we've ever seen however it's
simple clean and completely free to use
Pokemon duel isn't really a new game on
mobile it was originally released in
Japan under a different name and then it
was given an English translation and
released in an international market last
week the game is a strategy board game
where your goal is to move your
characters into the opponent's goal
you'll have six Pokemon various tactical
options and a whole lot more it's a
freemium game and it does have some
issues but it's free to download if you
