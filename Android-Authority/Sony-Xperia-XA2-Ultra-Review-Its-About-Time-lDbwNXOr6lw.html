authority and this is the Sony Xperia x8
ooh ultra and this is Sony's newest
mid-range smartphone it's arguably not
quite as exciting as their upcoming
flagship the XE too but it's still worth
taking a look at because it gives us a
pretty good idea of what Sony is trying
to do here in 2018 and the direction
that they're headed so I've been using
this for the past week now and I want to
give you guys my thoughts on it so let's
get right into it so I want to start
with the design of the XA 2 ultra
because I think that's where you're
gonna notice a pretty significant amount
of changes and when you're looking at
this phone from a distance you might not
really notice anything it still has the
same boxy rectangular look as other Sony
devices but once you look a little bit
closer you will notice some differences
here so the first thing you might see is
that the bezels are a lot smaller all
the way around you won't really notice
it quite as much on the top and bottom
because they're still kind of thick but
on the sides they're practically
non-existent and the screen basically
runs edge to edge now so it sort of
catches it up with the other designs
that we're seeing on the market it's
completely made out of aluminum so it
has a really solid and sturdy feel to it
and it has some other really nice design
touches as well like the slightly curved
back and the curved sides and then the
chamfered edges along the top and bottom
to give it a more premium look one thing
I will say about the XA 2 ultra is that
it definitely lives up to the Ultra name
this is a very big phone and normally I
don't really talk about the sizes of
Android phones anymore
because pretty much every Android phone
out there is a big phone and a lot of
manufacturers have done a really nice
job of making those big phones feel
smaller by shrinking down the bezels and
also switching to 18 by 9 screens and
the x8 to ultra does do some of that
obviously with the thinner bezels but it
still has a 16 by 9 display so it still
feels incredibly wide and it's also
really tall and really thick that it's a
little bit uncomfortable to use in one
hand if you like big phones you probably
won't mind it but for me I'm just not a
fan of how big this phone feels just in
case you're wondering
xa to ultra does have a headphone jack
so they are keeping that feature around
for their mid-range lineup but
unfortunately we can't say the same
thing when it comes to their flagships
now the other big change here that
you're gonna notice is the placement of
the fingerprint sensor this used to be
embedded in the side mounted power
button but it now has been moved to the
back underneath the camera and I like
this placement it's very easy to reach
with an index finger it's nice and
spacious and it's also pretty fast at
unlocking and the best part about it now
is that it finally works in the US Thank
You Sony as I mentioned earlier this is
a 16 by 9 display and it measures in at
6 inches with a resolution of 1080p and
1080p spread across a 6 inch screen
isn't going to result in the sharpest
looking panel but it still looks great
to my eyes I can still comfortably read
text and browse webpages and it's also
very vibrant especially if you use the
built-in super vivid mode which really
pumps up the color and contrast and it
is an IPS panel but sony has always done
a really great job with their smart
phone displays and the XA 2 ultra is no
exception
I have great viewing angles and it also
gets plenty bright that viewing it
outdoors is not really an issue on the
inside it's packing the Snapdragon 630
processor and 4 gigabytes of RAM which
are pretty run-of-the-mill mid-range
specs but it's still plenty fast and
responsive I haven't had any issues with
lag and 4 gigabytes of RAM is still
plenty for a smooth multitasking
experience it's not gonna give you the
craziest benchmark numbers if you care
about that sort of thing but in terms of
real-world use I don't think there's
really a whole lot to complain about one
of the biggest benefits to the
Snapdragon 630 processor is the battery
efficiency and when you pair that with
the massive 3580 milliamp hour battery
of the XA 2 ultra you have a recipe for
some really awesome battery life and the
battery life on the XA 2 ultra is
fantastic it easily gets me through 2
full days of heavy use and a consistent
6 hours of screen on time sometimes even
close to 7 so if you're a heavy user
or a light user you should have no
problems getting through a full day on
this phone one of the more interesting
features of the XA to ultra is actually
the cameras
more specifically the front-facing
cameras because there's two of them
the main sensor is a 16 megapixel camera
with optical image stabilization which
is gonna help with low-light and also
help you take less blurry selfies if you
have a shaky hand the second camera is
an 8 megapixel wide-angle sensor that is
gonna make it a lot easier to fit more
people into the frame or fit more of the
background into the frame but it's at
the expense of slightly lower quality
next to the 16 megapixel camera is what
sony calls a slow sync flash and what
this is supposed to do is properly
illuminate your face and the background
when you're taking a selfie because
normally what tends to happen when you
use a flash on the front-facing camera
is that your face will be illuminated
but the background remains completely
dark and this is supposed to solve that
and in everyday practice it does work
you do get to see a lot more of the
background but you also see a lot more
noise get introduced into the shot so it
really isn't quite as impressive as it
seems on the back side is a 23 megapixel
camera with an aperture of f28 oh and
it's capable of a maximum ISO level of
12,800 which is pretty high for a
smartphone but something that I thought
was really weird is that you can't
manually dial in that ISO level with
Sony's manual mode it's just something
that happens automatically when you're
in a really dark situation even then
you're not really gonna want to shoot at
those ISO levels anyways because there's
gonna be an incredible amount of noise
and at around a thousand ISO or higher
you can already see a lot of noise
creeping into the shots and low-light
shots in general are not really that
great on this camera
they're very washed out when it comes to
color highlights are overexposed and
they're very muddy when it comes to
detail the camera does bear a lot better
in well-lit or daylight situations which
is not really all that surprising you're
gonna get much better color reproduction
and better sharpness and I would say the
cameras biggest weakness is its lack of
dine
range it really crushes the shadows that
you lose a lot of detail in those areas
and HDR mode does help out a lot with
that but I'm not a fan of how it's
buried in the settings menu and it's
only accessible in manual mode which
makes it feel a little bit cumbersome
and unintuitive now as far as the
software goes it's Android 8.0 Oreo with
Sony's Xperia customizations on top and
I like Sony's software because it keeps
the experience pretty close to stock but
you do get some usual Sony customization
like the Xperia theme engine and the
PlayStation integration and there are
some other Sony pre installed
applications but it's nothing that we
haven't really seen before from previous
Sony phones now specific to the XA to
ultra is a one-handed mode that lets you
shrink the screen down and makes the
phone easier to use in one hand and it
has some other nice additional UI tweaks
like letting you shift the dialer to one
side to make everything easier to reach
if you're looking to pick up an X a to
ultra it's available now as an unlocked
GSM device and you can find it through
carriers like Best Buy in Amazon and at
the time of this video it's actually a
little bit cheaper on Amazon but the
normal price is 450 bucks if this was a
sub 400 or smartphone I would say this
is a no-brainer purchase because it does
have a lot of really good things going
for it and it's a pretty solid mid-range
smartphone from Sony it has a much more
modern design it has long lasting
battery life and it has a fingerprint
sensor that finally works in the US but
at 450 bucks it puts it pretty close to
budget flagship territory with bones
like the 1 + 5 t and honor view 10 which
can be had for fifty dollars more and
arguably offer a better bang for the
buck so at $450 it's a little bit tough
to recommend and like many Sony phones
that have come before it the price of
the XA 2 ultra is going to be its
biggest downfall so that pretty much
wraps it up for this review guys I hope
