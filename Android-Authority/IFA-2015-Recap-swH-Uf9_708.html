authority what's going on everybody and
I'm here with lon when of course our
second cameraman and also reporter and
writer here at Aoife in Berlin now we do
want to give a quick shout out it is the
final day it's a ghost town behind us so
of course you're not seeing anybody on
the show floor we're taking advantage of
that and we're filming our final recap
for you we weren't necessarily able to
vlog each day but despite there being
less devices here we still were super
busy so that was a big problem with this
particular show so we're sorry that we
weren't able to really share with you
the experience but that's exactly what
we're doing right here but what I was
gonna say was we want to give a quick
shout-out to our two other colleagues
who are with us here in Narev and also
Bogdan the two of them left earlier and
if we could we would have you right here
next to us just saying for our final
recap video salon how was Eva for you I
was it was a lot of fun actually like
there's there was like a lot of really
nice stuff when we had to cover it like
the gear s2 and the huawei watch and the
maid s and then the z5 premium so
there's a lot of exciting stuff a lot of
fun I had a good time here in Berlin so
I'm definitely looking forward to go to
going to it again next year for sure
this was your first time in Berlin right
yeah first time how did it go for you uh
it's it's cool like Germany's cool it's
a lot of fun like it I mean we had a
good time hanging out afterwards and you
know just being on the show floor
checking everything out it's been great
time we were basically just using like
like taxis the whole time so I guess
some of the stress was sort of like
alleviated in that sense because we
don't worry by using like our own
transportation or even public
transportation but but we found out
we're not the only ones who ended up
having to do that and besides we had a
larger team this year but really that
was the main thing was a transit time
among all of the different areas i think
was the biggest part of this that was
tiring and took up a lot of time yeah
that and then like it's really hard to
get a taxi like one when we're trying to
leave Aoife like yeah like it was last
night or the night before we were like
waiting like an hour just for a freaking
taxi cuz just impossible like ubers just
doesn't cooperate around here so
yeah absolutely well in terms of the
actual content itself what we what we
were looking at here was a show that was
not it's not a Samsung Note centric show
anymore I mean I showed her to say this
but you know I really hope that if it
doesn't become the next like
international CES you know in the in
terms of not really having high-profile
announcements that's not what we had
here right i I don't I don't think it's
gonna become anything like CES I hope
not anyways because I think other stuff
is just going to take its place like if
we don't see like the note series here
ever again but i think you know samsung
is going to be able to fill it with
other things like they did this year
with the s2 which i thought was really
exciting and then you know we obviously
had like Sony and Huawei stuff too so I
think other stuff will just take its
place in terms of the excitement of what
you can look forward to and that in a
way is kind of good thing for other
companies because that they can kind of
take that spotlight now because
Samsung's not you know stealing all the
attention that was actually what I was
going to say a lot of other products
were were given the spotlight in the
sense that we gave them a lot of
coverage not that we wouldn't have I
would have wouldn't have had before but
it was as if it was always all those
products were in the front of our minds
at all times we even gave an award out
to LG for a keyboard because we just
couldn't stop thinking about it was
really cool not a whole lot to distract
us from from products like that then we
gave one to lenovo to which had they
actually had a pretty exciting tablet
with the yoga tablet 3 it made a really
lot of really nice improvements the
projector is actually in a spot that
makes sense now and the speakers are
like crazy loud and I reviewed like the
previous one and the speakers on this
new one just blow the other one out of
the out of the water you can note you
can of course see all of the other
awards in our best of Aoife video so you
can check a link either below or there's
probably a link on top of us right now
so you can check out that video but just
to let you guys know we also gave we did
give Samsung an award for the gear s2 we
gave Sony an award for the Xperia z5
premium and then we gave motors the last
one that was that all 50 Huawei for the
mate s the one the funny part was with
Sony when I give him the award they were
so happy about it they actually put it
in the glass
case with the phones that they were
displaying it was really cool so any any
particular like really favorite moments
here at Aoife that you had on the show
floor or outside of the show floor about
do one of one of each um I mean off the
show floor just being able to hang out
with you know everybody in the industry
like getting to know everyone know all
the youtubers and stuff and everybody
from other publications just hanging out
with them having a good time you know
grabbing dinner and stuff like that that
was all like a lot of really cool stuff
that you know the viewers don't really
get to see but that was fun but as far
as you know the show for just like being
able to see all these really great
products like I was really excited with
the with the s2 that was probably my
highlight of Eva and just because it's
the most I think it was the most unique
product that we got to see and I think
that's why it's so exciting at least to
me over the rest of the stuff that we
got to see personally for on the show
floor I gotta give my favorite moment to
the Intel guys because you'd probably
can't hear them right now I could point
the microphone in that direction but
Intel is getting down right now like
it's it's the end of Eva and they are
having a dance party over there and it
is nuts we wanted to do our final recap
this video over there because they have
a wonderful display and we did a lot of
artwork there because the blog hooda is
one of the safe havens for bloggers like
us but now they're just getting down
right now yeah and yeah but another
company that knows how to get down
though is huawei we had a lot of fun
they had a party and we had a lot of fun
there because I had a nice little
concert with a band that like did a
bunch of covers and stuff so secret
covers really yeah but they were good so
it was like really exciting was a lot of
fun they know how to they know how to
throw a party so exactly I think this
year because it wasn't so centric Lee
surrendered it wasn't so centered rather
around just a couple of very specific
products I think all of the companies
were able to sort of celebrate a little
bit more because they got a lot more of
the spotlight and luckily for us we were
able to get a lot of great coverage for
you guys I agree with lon that outside
of the show we had a lot to really enjoy
hanging out with everybody what's funny
is right behind this camera and actually
is over on the side Dom Esposito is
kicking it with us right now and he was
just uh hey you want say I don has been
everywhere this
that he was on the podcast and I was
like chillin with us behind the camera
over here yeah they keep dragging me
onto these things I'm just kidding and
even last year smartwatches even though
they were a big thing they weren't given
like the center stage and I think that's
what this Aoife was truly about yeah i
think this year like the focus on Smart
Watch makes a lot more sense because
there are a lot better now and they're
also more appealing so I don't know
they're they're just they're starting to
become the products that we want them to
become so I think that's why there's so
much more exciting this year and it's
good that we're able to focus on them
this Aoife yeah there's only one problem
with that though in the next let's say
three weeks all of a sudden were gonna
have like so many new watches to mess
with and everything you know and lord
knows I don't think that will be able to
even get a review unit of the most
expensive ones though those are the ones
that we thought were really cool you
know but I'm pretty sure as long as you
get that black on black on black you'll
be happy on the huawei watch at least I
was joking around that I really wanted
the urbane looks but twelve hundred
dollars that's a little too steep for me
I mean that's even I can't yeah
definitely not too crazy way too crazy
that lacquer case though if you could
just add a cool case for all of the
watches i think i'd be happy with all of
that but in any case we want to thank
you guys for watching all of our footage
here at Aoife in berlin again like you
see behind us it's a ghost town and
we're about to make our exit as well we
hope that you enjoyed watching all of
our coverage we focus so much on the
devices this time around because once
the note 5 wasn't really in the front of
our minds everything else came in as a
flood and that was essentially what we
tried to roll against and we brought you
a lot of looks at things like Lenovo all
of all the devices that they had and we
took a look at even the Moto 360 a pedal
lenovo event alcatel huawei and a bunch
of other people that you know not to say
that they don't deserve the spotlight
but now they have so much of it so keep
it in two and Row Tony for all of the
best coverage videos from me here at
Aoife and of course videos by lon here
at Aoife job with some wax on those
videos subscribe to our channel so you
can keep up with the rest of our
coverage and reviews of all the devices
that we looked at here at Aoife and of
course we are your source for all things
