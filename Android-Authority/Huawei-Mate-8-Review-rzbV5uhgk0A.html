made seven and one of our favorite
phones of the year the Nexus 6p now
they're hoping to continue that momentum
in 2016 with a follow-up to all of that
does it get the job done
well it's Josh Berg our from Android
Authority what's going on everybody and
this is your video review of the Huawei
mate 8 now we are going to be changing
things up just a little bit I am of
course going to bring you the video
review which you're watching right now
but once you're done with this you can
head on over to Android Authority calm
for the written review done by Nora
Gandhi who also is using the may 8's is
daily driver and he'll be able to bring
you his thoughts and comprehensively add
in mind as well you can also find my
camera samples over there some
screenshots that I took as well and you
can find both of our opinions put
together so you can get a more
comprehensive look at this phone so when
you're done with this video head on over
to Andrew authority comm to see that so
before I get into my actual thoughts on
the Huawei mate 8 I thought I could give
you a bird's eye view of the phone just
enjoy seeing all of the aesthetic while
I list off all of the specifications
all right let's get into it what we have
here is the Huawei mate 8 of a metal
construction that actually looks kind of
familiar if you remember the made 7 and
the mate s but this design language
hasn't gotten stale just yet so that
actually plays into the mates favour we
still like this unibody symmetrical
metallic body on here which is a
wonderful thing to have in the hand
especially considering the weight
distribution because even though you are
using premium materials on here the
weight actually feels very even from top
to bottom so the phone doesn't feel like
it's going to just fall out of the hand
it's really all of the little details
that we enjoy the most about this phone
over on the sides you have flat sides
with the subtle chamfered edges but
these sides are of a brushed metal
design if you look underneath the front
panel that glass you'll see that there's
actually a pattern underneath right next
to the Huawei icon and at the top of the
front panel you actually have a
notification light which already comes
in handy especially for messages now we
are dealing with a 6-inch screen up
front here so handling is going to be a
bit tough especially in one hand that
said however gripping the sides is
really nice and the phone doesn't feel
like it's going to slip about despite
this smooth metal on the back so it does
feel pretty secure in the hand it's just
when you're actually navigating from
left to right or top to bottom you are
going to have to perform some gymnastics
now speaking of that display this is an
IPS display that comes in at 1080p
resolution now we know what you're
thinking quad HD seems to make more
sense for a flagship device like this
and we are inclined to agree but the
thing is 1080p we think is still more
than enough to have some fun on this
phone and even then you get a large
canvas to be able to have fun anyway
media and gaming all are still very
enjoyable on here and as an IPS display
maybe the colors aren't as punched out
as an AMOLED display but really we don't
have that many complaints about it out
in broad daylight the IPS display when
cranked up to the full brightness still
looks quite nice and there's actually
one little benefit to having a lower
resolution on the large screen like this
the DPI now take a look at this shot
where we have the Huawei mate 8 next to
the quad HD Nexus 6p you'll notice that
the font on the mate 8 is a little bit
larger so you users out there who
actually want to have a large phone like
this in order to better read the
Internet well then mate is an example of
how a lower resolution could actually
probably help you out
but now we can turn the phone around and
of course you have that fingerprint
reader on the back we can really make no
bones about it this is one of the best
fingerprint readers and Huawei is still
creating some of the best ones best in
class that are available a bit of inside
baseball for you guys whenever I get an
Asian device especially one that's
imported one that may or may not come to
the US I always have to contend with one
big problem it doesn't connect to the
fast mobile networks here in the US and
with the Huawei mate 8 which is not
supposed to be making it over to the
West that could have been a problem but
Huawei has thought ahead and they put
every radio for major carriers so that
you are able to use this phone across
the globe so no you're not going to get
this phone on carriers in the US but you
can always import it and like I'm using
right now on 18t and t-mobile I'm still
able to get good call quality and I'm
still able to get fast mobile internet
speaking of sound we do have the bottom
mounted speaker right here so obviously
it's not going to be quite as good as a
front-facing unit or dual front-facing
unit even but this bottom mounted
speakers still provides some pretty good
body to the sound even if it doesn't get
as loud as we would hope but that's
still more than I could say for a lot of
tinny speakers that are out there and
over on the left side of the phone you
can pop out that SIM tray and yes Huawei
mate 8 still continued connectivity with
dual-sim capabilities but one of those
sim card tray is can actually be used
for a microSD card so this particular
phone that I have in my hand is a 32
gigabyte model there's a 64 gigabyte
model but it doesn't really matter
because you can put in microSD cards
expandable storage is a feature I know a
lot of you guys really want in your
flagships again and then May 8 is
leading that charge right now in 2016
but now we can get into what I think
everyone should be really talking about
when it comes to the may 8th power of
four thousand milliamp hour battery is
underneath here obviously not
replaceable but trust us it's going to
get you as much longevity as you need
especially if you're smart as you can
see here I'm going into the battery
manager and you have some smart or
performance modes that you can put into
there even an ultra mode but what I did
was I tested out the performance and the
smart modes in performance mode where
everything is cranked up to 100 I was
able to get a full day's worth of work
done with about 4 and a half hours of
screen on time now that already feels
pretty good especially for a large phone
like this but once I turned on the smart
mode and
took the suggestions of the smart
optimizer including things like turning
down the screen brightness putting some
apps in the background so they don't run
when the screen is off I was able to get
two days worth of battery life with
seven hours of screen on time now really
that's nothing short of amazing
honestly that you are able to wake up in
the morning and if you still don't have
full battery if you have at least maybe
around 40 to 50 you're still ok then
that's not even mentioning the great
fast charging that Huawei has been able
to put here using the included charger
as you can see here I was able to get
from 15 to 50% in about half an hour to
about 40 minutes so it really feels like
Huawei is trying to put in as much as
possible in this phone especially when
you consider the hardware and they've
made some really good choices on there
so we're going to go ahead and move on
to the camera the rear facing camera
actually is made of a new Sony sensor so
while we want it to be as updated as
possible but first we'll talk about the
front facing shooter which is 8
megapixels and I did use it for some
selfies out at CES maybe one or two
videos and it did seem to do the job
pretty well 8 megapixels is nice because
if you need to crop into the photo
you're not going to lose too much of
that detail but back to the rear facing
shooter we have a 16 megapixel shooter
on the back that should be able to
provide some good optics and if you get
into the app you have a lot of options
in order to get the shot that you want
you have everything from panorama it's
even a document capture mode and a
professional mode which we actually
enjoy a lot you could actually get a
better shot if you put in just that
little bit of work my biggest problem
with the camera app though is that you
actually have to go into an HDR mode in
order to do HDR it's not an auto setting
and I think about HDR is that it
actually doesn't feel like it's working
all that well if you look at this photo
I was able to spot meter it to a dark
area so then things got blown out and
then I did the same thing using HDR
hoping that it would even everything out
when in reality it just went ahead and
blew everything out it didn't even add
that much color to the new photo so it's
kind of a disappointment that HDR is
just not really a viable tool in the
huawei mate AIDS camera but even then as
we get into the image quality
unfortunately processing kind of rears
its ugly head again it's been a problem
for huawei for a bit the actual photos
lack a lot of color depth especially
when you get from very well-lit
situations and you kind of bring it
medium and low light situations and even
then in medium light situations there is
still a noise reduction and a
smoothening that's happening here that
actually makes you lose quite a bit of
the detail optical image stabilization
does seem to help a little bit when
taking these photos and for that matter
it does also help in video now quick
thing video you do have 1080p 60 frames
per second capture but you don't get 4k
on here again a feature that I know some
of you might think should have made it
onto a flagship device like this it's
kind of a shame that we actually have to
say that the camera on the May 8th is
kind of subpar because they've already
proven that they could do good optics
and good processing on the Nexus 6p it
may be a little bit more time with the
new module the new Sony sensor could
have helped them out because the
processing has been a thorn in the side
of Huawei for quite a few iterations of
the mate by now but now we can get into
the actual user experience and of course
that means emui
and what powers it the processor here is
a high silicon Kirin 950 in-house made
by Huawei so all the optimizations that
they needed to make for emui
or what you're seeing here it's backed
by three or four gigabytes of RAM and
Mali graphics honestly the curé 950
just might be one of the best processors
that we've used in recent memory we've
had a great time on it and me personally
on this while we may date I haven't been
able to slow it down
not one bit I do some gaming with a Star
Wars game and then I multitask and go in
and out of all these different imaging
applications I even use Adobe Lightroom
mobile on here and I really haven't been
able to have any problems on here and it
hasn't slowed down one bit but that does
bring us to the e/m UI now I've
mentioned already in the power section
that yes having a lot of control over
what apps are doing and what the actual
settings are for the phone mean that you
can get really good battery life but
that same amount of control is also
found in a lot of other aspects of this
phone and really it could be a little
bit overwhelming
Asian interfaces when it comes to
Android do tend to do this one thing
that people in the West don't really
enjoy they don't have a app drawer now
that means that all of your icons are
going to be splashed out on all of your
home screens and it's up to you to put
in the work to organize everything now
that's a lot of work that I know a lot
of people may not want to put
but you can always put a launcher on top
of it that said there are parts of the
EMU eye that we do enjoy like the
notification drop down that shows
notifications in a timeline way and even
if the recent apps screen is pretty
simplistic it actually is one of the
smoothest that we've been able to use
but ultimately as usual it's all about
the extras all of the different features
that they put into here that you might
use once or twice and then you never use
them again like for example the knuckle
feature you can actually use your
knuckle to draw on the screen to make
any number of things happen now the
issue that I had with it is that I
actually had to hit the phone really
hard it's almost as if I was punching
the device just so I can get the knuckle
thing to work and unfortunately if you
are already failing at using the knuckle
feature on here then you probably could
have just hit your icon or just went
through the interface and got to where
you needed to go in a much faster way
another feature that feels a little bit
half-baked is the dual window with such
a large canvas on here it should be nice
to use for two different applications
running at one time but you only have
about nine Huawei based applications
that you can use in the dual window and
really nothing else after that so while
we has a lot to catch up on when it
comes to full multitasking on the May
8th it's a little paradoxical really
like we love the emui because of the
ki-rin 950 because it's one of the
smoothest interfaces that we've used but
it's also a pain to use because it's
kind of a convoluted mess especially
when you consider all the work you have
to do just to make the home screens look
well clean and all the features that are
in here kind of don't really help at all
and kind of just hinder the experience
overall so it's obviously clear that
Huawei really wanted to pack in as much
as they could into this phone and in a
lot of ways they succeeded but in a few
very key ways they've actually kind of
failed and it might be easier to look at
what this phone lacks rather than what
is packed into it for example the quad
HD display which I know some people are
really going to harp on and even then
without quad HD you also don't have the
forced touch capability that the mate s
tried to introduce the biggest issue for
me personally was the camera where the
processing just really made all these
images that should be a lot better just
look very shoddy and then when you get
into the software emui is not really
something that a lot of Western users
are going to enjoy that's pretty much
just feet long and short of it and then
you're able to look at what wow I was
actually able to put into the phone all
of the hardware the Kira 950 and the
great power consumption on here are
really the marquee features and they are
just barely covering up the flaws of
what is ultimately a phone that we still
really really enjoy so of course you're
going to be paying a very pretty penny
for this because it's still a flagship
device anywhere between six to eight
hundred dollars is what you can find if
you are going to import this phone from
the other part of the world into the
West so it's still a very expensive
phone to have and if the power
consumption and the long battery life
along with the really great performance
are really what you're looking for in a
phone then this just might be the one
that you need to put the money down for
just remember you're going to have to
put some work in to make it look clean
like this or maybe you just put Google
now launcher actually I think I'm going
to do that right now
so as always thank you guys very much
