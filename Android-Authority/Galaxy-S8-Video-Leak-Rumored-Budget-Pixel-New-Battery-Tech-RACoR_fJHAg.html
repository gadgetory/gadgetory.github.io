one would ever need more than four
gigabytes of RAM for their device
reminiscent of when Bill Gates the
founder of Microsoft is alleged to have
said that 640 k is enough RAM for
anybody 640 k of RAM is a tiny fraction
of a tiny fraction of the current Ram
that we tend to use that's sort of like
saying you're going to power your car
via a donkey so before we get to donkey
powered smartphones let's first talk
about the most recent video on the
samsung galaxy s 8 now this video seems
to confirm most of the leaks we've seen
thus far but Evan black AKA evleaks has
said that the galaxy s 8 launch will be
pushed from april twenty first to April
twenty-eighth now some people might be
claiming that this extra week is just
another week for samsung to ensure that
all the safety issues are covered with
the s8 but is that supposed to inspire
confidence an extra week it's almost
midnight five times over that inspires
me with serious doubt what do you think
we still moving on to the rumored budget
pixel it may not be a pixel at all
Google senior vice president of hardware
Rick Osterloh has confirmed that the
Google pixel will receive a sequel in
2017 and I quote there is an annual
rhythm in the industry so you can count
on us to follow it set off Strehlow
adding and i quote you can count on a
google pixel successor this year even if
you don't hear a date for me now now
this is what led to some confusion
because some people were assuming that a
rumored budget pixel was the successor
to the original pixel but no apparently
we received some fairly firm
confirmation that there will be a budget
device meaning an Android one launched
pretty soon and a premium pixel
successor to the original pixel that
good news that's good news but the
Android one
will be launched in the US or North
America this is something we'll probably
for India and Africa where Google is
trying to reach the next billion Android
users in a recent post on the Weibo page
of Lao Shi an executive of Huawei she
discusses that he believes four
gigabytes of RAM is plenty for a phone
to run smoothly he says that many of
hallways devices actually run better on
four gigabytes than six gigabytes of RAM
and that's the most important thing to
do in a smartphone is to optimize the
operating system to be as efficient as
possible she cites Apple's iPhone noting
that iOS doesn't need a huge amount of
random run smoothly and that the company
has simply optimized the u.s. to work
fantastically with smaller amounts of
available memory he says that adding
more RAM only increases the price of the
device and that it would simply not be
worth pushing the boundary of this
hardware on mobile devices now this man
has a point I agree with if the way we
use phones pretty much stays the way it
is you see way back in nineteen eighty
one when Bill Gates apparently or
allegedly said that thing about 640k he
claims he never actually said it but at
that time in 1981 no one envisioned that
computers would be doing the things
they're doing today processing huge
gaming applications video processing all
that kind of stuff it was doing far far
simpler tasks if phones continue to
operate and be used in the way they are
now sure poor gigabytes of RAM is no
problem but if the landscape completely
changes the way it did in desktop over a
period of two decades we're going to
lead a lot more firepower but i think
the device format is going to change
before that happens what do you think
let me know in the comments below but
wait wait wait we're not quite done
because i know you battery geeks are
going to love this news there has been
significant or potentially significant
battery innovation going on by the man
who invented lithium-ion batteries meet
John be good enough yes his name is
actually good enough and despite being
94 years young he is the co-inventor of
the lithium-ion battery as we know it
and is still working hard together with
researcher Maria Elena Braga he
developed a new low-cost solid-state
battery that is not only safer than
conventional with EMI on batteries
but also stores a lot more energy and
can be charged faster apparently the new
battery has at least three times as much
energy density when compared with
lithium-ion batteries it also features a
faster rate of recharge meaning that we
can fully recharge our devices and
electronic vehicles in minutes rather
than ours once more it allows for a
greater number of charging and
discharging cycles so the battery should
last a lot longer now before you get too
excited please know that this is still
in the very early stages of development
it'll be a while before it actually come
to market but I know battery innovation
makes a geek happy
