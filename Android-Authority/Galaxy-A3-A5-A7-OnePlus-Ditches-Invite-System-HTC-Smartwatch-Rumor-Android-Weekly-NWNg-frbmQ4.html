brought to you by domain.com well we got
good news about the galaxy a3 a5 and a7
but perhaps most importantly is the news
that one plus will be permanently
ditching their invite system I know
geeks be like the original galaxy a
devices marked a departure from
Samsung's usual focus on plastic by
featuring metallic unibody now the
galaxy a 2016 series continues on the
same path as with the galaxy 6 inspired
design featuring aluminum frames and
glass box but the Galaxy a5 and a7 2016
take more than design cues from the
flagship galaxy the two devices include
functionality that just a couple years
ago were reserved for the rarefied elite
of the ecosystem cameras with optical
image stabilization fingerprint sensors
and Samsung pay integration only the a5
a 5.2 inch full HD and the a7 5.5 inch
full HD offer these perks the smallest
member of the family the 4.7 8 3 is less
endowed but its specs are still pretty
decent this confirms reports from last
month about the migration of certain
features down Samsung's mid and
entry-level range all three galaxies a
2016 devices feature AMOLED displays 13
megapixel rear cameras with double tap
to launch and 5-megapixel front-facing
cameras LTE micro SD card support and
android 5.1 the a7 features an octa-core
processor clocked at 1.6 gigahertz
paired with 3 gigabytes of ram the a5
comes with the same processor but just
two gigabytes of RAM why the humble a
three features 1.5 gigahertz of
quad-core processor and just 1.5
gigabytes of ram all three devices will
become available in China this month and
for the rest of the world early next
year now although it is true that one
plus will be ditching the invite program
permanently they do have an exchange
program for Indians one plus has started
an exchange program for prospective
owners of the 1 + 1 1 + 2 + 1 + X
smartphones in
to qualify for the exchange program the
user has to register their old
smartphone on one pluses website or the
red globe dedicated page note that not
all devices are exchangeable from there
they can decide on which method to use
to get a new phone the by first cell
later method involves users selecting a
smartphone online red globe will then
send the user an invite code for the
device and set up a pick up service to
retrieve the old handset once the invite
code has been used after using the
invite code the user will be sent a page
where they can redeem insurance for the
service and apply to receive an animus
on gift card in the amount of their old
phones worse for my Indian brothers out
there I'd love to hear from you if you
use this exchange program how did it
work was it smooth was it worth wild let
me know on Twitter love to hear it well
it's been a big year of shake ups for
Samsung's management and I want to warn
you hear that I'm doing my best with the
pronunciations but for my Korean fans
please forgive me if I butcher them here
we go samsung has announced that its
head of mobile communications Shin Jung
Hyun and another co-chief executive
officer BK Yoon will be stepping back
from day-to-day operations Kuhn a nine
year veteran of the company will be
replaced by ko dongjun who was involved
with the launch of the galaxy s6 and
note 5 the announcement comes after
another questionable year for Samsung's
mobile division Samsung saw a
thirty-eight percent drop in its mobile
profits for the launch quarter of the
galaxy s6 has more expensive components
and excess unsold stock drove up the
divisions costs Samsung's latest
management reconfiguration is the latest
in the string of shakeups in the past 12
months which also saw three marketing
executives resigned last year perhaps we
hope these changes will lead to better
fortunes in the coming year good news
for you HTC fans out there it looks like
they're coming out with a SmartWatch
early 2016 Evan Blass aka evleaks has
tweeted that the HTC One watch is coming
in February 2016 since that's the same
time around the Mobile World Congress
2016 there is a high probability that
HTC's first SmartWatch will be announced
then rumors suggest that the HTC One
would feature a circular display with
resolution of 360 x 360 the upcoming
gadget is said to be codenamed half beak
of course none of this can be confirmed
just yet and this week's t-shirt is
awarded to Gokul on Twitter who came up
with a very creative domain name dude
