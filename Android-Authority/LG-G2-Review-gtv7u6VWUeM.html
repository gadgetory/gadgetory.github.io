hoped it could be find out in our review
hey everybody I'm Chris look the LG g2
has some seriously impressive specs and
some really cool design elements but we
all know that a truly great phone has to
be more than the sum of its parts so is
the g2 let's take a look the LG g2 has a
5.2 inch 1080p display and runs a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chipset with a
2.2 6 gigahertz quad-core Krait CPU and
Adreno 330 GPU it has 2 gigs of RAM and
32 gigs of internal storage 24 gigs of
which are available to the user no
microSD slot is available it has a 13
megapixel rear facing camera with
optical image stabilization and a 2.1
megapixel front-facing camera both of
which capture 1080p video powering
everything is a 3000 milliamp hour
battery the G to s design is one of its
most talked about aspects and with good
reason as LG has done some very
interesting things here first we've got
to talk about how thin the bezels are
this allows the phone to have a 5.2 inch
screen while the phone itself doesn't
feel large at all in fact it's about the
same size as a Galaxy s4 just a little
bit taller this is definitely not a
phablet I honestly think this is about
as small as a bezel can get before
actually becoming so small that the
phone is impossible to hold without your
fingers covering part of the screen but
that isn't what most people are talking
about it's the button placement LG has
made a bold move and placed all the
buttons on the back of the phone some
people love it and others well not so
much personally I found it very usable
and it wasn't long before I didn't even
think about the button placement though
I could see some people having a tough
time adjusting that aside the feel of
the phone is very nice the rounded back
allows it to sit very comfortably in
your hand long story short the g2 s true
HD IPS plus display is very impressive
at 1920 by 1080 stretched over 5.2
inches we're looking at an ultra sharp
pixel density of around 424 pixels per
inch look as hard as you want but you
be hard-pressed to see any pixels here
colors are very vivid without the
oversaturated look that can cause nearly
everything to look cartoonish on some
other smartphone displays of course a
good display is useless if you can't see
it which fortunately is not a problem
here the LG g2 has a maximum brightness
of 450 nits and outside in the middle of
the day in very bright sunlight I had no
problem whatsoever seeing the display
which is more than can be said for a lot
of other popular fonts being one of the
few phones currently using a snapdragon
800 chipset we were excited to see what
kind of results we would get in
benchmarks first we turn to our usual
tool of choice and to to benchmark we
ran the test a total of ten times and
saw scores ranging from just over
twenty-seven thousand to over thirty-two
thousand five hundred the final average
score was twenty-nine thousand five
hundred and sixty interestingly enough
it seemed that the first benchmark after
letting the device rest a while was
always the fastest with subsequent
consecutive runs being a little slower
it's important to note here the LG told
us prior to testing that the review unit
we were shipped is not the final
finished product and that test numbers
in the version release to customers
could be higher next up we turn to Epic
Citadel and ran all three available
benchmark modes ultra high quality mode
gave us an average frame rate of fifty
point nine frames per second while high
quality and high performance gave us
fifty five point three and fifty six
point eight frames per second
respectively that is pretty impressive
considering that the software is pushing
over two million pixels every day
performance was equally impressive
scrolling browsing launching apps and
everything else was always zippy and I
never encountered a single moment where
anything felt slow or even stuttered for
a second performance across the games we
tested was similarly impressive as well
the LG g2 runs Android 4.2.2 jelly bean
overlaid with a custom LG user interface
you can customize the interface a bit by
changing fonts which changes the font
across the entire system that's cool but
it gets much cooler gestures and button
free operation play a big part here want
to turn on the display but don't feel
like pressing the power button on the
back knock on that by allowing you to
simply tap twice on the display to turn
it on tapping twice on an empty area or
the status bar turns it back off to
answer a call you can just pick the
phone up but it doesn't actually answer
the call until it gets to your ear so
you still have a chance to see who's
calling before you answer slide aside
lets you use a three finger swipe to
save an app state and slide it off to
the side of the screen for later use
just swipe the other way to bring it
back if you have the lockscreen set to
pattern lock you can use this to enable
guest mode use your own pattern to use
your phone like normal while
another pattern puts the phone in a
guest mode where you can restrict what
apps are available with the display off
you can hold the volume down button to
launch the camera and it also acts as a
shutter button holding the volume up
button launches the Notes app looking at
apps quick remote allows the g2 to act
as a universal remote controlling a TV
blu-ray player projector or even air
conditioner an update Center allows you
to manage system and app updates without
digging into settings or the Play Store
to get right to it the LG g2 s 13
megapixel camera is one of the most
impressive cameras I've seen in a
smartphone and a long time
aside from setting the quality to 13
megapixels I left the camera on all its
default settings and took a lot of
photos in a lot of situations on the
rare occasions where a photo came out
bad it was usually my fault
I'm sure a lot of this is due to the
optical image stabilization used in the
g2 s camera this does a lot of things
from reducing camera shake and video
recording to improving low-light
photography by allowing for longer
exposure times without blurring colors
are well represented in images are razor
sharp that quality extends to video
capture as well while it's not unusual
for smartphone cameras to capture 1080p
video these days not all of it is this
good-looking and unlike a lot of phones
the LG g2 s rear-facing camera can
capture 1080p video at 60 frames per
second optical image stabilization helps
here as well as you can see in the
footage that I captured while walking
around outside on a lot of other cameras
this would be a mess seeing how powerful
the phone is it might be easy to think
that a 3000 milliamp hour battery might
not provide all that much battery life
but the qualcomm chipset goes a long way
to get the most out of that capacity
after a 14 hour day of heavy testing I
still had around 20% battery capacity
left so I'm confident in saying that
this phone should be able to last anyone
through even the longest days of heavy
use the battery isn't removable so you
won't be able to carry a spare but
luckily that shouldn't be a problem in
the end it's pretty hard to find
anything bad to say about the LG g2 so I
won't if you don't like the phone it's
probably for a subjective reason like
not liking the interface where the
button placement neither of those were
issues for me and objectively this is
simply a great phone as usual we'll have
