announced and it's about to embark on
its journey into the hands of consumers
when the more delightful aspects of the
phone is its updated design it's a
testament say lace
since HTC has always been highly steamed
in industry for its designs so it really
got us thinking how the phone got here
like what transpired throughout the
years to reach this new design so with
that in mind John Velasco here with
Android Thor ting and I'm taking you on
a quick look at the history of HTC's
Android designs let's go back to the
beginning of Android the year is 2008
and the codenamed HTC dream is the first
commercially available Android
smartphone to be released which many of
us know as the t-mobile g1 aesthetically
this QWERTY landscape handset look cute
with its chin sticking out but it wasn't
entirely impressive with its design it
wasn't perfect and doesn't scream
premium by today's standards but at the
time it stood out to establish androids
identity in 2009 HTC released only two
phones the first being the HTC magic
known in the US as the t-mobile mytouch
3G quite simply it was a keyboardist
version the g1 so it had your typical
slight design it wasn't grandeur by any
means just because it kept that simple
and cute manner from before for latter
portion of the year the company
surprised many by coming out with the
HTC Hero and boy did establish HTC on
that path to premium with its
one-of-a-kind looks it was utterly
premium in every way you've been
featuring a Teflon coating to help it
stay clean looking and would you believe
it was HTC's first Android smartphone to
feature a built-in 3.5 millimeter
headset jack 2010 brought us the very
first Nexus branded smartphone the HTC
made Google Nexus One it was an
evolutionary leap just because it
brought along a cleaner more refined
design in fact it popularized the
unibody design a casing fashioned from
one piece of material this one in
particular had a Teflon coating as well
to resist dirt and debris now long after
the Nexus 1 HTC came swinging with a
onion in the form of the HTC Desire it
remained faithful to its siblings design
but swapped out the trackball in favor
of a trackpad also losing a male frame
with a mostly plastic rear casing now
after back-to-back impressive designs
many were blown away by the HTC legend
it was the true successor to the HTC
Hero you can say that
HTC's legendary expertise in design was
its fullest with legend given that the
body was fashioned from one piece of
aluminium now it's really hard to
imagine where HTC is currently without
paying homage to the HTC legend for the
rest of 2010 however we didn't see
another handset with the same level of
prestige this was when we began to see
the company recycling its designs phones
like the HTC before G the Droid
Incredible Wildfire Aria Desire HD and
inspire all seemingly were variations of
the original HTC Desire despite the
underwhelming options
HTC did end the year with some stunning
designs both the t-mobile mytouch 4G and
the g2 were serious upgrades to the
respective predecessors there were far
more premium looking and solidly
constructed by the time 2011 rolled
around HTC established itself as a
premiere maker with its stunning designs
the designers design language was a
particular favorite of theirs given that
the HTC Thunderbolt Desire s resound and
Evo 3d all kept to the same theme don't
get us wrong some of them still offered
a metal chassis but there wasn't
anything majorly new or different with
them then in mid 2011 the HTC Sensation
was released to prove again that the
company was capable of producing
something original yes the desire
resemblance was there but the sensation
boasted an evolutionary design that
consisted of an aluminum chassis a
beveled glass display and an
eye-catching tri-colored pattern design
with its rear casing beyond the
sensation HTC managed to experiment with
other peculiar looking designs HTC
ChaCha and salsa are two examples of
that as these so-called Facebook phones
appeared vastly different they cater to
teens and tweens demographic they sought
after the company's decision to care too
specific audiences became more evident
with the blissfully design HTC Rhyme a
phone specifically designed for women it
fashioned together characteristics from
the desire and sensation but was
arguably most recognizable for its color
choice plumbed to be exact a check-up
occurred in 2012
HTC seemingly settled on a new franchise
named the one series the brand new HTC
One X was a departure from the norm for
them because they decided to go with a
curved polycarbonate body it was a
surprising turn of events however they
still managed to forge an elegant phone
now metal was entirely removed
given that the mid-range in the new
series the HTC One S was blessed with a
slick looking anodized metal chassis in
certain instances some folks regarded
the HTC One S as being superior in
design than the flagship One X people
questioned whether the company was
expunged of any new ideas at this point
since most of the remaining releases of
2012 were nothing more than variants of
the new devices in the one line in 2013
one of HTC's most baffling design
choices came in the form of the HTC
first design wise this Facebook phone
was a stark contrast to what HTC was
doing the middlemost design was obvious
everywhere it wasn't flashy or premium
but it was oddly different from the rest
of stuff in its stable the most
ambitious design HTC's history came with
the HTC ones arrival codenamed bm7 many
people will certainly agree that this
was and is HTC's finest looking foam
adopting a new premium design language
that would be the foundation of others
to come later after going with
polycarbonate the previous year the m7
went back to more premium design with
the body made of aluminum it also
introduced micro holes that comprise the
earpiece and speaker giving the phone a
symmetrical appearance like nothing
before it the design can still hold up
today showing to us that designs can
carry a phone very far for the m7
successor in 2014 the m8 made some minor
iterative improvements you still have an
unmistakable metal design one that now
comprised 9% of all featured edges that
were more rounded a polished finish to
accentuate its premium industrial design
and the switch to on-screen buttons well
it was an overhaul the MA did manage to
become a pleasantly designed phone
worthy of being the m7 successor well
you could say that the minor changes
were probably overshadowed by the fact
that the MA featured a new dual camera
system 2014 end up being one the slowest
years for HTC it scaled back with
product releases instead they announced
variants of the MA as well as devices in
its desire line next bone design that
stood out came with HTC butterfly -
essentially a polycarbonate version of
the m8 you could say it was in response
to the water resistant construction of
the Samsung Galaxy s5 at the time design
appeared lukewarm without the premium
attachment but it showed us that HTC was
willing and able to go outside the box
to reach a particular feature hard times
of late didn't make 2015 an eventful
year as well the person notable phone to
arrive was the HTC One m9 sadly though
its design wasn't as widely claimed
because there wasn't anything profound
with its design choices the changes to
it were minimal at best such as the
Julie grade dual tone finish to the body
we end up seeing Hardware alterations to
the phone resulting in devices like the
HTC One a9 plus and the one m9 plus at
the same time the desire line was still
alive and well choosing two favorite
designs that were more fun and colorful
to target Millennials that don't want to
spend a huge fortune on a phone it
wasn't till late 2015 when we saw
another major design shift when the HTC
One a9 was introduced as a low cost
premium alternative many critics panned
the farm for resembling the iPhone but
it had a premium design without the
premium cost so the last few years
haven't been kind for HTC things have
changed dramatically since they launched
the t-mobile g1 we're nearing the
halfway point of 2016 already and HTC
went back to the drawing board with its
latest flagship smartphone HTC 10 design
is yet another testament to the
company's legendary reputation producing
in original design it draws inspiration
from the previous flagships as well as
the recently launched HTC One a9
now HSN has increasingly become more
selective with what it releases so it
will be interesting to see what HTC
comes out with next I know the video was
kind of long but I hope you liked it

handsets I talked about in this video
