well which one do you pay well
the Google Nexus line has your back with
seven and 10-inch tablets great
performance and updated software but
which one do you pick well that's
exactly what we're going to look at in
this comparison but also we're going to
ask the question what does it mean time
a 7-inch tablet what does it mean to
have a 10-inch tablet which one's more
practical hey this is Josh with a car
from Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is the assumed axis 7
versus the Samsung Nexus 10 let's jump
right in with the one that came first
the Nexus 7 created by a sous the 7 is
obviously right between a smartphone and
a full-sized tablet as such its form
factor is supposed to be used by two
hands but fits comfortably in just one
the screen on the front is surrounded by
a black border the top of which has the
front-facing camera
the power and volume buttons are found
on the same side while the headphone
jack is near the charging port on the
bottom the back of the Nexus 7 has a
perforated design and was the first to
support the Nexus designation proudly
below which is the asou stranding and a
speaker slit a suit made a very balanced
smaller tablet without compromise as
this tablet is easy to handle and easy
on the eyes with the right cover it
blends in very well with books and
planners the larger Nexus 10 was
Google's way of storming into the tablet
market with great specs and a killer
screen has become one of the devices to
beat the 10 inch screen on the front has
a front-facing camera up top with the
notification light at the bottom the
sides of the front have inconspicuous
but very effective speakers the power
and volume buttons are together at the
top looking in landscape while the
charging port and headphone jack are on
the Left opposite the mini HDMI port
this tablet is meant to be handled by
two hands as anything else would feel a
little precarious if held in one hand
I'd have a death grip on the Nexus 10 or
I'd just lay on one hand like a waiters
tray of course you can enjoy the tablet
on a stand for all your viewing pleasure
which leads me to make this one a tie
and because both sizes serve different
purposes the sevens mid-sized form gives
it nimble capabilities while the 10 is
to be held safely or sitting on a desk
for all to see while I do like the
design of the Nexus 7 just a little bit
better
I have to say that both these tablets
look to fill particular needs and they
both very much succeed so the first
round is a tie as we look at the screens
next the true IPS display of the Nexus 7
brings in a resolution of 1280 by 800
while this is mostly standard the screen
also has a rather low pixel density at
just 216 PPI while the general user of
the Nexus 7 will probably have no qualms
with the screen and its ability to show
movies and texts quite well the keen eye
will see that sharpness isn't very
perfect and that colors can use a little
bit more vibrancy not to be fair this
criticism comes primarily because of the
Nexus tens incredible 10-inch screen
it's hard not to criticize other devices
when you see this RGB real striped pls
screen capable of an amazing 2560 by
1600 resolution with 300 PPI the Nexus
10 screen is not just brighter colors
are more vibrant the sharpness
especially with text is also just a
sight to behold in just a couple weeks
I've had this tablet I found myself
watching content more and more on it
than anywhere else
mind you all content is still enjoyable
on the Nexus 7 and like I said you might
not be as nit picky but the Nexus 10
does spoil you a little bit the 7 is
capable of showing the same things the
10 is but the Nexus 10 just does it all
better
but a 10 inch tablet with such a high
resolution needs some incredible power
under the hood and that is exactly what
you get with the Nexus 10 imagine if you
will that the Nexus 7 is a high-end road
car which then makes the Nexus 10 too
super card that you can take onto the
track and just destroy it even if
benchmark tests didn't always seem to
show the Nexus 10 blowing away all of
the competition there's still a level of
optimization within this package that
you just have to experience to believe
this tablet absolutely flies with its
1.7 gigahertz a 15 processor and that
brings one of the most smoothest and
fastest experiences on a device I have
ever had
Gaming is great on both of these tablets
the Tegra 3 of the Nexus 7 is the
processor package that spawned a slew of
games made for its capabilities so the
seven-inch tablet is definitely able to
hold its own in 2d and 3d gaming the
speed found in the Nexus 10 however
translates beautifully in
the quad-core Mali t6o for graphics
processor the amazing screen further
adds to the gaming experience too now my
battery test with the Nexus 10 before
was a little bit too crazy
I'll admit however after spending some
time with the tablet I could definitely
say that it is able to go for days of
normal usage without any problems
say I use it for a few hours one day let
it sit until the next day it starts
right where it left off the Nexus 7
however with its smaller screen and
lesser but still great specifications is
able to go for more days so with
incredible screen comes incredible power
the Nexus 10 definitely takes it there
but all of that awesome has to come with
a price ultimately the mileage of the
supercar just isn't quite as great as
that of the road car the hardware of the
Nexus 7 is simplistic at best what you
see is ultimately what you get as there
is no rear camera and the front-facing
camera is best for just hangouts and
maybe the occasional self-portrait
however aside from the usual GPS
Bluetooth and NFC offerings found in the
7 the 32 gigabyte version of the tablet
was recently given 3G and HSPA+
capabilities on ATT's network you can
connect to the internet from pretty much
anywhere with adequate speeds that add
further portability but a Premium
Package in the Nexus 10 brings a lot
more to the table easily found on the
back is the rear camera that does take
some decent photos even if using a
tablet for pictures isn't always
practical the notification light below
the screen is a nice touch and the mini
HDMI port on the right side allows for
viewing on a television
aside from GPS NFC and Bluetooth
miracast is also available but I don't
have a TV with this wireless display
capability the great part of the Nexus
10 is the sound Samsung should get a lot
of credit for putting two speakers on
the front of the tablet that bring a
much louder and richer sound than most
if not all of the competition
ultimately if you need mobile networking
that the Nexus 7 is your only choice
however the Nexus 10 is overall package
just offers so much more than the seven
and thus it gets the point in this round
which brings me to my final aspect which
will seem a little new but I believe is
incredibly important for a comparison
like this usage what does it mean to
have a 7-inch for a 10-inch device we
can look at which one is faster or has
the nicer screen all day but in reality
both of these tablets are great
performers you will get the most updated
software in jelly bean 4.2 on both
tablets so software is not an issue here
so after everything we've looked at I
would argue that the most important
aspect between this two is which one is
the most practical the Nexus 10 is
definitely the more powerful of these
two and is thus an absolute joy to use
however I found that I could only enjoy
in particular situations at a desk like
in a cafe or on a stand in both hands or
anywhere that I could set it down to
view something and just let it go and
that's a little bit limiting to be
honest months ago when I bought my Nexus
7 I chose it because it was the most
nimble device and was able to be used in
just about any situation I could throw
at it if I wanted to watch read or view
anything the seven-inch screen still did
the job pretty well but it wasn't the
on-the-go quick
spontaneous situations that I knew the
Nexus 7 would be better I could carry it
like a book with me anywhere rather than
have a bag so that I could hold the
Nexus 10 for whatever I went and if I
wanted to change a calendar entry jot
down a note or draft a quick write up
the Nexus 7 was always at the ready for
getting those things done and ultimately
these are the questions you have to ask
yourself what is it you really want from
the tablet you're going to get do you
want a media powerhouse capable of being
your video and picture viewer in
spectacular fashion or do you want an
ultra portable nimble easy to use in
spurts device that you can essentially
take anywhere with you in a direct
comparison the Nexus 10 is better and
greater its size makes for one of the
best experiences on Android I have had
to date but for what I actually want and
need to do the Nexus 7 fulfills my needs
so which tablets the one for you the
Nexus 7 starts on 199 while the ten
starts at 399 you can read my full
written comparison
and leave a comment about which one you
would choose at Android Authority calm
