Android Authority channel the Galaxy s4
and HTC One deliver eye popping this
place primarily because of the clarity
sharpness and vividness of their full
high-definition screens both may be
high-end devices but they are not
unequal footing especially in display
quality and performance and what ways
are they alike in what ways do they
differ I'll talk about that and more in
this video let's begin by comparing the
displace packs of both phones both
phones have the same full HD display
resolution of 1920 by 1080
but the HTC One crams more pixels into
every inch about 469 pixels actually by
virtue of its smaller screen diagonal
which is 3/10 of an inch shorter than
the S force but you also use different
protective glass types for the screen
but one of the most pronounced
differences between the two is the
display technology the galaxy s4 uses
the pencil RGB G matrix with diamond
pixels which reportedly causes the
greenish or blueish green tint on the
display HTC One on the other hand uses
an RGB matrix which is brighter and
produces more realistic colors than the
pencil RG Li G matrix to compare the
brightness and visibility of the two
phones
we compare the two screens both indoors
and outdoors first we brought the phones
through the dimmest part of the house
and displayed a color chart on both
screens at 50% brightness the Galaxy S
force colors appeared brighter even the
darker shades of each color are still
clearly visible on the HTC One the
colors appear darker or richer less
saturated and more natural but the
darker shades have disappeared
next we brought the phones outside and
place them under direct sunlight viewing
a webpage on the screen at nearly
perpendicular angle we found that the
HTC One delivers a brighter and more
visible display then we tilted the
phones backwards to about 45 degrees
some sunlight reflected on the screens
and greatly reduced the visibility on
the Galaxy s4 however the display on HTC
One stayed somewhat visible at the same
45-degree angle but without any
reflection and with brightness set to
maximum both phones had visible displays
with a galaxy s4 slightly having an edge
chiefly because of its saturated colors
we also tested the phones under a shade
outdoors which means there was enough
bright lighting but not directly hitting
the phones with the phone set maximum
brightness the galaxy s4 showed richer
color and more marked contrast by the
HTC One delivered a brighter display the
HTC One screen seemed to have dimmed a
bit when we tilted the phone's backwards
to about 45 degrees the s4 screen stayed
visible and clear still under outdoor
shade but set to auto brightness the HTC
One showed better whites the Galaxy s4
screen was a bit dim because of the
bluish tint although it's blacks were
more solid in text was thicker text and
images were still clear on both phones
though thus far we've seen that the s4
has a wider viewing angle and a display
stays visible even under direct sunlight
first long as you keep it away from
reflection the HTC One screen meanwhile
doesn't reflect too much light and
therefore tends to stay visible even
under bright light it also shows whiter
and brighter whites compared to the
greenish bluish white on the s4 but the
s4 shows richer contrast and deeper
blacks we also wanted to explore how the
two phones deferred in color sharpness
and resolution so we compared the two
screens is playing the same high
definition photo in an indoor studio
setting with a screen set to 50%
brightness the HTC One seemed to render
realistic and vibrant colors the galaxy
s4 image showed saturated colors viewing
the same image under a microscope we saw
that the s4 screen had more green blue
pixels which somehow brightened up the
lighter areas the pixels on the s4 also
appeared
ah the HTC one white areas have no blue
or green pixels and appear realistically
white colors are deep rich and vivid
also the pixels are smaller so they tend
to be more dense resulting in a sharper
and refined image we also wanted to see
which phone displaced text better
undoubtedly Texas crisp and sharp on
both displays at maximum brightness on
the s4 though black letters look thicker
and bigger and the white background
seems a bit bluish the same leathers
look narrower or thinner and smaller on
the HTC one at maximum brightness the
white background looks more
realistically white and is much brighter
than the white on the s4 scrutinizing
the text more closely we found red and
green highlights around each letter on
the s4 creating some sort of fuzziness
around the text edges the HTC one on the
other hand simply has crunchy text and
solid lines with minimal outline as
high-end flagship Android phones the
Galaxy s4 and the HTC One are expected
to bring not just the best of processing
performers in power but also the best in
screen and display prowess in this video
we've seen that although the two phones
differ in their displace both phones do
render visually pleasant and amazing
images on their respective screens at
the end of the day what will most likely
sway you will not be what technical
experts say but what your very own dice
tell you when they see the awesome
display on either phone have you seen
this place on these phones with your own
eyes which phone has the better display
