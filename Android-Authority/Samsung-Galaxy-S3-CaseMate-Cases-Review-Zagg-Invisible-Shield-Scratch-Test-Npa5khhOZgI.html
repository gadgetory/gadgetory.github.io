tuning in to Android 230 coms YouTube
this is Clayton today I'm gonna be
showing you some case-mate tough cases
for the Samsung Galaxy s3 I've got four
of them here but before I do that I want
to tell everyone I do have these AG
invisible shield installed on my samsung
galaxy s3 and just as a note when you do
that the phone doesn't fit properly in
any case that I've tried so far so I'm
gonna actually uninstall the Zagg
invisible shield from the back of my
phone because after I do that everything
will fit properly but before I do that I
was just gonna show you guys some tests
with keys and a knife to show you how
well the invisible shield actually does
work in case people are thinking of
installing this and just leaving the
phone look sexy and not hiding it in a
case if anyways I do have it on the back
so I'll just dig some keys into here as
you can see I'm actually pushing pretty
dang hard this is about as hard as I can
and we can jingle all wrong I'm not
gonna rub it across the camera because
that's not protected but I am pressing
very very hard with these keys as you
can see there are some very slight
visible scratches on these AG but hardly
anything whatsoever it really does a
nice job of protecting the body now next
I will just grab a knife then do the
same exact thing there and of course we
can kind of cut it
and there are some scratches I can feel
but nothing made it all the way to the
body of the Galaxy s3 as you can see
here there is a bit of scratching some
that did go into the invisible shield
but mostly everything is gone and it's a
really nice protection but I will just
uninstall that really quickly just grab
a corner of this and peel take that off
there unless you can see this doesn't
leave any mess here's our invisible
shield but our Samsung Galaxy s3 is free
of residue so if you ever do have to
take your invisible shield off if you've
got one you're not gonna have to worry
about having any sticky disgusting
residue on your Samsung Galaxy s3 but
anyways let's get into some of these
case-mate tough cases I've got four here
I've got a pink dual layer protection
case I've got two here gold and a black
and then I've got a brushed steel
looking case so let's just open up these
gold and black ones the features of
these V's they're made out of plastic
they're really durable you're gonna
protect the sides and back of your
galaxy s3 so we'll pop on this black one
it fits nice now that we have our
invisible shield off the back let's see
it looks nice too it's got a nice
coating strong and it doesn't really
slip out of your hand - well anyways
we've got our headphone jack exposed our
LED speaker in the camera and then our
volume rocker our power button and our
micro USB on the bottom that's a pretty
nice one this black one is probably my
favorite just cuz I like the black you
have this gold one some of the ladies
out there might like this one just pop
this on sort of glammy but uh this one
is probably going to protect just as
well as a black one it feels like
there's an extra layer added on to this
gold speckle here it kind of has some
bounce
so that's nice all the same volume
rocker the power LED all that same stuff
exposed so I would say that these two
actually have the same amount of
protection next we'll get into our
brushed steel looking case mate case
this one I'd say has the same amount of
protection as well all these three are
just going to be the same it's just a
matter of preference of which one you
like which one you think looks better
this is a nice feel it's it's kind of
it's plastic so it's not really brushed
steel but does work we can snugly fit
our galaxy s3 in there all these cases
add some nice weight to the phone as
well all the same things exposed we have
our case mate logo down there this one
actually looks really nice I do like
this one and enhances the look of the
galaxy s3 especially the bordering
around here and finally we'll just get
into our dual protection tough case
which is gonna be the strongest one but
it may not be everyone's favorite color
it's got a pink and black colour scheme
but before we pop this on the phone we
can see this does have the dual layers
of protection we've got our polyurethane
or our rubbery
sort of protection there this is gonna
be shock absorbing and then we've got
our plastic outer case and this one has
some some ridges on there it makes it a
little bit stronger but anyways I'm just
gonna slide the phone in the rubber case
first and it fits on there nicely and
then we just guide this in I'm gonna use
the volume rocker as a guide poke that
through and then we can pull this out
and if the volume rocker through this
has got a nice fit some people may like
the look of this we've got all the same
things exposed and compared to the other
ones where we would have just a little
bit of coverage from the plastic up
there you have this rubber that's gonna
save it from Falls where it lands
directly on the top of the bottom and of
course it's gonna be protected from
bouncing and drops like that and then
even this little lip might protect the
screen a bit
so if it falls facedown as long as
there's nothing sharp for shooting from
the ground it's not gonna break the
screen of your Galaxy s3 those were
case-mate tough cases you guys so go
ahead and check these out pick them up
if you've got a galaxy s3 we've got a
few to choose from and there'll be more
coming out but you can basically
customize your Galaxy s3 with any look
you want and these provide a certain
level of protection that you can't get
without a case so stay tuned with
android authority guys we're gonna be
showing you a lot more stuff for the
galaxy s3 and everything Android in
