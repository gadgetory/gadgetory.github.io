tuning in to android 230 coms youtube
this is clayton today i'm going to be
showing you some case-mate tough cases
for the samsung galaxy s3 I've got four
of them here but before I do that I want
to tell everyone i do have the zagg
invisible shield installed on my samsung
galaxy s3 and just as a note when you do
that the phone doesn't fit properly in
any case that I've tried so far so I'm
going to actually uninstall the zagg
invisible shield from the back of my
phone because after I do that everything
will fit properly but before I do that I
was just going to show you guys um some
tests with keys and a knife to show you
how well the invisible shield actually
does work in case people are thinking of
installing this and just leaving the
phone looks sexy and not hiding it in a
case but anyways I do have it on the
back so I'll just dig some keys into
here as you can see i'm actually pushing
pretty dang hard just about as hard as I
can and we can jingle Iran I'm not going
to rub it across the camera because
that's not protected but I am pressing
very very hard with these keys as you
can see there are some very slight
visible scratches on the zagg but hardly
anything whatsoever it really does a
nice job of protecting the body now next
I will just grab a knife then do the
same exact thing there and of course we
can kind of cut it
and there are some scratches I can feel
but nothing made it all the way to the
body of the galaxy s3 as you can see
here there is a bit of scratching some
that did go into the invisible shield
but mostly everything is gone and it's a
really nice protection but i will just
uninstall that really quickly just grab
a corner of this and Peele take that off
there as you can see this doesn't leave
any mess here's our invisible shield but
our samsung galaxy s3 is free of residue
so if you ever do have to take your
invisible shield off if you've got one
you're not going to have to worry about
having any sticky disgusting residue on
your Samsung Galaxy s3 anyways let's get
into some of these case-mate tough cases
I've got four here I've got a pink dual
layer protection case I've got to hear
gold in a black and then I've got a
brushed steel looking case so let's just
open up these gold and black ones the
future of these these are they're made
out of plastic they're really durable
we're going to protect these sides and
back of your Galaxy s3 so we'll pop on
this black one it fits nice now that we
have our invisible shield off the back
and see it looks nice too it's got a
nice coating strong and it doesn't
really slip out of your hand too well
anyways we've got our headphone jack
exposed our LED speaker and camera and
then our volume rocker or power button
and our micro USB on the bottom that's a
pretty nice one this black one is
probably my favorite just because I like
the black you have this gold one some of
the ladies out there might like this one
just pop this on sort of glammy but uh
this one is probably going to protect
just as well as a black one feels like
there's an extra layer added onto this
gold speckle here it kind of has some
bounce
so that's nice all the same volume
rocker the power LED all that same stuff
exposed so i would say that these two
actually have the same amount of
protection next we'll get into our
brushed steel looking case-mate case
this one I'd say is the same amount of
protection as well all these three are
just going to be the same it's just a
matter of preference of which one you
like which one you think looks better
this is a nice feel it's kind of it's
plastic so it's not really brushed steel
but does work we can snugly fit our
galaxy s3 in there all these cases add
some nice weight to the phone as well
all the same things exposed we have our
case mate logo down there this one
actually looks really nice I do like
this one and enhances the look of the
galaxy s3 especially the bordering
around here and finally we'll just get
into our dual protection tough case
which is going to be the strongest one
but it may not be everyone's favorite
color if it gets got a pink and black
color scheme but before we pop this on
the phone we can see this does have the
dual layers and protection we've got our
polyurethane or are rubbery sort of
protection there this is going to be
shock absorbing and then we've got our
plastic outer case and this one has some
some ridges on there makes it a little
bit stronger anyways I'm just going to
slide the phone in the rubber case first
and it fits on there nicely and then we
just guide this in I'm going to use the
volume rocker as a guide poke that
through and then we can pull this out at
the volume rocker through this has got a
nice fit some people may like the look
of this we've got all the same things
exposed and compared to the other ones
where we would have just a little bit of
coverage from the plastic up there you
have this rubber that's going to save
her from false where it lands directly
on the top of the bottom and of course
it's going to be protected from bouncing
and drops like that and then even this
little lip might protect the screen a
bit
so if it falls face down as long as
there's nothing sharp for shooting from
the ground it's not going to break the
screen of your Galaxy s3 those were
case-mate tough cases you guys so go
ahead and check these out pick them up
if you've got a galaxy s3 we've got a
few to choose from and there'll be more
coming out but you can basically
customize your Galaxy s3 with any look
you want and these provide a certain
level of protection that you can't get
without a case so stay tuned with
android authority guys i'm going to be
showing you a lot more stuff for the
galaxy s3 and everything android in
general</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
