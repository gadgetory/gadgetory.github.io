handy Android authority Alki and we're
nearing the end of May and that means
it's time to round up the best new
Android games that were released over
the course of the last month and you
want to try out any of these games for
yourself you can find those links in the
video description below
battle bay is a surprise release from
Rovio even more surprising is that it's
a MOBA instead of characters players
will drive different boats and each one
has its own set of strengths and
weaknesses it plays like most MOBAs you
and other players square off against an
opposing team the first team to capture
all of the points wins games are
generally pretty quick and it also
features things like guilds upgrades and
more the MOBA genre is fairly anemic on
mobile so it's nice to see a major
company get into it crosswords with
friends is the latest game from Zynga it
plays a lot like the other with friends
games in the franchise you and a friend
will start filling out a crossword
puzzle the one who does the best wins
the round
you can play with friends or against
random strangers on the internet if you
so choose it's an easy and quick game to
pick up and play it also has various
crossword category's new content added
periodically and a hint system if you
need help it's not the New York Times
Sunday crossword but it'll do galaxies
on fire three Manticore is the latest
game in the sci-fi shooter franchise
you'll be piloting a spaceship and your
goal is to shoot bad guys in huge space
battles it has improved graphics from
the prior iterations but aside from that
it plays similarly to the old titles it
features a social system to connect with
friends ship upgrades new areas to
unlock and explore and a whole lot more
there's a lot to do but it is a freemium
game people who don't like those should
adjust their expectations accordingly
injustice 2 is the big ticket release
for the month of May much like the last
iteration it's not nearly as good as its
console release there are some similar
elements though it is a fighting game
that features DC comic book characters
to its credit the fighting mechanics and
controls are far better than the prior
injustice title it's not quite as good
as most arcade style fighters but it
makes up for it by being a
halfway-decent play for all of those
looking to kill a few minutes the
storyline isn't too bad either
kill shot virus is the third game in the
franchise unlike the others this one
deals with zombies it's a mission style
first-person shooter with over a hundred
missions to start like most FPS titles
that has a ton of what
here for you to collect and to upgrade
it also features power-ups if you're
interested along with the basics the
game includes a few different game modes
and in-game chat and leaderboards it
suffers from a lot of the same pitfalls
as other premium shooters though ok Golf
is an OK golf game it's reminiscent of
those old style arcade golf games with
the rolling ball controls the whole
premise of the game is to point and
shoot and like most golf games the goal
is to get the ball into the hole in his
cube shots as possible it's
family-friendly easy to play and it has
different game modes to help challenge
you it also features pass and play local
multiplayer as well as online
multiplayer mechanics it'll run you
$2.99 but there are no in-app purchases
pictionary is a mobile version of the
popular drawing game players will form
up into two teams of two and then one
person draws something while the other
person on their team guesses what it is
the first team to get it right is the
winning team this version features two
game modes thousands of words and tools
that you can upgrade as you play it's
not 100% faithful to the original but
it's close enough to be enjoyable it's
also a freemium title if that matters to
you milk made of the Milky Way is a
retro adventure game it focuses around a
quirky story about a girl some aliens
and some other stuff the game includes
plenty of puzzles to solve a story to
play through and all of the text in the
game is written in rhyme it's a
delightful little experience however the
playtime is about four hours and there
is no Google Play game support this may
be a deal-breaker at four dollars and 49
cents but it wasn't for us Riven is an
adventure puzzle game with tons of
exploration it's also the sequel to
missed the popular PC game from way back
in the day it follows a lot of the same
mechanics you'll wander around explore
your environment and figure out puzzles
to progress it comes with a functional
if rudimentary save and load system and
there are also Google Play games
achievements pinch-to-zoom functionality
and more
it runs $3.99 with no Inc app purchases
to the moon is a unique retro puzzle
adventure game you'll play as two
scientists and your job is to alter a
man's memories in order to fulfill his
final wish it boasts absolutely no
filler content everything you do will
have something to do with the storyline
additionally it has no combat it's just
you some puzzles and figuring out how to
get old Johnny to the moon in his
memories it's a fun little play and it
costs $4.99 with no in
purchases and that about does it for
this one folks don't forget to subscribe
