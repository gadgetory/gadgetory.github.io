the top tier smartphone game and for the
other it meant the perfecting of what
the first one started H Josh Vergara
from Android auto what's going on
everybody and this is the Sony Xperia z1
versus the Sony Xperia Z one of the main
ways of looking at this comparison is
that the Xperia z1 was a further
perfecting of what was started in the
Xperia Z essentially this means both
phones share many similarities what was
at one point considered the comeback
phone for Sony into the high-end
smartphone game came with a look we
didn't and still don't often see in the
markets a very rigid look with sharper
edges and corners almost like a
rectangular block what we also got with
the Z was the beginning of a new trope
for Sony smartphones the big silver
metal power button on the side atop the
volume rockers having water and dust
resistance meant that all of the ports
and slots on either of these phones had
to be covered up with small plastic
pieces I used to think that they would
eventually break but actually they never
have so that's good
nonetheless they dangle from the phone
when opened up and aren't the most
attractive parts of the phone despite
having an important function overall the
very decisive look of the phone gets a
pretty lightweight giving the Xperia Z a
nimble ability despite feeling sharp due
to those edges the Xperia z1 is the
Xperia Z grown-up in a way as the phone
has not only gotten a little bit bigger
but is also improved upon the general
design philosophy of it older brother
what it was once a plastic frame and
chassis is now metallic and though the
rest of the phone is similar leaking
cased in completely glass and some
plastic it unsurprisingly gets heavier
as a result in the hand this just feels
like a more premium device whose added
weight may or may not be a problem the
lighter Xperia Z might be easier to
carry but the weight also somewhat
grounds this z1 the black slate look
returns along with the same button
layouts the various small covers and
finally the addition of a two-stage
camera button on the same side as the
buttons its edges were also smoothed out
with very subtle curves that lower the
rigidity of the feel the result is a
softer overall feel despite this phone
being so similar to the original Xperia
Z when it comes to design there are real
differences between these two phones
even if they aren't easily recognizable
first glance if you liked the look of
the Xperia Z the z1 isn't hard to enjoy
either
it's definitely worth noting the added
weight in size as well as those subtle
curves that soften the feel but I know I
didn't have any problem with the sharper
edges of the Xperia Z admittedly it
might be an eyesore for some people to
see that the bezels on both of these
phones are rather thick we have been
somewhat spoiled by thin bezels and
other offerings and that is simply
something you won't get here nonetheless
sony has been hard at work trying to
improve their display game since the
Xperia Z which came with a capacitive
TFT screen backed by the Bravia Engine
especially one head-on does 1080p
display capable of 441 PPI brought a
great experience akin to a tiny Sony TV
yes the viewing angles were highly
publicized for not being great and they
really aren't on those standards the
screen might not truly fit into the
top-tier but it is still good at
producing a nice enjoyable experience
the Xperia z1 did improve on all of this
as Sony created the triluminos display
this time backed by the ex reality
engine it is still capable of the same
1080p resolution and 441 PPI from a
cursory glance you can notice that the
z1 screen has darker blacks and as a
result it has better contrast it
definitely handles the darker Timescape
UI very well it does somewhat improve on
those viewing angles a little though the
certain hue does still cast over
everything and that times you do notice
that the backlight bleeds out of the
edges of the screen which doesn't really
kill the experience but it's definitely
still worth mentioning dead-on however
this is definitely a better execution of
the display experience originally found
in the Z and that is a good plus for the
experiencing one even if it isn't leaps
and bounds better leaps and bounds do
describe the upgrade in the performance
Department some thought that a top-tier
offering like the Xperia Z did miss the
mark somewhat by having the then
somewhat aging snapdragon s4 pro clocked
in at 1.5 gigahertz and backed by the
Adreno 320 partially due to the more
simplistic Timescape UI the experience
was quite snappy and smooth without
really any big slowdowns even months
after its inception I can still rely on
it to get work and play done however the
recently released Xperia z1 does benefit
from getting the newer and very powerful
Snapdragon 800 the 2.2 gigahertz beast
with the audrina 330 this is the current
top dog in the processing department and
definitely makes the z1 a grey package
while I would stress that the Xperia Z
is still a good performing phone
you may want to have a more sustained
future-ready processing package and
admittedly that is definitely available
in the Xperia z1 in hardware there is
actually not too much that
differentiates these two phones both
offer very similar features like
expandable memory via microSD cards and
fixed batteries you do get a pretty
massive increase in the battery capacity
as the 3000 milliamp hour unit in the z1
Trump's the 23 30 milliamp hour one in
the Z as a result you will definitely
get much better longevity from the z1 as
it is able to handle a full day's work
with no issues at all power saving
features definitely help with this as
well and despite both phones being
flagship devices I find it odd that
features found on other iterations of
the Xperia Z line don't make it on
either of these phones like the IR
blaster from the ZL or the ability to
make any metallic surfaces stylus from
the Z ultra the biggest change in
hardware however is definitely in the
camera the experience he came with a 13
megapixel shooter powered by an app that
was pretty simplistic it did come with
the superior auto that calls back to
Sony cyber-shot cameras and for the most
part it does its job pretty well you can
always go into a normal mode with some
manual control and there were some other
modes available like sweeping panorama
picture quality was decent but it was
held back by its noise levels and darker
spots and low-light situations
color reproduction left a little bit to
be desired ultimately it got the job
done but it didn't do it by truly
excelling with a great digital
photography background Sony wanted to
fully instill its prowess into the z1
what we get in the z1 optics is a sensor
that is larger than typical smartphone
cameras usually come with and a massive
increase to 20 point 7 megapixels while
that's definitely awesome it was
unfortunate to find that the megapixel
drop immediately went from 20 to 8
megapixels in the settings not only that
there are no steps for 16 by 9 shooting
in between those which is a big bummer
for anyone who wanted a larger size in
their favorite aspect ratio the app does
get a boost with a more open eco system
allowing for downloadable add-ons and
new functionality and when it comes to
picture quality the color reproduction
and saturation was very much improved
making well-lit shots all look very good
your focal point will get a very high
level of detail but when you move away
from it the story starts to change areas
with blur or noise basically anything
from black spot
to low light areas to even sometimes the
bouquet in the background have a smudgy
look making grain that much more
unattractive you will still get a lot of
great shots out of the Xperia z1 and it
should be commended for that especially
in highly lit situations but when you
put these pictures under the looking
glass these issues happen to become
clear in the end you are seeing a good
increase in camera performance from the
z2 the z1 but both still suffer from the
same overly aggressive noise reduction
that makes the darker areas harder to
capture well finally in software we
don't see a whole lot of changes as the
Timescape UI has not really evolved that
much you get a pretty simplistic user
interface overall that does somewhat
mimic stock Android with the home
screens the doc app drawer and the power
widget in the notification drop-down
these phones do bring the modernized
version of Sony's media experience like
the Walkman app which is a nice and
attractive music player that I still
like to use very much
the main addition that differentiates
Timescape is the small apps feature
which can be accessed in the recent apps
screen these are small overlays that
allow for small and quick multitasking
over whatever you're already doing in
the end you're getting the same overall
experience with either phone honestly
it's a bummer that Sony phones don't
really make it to US carriers though
they are quite popular in plenty of
other countries that being said the
Xperia Z is found on t-mobile for their
program of $20 a month over 24 month
period unlocked it does now come in at
around $500 we don't know what the
roadmap for the Xperia z1 is for US
carriers but when unlocked it does come
in at around $700 and so there you have
it the Xperia z1 is undoubtedly the next
step from the Z and that's a good thing
the design does bring a much more
premium feeling phone and continues the
design that we've come to expect and
honestly love from the Xperia line plus
the faster processing really elevates
the performance aspect
despite its other improvements however
the z1 still suffers from issues that
plagued the Z even if to a lesser extent
the screen better handles its colors and
contrast though its viewing angles and
backlight bleeds or detractors the
camera is a massive spec improvement but
it's very selective in allowing you to
harness that power and it's picture
quality while improved it's still rather
uneven ultimately the z1 feels like the
phone the Z could have been
and that may or may not mean it is
enough to justify the extra costs if you
were able to look past these issues in
the Xperia Z know that they do somewhat
remain in the newest iteration and this
is a notion that might mean the Xperia Z
is still the better value as always
