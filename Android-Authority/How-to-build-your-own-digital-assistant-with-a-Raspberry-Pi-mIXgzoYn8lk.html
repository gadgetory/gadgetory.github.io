Authority now google recently announced
support for the Raspberry Pi for its
Google assistant API that company's
cloud services which is absolutely
brilliant idea because it means that
hobbyists and education is the makers
can now start to build small projects at
home that have voice activation and are
connected to Google services now once I
heard about this I thought to myself
well I've got to build a project to show
you how great fun that's going to be to
build while I was doing that Google
actually released a special kit called
the voice kit that includes a special
piece of hardware called The Voice hat
for the Raspberry Pi that has a
microphone and a speaker built into it
and some special software which kind of
means all this stuff just happens
automatically without you having to do
lots of programming now I thought that
would be a great thing to demonstrate to
you and I tried to get hold of one now
it was officially released on the front
of the magpie magazine the official
roster fire magazine but I couldn't get
when I looked online I asked one of my
colleagues Robert Trix to go out to the
shops in London see if he could find one
he couldn't find one so they're really
hard to get at the time of making this
video but it certainly gave me a clue
about what Google were intending with
this Google assistant API so I tried
some more and I took what I learned from
the voice kick and I took what I had
here at home and I still managed to make
a Google assistant running on a
Raspberry Pi so if you'd like to know
how to do it let me explain okay first
things first do this you're going to
need a Raspberry Pi 3 okay and that's
the big one which is got the quad core a
50 C processor in it's got lots of USB
ports it's got Wi-Fi built into it so
that's a really good device to have to
do this because they need to be tethered
necessarily to a network with an
Ethernet cable you're going to need a
speaker of some kind that has connection
for a 3.5 millimeter jack plug as one of
those here and you're going to need some
kind of button and I've got a button
here on a breadboard that you can use
for pressing the button to activate the
Raspberry Pi and then need a USB
microphone I'll talk about that in a
moment and of course while you're doing
setup you're going to need a mouse and a
keyboard and a monitor and so on to
actually configure your Raspberry Pi now
basically what we're going to do is when
you take the voice kit software but
Google are providing on their AI
projects or website and we're going to
modify it slightly not to work with the
voice happ's hardware that they're
giving away with the kit but actually to
work with a normal speaker and with a
USB microphone for the first step is to
download that SD card image now all of
the links and all the actual details are
step by step because you're going to
find in the article that accompanies
this video that's over on the under
authority comm website I really
recommend you following the steps there
but in broad strokes what you need to do
is you need to download that image and
write it on to an SD card and then boot
your Raspberry Pi with of course a mouse
keyboard and wanted to connect it to it
now once you've done that we need to
edit a few things because that version
of Linux is running on the Raspberry Pi
is specifically looking for the voice
hat that special piece of hardware that
Google are having their kit to do the
microphone and to do the speaker output
so we're going to need to change it now
to do that you need to modify the booth
slash config dot text file at the bottom
there you'll notice that Google have
commented out support for the built-in
sound card of the Raspberry Pi and
they've added in support for the voice
app and we need to undo that change so
we need to comment out Google's things
and
to put in again support for the
Raspberry Pi and while you're there on
your Raspberry Pi you're going to need
to configure access to secure share you
do that by going to the menu and then
finding the Raspberry Pi configuration
program those interfaces and then make
sure that SSH is enabled and you also
need to make sure that your network is
configured go up to the Wi-Fi sign up on
the top right hand corner by the clock
and configure it your Wi-Fi network now
you do one other thing before you reboot
and that is to edit the file slash etc
slash a sound dot cold now that's
basically the sound configuration file
that Linux uses to work out what sound
hardware is connected now again the one
that's shipped with it is expecting the
voice hat a piece of hardware but we're
going to change it so that you can
actually just use a USB mic and you can
use the 3.5 millimeter
sound jack that you get on the
motherboard now you'll find the
configuration file that you need to put
in there again over in the article on
the Android home website now once you've
done that it's time to reboot so the
first thing I check is that the sound is
working now there are two little more
minor steps we need to go through first
of all there's a file that is a Python
file but Google are using to check that
the audio is okay and that's expecting
again the voice has hardware now give
details over there when how you change
that so that it can use the built-in
hardware once you've changed that file
you just need to plug in a micro USB
microphone now I didn't have a USB
microphone handy so a bit of a tip I did
have an old webcam knocking about and I
took the webcam and plug that in and the
Raspberry Pi was able to detect the
microphone that was built into the
webcam and use that instead so if you
don't go out and buy one don't have one
you can actually use an old webcam if
you don't even need to get hold of a
Raspberry Pi compatible USB microphone
now once you have the microphone plugged
in once you've changed the script to
make sure it's using the internal
hardware then you need to double-click
on that check audio link that you find
on the desktop and that will ask you
then to check that you can hear the
sound coming out the speaker and it will
also check so it can record your voice
and repeat it to you on the speak and if
you've done back the
you're halfway to getting this system
working testing testing 1 2 3
the reason you did your Raspberry Pi
case to be infinite is because a lot of
these heavy lifting is done using
Google's cloud services so to get this
Google assistant working on the right
with high you're going to need to
connect to and configure a cloud
services account over at Google now all
the details on how you do this are found
in this article and also Google have
published them on the voice kit website
and again there are links over at the
article for that basically what you need
to do is go over there you log in you
create a new project you enable the
Google assistant API for that project
you need to create some credentials for
logging in so it knows that your
raspberry pi is authorized to log into
your account and you do that by creating
some o author credentials and you then
download the JSON file which has those
credentials in and you put them on your
raspberry pi renaming the file to
assistant Jason and once you've done
that it should work with the Google's
Google's cloud services now the last
thing you need is a switch for
activating the voice control now
basically here I've got a breadboard
with a switch and you need to take two
wires from the breadboard here over to
the Raspberry Pi one needs to make it to
GPIO pin 23 and the other one needs to
be connected to any of the ground pins
and what happens is the software that
Google provided monitors that GPIO pin
and when you press the button it then
starts listening for your voice command
and finally to get it we're running you
just need to run main Python which is a
file that's part thereof the kit again
detailed in the article and that will
set this whole thing in motion and this
is what it sounds like when it's working
who is the queen of England according to
Wikipedia elizabeth ii has been Queen of
the United Kingdom Canada Australia and
New Zealand since the 6th of February
1952 now the voice kit comes with a nice
cardboard box at Google of made but you
can use your imagination to put your
raspberry pie into any kind of cardboard
box if you like cut some holes in it
now I'm going to show you the one that
I've made I'm a software engineer not a
hardware engineer so don't laugh at my
creation here but here's my box what
time is it
currently eleven twenty three years okay
and it does work and you I'm sure you
could do better if you do please do post
pictures in the comment I would love to
see the boxes that you make for your
Raspberry Pi now as a final wrap-up what
have we done we've downloaded the voice
kit software from Google which has
already been shipped ready to work with
the Google assistance we've modified it
a bit to work with the standard hardware
rather than the voice kit hardware we've
configured the Google cloud so that we
can actually access the Google Assistant
API and then we built a switch which is
what triggers the voice activation and
then we put it all into a nice cardboard
case but this isn't the end you can also
extend this further now Google of given
instructions on how you can make your
own triggers and they've got a little
demo project there where you can say
light on light off and it will turn an
LED on or off on your grass with
pineapples that could be extended to all
manner of things so this kit is
extensible you can actually just change
it to do home automation to control
robots to do whatever you want to do
that you can do on a Raspberry Pi it can
now be voice-activated I'm going Sims
from an authority I really do hope you
enjoyed this look at how to make your
own Google assistant with a Raspberry Pi
if you did please do give it a thumbs up
please subscribe to the anti-authority
youtube channel hit that Bell so that
you get notifications whenever we
release a new video and do go over to
