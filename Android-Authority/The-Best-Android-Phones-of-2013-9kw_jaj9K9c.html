of the year so it's time to take a look
back and see what are the best Android
phones of 2013 it's Josh regard from
Android 30 what's going on everybody and
it's time to take a look at the best
phones of 2013 however we're taking a
bit of a different approach here instead
of just giving you a top five ten list
we're actually going to look at what
types of phones would be perfect for the
type of person that you might be but
enough of the chitchat
why don't we go ahead and jump right
into the categories whether you like
just your simple word puzzles or you
play dead trigger 2 at the highest
possible quality settings this is a
phone made for the gamer in all of us
and yes our pick is the Google Nexus 5
with a great display backed by LG's
display prowess a wonderful processing
package in the Snapdragon 800 and the
adrenal 334 high graphics allows for
some very great gaming capabilities
the main reason here however is the
price it is a pretty easy entry for a
great performance and you have money
left over for plenty of games our
runner-up in this category is the Sony
Xperia z1 it brings many of the same
capabilities along with even better
battery life a better camera and
expandable storage also DualShock
controller support built-in doesn't hurt
either however it does have a much
higher price point our next best
smartphone for 2013 is for the
workaholic basically the person who
needs to get a lot done and needs a
companion that can get a lot of things
done and for the workaholic we have to
give the crown to the Samsung Galaxy
Note 3 it is an executive phone with an
executive look however it also comes
with all of the tools that you would
need to get the work done it continues
to lead the phablet space especially
with the inclusion of the s-pen not only
does it come with a bunch of new
features that make it easier for even
the average user to get into the s-pen
it also allows for a lot of multitasking
our runner-up in this category is the LG
g2 while it doesn't have the s-pen
plenty of the multitasking tools
included in the g2 are similar to what
are included in the galaxy note 3 and
all comes in a smaller perhaps slightly
more accessible package due to its
smaller size compared to the note 3 if
your phone is basically your
entertainment hub for everything from
YouTube to Google play music to Spotify
to Netflix even then this next phone is
one of the best songs 2013 and is made
especially for you the entertainment
lover it should come as a little
surprise that the HTC One gets the nod
here due to a superior audio experience
the boom sound front-facing speakers are
just stellar performers and they allow
for standalone media consumption through
just the phone itself and couple that
with a 1080p resolution screen at 4.7
inches that keeps it had a great quality
in an actually pretty accessible package
nonetheless our runner-up in this
category is basically the step aside
from the HTC One and that is the Samsung
Galaxy s4 the Samsung Galaxy s4 Super
AMOLED display provides high contrast in
a 5 inch form factor media looks great
across the board on this particular
screen so if you need an experience that
might be just a little bit bigger than
the one that is in the HTC One the
Samsung Galaxy s4 stands right alongside
it you get all of your materials
together you're super-excited to get out
to your brand-new college campus but
after paying for the books paying for
your extra materials and not to mention
the college tuition you find yourself a
little strapped for cash so this next
best phone of 2013 is made for you the
student was there really any doubt what
the phone would be here of course it's
the Moto G with great performance at a
very affordable price point this is one
of the most undeniable Steel's in the
android market today and in the market
of smaller lower end phones not only
does the $179 base price point truly set
it apart but a great 720p display
quality and a good performing quad-core
Snapdragon processor are just icing on
top of the cake however if money is no
object and you are able to pay for that
much higher price point
then our runner-up in this category is
the samsung galaxy note 3 the note 3 is
great for students for all of the same
reasons that it is good for workaholics
of course granted they don't stay on
Facebook all day
so you've got all of your gear on for a
nice run or maybe you even have a
backpack on for that hike well in this
case you want to be one with nature so
what phone do you bring along with you
well when it comes to the outdoorsy type
we have found that the Sony Xperia z1
definitely fits the bill with ingress
protection or ip67 certification all
that means that this phone can brave the
elements much better than most other
phones and it still manages to look like
a very sleek device despite all of that
protection in DB Sony Xperia z1 can take
a tumble it could even take a splash and
in terms of our drop tests it took a
thrashing and still came out looking
about as good as it went in however if
you do want to kind of hit it on the
nose here with the more rugged type of
phone our runner-up is of course the
Samsung Galaxy s4 active if you want a
phone that actually seems catered for
the rugged terrain and that is exactly
what the s4 active was made for as it
comes with the same IP certifications as
the Xperia z1 in a body that likely
matches your hiking gear now this is a
category that I might somewhat put
myself in because it's the category that
tends to try to be unique tries to be
the early adopter for something that
might really blow up later this is the
best phone of 2013 for the trendsetter
and after much deliberation we have
found that the best phone for a
trendsetter is the LG G flex this is the
phone trying to do something new and
manages to do it with some style while
never failing to be a great font
underneath it all that curve is very
very obvious from the get-go but it does
allow for durability along with a
self-healing back a flexible plastic LED
display allows for this type of form
factor to happen and it is a pretty
early adoption along with that
self-healing back but underneath it is a
wonderfully executed 720p display
powered by the high performing
Snapdragon 800 our very close runner-up
in this category is the HTC One it is an
aluminum clad smartphone that actually
pretty much stands alone in the Android
space the HTC One gets points for its
own stylish Flair and there's a phone
that we are always happy to have in our
and and usually does the trick when it
comes to turning people's heads
our next category is for the gadget
lover essentially what we're looking for
is a phone that you would be immensely
happy to have and have right alongside
all of the other gadgets do you call
your own and in this category we have to
give it to the motox see you taught us
that super high end specifications
aren't needed to have a superior user
experience and it has a highly
accessible smaller body that makes for a
companion you can always easily have on
hand however it doesn't slouch in terms
of its features as the extra features
motorola put into the home oh stock
Android build adds points for being
actually practical and highly utilized
by even most average users however as
long as we're talking about features if
you want the most possible then perhaps
the Samsung Galaxy S 4 is for you and is
the runner-up in this category
maybe every new addition that Samsung
did throw into the s4 will make you
happy everything from the air gestures
to the air views to the smart pauses the
smart scroll is the IR blaster and even
the s health functionality if that is
all useful to you then the Samsung
Galaxy S 4 is your pick so let's say
there's a shot that you want to get
something just looks really beautiful
but you don't have your DSLR or your
compact camera so what phone do you have
in your back pocket to take that perfect
shot well this is the best phone of 2013
for the photographer and in this regard
we have to give it to the LG g2 a 13
megapixel optic package comes with many
different modes in the app to allow for
creativity HDR panorama burst modes the
works however what is really of note
here is a great implementation of
optical image stabilization which proves
how important such a feature will be in
the coming year for other camera
smartphones not only does it allow for
some great stabilization for your shaky
hands it also provides some pretty great
photos as a result the quality is pretty
undeniable here and also the bonus with
the LG g2 is that it just also manages
to be a damn good phone too because you
can compare to some other phones that
try to be more like cameras than phones
and pretty much fall flat on their face
the Sony Xperia z1 is the runner-up here
and gets the nod for a very
high-performing 20.7 megapixel shooter
is enhanced by user installable add-ons
that provide a possibly consistently
evolving photography experience its
pictures are also not too shabby either
and with that super high megapixel count
there are definitely quite a few things
you can do with the very large pictures
that come out of this phone now we would
be remiss if we overlooked what is one
of the most important categories of the
year and that is the Android purist this
is probably the smallest surprise of the
year because of course the Nexus 5 takes
the crown for being the phone for the
Android purist we wanted to give it a
nod primarily because it really is the
best and quintessential Android
experience available right now and it
only comes from the Nexus Android 4.4
KitKat brings optimizations with a
further elegantly integrated search
interface with voice controls built in
to boot the phone is also a great
performer with very powerful
specifications and the camera even if it
started off a little bit wonky got
greatly improved with a new very recent
point one update we give the runner-up
spot here to the Moto X with Google's
backing the Moto Series is still a great
representation of almost stock Android
with useful and well-executed Motorola
extras and so there you have it for all
of the best phones of 2013 catered
specifically to the type of person you
might be now we've pretty much covered a
lot of different types of people and if
