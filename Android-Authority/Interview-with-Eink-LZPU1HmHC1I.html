with our wearables and mobile devices
they have ambitions to go outside of the
mobile box and charter new grounds or
wall tiles here at CES we had an
opportunity to speak with Giovanni
Mancini who was a head of global
marketing for e and here's what he had
to say our big announcement at CES this
year is our Inc prism product what Inc
prism is you've basically taken our Inc
technology introduced color into it and
create a color-changing film so that
we're actually able to integrate this
into architectural products and design
products so that you now have
environments we can change the
aesthetics of the environments you can
change the color of the environment so
you don't have the kind of the static
you know one painted once and leave it
on leave it there for as long as you
have to paint again the product here is
intended primarily for architecture and
design applications so it's not really
for mobile 210 for large large
installations that we typically see like
hotel lobbies you know the large areas
of an airport you know branding
experiences for corporations and their
head offices those types of applications
and markets so you know we've been
working with architects and designers
for about over a year now
you know this wall is about 4 feet by 12
feet tall overalls about 16 feet tall
you know we're looking to have a
demonstration product of this probably
by the end of 2015 in conjunction with
architects and some of the architecture
material products that are working in
this space great now if they want to
know more information about this product
how can they get in contact with eating
canned and see more of their see more of
your products the easiest way of getting
more information and contacting us is to
go to our website wowt.com we have a
complete sub section of our website
dedicated to ink prism to talk about
what the product is the markets were
focusing on what we can do with it the
types of you know types of projects we
were working with and how to contact us
