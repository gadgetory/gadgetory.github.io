with android authority from CS 2017 i
have the pleasure today speaking with
mr. Finbar Monahan who's general manager
of sales for media tech morning Graham
life sir good to see you and how's your
CS going so far so good yeah it's like
it's day three so we're in the middle of
it I guess but yeah it's been a busy
couple of days so far it's been a busy
couple quarters for media tech yes it
has yes sir let's just talk about how
mediatek's doing how's company so it was
a pretty good year for us in 2016 we saw
very good revenue growth I think the
revenue is up over about thirty percent
OCR years and there's really kind of two
things driving that for us one is we've
seen a lot of growth in smartphones so
you know even though the overall
industry I think people have sort of
started talking that you know there's
not that much overall growth in the
industry actually what we've seen is
quite significant year-over-year unit
growth in smartphones and so that's been
a big driver of our market share and big
driver of revenue I'm actually the other
part of the business which is is also
kind of important for CES is the home
business for media tech and that's also
seen some strength and TV set-top box
and some of those products yeah
absolutely so rich media text technology
you know Taiwanese face company yep I
mean the cool thing about all these sort
of armed IP licensors essentially is
that there's so much diversity within
the marketplace you know for sure
mediatek kind of took a special place
because I mean Qualcomm has always kind
of vibe for you know arguably the
highest and and they also have a strong
mid-range for then we have X else yep
but Media Tech is really my opinion like
their technology has graduated and
improved so consistently
quarter-over-quarter year-over-year how
would you define the brand right now you
know I use the words before like sort of
budget premium yeah I mean that's kind
of one way to describe it and I think
but I think you kind of hit it on the
head there at the start of the
discussion I mean I think Media Tech has
always taken a kind of a very holistic
systematic approach to all of the
markets we go into so you know one of
the things I joke about media tech is
where a software and systems company
hiding as a hardware company because
ultimately what we sell are the chips
right but most of our engineering
headcount most of our R&amp;amp;D
effort and money probably goes into
software system solutions right so we
take a very systematic approach to tvs
set-top boxes tablets smartphones and we
really do try to build what you know
some people refer to as the turnkey are
that complete system solution but we
think that gives us better insight into
the actual end application the end user
application and then you know generation
after generation we can do better
integration better optimization you know
really trying to figure out what are the
user experiences that matter and put
more focus on those right yes yes and
then what we also focus on though is
delivering it as a reference design to
our customers because at the end of the
day we don't think it makes sense for
like one reference design to go into
every single phone from every single
brand right we still want to allow
enough flexibility for each brand to
differentiate so you know many brands
may take the same reference design from
us but some of them may focus on like
the camera others may focus on the
display some may focus on the battery
life so many focus on multiple aspects
but they all want to be able to leverage
that common platform that we deliver so
that's where I think the value of media
tech solutions come in I mean I just
love listening to a talk it's very
interesting I mean because your
salesperson you know yeah so you're
dealing these large corporate customers
to me we were looking for highly
customized solutions yeah and the
diversity of the offerings that media
tech mmm has such that you can pretty
much Taylor whatever they need yeah yeah
and and our customers base you know they
run as you said exactly the from the
tier 1 customers soul I can you know in
the home and tablet space amazon has
been a good customer so many years that
Lily obviously they have a very unique
software solution a very unique so you
know what we support them with is very
different maybe than what we might
support a different type of customer
ways actually yeah so just talking about
the actual technology itself looking
like the helio 630 yep talking about
eight gigs around your essential and
you know Decker Decker corteco or you
know yeah so the helio the helio line is
obviously something we focused on for
the last couple of years and I think
that you know back to your earlier
comment that's also been part of
MediaTek's deliberate strategy to you
know move up here into sort of slightly
higher tier to your products and and
we've had you know two families the
Helio X family and the Helio p family ok
you know x is for extreme performance so
that's where you'll see the latest and
greatest technologies right so that
that's where we introduced Decker core
that's where we you know moved into new
process technologies and then we also
have the pea family and the pea family
is positioned just below the x you know
it probably isn't as high performance
it's more about a balanced high
performance and power consumption so
we're really trying to deliver that you
know combination experience but both
have been very successful for for us I
mean we've seen we've seen over the last
two years probably from not being in
those segments you know to probably
approaching you know twenty percent of
our volume is now Helio products well
actually yeah and and you know some of
that I think has coincided with the
growth and success of many of the
Chinese OEMs yeah who you know have been
very good customers of media types for
many years but they obviously had a lot
of success domestically in China but now
we start to see many of those brands
really starting to come out into the
global market and they tend to focus on
you know slightly higher tier you know
4g smartphones which is I think we're a
lot of that Helio value proposition
really makes sense as you know the good
performance you know at reasonably
affordable prices thanks for buck
exactly and that's what consumers want
right now honestly you know I'm we're
seeing you know the US smartphone market
contracting yep I mean simply because
the phones that have been released over
the last 18 months Frank they're all so
good yep even phones you know that were
sort of considered to be flagships yeah
my point is that
really believe that consumers are
looking for exceptional value exactly
exactly it's actually global consumers
you know and and there's a few trends
that I think we see I mean one yes the
you know I think the very interesting
thing about the smartphone market these
days is that the you know the overall
global growth has slowed we all know
that we look at the analyst report
disease but if you unpack that a little
bit and you look in different regions I
mean India is probably going to grow by
you know tens of percentage growth and
will be down for a while you know I
still has quite healthy growth last year
other tiers are also you know the
premium segment i think is probably
flattened out or not yeah probably the
effect you see most in the US market but
you know tears below that are quite
healthy as you see consumers looking for
value like you said and you know one of
the trends we see in the US market is a
move towards more unlocked phones and a
people going to you know going online to
amazon.com or are going into their
retail store and looking for the best
phone they can buy berlin for their
their particular nvidia dollars exactly
and that's kind of a trend we see will
happen plus i think we also now start to
see china has moved into very much a
replacement market so people are
upgrading their phones looking for a
better features more memory more camera
a better display even in markets like
India where you still have a large
number of consumers really getting their
first smartphone and that first data
experience you still also have a large
number of people who are also trading up
in those markets so I think we'll see it
kind of a shift to the you know the
middle range of the market on a global
basis and we think that's very much a
sweet spot of where we want to be and I
have to applaud you guys because a
company like MediaTek you know they're
putting pressure from all sides on
unlike icing comments you know yeah who
can remain nameless but no I mean
competition is good for the market it's
Christmas always get worse yeah
competition is good it's good for the
consumers you know we think if we can if
we do our job well what we do is we
enable a platform and a technology that
frankly enables our customers the phone
makers to be successful and ultimately
delights the consumers our customers
when we when the consumer wins
well I mean with that I think we've
almost call it a wrap very good well
really appreciate a man pleasure to talk
to the time came back passenger a story

mediatek thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
