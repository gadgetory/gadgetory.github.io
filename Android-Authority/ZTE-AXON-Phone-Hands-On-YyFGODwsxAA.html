earth or tea coming to you live from New
York City to bring you your first look
and hands-on of ZTE s ax on phone so the
main idea behind the ax on phone is as a
phone that's designed for the consumer a
phone that is meant to give you pretty
much everything you would want it's
entirely made of metal with some nice
curves along the corners and backside
that give the phone a very comfortable
feel and it's extremely solid because of
the metal unibody design this phone
isn't striving to be the thinnest or
lightest measuring in at nine point
three millimeters thick and 175 grams
and weight but when holding it in the
hand the phone feels substantial going
around the device you'll find much of
the buttons and ports in their typical
locations but something the ax on phone
has that many other Android phones don't
is a dedicated camera key to make it
quick and easy to launch directly into
the camera and snap photos capacitive
keys can also be found on the front
denoted by a glowing circle for the home
button and two individual dots for menu
and recent apps at first glance you
might think the ax on phone features
dual front-facing speakers with a
matching set of uniquely styled grills
but unfortunately only the bottom is a
speaker something this phone does have
to of however is the cameras on the rear
which coincidentally featured the same
grille styling for some extra Flair on
the front is a 5.5 inch screen but the
ax on phone is considerably larger than
some other 5.5 inch smartphones in terms
of height due to the large top and
bottom bezels and of course the two
grilles on the top and bottom definitely
add to that as well so one hand
usability might be a bit of a challenge
for some besides just having a large 5.5
inch screen the ax on phones front panel
is also very sharp with a resolution of
2560 by 1440 or quad HD resulting in a
pixel density of 534 PPI so far the
screen looks fantastic with great colors
viewing angles and brightness and should
be a pleasure to use in all situations
whether it's just normal day-to-day
tasks or playing the occasional game or
movie under the hood the ax on phone
packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810
processor clocked at two gigahertz the
audrina 430 GPU and is one of the few
phones on the market with a whopping 4
gigs of ram this is the revised version
of the synaptic a10 processor so
overheating should not be an issue and
performance on this advice at first
glance seems rather snappy and
responsive and with 4 gigs of RAM doing
heavy multitasking or playing games
should pose very little problems for the
axon phone whether the overheating
issues rears its ugly head again is
something we can only find out after
really putting the device through its
paces when we give it the full review
treatment so stay tuned for that but for
the short time we got to spend with the
device it was as smooth as you would
expect it to be for storage the axon
phone comes with 32 gigabytes of onboard
memory which is the only option
available and without a micro SD card
slot you'll have to either rely on the
cloud for extra storage or make do with
the 32 gigs aside from all the other
usual connectivity options the axon
phone will carry 4G LTE compatibility
for t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T here in the States
the axon phone will also be the first
phone sold in the US that features high
fire do playback which is supposed to
give you a fuller louder and purer of
sound quality than ever before and you
should be able to notice the difference
even with a pair of inexpensive
earbuds keeping the phone powered
throughout the day is a beefy 3000
milliamp hour battery so at least on
paper battery life should be good for a
full day if not more now because this
phone is made of metal you don't have
wireless charging capabilities however
you do get to take advantage of Qualcomm
quick charge technology now the dual
lens setup on the rear is comprised of a
13 megapixel main shooter and a 2
megapixel secondary sensor this is
similar to what we saw on the One m8 to
allow for a much faster autofocus and
the ability to refocus shots after the
fact the camera is also capable of video
recording in 4k and comes with twin
microphones along with some of the best
in noise suppression technology to help
eliminate background and wind noise when
recording concert videos and voice calls
the device also packs a wide-angle 8
megapixel front-facing camera which
should be good for all of you selfie
lovers the camera interface is fairly
simple with various different modes
being accessible with just a swipe
across the display but
most interesting feature of the camera
is the ability to adjust the f-stop on
the fly from 8 all the way down to 1
although this is most likely done at a
software level and not exactly a real
aperture change as to how well this
camera actually stacks up to the
competition we'll have to wait and see
but with phones like the g4 and s6 it's
got a tough road ahead of itself for the
software the axon phone is running on
5.1.1 lollipop and ZTE has done some
customizations and there's a handful of
pre-installed apps like Argos and ROK my
run for tracking your fitness data but
for the most part they've kept things
very light and many of Google's material
design aesthetics have been kept intact
like the notification drop-down and the
overview screen and this definitely
helps maintain a snappy performance the
axon phone will be available for
pre-orders directly from ZTE and other
retailers like Amazon and Newegg
for a price of $500 and we'll be
shipping out in the coming weeks it
isn't exactly impulse buy territory at
500 bucks but with an all-metal design a
quad HD display 4 gigs of ram dual
cameras and a large 3000 milliamp hour
battery powering at all the axon phone
packs a major punch for the price as
always guys hopefully you enjoyed this
quick hands-on of the axon phone keep it
tuned here for more coverage of the axon
phone and everything else that we have
coming down the road and as always give
this video a thumbs up if you did enjoy
