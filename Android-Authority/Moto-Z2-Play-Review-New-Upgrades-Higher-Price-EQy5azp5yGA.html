authority and the successor to the Moto
Z play is here and it brings along some
new friends and some new improvements
but are all of these changes for the
better and is it still one of the best
mid-range phones that you can buy this
is the Moto Z to play the biggest change
with this year's v2 play that you'll
notice right off the bat is the design
is a little bit different it's a little
thinner one millimeter thinner to be
exact giving it a much sleeker feel in
the hand and the back is now all-metal
which is a huge improvement over the
fingerprint prone glass back of the
original Z play otherwise the overall
design and form factor is practically
the same as last year and it sort of had
to be for one simple reason the Moto
mods motorola has refreshed the Moto
mods with the release of the z2 play but
if you have last year's moto mods these
will all fit and work perfectly fine
just like Motorola promised motorola is
guaranteeing compatibility of the Moto
mods with their phones for three years
so you could probably save yourself some
cash by buying last year's mods if
you're looking to invest in them for the
first time despite shaving off an entire
millimeter there's still plenty of space
for a headphone jack so nothing to be
worried about there but the thinner body
did come with one compromise the battery
capacity has dropped from 35 10 milliamp
hours on the original Z play to 3000
milliamp hours the z2 play is not going
to get you the two days of battery life
that the Z play did but it can still
last a solid day to a day and a half
that's well above average and more than
what you typically get on most other
Android phones I've never struggled to
get through a full day even with heavy
use and I would usually end the day with
anywhere between 25 to 40% battery left
so battery life was your main concern
there's nothing to be worried about here
it's still exceptionally good and it
supports Motorola's Turbo Power charging
which can quickly get you a 50 percent
charge in only 30 minutes you won't find
a whole lot of bells and whistles on the
z2 play after all this is a mid-range
device it's not IP certified against
water and dust in any way but it does
have a water repellant nano coating so
it is at the very least resistant to the
occasional splash audio also isn't all
that great on the V to play at least not
without resorting to a moto mod there's
only
one speaker embedded in the earpiece and
while I do appreciate that it is a front
firing speaker it doesn't get very loud
and because it's just a mono speaker you
get a very lopsided listening experience
when using the phone in landscape the
fingerprint sensor has been redesigned
with the same oval shape that we
initially saw earlier this year on the
g5 plus it works great unlocking the
phone with reliability and speed but in
addition to that you can use various
different gestures to move around the OS
in place of the on screen navigation
buttons this is great if you want to
maximize the screen real estate but
there is a bit of a learning curve to
using one button for everything just
like last year's motorcy play you've got
a 5.5 inch 1080p screen and it is an
AMOLED screen so colors are vibrant with
deep dark blacks viewing angles are also
quite nice and in most situations it
looks pretty good its spacious enough
for comfortably browsing the web and
playing games but it's not that bright
so it is tough to see under direct
sunlight even at max brightness inside
it's got the newer Snapdragon 626
processor with either three or four
gigabytes of RAM depending on storage
and there is a micro SD card slot if you
need more than what the phone offers
internally the Verizon model is
currently only being offered in the
three gigabyte version and that's the
one I've been using for the past week it
performs well with general everyday
tasks like opening apps browsing the web
and checking emails it does tend to drop
frames from time to time when playing
more graphically intense games it's not
something you'll notice very often
because for the most part the experience
is very smooth and I never found the
occasional drop frame to be much of a
distraction of course software plays a
huge role in the way this phone performs
you'll find Android 7.1.1 nougat on
board but what I love most about
Motorola software is that they keep
everything very close to stock while
only adding in a few software tweaks
that enhance the experience you still
get all Motorola software additions like
the double chop to turn on the
flashlight risk twist to launch the
camera and the ever so useful battery
friendly notifications that fade in and
out with the Moto display if you get
this phone on Verizon you will have to
deal with Verizon's entire suite of
bloatware applications and a few other
pre-installed third-party apps like NFL
Mobile and slacker radio this won't be a
problem on the unlocked model but it
doesn't make a whole lot of sense why
Verizon still insist on bogging down
their phones with
extra bloatware when pretty much all of
it is already being offered by google
for free
another improvement that motorola has
made to this year's e to play is with
the camera they have reduced the number
of megapixels down to 12 in favor of
larger pixels and the camera now has a
much wider F 1.7 aperture this certainly
helps with brighter images in low light
but the camera still has to resort to
the slowest shutter speed possible and
high ISO s that are typically around a
thousand or higher which results in a
lot of noise the camera is slow to
capture in low light especially when
using HDR and without optical image
stabilization don't expect the photos to
have very much sharpness or detail
colors are also very washed out and
highlights are overblown with a lot of
JJ Abrams lens flares photos and good
lighting conditions are certainly better
with better color accuracy and detail
but they still lack sharpness and
properly exposed highlights it's just as
problematic as it is in low-light the
camera is sufficient but the results are
definitely nowhere near as good as what
you would get from a more expensive
flagship the front-facing camera on the
other hand pretty much remains unchanged
from last year it's a 5 megapixel F 2.2
lens with a front-facing flash and the
front-facing flash does a decent job of
illuminating your face without being
overly harsh but it does cause a lot of
the details in the background to get
crushed that you're almost better off
without it
currently the Moto Z to play isn't
exclusive to Verizon and if you buy
between now and July 26 the JBL sound
boost moto mod is included for free if
you're not on Verizon there's an
unlocked version coming later the summer
for $500 that's a $50 increase over last
year's model and that's pretty high
considering this is a mid-range phone at
this price you might be thinking why not
buy the oneplus 5 instead and you
wouldn't be wrong to think that way it's
being offered for roughly the same price
and it's a much more powerful smartphone
so in a lot of ways it is the better
purchase especially if you're looking
purely at just the phones themselves the
real differentiator of course is the
moto mods and that's what it boils down
to it depends on how much you value the
Moto mods and potentially how invested
you already are in the Moto mod
ecosystem if you're coming from a
previous Moto Z that it wouldn't make
sense to switch to another device that
didn't support them another thing to
consider is the fact that the Moto mod
still aren't cheap
and most of the things that the modal
mods do you could find third-party
accessories that are not only cheaper
but also work with all of your devices
there's still nothing out there that's
quite as sleek or unique as the moto
mods but what you're really paying for
here is the convenience factor don't get
me wrong the z2 play is a great
mid-range phone that does a lot of
things well on its own but in order to
truly make it worth your while
you need to invest in more than just the
phone itself as always thank you guys so
