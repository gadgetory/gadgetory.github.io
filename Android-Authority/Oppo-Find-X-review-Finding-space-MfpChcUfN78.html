represents a new era for the company one
where bezels are not part of the
equation before I talk about any of that
performance stuff we need to address the
elephant in the room if ninety 2.25
percent of this face is screen where do
you put the front-facing camera we just
saw vivos for a similar look with the
vivo necks where a small little module
came out of the top of the phone to
reveal the front-facing camera
vivo still kept those rear cameras on
the back of the phone though with the
Oppo find X there are no cameras to be
found in its default state instead Oppo
has employed a mechanical mechanism
which raises out of the top of the phone
to reveal both the front and back
cameras this mechanism has some pretty
solid feedback though it does get a
little loud I would avoid using this in
quiet rooms or when other people are
sleeping the front-facing camera is 25
megapixels and it employs an IR blaster
to scan your face and create a 3d depth
map this is used kind of like face ID to
help unlock your phone and surprisingly
they decided to get rid of the
fingerprint scanner here opposites that
this 3d face unlock mechanism is about
twice as fast as a generic fingerprint
reader so they decided they really
didn't eat it here I was pretty hesitant
to use the face unlock at first because
need to open and close a part of your
phone physically every single time you
unlock it seems a little redundant I'm
also not really a fan of moving parts
but I was actually surprised at how well
this worked it only took about half a
second to raise and close that mechanism
on the device and my phone was just
instantly unlocked I still would have
preferred a fingerprint reader on the
back because I'd rather use that instead
of having to use moving parts every
single time I want to unlock my phone
since we're talking about the cameras
the rear facing camera has actually
performed a lot better than I thought
they would it's not gonna compete with
the pixel 2 in the Walia p20 but it had
a lot of dynamic range this phone does
tend to overexpose images quite a bit
but if you just lower the exposure and
then shoot the photo it can produce some
pretty solid images there's also a
portrait mode on this phone and I was
pretty surprised at how well it worked
now the live view would lead you to
believe that it was going to be really
bad but after you actually take the
and it does all the processing it ends
up looking really good the biggest
downside I found what that moving part
is just how easily it gets dirty just
keeping it your pocket and pulling it
out every now and then leaves a lot of
dirt and lint so you're probably gonna
have to keep a cloth with you if you
want to take photos on the regular oh
and one other thing if you want to use
the rear facing cameras they take a
while to boot up when you actually open
the camera module if you just swipe open
the camera app it will take a few
seconds for you to actually get to the
live view of what you're trying to shoot
and that can be pretty annoying when
you're just trying to take a picture on
the fly now that we're done talking
about those cameras let's take a look at
the rest of the phone the Oppo find X is
a really beautiful device he uses curved
glass on both the back and front of the
phone and I honestly reminded me a lot
of the Samsung Galaxy S 9 the thing that
really stood out to me was just how
symmetrical this phone is yeah the
volume rockers and the power button are
not exactly symmetrically placed but
even the SIM tray was symmetrical with
the bottom firing speakers they've also
switched out the microUSB port with USB
sea which is symmetrical within itself
heck even the Oppo logo is symmetrical
okay so this phone is pretty but how
does it actually perform surprisingly
really well this is a huge step up from
that Oppo r15 Pro that I reviewed a
couple of months ago though color OS
does need some work in my opinion it's
still very iPhone esque and there's no
app drawer but this phone wasn't exactly
designed for the US market with the Oppo
find X these phones are no longer using
mid-range parts to drive them this thing
is running a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 a
gigabytes of RAM and 256 gigabytes of
storage that's pretty much becoming the
new standard for these flagship killer
phones and I'm really excited to see
Oppo stepping up their game the mania
show I found with the performance of
this phone was the poor RAM management
this thing is almost four-and-a-half
gigs just by having a few apps open and
just because you have a lot of RAM
doesn't mean you should manage it badly
it's packing a 3730 milliamp hour cell
and it lasted me a really really long
time about a solid day and a half now
color OS still doesn't report screen on
time and that's still pretty frustrating
but you can expect to get a lot of time
out of
this phone they're still using vogue
fast-charging but they have switched to
USB type-c which I am really really
happy to see here unfortunately this
phone doesn't have wireless charging or
an IP rating which is kind of
disappointing to see especially since
it's an all-glass phone I'm not really
sure how they would put an IP rating in
this phone though because it has a
moving part which physically opens so
I'm hoping they might tackle that in the
next generation that battery is also
powering that six point four two inch
2340 by 1080 display and it looks
beautiful colors are punchy and vibrant
and I'm actually really happy to see how
dim this display can get I'll often sit
up in my bed and read Reddit and Twitter
and I know I probably shouldn't be doing
that but I'm happy to see that this
thing isn't gonna burn my eyes out when
I do the mania show I had with this
display was the palm rejection sometimes
they won't activate commands if your
palm is slightly touching the side of
the curved display and this can cause a
lot of issues when you're using certain
apps a good example is when you're using
the camera to shoot a photo and your
palm is slightly touching the side of
the screen this could cause the shutter
button to not actually activate and that
can be a huge problem when you're trying
to catch a photo on the fly there's also
a little disappointing to see because I
heard that the vivo next has a really
great palm rejection so I hope that Oppo
updates this in a future software update
the Oppo find X is a first generation
product but it doesn't really feel like
one this is honestly a super solid phone
overall but I would really like to see
how that moving mechanism holds up over
time if this is what's necessary to get
a bezel as phone before we get that
front-facing camera under the screen
then I am all for it the Oppo find X
will come in glacier blue and Bordeaux
red like the wine because this is
definitely purple pricing and
availability still hasn't been announced
yet but stay tuned because we will let
you know as soon as we find out what do
you think of the Oppo find X now just a
quick little thing to know here but the
company BBK actually owns Oppo vivo and
oneplus so it kind of seems like they're
a be testing different mechanisms to see
what consumers like for hiding the
cameras
I'm actually pretty interested to know
which mechanism do you like better would
you rather just hide the selfie camera
or do you like hiding both of them to
have nothing on the back of the phone
either let me know in the comment
section below and please stay tuned to
android authority and our socials
