handy the Android authority app guide a
lot of apps made a big splash in 2014
but not all those splashes were good so
let's take a look at the most
controversial applications of 2014 first
up on our list is a duck hunter knockoff
called ass hunter and this was a pretty
messed up game he played as a hunter who
shot naked men and if the naked men
approached you and you didn't shoot them
they had gay sex with you it was
reported that the app description
contains such phrases as play and do not
be gay and you are a hunter and your
mission is to kill gays as much as you
can that should give you a pretty clear
indication on why this game made people
angry
there was a successful Twitter campaign
to have the game flagged for
inappropriate content and eventually it
was rightfully removed from the Google
Play Store
Facebook made the decision this year to
totally remove their messenger and
group's services from the main Facebook
application and force people to use
external applications for each one this
made a lot of people angry and has
widely been considered as a bad move on
top of using extra storage space users
also now have multiple accounts
constantly waking up their devices
causing battery drain and pinging their
data plans ostensibly this was so
Facebook could build more features into
those services but so far the best we've
gotten are similar to what one-night
stands gets which are large gaudy
stickers and regret then when things can
get any worse Facebook did it again with
their new Facebook groups app problem
cast was an application that people
actually liked it allowed people with
amazon prime memberships to stream
content from their Amazon Instant Video
account to their televisions by casting
it through the chromecast and was the
only app that allowed this functionality
Amazon was all like lol nope and then
had the application pulled on top of
that they changed their back-end so the
people who still had copies of the
application could no longer use it it
was a great app that met a sudden end
and is a sterling example of what
happens when a powerhouse like Amazon
wants your app dead secret is another
anonymous platform where people can post
secrets about themselves and other
people and you can see where this is
going things have gone so far with
secret that has been banned in Israel
because people are using it for
cyberbullying and also in Brazil for
similar reasons it's also been used to
post faulty secrets such as fake device
leaks and other fallacious content like
yak yak secret is still available in the
Google Play Store sketch factor is
actually a really good idea for an
application the premise was to alert
people as to what parts of various
cities are dangerous
weird or shady and which part should be
avoided unfortunately the application is
crowd-sourced instead of fact sourced
and that has led to some problems on top
of users not generally taking the
platform seriously there have been
widespread accusations that people who
post on the application are totally
racist and some have even said that the
app is for white people trying to avoid
black neighborhoods the creators swear
up and down that neither of these things
are true unfortunately for them the
internet does exist in its current form
and many parts of it have dubbed their
application racist it is still available
in the Google Play Store if you want to
see it for yourself
the guinea pix is an application that
takes your selfies and edits them to
make you look like you've lost weight
the options are pretty simple you can
have the application subtract five ten
and fifteen pounds and result is a
selfie that makes you look thinner it's
promoted as an application to help you
feel better about your looks but it's
been pointed out several times that you
can't possibly feel good about your
looks if you feel the need to alter them
it also doesn't help that the algorithms
are pretty bad and make healthy-looking
people look gaunt tired and starving to
death whether it's making skinny people
look dead or making chubby people feel
bad that their chubby this application
seems to strike out on almost every
demographic oh and don't forget that you
have to pay for it also if you want to
check it out for yourself it's in the
Google Play Store it's true that uber
wasn't released this year but it's
driven enough controversy to earn a spot
on this list ok so where do I begin with
this one the app has been banned in
Nevada and his spark talks about banning
it in other cities there has also been a
back-and-forth smear campaign between
uber and lyft it's lasted all year then
the CEO decided to spend 1 million
dollars to dig up dirt on shady
journalists who blast uber in the media
and even got an endorsement for the
behavior from Ashton Kutcher who is most
notably not a journalist than to top it
all off their controversial search
charging has plummeted ubers Better
Business Bureau rating to an F it's been
a really rough year for uber flourish
shield made headlines earlier this year
when it took the coveted top spot as the
number one new paid application in the
Google Play Store the feat was
impressive especially considering that
the application does absolutely nothing
if you did download the application you
would have been treated to two screens
there was one with an X on it and
another one with a check mark and you
could go from one to the other by
tapping on the screen unfortunately the
wheels were spinning but no one was
behind the wheel and the app did nothing
else other than changed graphics the
developers stated that the release was
accidental
but the damage had been done in any case
the app is no longer available in the
Google Play Store and a lot of people
got refunds young jack is a little-known
application that's already causing some
serious problems the application itself
is an anonymous and local message board
that is kind of like a small-time secret
the idea was that people would share
community news tell jokes and have fun
with other people in their general
location unfortunately we are humans and
not all of us are good people
thus the service began being used as a
cyber bullying and rumor mill platform
it's been called a dangerous application
by at least one psychiatrist and a
couple of Philadelphia students even use
the application to announce a school
shooting while another used it to post a
bomb threat despite the issues the
application does remain available in the
Google Play Store if you want in you
isn't really controversial but it is a
curious case the premise that the
application is ridiculously simple it's
a messaging platform that says only one
word and that word is yo the idea is for
users to assign meaning to the word and
then when they receive a message they
know that something happened for
instance a sports team PR may send out a
yo whenever their team scores Motorolla
even used it recently to host a contest
the thing most don't understand is why
this application is so popular and why
so many investors have dumped money into
it yo was developed in one day and it's
already earned tens of millions of
dollars in financing oh and let's not
forget the huge security problem that I
had when it first started out it's an
anomaly and it's really interesting once
again i'm joe hindi the android
authority app guy we're here why not
