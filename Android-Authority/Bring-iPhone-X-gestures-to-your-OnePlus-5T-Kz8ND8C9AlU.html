been taking advantage of the 1 plus 5t
beta program the latest Oreo beta brings
about some pretty interesting changes
let's take a look so the first thing
you're gonna notice with this latest
beta release is that it removes the
clipboard feature that was introduced in
the previous beta long story short the
clipboard app didn't really work all
that well so the best solution was for
oneplus to just remove it all together
and revert back to the standard Android
copy and paste functionality the biggest
and most notable change to this beta is
the new navigation gestures that are
very similar to the iPhone 10 this
feature can be enabled by going to
settings buttons and hiding the
navigation bar once you have it enabled
swiping up from the middle takes you
home and swiping up and pausing for
about a second will open up your recent
apps if you want to go back you can
swipe up from the left or right side of
the bottom edge and these can be used
interchangeably this beta update is also
available for the 1 plus 5 but as it
stands right now you won't get the same
iPhone 10's gesture controls if you want
to check out this beta update for
yourself head on over to our written
article where you can read all about it
and download it for your oneplus 5 or 5
T but what do you guys think about this
new Oreo beta update and the gesture
controls would you favor this over the
default Android navigation keys let us
