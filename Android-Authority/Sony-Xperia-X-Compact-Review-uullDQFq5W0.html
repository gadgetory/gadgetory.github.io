lookout for smaller Android phones the
sony compact series has always been a
pretty good way to go and to this day
it's probably still your best option if
you want a phone with a small form
factor but even though it was announced
alongside the Xperia XZ this is actually
a smaller version of the Xperia X and
not the XZ and unlike previous compact
smartphones this isn't exactly a
flagship in a smaller body it's built
entirely out of plastic which doesn't
feel anywhere near as nice as glass or
metal but the X compact is surprisingly
sturdy it doesn't creak or rattle so
there's no issues at all here with the
build quality but it has a super high
glossy finish which is supposed to make
it look more like ceramic and it does
look pretty clean but like all phones
with a glossy finish the X compact
attracts fingerprints like crazy the top
and bottom of the phone are perfectly
flat which means it can stand up on its
own and there's clear frosted color
matched inserts that flow really well
with the rest of the design the X
compact also has what sony calls a loop
design which is just a fancy way of
saying the sides have these slight
tapers that make the transition between
the plastic and glass a lot more
seamless and also makes the phone feel a
lot more comfortable in the hand but it
still has that signature Sony
rectangular shape the best part about
the X compact is that it's really easy
to use in one hand and that's sort of
the whole point behind having a compact
phone and with so many large screen
Android phones out there these days it's
really refreshing to go back to a phone
that's smaller and has a screen that can
easily be reached with just your thumb
from both top to bottom and left to
right without having to do any crazy
hand maneuvers in order to do it going
around the device you have the headphone
jack up top USB type-c port on the
bottom a SIM card slot that also doubles
as a micro SD card slot on the left and
finally on the right side you have the
power button volume rocker and the
dedicated camera shortcut key that you
typically find on Sony phones the
dedicated camera shortcut key is super
convenient because it works as a
physical shutter and it's also a fast
and direct way to get right into the
camera
but having three buttons on one side
makes it feel a tad bit cluttered and
the volume rocker sits way too far down
the right side that it feels very
uncomfortable
to try and press with your thumb the
position of the volume rocker makes a
whole lot of sense when using it to
control digital zoom on the camera but
for controlling volume it's not in the
most optimal position the X compact does
have a fingerprint sensor embedded in
the power button but unfortunately this
feature again is not available on the US
version for reasons that we'll never
know and if water and dust resistance is
important to you you're not getting that
on the X compact either the screen is a
four point six inch IPS LCD with a
resolution of 720p which doesn't sound
very mind-blowing but 720p works
perfectly fine on this smaller display
it's sharp enough that I didn't have any
issues with reading text and the screen
itself is generally pretty good despite
how it may sound on paper it's got
really nice color and saturation good
viewing angles and it's surprisingly
very bright making it easily viewable
outdoors in direct sunlight I didn't
find typing on the smaller screen to be
much of an issue either but if you're
big on watching YouTube Netflix or
playing a lot of mobile games it's
definitely not as enjoyable of an
experience
it feels very cramped but if you only
play games or watch YouTube occasionally
on your smartphone that is not going to
be that much of a deal-breaker above and
below the display you have two tiny
slits for the dual front-facing stereo
speakers and I found the overall volume
to be a little on the quiet side for
front-facing speakers but the sound
coming out of them is actually quite
good it's clean and doesn't get
distorted at all but you'll get a much
better audio experience by plugging in a
pair of headphones the X compact has
built-in support for high res audio like
flak but if you don't have any high res
audio files the X compact can also
upscale any compressed music files to
give it more of a high res sound even
though it's not packing top-tier specs
performance hasn't been an issue on this
device it's been very responsive and
fast and regular everyday use and it
even runs high in games
extremely well the load times are a
little bit longer with some games but
once the game loads up it runs very
smoothly and rarely ever drops a frame
the Snapdragon 650 and three gigabytes
of RAM may sound a little underwhelming
but it works really well for the X
compact and since it's only powering a
720p display the processor isn't having
to work as hard to push all those pixels
the software experience also helps out a
lot with the performance of this phone
it's running Android 6.0 marshmallow
with Sony's custom skin on top but I
hesitate to even call it a skin anymore
because a lot of the experience is just
stock Android they've really scaled back
a lot of their customizations and
they've even gone as far as adding the
Google now home screen into their own
launcher to make the experience feel
closer to stock it does however come
with a lot of pre-installed bloatware
from Sony's own apps to a few
third-party ones but a lot of these can
easily be disabled to get them out of
the way and aside from that Sony's done
a fantastic job with keeping the
experience clean and simple considering
the size of this phone battery life has
also been surprisingly good it's got a
twenty-seven hundred amp hour battery
inside which isn't huge but it's more
than good enough to get the X compact to
last me comfortably through an entire
day but I wouldn't expect much more than
that again having that 720p display
really helps out a lot here and even
with my somewhat heavy usage of gaming
for a couple hours a day watching
YouTube and the usual email and social
media I rarely ever found myself
plugging in during the middle of a day
if you do need to plug in during the day
the phone does support quick charge 3.0
but the wall plug that it comes with
does not so you have to supply your own
the phone shouldn't take that long to
charge anyway since it doesn't have a
massive battery but it doesn't make a
whole lot of sense why Sony chose not to
include a quick charge compatible wall
plug with their phones
Sony is also making a pretty big deal
about the camera on the X compact the
front camera is a fairly standard 5
megapixel camera that's also wide-angle
so it works perfectly for selfies but
the rear camera is a 23 megapixel sensor
and it's the same sensor that's only
higher-end Xperia XZ to improve their
camera they've added a new laser
autofocus system to help with sensing
distance and taking better photos in low
light and there's a new color sensor to
help you get much better white balance
the real kicker here is that the X
compact has 5 Access image stabilization
for both the front and rear cameras when
recording video but there's no physical
hardware inside to make the
stabilization half in all of Sony's
camera stabilization is purely software
based and before you get too excited the
5 axis stabilization only kicks in when
you're recording a macro shot so unless
you see macro show up in the corner of
the viewfinder you're only getting 3
axis stabilization even then the 3 axis
stabilization works really well to keep
the footage stable without any
noticeable warp
or distortion but it's really strange
that Sony hyped up this feature and it
only works in a very limited situation
the camera app is the usual camera app
that we've come to expect from Sony it
doesn't look like it's changed all that
much from other Sony phones if at all
you can swipe up or down on the screen
to switch between the different modes
like superior Auto manual video
recording and the variety of camera
effects that Sony always includes with
their camera it isn't the most intuitive
camera app and HDR is still only
available when shooting in manual but
overall the camera experience is fairly
straightforward the camera is really
quick to launch and snap photos and the
photos that it takes are well above
average they're incredibly sharp and
well detailed and there's a good amount
of color and saturation but they
definitely have a much more natural look
to them versus the oversaturated look
that you might get from some other
phones the camera also has a predictive
hybrid autofocus feature that can
continuously track moving subjects and
capture them without motion blur and as
long as the subject isn't moving at a
ridiculously fast speed it tends to work
pretty well in low-light there's still a
fair amount of detail and the images
come out relatively noise-free
but the camera can be really slow to
capture in low-light situations and if
you aren't holding the phone perfectly
steady you'll wind up getting a lot of
blurry shots the big elephant in the
room with the xperia x compact is the
price it's going for $500 unlocked in
the US which is really steep for what is
basically a mid-range phone and it puts
this phone in a pretty awkward position
there's a lot of other options out there
that arguably offer a lot more value for
the same price or less you have phones
like the Nexus 6p that's still a really
solid phone despite being almost a year
old at this point and if you want
something even less expensive phones
like a one plus three axon 7 and the
honor eight are all really great options
the Xperia x compact is a great phone
and if you choose to buy one you won't
be disappointed but without a
fingerprint sensor at least on the US
version or any water resistance
capabilities the $500 price tag is even
harder to swallow if you're looking for
the best value for your money
this phone is the one to get but if you
want a small compact phone that doesn't
have a whole lot of compromises then you
might find this phone to be worth every
penny as always thank you guys so much
