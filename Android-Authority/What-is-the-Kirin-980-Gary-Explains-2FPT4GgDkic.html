Kiran 980 and it's their new processor
that's gonna find its way into the
huawei mate 20 which is going to be
announced in October hello my name is
Gary Sims and this is Android Authority
now if you're wondering about the
keyring 980 what does it all mean then
please let me explain
first of all I want to say great that
you could join me for this video today
so we're looking at the architecture of
the keyring 980 as well as some aspects
of its performance so let's just jump
straight into it and when we look at the
CPU side of this processor we see that
while we have gone with the Quartus a 76
and the cortex a 55 and that's important
for two reasons
first of all compared to the previous
generation the ki-rin 970 which used the
cortex a 73 while we have made a
generational leap they've left over the
court it's a 75 and gone straight with
the cortex a 76 that means that when you
compare the performance of the 980
compared to the 970 you're gonna see big
CPU performance gains secondly it means
that now that while they are using
dynamic which is a new way of organizing
the CPU cores inside of the SOC so that
you can have up to eight processor cores
in the same cluster now I have whole
videos on the court it's a 76 and
another video on dynamic and you'll find
links to those in the description below
a tradition when we talk about
heterogeneous multi-processing we talk
about for high-performance cores and for
energy efficient core so previously you
might have had that say the court is a
seventy three four of those and then the
cortex a53 four of those but now with
the curie 980 things are slightly
different yes there are four quarters a
seventy six cores and there are four
quarters a fifty five calls but actually
they're configured in a two plus two
plus fork setup that's because the first
two quarters a sublease it's cause have
a max clock speed of 2.6 gigahertz then
the next two quarters eight empty seats
cause have a max speed of 1.9 two
gigahertz and then finally you get the
forecourt it's a 55 calls and they're
clocked at 1.8 gigahertz what this
allows whywe to do is to give good
single thread performance because one of
those faster clock caught it's a 76
calls will be used and then when it gets
into a very multi-threaded situation
you've got four quarters a seventy six
calls and then of course a total of
eight calls including those courses a
fifty five calls so that should make the
overall performance both single
threading and multi-threaded
significantly higher in the ki-rin 980
they just talked a bit about the
manufacturing of this this is a seven
enemy2 process at the latest newest node
that is available from TSMC and while we
are proud they are one of the first to
be on seven nanometer and it's actually
got six point nine billion transistors
in it and that's up from the five point
five billion transistors that you find
in the keyring 970 they should talk GPU
for a moment the keyring 980 has got the
mali g76 with ten cores inside of it and
it will offer a 46% performance increase
compared to the keyring 970 which had
been mali g72 inside of it so we're
looking again for a significant cpu
increases and significant GPU increases
some of the things worth mentioning now
is that the 980 has got to NPU units the
NP units that we found first of all in
the queue in 970 has now been doubled up
in the keyring 980 and it should have a
hundred and twenty percent performance
of the Kon 970 when it comes to in pu
processing and again i've got a whole
video about NP use and how they work in
the 970 and it's basically the same
story in the 980 and you can find links
to that in the description below it's
also worth noting that the 980 uses a
higher clock speed lpddr4 memory which
should give you about a 14% increase in
overall memory bandwidth as I mentioned
earlier this new CPU uses dynamic which
means now for the first time we have a
processor from Huawei that has level 3
cache and compared to for example the
Snapdragon 845 which had 2 megabytes of
level 3 cache while we have opted for 4
megabytes of level 3 cache in the 980
again that will have a significant
improvement on the overall performance
of this processor as you expect the
process has all the other things you
would need inside of it including a new
and improved evening signal processor
and new and improved LTE modems this
time cat 21 and cat 18 so let's just
talk performance for a moment the
figures that while we're quoting and we
can only go by what while we're quoting
at the moment is that in the single
thread score for Geekbench the ki-rin
980 will get a score 3 3 6 over 3000 360
which is 37% greater than the current
single thread score of the Snapdragon
845 and when it comes to GPU gains of
course again Huawei are quoting big
improvement and they're saying the GPU
in the 980 is faster than the GPU in the
Snapdragon 845 but there are two quick
caveats for that one is that that needs
to have the GPU boost technology enabled
and that something has to be built into
the game itself it's not something you
get automatically the game has to
support that technology to get that
extra framerate and secondly there are
accusations that while we have been
cheating a little when it comes to
benchmarks to kind of bump up the
performance when it sees a benchmark
running so really we have to wait until
we get the mate 20 in our hands to see
what the real benchmark figures are and
the context of all of this of course is
that when it comes to the Android
ecosystem they are comparing it to the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 and we know that
probability Qualcomm will have a new
chip that they're going to announce
sometime in December for new handsets
that can appear in 2019 but of course
the point is that now you can actually
get the mate 20 in 2018
with this processor with the court it's
a 76 with the latest mali processor ok
so there you have it the new Kirin 980
the latest calls from arm the latest
GPUs faster memory better NPU new
improved image signal processor so it
looks like a really good package so my
name's Gary Sims and this is Andrew

okay that's it
I'll see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
