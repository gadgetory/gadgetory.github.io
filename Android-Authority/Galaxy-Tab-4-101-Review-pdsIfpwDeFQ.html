Android Authority and it's the biggest
of the bunch but is it really any better
let's take a look at the Samsung Galaxy
Tab 4 10.1
all right so here it is the Samsung
Galaxy Tab for 10.1 the biggest of the
tab for bunch and it shares the same
design language that we've become pretty
familiar with with Samsung devices it's
entirely made of plastic with a fake
leather texture on the back and while it
does a great job of not attracting
fingerprints it doesn't do anything in
terms of providing extra grip but you'll
most likely be holding on to this tablet
with both hands anyways so it shouldn't
really be too big of a problem wrapping
around the bezels of the display is
Samsung's signature chrome accents and
like I mentioned before I'm not a fan of
it but it's not so bad on the tab for
lineup as they've slimmed them down
quite a bit from what we've seen on
previous Samsung devices the tablet
itself though does feel very well made
so build quality is an issue and it's
very thin coming in at 8 millimeters and
also very lightweight making it
comfortable to hold for long periods of
time on the front above the display is a
1.3 megapixel front-facing camera and
following along the bottom is Samsung's
standard home button with capacitive
recent apps and back buttons and just
like this 7 and 8 inch models they
aren't backlit making them hard to find
when using this tablet in the dark the
majority of the buttons and ports can be
found on top when holding the tablet in
landscape with the power button followed
by the volume rockers a micro SD card
slot with support up to 64 gigs if the
16 gigs onboard isn't enough for you and
an IR blaster for controlling your TV
through Samsung's built-in watchon app
on the bottom is your microUSB port and
on the right side above one of the two
speakers is your 3.5 millimeter headset
jack and speaking of the speaker's it's
a dual speaker setup that can be found
on the left and right sides which is a
big improvement over the tiny speaker on
the seven and eight inch models that can
easily be covered up by a single finger
they still don't compare to having
front-facing speakers but placement on
the sides means you can have the tablet
resting on a table without having to
worry about muffling the sound and
they're placed in such a way that you'll
never have to worry about blocking them
with your hands whether you're holding a
tablet in landscape or in portrait the
sound quality is actually pretty good
too with great clarity even at Mac
volume
the 10.1 inch display on the front while
not the most high-resolution or pixel
dense that we've seen on a tablet or any
mobile device in general it's not really
all that bad
I will admit pixels definitely are
noticeable if you look close enough but
being that it's a 10.1 inch display
you're probably going to be holding this
a little farther from your face than a 7
or 8 inch tablet and it's got very
bright and vivid colors with great
viewing angles like most Samsung panels
tend to so it's actually very enjoyable
and I had quite a fun time playing games
and watching movies on it as with pretty
much all 10-inch tablets the bigger
display does mean you're not going to be
able to hold it in one hand and carry it
around like you would a 7 or 8 inch
tablet and it's not going to fit in your
back pocket obviously but you can still
easily fit it in a book bag and carry it
around that way but so it's not quite as
portable as a smaller tablet but that's
sort of the trade-off when you decide to
go with a tablet with a bigger display
it's a mid-range tablet so the specs
powering this guy aren't going to blow
you away either with this 1.2 gigahertz
processor and 1.5 gigabytes of RAM but
the general performance through day to
day usage has been smooth with very
little hiccups whether it's scrolling
through home screens or opening up apps
and multitasking wasn't an issue either
web browsing performance could be a
little bit better though at least on
Google Chrome we're pinching and zooming
or scrolling tended to be a little bit
jerky Gaming is good though as I was
able to play all of my favorite games
without any noticeable lag or drop
frames around back is the same 3
megapixel fixed-focus camera that
getting found across the entire tab for
lineup it wasn't any good on the 7-inch
model and it wasn't any good on the 8
inch model and it's not any better on
the 10.1 most likely the camera on your
phone takes better photos and you're not
going to look as silly as you would
taking photos with a 10-inch tablet but
if you absolutely must have to it's a
good secondary option it performs best
when outdoors or anywhere with a lot of
light but with 3 megapixels photos
completely fall apart if you try to zoom
and crop and the second you take this
camera indoors photos become grainy
quick especially in low light
keeping this 10 inch tablet powered is a
pretty large 68
our battery and like I mentioned before
I'm a pretty heavy user when it comes to
tablets I primarily only use them for
gaming and watching YouTube videos and
movies things like that but even with my
usage I managed to get a couple of days
out of it with about eight and a half
hours of screen on time which is pretty
impressive I thought it was pretty
impressive anyway so it lasted me quite
a long time and I think with pretty
regular usage you could probably get at
least three to four days out of this
tablet before having to recharge on the
software side of things it is running
the latest version of Android with 4.4.2
KitKat and Samsung's TouchWiz on top and
I'm not the biggest fan of TouchWiz I
don't really like the way that it looks
and I don't care too much for a lot of
Samsung's features but it's certainly an
improvement over previous versions and
the version of TouchWiz on the tab for
line of tablets is a little bit lighter
in comparison to something you'd find on
the galaxy s5 or Samsung's own pro
series of tablets so there's no my
magazine or magazine UX whatever you
want to call it air gestures and fewer
toggles built into the notification
shade but all the staple features of
TouchWiz that have been around for a
while now are still here like multi
window for true multitasking palm swipe
for taking a screenshot which is very
useful especially on a ten inch display
and smart stay which keeps the display
lit for as long as you are looking at it
the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1 is
available now for $350 it's Wi-Fi only
as of right now but there will be 3G and
LTE models coming to carriers later this
year if you need that extra connectivity
and whether or not this tablet is worth
it that's purely going to be up to you
to decide as there's not a whole lot of
options to consider right now in terms
of this particular price range there's
the Sony Xperia z2 tablet but that's a
couple extra hundred dollars and then
there's the Nexus 10 which is around the
same price but it's technically not for
sale I'm pretty sure if you dig deep
enough you could probably find it but
it's technically not available anymore
so there's not a whole lot of options to
consider but if you do decide to get
this tablet it certainly isn't a bad
option whatsoever but that is it for the
Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1
it's a decent tablet with a decent
display solid build quality dual
speakers and pretty awesome battery life
it doesn't have the latest on the
greatest specs but it wasn't really
meant to and I think if you're to go out
there and pick one up for yourself you
might like it as I found it to be the
most enjoyable one of the bunch but that
is pretty much it for this video
