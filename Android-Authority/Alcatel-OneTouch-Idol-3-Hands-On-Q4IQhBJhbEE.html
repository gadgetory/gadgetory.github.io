Android authority and we are hanging out
with Alcatel
at Mobile World Congress 2015 taking a
look at some of the latest devices this
is the idol 3 and it comes in a 4.7 inch
model and a 5.5 inch model and the 4.7
inch model here is basically the same
phone but with a slightly low resolution
display and a smaller battery but we're
going to focus on the 5.5 inch model
here and starting with the design it's a
very simple very simplistic design it's
entirely made of plastic but it feels
really nice in the hand so also very
lightweight and overall it looks pretty
good and it is running on Android
lollipop so you do get the latest
version of Android here with Alcatel
slight customizations on top as well but
for the most part you still get a lot of
these stock elements like the recent
apps and the notification shade but
Alcatel has added a few standout
features like if you swipe over to the
leftmost screen here you get the
OneTouch stream so you get access to
things like the weather various news
articles your calendar and things of
that nature one really cool feature that
you will find on the idol 3 is this mix
application here which takes advantage
of the dual front-facing speakers that
you can see on the top and bottom and
with this particular application it's
actually pretty cool you can mix tracks
and basically sort of become a makeshift
DJ if you will so I'll go ahead and play
a track here really quick and the
speakers are actually quite loud too so
let me go ahead and just play something
here
and I can mix these tracks back and
forth if I want and just kind of play
around a bit which is really cool but
that's essentially how that works you
can add various effects and do cross
fades a bunch of different things that
you can normally do with a virtual
turntable so it's really cool you can
just kind of become your own little
makeshift DJ so this app is really neat
and also really fun to play with and
again the speakers are really nice
really loud
also they deliver a very high quality
sound and all in all this is a really
compelling package as far as pricing and
availability goes you're looking at less
than $200 for the four point seven inch
model and less than $250 for the 5.5
inch model availability will be sometime
in q2 but this has been a quick look of
the idol three four point seven inch and
5.5 inch stay tuned for the rest of our
coverage here at Mobile World Congress
