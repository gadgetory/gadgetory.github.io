further skipping number six and going
straight to seven in their new device in
the note line but we do know that
Samsung has made it clear that this is
so they could have uniformity across the
galaxy line but still we have to ponder
whether the leap from five to seven is
one that is truly justified and that's
exactly what we're doing here because
it's Joshua freghar from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is our full review of the samsung
galaxy note 7
yes you get a curved display here on the
galaxy note 7 and it's going to be the
only version of the phone that will be
available so at its core they're
basically no surprises with the way the
no7 looks you have the same large
display with the home tactile button up
front right below the display and all of
the different ports that are still on
the bottom there is one obvious change
here however as the note 7 has made the
move to USB type-c but next to it is the
bottom mounted speaker and the headphone
jack which thankfully is still sticking
around above the display is the
front-facing camera but now the other
addition is the iris scanner which is
essentially a dedicated secondary camera
made for scanning your eyes and of
course there's the little buddy that
always comes with the note and pretty
much defines the line and that would be
the S Pen and no the S Pen does not go
backwards into the phone anymore because
the clicky top up here is just wide
enough to keep it from going any more
than just that much there have been some
refinements made to the S Pen itself a
thinner tip means more precision and the
length of the pen is now as much as a
regular ballpoint pen but when you're
actually using the S Pen it doesn't feel
that much different from the one that
was from the note 5 and that might
actually be a good thing because we
already liked the experience from before
but speaking of refinements we already
talked about the curved display and we
already know that the curved display can
help with handling but we also learned
in the note 5 that a curved backing can
also do the exact same thing in the note
7 you get both and there was actually
only one way for the Samsung designers
to really describe it to us symmetry now
by making the backing curved on the note
5 it made a somewhat bulkier device more
comfortable in the hand but by making
the display also curved it not only
makes for a very symmetrical phone but
it also makes the entire device that
much more narrow and the result is
something I've been waiting for for a
while a big phone that's actually really
comfortable to use and for a larger
device that actually has very accessible
handling the entire package undergoes
one more change and that's IP
certification at the very least however
the vast majority of users will
appreciate that this phone will still
work even if it gets wet now Samsung
hasn't really lipped forward much in the
mode 7 in the
of different aspects and that starts
with the display you still get the Super
AMOLED five-point inch screen that comes
in a quad HD resolution for that high
pixel density and the high quality that
you would expect from a high-end Samsung
product the Super AMOLED display
generally does mean that the colors will
be somewhat saturated maybe
oversaturated but this can be changed in
the settings among a number of different
modes now even though this is a quad HD
display you can actually output less
than quad HD resolution on it this is in
the interest of power saving and you can
go into the device maintenance area in
the settings to find it you can actually
make this display output regular HD at
720p and you can actually tell the
difference if you go between the two
modes now a big deal from the galaxy s7
now makes it to the note line and that's
the always-on display essentially you
get a small area on the display where
you can show a number of different
clocks a few different calendars and
some images that are canned and or
predetermined but from there you get a
little bit of customization on the note
sevens version of it mainly because in
the clock area and or many of them you
can actually create a block of text that
will always show up along with the clock
and notification icons so you know what
you're going to be getting when you
unlock the device that little bit of
customization is always nice to have and
I personally really applaud Samsung for
putting into this phone and as you can
see I've already made full use of it now
considering that the note now has a
curved display of course that means that
the edge UX makes an appearance here but
for the most part it doesn't have
anything different than the iteration
that was found in the galaxy s7 edge
it's not particularly useful unless you
go through the effort to use it so for
the most part it stays out of the way
and of course this is all on top of what
is already a pretty great experience
that we've had in previous devices we
had a ton of fun on this phone
especially with games like Mobius Final
Fantasy and videos across YouTube users
familiar with the galaxy s7 and the s7
edge are pretty much going to know what
to expect here the Snapdragon 820 is the
version we have now with the audrina 530
and 4 gigabytes of RAM there is an
accelerate even but it will not be
coming to the States now 4 gigabytes is
enough for a lot of phones out
there especially when you take into
consideration their core experiences but
we're talking about the note here you
already have multi window and pop-up
view for multitasking and then you put
on top of all of that the s-pen there
are so many capabilities on this phone
that may be a little bit more RAM would
have kept it feeling incredibly crisp
all the time now granted we didn't
really find these problems to be very
abundant they only really happened once
in a while but even then that little
inch that Samsung could have given could
have felt like a mile in the RAM
Department despite the lack of higher
ram capacities Samsung actually did
pretty well to appeal to power users
when it came to onboard storage you now
get 64 gigabytes of on-board storage and
that is the deal you don't get any other
versions of 32 or 128 you simply get 64
which is already pretty great add on top
of that a micro SD card slot in which
we've already put a 256 gigabyte microSD
card and you have all of the storage
you'll need for pretty much anything now
calls on the note 7 actually sounded
perfectly fine there were no complaints
on either end of the call nor were there
any drops but we can't really be as
optimistic about the onboard speaker now
the sound experience from here is simply
singular it just doesn't really provide
any richness or even any real volume
when compared some plenty of other
flagships that we've seen this year and
of course it's a bottom mounted speaker
so it already has that disadvantage
luckily however the experience on the
headphone jack that is over next to it
has actually been kind of above average
there's no DAC in the note 7 which means
you're not going to be getting HTC 10
levels of sound as a matter of fact it
falls pretty much just short of that but
sound actually sounds really good out of
here especially when you consider that
you can cater the sound to your liking
sound alive is available here and you
might remember it from some previous
Samsung devices and it can let you go
from base to treble in terms of emphasis
or it can emphasize the instrumentals or
the vocals from there you can actually
adapt the sound based upon a bunch of
beeps that you hear through your
headphone so we can take the sound and
enhance it properly depending on what
headphones you have but from there
there's one thing missing from the audio
experience and that's a dedicated amp
without an amp the sound you get from
headphones like these audio Technica's
around my neck could be a little bit
quieter than we would like battery life
on the note 7 has been a major focus
into that end they have put in a 3,500
milliamp hour unit in this phone one
short test from our own Android
authority battery testing app used a
mixture of gameplay web browsing and
video playback while on Wi-Fi and
predicted that the screen on time could
be about 6 hours in order to test that I
actually did that myself
I put YouTube on here and binge a bunch
of episodes across YouTube for what felt
like a really long time and when I took
a look at the battery stats it certainly
was I played some games at the tail end
of it but overall the screen on time was
over 6 hours but what that basically
means is that with the note you'll get a
normal day with 4 to 5 hours of screen
on time especially if you have pretty
much moderate usage but of course if you
need to charge the phone in a hurry you
have fast charging in order to do that
an adapter that is included in the box
will help make the transition a little
bit easier as micro USB cords can be
adapted to fit the samsung galaxy note 7
you just have to remember to use the
included charging brick and then you
will get fast charging no matter what
now it still lives up to its claims it
gets half an hour to get half power
inside of this phone the same as it was
with the galaxy s7 and but there's also
fast wireless charging involved here but
even then fast wireless charging still
takes quite a while and it just pales in
comparison to fast wired charging so we
tend to stick with that so finally we
can talk about the iris scanner this is
where we'll talk about Samsung's new
biometric scanner and it's also a way
for us to segue into the camera
essentially it's a new camera module
that's right next to the front-facing
camera and it does an infrared scan of
irises or eyes the composition of one's
eyes the setup is pretty simple you
basically have to keep your glasses off
and then scan your eyes and once it gets
a snapshot of your eyes then it
registers it and looks for that whenever
you trigger the iris scanner honestly
once you get the hang of it the iris
scanner is incredibly fast almost
surprisingly so when you have the phone
locked you just have to wake it swipe
and have the phone a regular distance
muscle-memory will tell you how far the
phone should be after you get used to it
now as you're looking into the camera at
the top it just unlocks right away
you don't even have to look at the
viewfinder that comes up in order to
tell you where to put your eyes once
you're used to doing it now I've gotten
a lot of reactions while using the iris
scanner already but my favorite one has
been from a friend who told me that she
thought I hated my phone the reason why
is because it looked like I was giving
it the evil eye that wasn't really the
case I just wanted to be sure that my
eyes were wide open so the iris scanner
would work flawlessly and in the camera
Department Samsung seems to be confident
enough and what they did in the galaxy
s7 to really make it a repeat so the
same 12 megapixel F 1.7 dual pixel
shooter of the note 7 is the same as it
was before in the galaxy s7 if there are
any real improvements it's in the camera
app the camera app has simply just been
a little bit streamlined so that's
easier to use in one hand for the most
part you just have to swipe up and down
to change which camera you're using and
then swipe left and right to access the
different modes and also the different
filters so for the most part anyone
familiar with the galaxy s7 and its
top-notch camera quality will know what
to expect here it's still capable of
some of the better batches of photos in
really good lighting and even in
low-light situations it might still have
its quirks but it still provides some
pretty nice-looking photos
details are captured quite well with
only some softness showing up when you
actually zoom into the photos small text
is still legible though so that means
that the sharpness is still pretty good
and self-portraits are not the super
high quality that some people might be
expecting especially in indoor
situations but we can still give some
credit to the F 1.7 aperture lens for
trying to do what it can in low-light
the main camera has quite a few tools
like the f 1.7 aperture optical image
stabilization and of course the larger
pixels the dual pixels that are used for
capturing more light and in low-light
the color temperature tends to get
pretty warm still now this isn't a huge
problem but something that we noticed
and you might need to have a steady hand
because the slower shutter speeds
require it and if you don't really have
a steady hand you'll get a somewhat
blurry picture but in times when
everything falls into place the pictures
can still look really nice even in these
low-light situations and we were able to
get some pretty nice photos of some food
while at some restaurants late at night
essentially it's going to be the same
one that you saw in the galaxy s7
and for the most part that's not really
a bad thing the software experience for
no device always centers around the
s-pen and that's still the case with the
note 7 but there have been some
refinements to the general Samsung UI
Samsung's way of presenting Android
overall the user interface has been
given some unified colors to make
everything feel more coherent with only
the main elements providing some of the
color the secure folder might be one of
Samsung's best security features yet
essentially it's a folder where you can
put applications files and content and
then on top of it or all of the same
layers that you would use to unlock the
device but what's awesome is that you
can put apps into here and they act like
brand-new installed applications for
example Instagram is installed into the
secure folder and I still have to log
into it so I can put completely
different accounts onto any of the apps
that I put into that folder but of
course the crux of the note 7 is the S
Pen and there is a mixture of
streamlining and adding upon the formula
to make this iteration probably the most
practical one yet smart select got
probably the biggest and perhaps
trendiest edition of them all
essentially the animation select allows
you to record a 15-second gif of
whatever is happening on the screen that
you can then easily send save or share
with other people honestly you can
capture pretty much anything any video
on YouTube or even on Instagram can be
used in order to capture that and the
video that I used came from Instagram
the other additions to the s-pen
software family are not quite as deep
but are found easily in the air command
menu we start off with magnify which
provides a small square to magnify parts
of the screen up to 300% which can be
useful if you actually need to get a
closer look at something now glance is
an interesting one that shrinks any app
to a small square that snaps to any
corner of the screen and then you hover
the tip of the S Pen over that square to
make it blow up again it could be nice
to use if you want just quick glances or
updates as to things that have changed
in that app but other than that the use
case scenarios seem a little bit then
and then finally there's translate the
feature that we really want to see
evolve translate essentially allows the
hovering of the s-pen to translate
single words from one language to
another and there's a myriad of
languages that you can use here now
we do want to eventually translate full
phrases or even full sentences or full
blocks of text but for now if you have a
word that is on a website or an online
menu for example that you need to have
the definition of you can just hover the
pen over that word and you'll get your
translation the only other main addition
comes in the screen off memo essentially
while the screen is off you can take out
the s-pen and you're given a blank black
canvas in order to write any memo or
anything down and what you can do now is
pin this screen off memo to the
always-on display so it's always
available so that if you have a quick
task or reminder that you only need
immediately for the time being you can
have it always displaying on the phone
samsung really wants people to actually
take this s-pen out and use it more
often now the note line has been
notoriously or rather infamously known
for having users that never ever even
take out the s-pen they just use this
phone as a large device so maybe these
changes will make people use the s-pen
more often but at the very least it
means that the s-pen has become a pretty
practical tool to use in the note 7 and
all of this does come at a pretty steep
price not necessarily the monetary price
which I'll get to in a second
essentially there are so many features
in the note 7 that every single user
will have their own distinct learning
curve if you actually go through the
effort to learn how to use all of them
that could take up a pretty big chunk of
time in order to get the most out of the
note 7 you kind of have to do your
homework so perhaps for one of the few
times in their tenure samsung has made a
phone that is trying its darndest to
justify its very high price point and
currently on the Samsung website the
phone is available for a total of eight
hundred and forty nine ninety nine a
very steep price for a phone that
simultaneously feels fresh enough yet
feels undeniably familiar if you can
genuinely say that you don't need an
accessible big display device high on
board capacity with expandable storage
great battery life a top-notch camera
experience one of the most feature heavy
Android iterations ever and or a s-pen
that just won't quit then you can look
elsewhere but unless you can do that you
simply need not look any further than
this
I'm some Galaxy Note 7 so as always
thank you guys very much for watching
and I hope you enjoyed this review of
the samsung galaxy note 7 now for a
phone that actually is incredibly
familiar there was actually a lot to
talk about on this device and it did
take up a lot of time so hopefully you
guys got something out of it and we
pretty much let you know that because
this phone is so feature heavy more so
than pretty much any other galaxy device
it might actually justify its price
point and if you've been holding out on
a note device up until now this might be
the best upgrade that you've been
waiting for so from there you can keep
it into Android 34 even more about the
galaxy note 7 we have a lot coming up
and of course we have shows like Aoife
right around the corner you can go to
our sibling sites that include VR source
comm tab times and sound guys and then
you can bring it on back to Android or
decom and our youtube channel because of
course we are your source for all things
