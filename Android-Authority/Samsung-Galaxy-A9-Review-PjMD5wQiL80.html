year ago and ever since then Samsung has
been creating many different versions of
it to appeal to very specific groups of
people and now they just released the
galaxy a nine is pretty much just a big
galaxy s6 actually no a really big one
but due to its size you get a massive
battery and access to a micro SD card
slot so let's take a look and see if the
a9 is exactly the phone that Samsung
fans have been waiting for right off the
bat this phone looks exactly like the
note 5 but when you look a little closer
you'll notice the lack of the s-pen and
even the lack of the curved edges on the
back so then you begin to think wow this
thing is pretty much a big galaxy s6 no
actually this thing looks like a huge
galaxy s6 now when I say huge I'm not
kidding this is a much bigger phone that
even the note 5 do to this gigantic 6
inch screen so yeah this phone can be
quite cumbersome to hold but thanks to
its slim top and bottom bezels it's not
too much taller than other phones that
have smaller screens the main thing here
is this extra width that brings the
phone to 80 point 9 millimeters which
can really make the phone hard to use
one-handed just like the standard galaxy
s6 we have a very premium design that
features Gorilla Glass 4 we have the
gold version right here
which also keeps the front black which
is nice you can also pick up the a9 in
other unique colours like silver and
pink on the back and with this extra
thickness as seven point four
millimeters which is point two
millimeters thinner than the note 5 we
have a camera sensor that perches a
little less probably one of the most
noticeable differences between the
galaxy a9 and this more popular s6 and
note 5 companions is this weight this
phone is heavy at 200 grams it's the
first thing to stuck out to me as I
picked up the phone for the first time
but this really isn't a huge issue
although with this large dimensions it
can feel a little unbalanced when
maneuvering it around your hand now
there is a reason for this extra weight
and that's due to the a9 s gigantic four
thousand milliamp hour battery and with
the way this battery performs as we'll
find out later on it definitely makes up
for this huge and heavy design Samsung
has always been known for beautiful
displays under smartphones and in most
areas the Galaxy a9 is no exception like
I said the 89 offers a very large 6-inch
display which makes this phone the
ultimate media consumer watching videos
is a joy thanks to all this extra room
and browsing the web makes for a very
pleasant experience
Samsung of course still stuck to their
Super AMOLED technology here along with
their punched up colors to create very
vibrant images however as we look at the
display specs here you'll notice one
area where the ae9 Falls a bit short and
that's its resolution a 1080 by 1920
Full HD resolution still makes sure a
great resolution on most smartphones
today but with a 6 inch display like the
one here on the a9 it makes for a rather
low pixel density at 367 PPI so text
will appear fuzzy even when holding the
phone at a normal using distance and
you'll definitely notice images are not
too sharp but all this being said I can
confidently say this display is gorgeous
as I really do love great AMOLED
displays and saturated colors sure the
resolution doesn't make for the clearest
viewing experience but with less pixels
to push well this is why I'm so excited
to get to the battery section like most
of Samsung's lineups these days we have
the beloved fingerprint scanner which is
located on the physical home button
which is located between the capacitive
buttons it's a decent place for it
because you can access it at any time
although it can be a little awkward
compared to a rear-facing sensor you
still have to push the home button for
the fingerprint scanner to begin reading
but it's still super fast and very
accurate only feeling to read my print
maybe once in every 20 attempts and yes
in addition to this fingerprint scanner
we have Samsung pay which will work
perfectly with the a9 this speaker is
still located on the bottom right which
is a pretty bad place for it giving the
sound is directed away from you and can
easily be covered up when holding the
phone and landscape for videos or games
the quality is decent just as good as a
standard s6 it gets loud and is pretty
clear with a small amount of compression
to it finally a very welcomed addition
is a micro SD card slot allowing up to
128 gigs of storage you can access the
slot here which pulls out a rather large
tray thanks to the phone's dual SIM card
capabilities
this SD card slot had been missing on
the galaxy s6 and note 5 which caused a
great amount of controversy in the tech
world so it's very promising to see
Samsung include this while still
maintaining a premium design and perhaps
this is a little foreshadowing for the
future as well as we run through the
specs you'll notice a very different
look as here we have Snapdragon
processors and Adreno GPUs instead of
Exynos processors and malley GPUs we
have the newly renamed octa-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 - processor with
an adrenal 510 and three gigs of ram and
actually this setup really gets close to
the performance similar to the note 5
and crushes a standard @ 6 as
performance
I ran the Galaxy a9 through Geekbench
and 2 to several times to get a good
understanding of how it holds up against
the competition and it received very
similar rankings to the note 5 the 89
handles gaming with ease with barely any
drop frames it's very smooth the recent
apps screen runs very well although
refreshes apps a little more than usual
but you can jump in and out of apps very
fast without any hesitation
really the only thing two lags up the
phone is this briefing screen that you
can access on the left of the home
screen this isn't new though and the
same can be said for other Samsung
phones it's a very smooth experience
overall anyway we've made it to the
battery section and if you're thinking
to a 9 spec Street hints towards great
battery life you'd be more than correct
first off the battery on the Galaxy a 9
is a four thousand milliamp hour battery
which is one of the largest on the
market right now also with a nine only
sporting a full HD resolution instead of
quad HD which has kind of become the
standard for flagships it has a lot less
pixels to push which means less power
all of this translates to phenomenal
battery life the galaxy a 9 could easily
last me two full days with very decent
standby time you won't be able to kill
this thing in a day especially if you're
not a heavy gamer I could easily manage
up to 8 hours of screen on time which is
pretty remarkable especially for someone
like me who is constantly taking
pictures if you take advantage of
Samsung's battery saving options when
you begin to get low this number will
drastically increase by up to another
hour there was really never a need for
me to charge the a9 overnight
and if the phone did begin to get low
and battery towards the end of the
second day I could easily charge it up
enough to last me the rest of the day
and fast too with this quick charge 3.0
capabilities the camera has been
downgraded from the standard galaxy s6
but still is able to take pictures we
have a smaller sensor size of 13
megapixels however an aperture of 1.9 is
still present and fortunately optical
image stabilization is here as well to
take advantage of the full 13 megapixels
you'll have to resort to shooting in a
43 aspect ratio and with enough light
the camera performs very well there's
some post-processing sharpening going on
that really helps create sharp looking
pictures and colors look very vibrant
but it can struggle with dynamic range
and lots of detail can get lost within
the shadows overexposure is very common
for this camera especially on these
overcast days but HDR does a great job
of fixing this and remaining realistic
looking indoor shots that have less
light will start to create very dull
images with not much color and lots of
noise and artifacts the front-facing
camera actually sports a larger
megapixel count in a standard
counterpart at 8 megapixels instead of 5
the difference in detail is actually
noticeable while the Essex is selfie cam
like lots of detail the a9 produces a
great amount of detail with everything
being very sharp which is nice the lens
is wide angled as well like we're used
to which we love as it helps get a lot
of information in the shot so it's a
little bit of an unusual case with the
rear-facing camera being downgraded
while the front-facing camera seems to
be the same or slightly better either
way the a9s camera quality is very good
but the galaxy s6 still has a beat
probably the biggest shock when it comes
to the a9 is that although with this
phone being released in January of this
year it was not released with Android
marshmallow but instead android 5.1.1
lollipop perhaps am song is still
testing their marshmallow version of
TouchWiz or maybe wants to save it for
the galaxy s7 announcement but for now
we have the version of TouchWiz that
we've been familiar with for about a
year now
a pretty simple skin of Android with a
couple of cool features thrown in the
notification pull down is nicely
designed if you don't mind the color
choice settings allows for quick
settings to be assigned to easy access
there
dual window support which is great and
runs very well although you'll be
limited to certain apps sure there are
some areas that may need work like the
small stutters that have to do with the
home screen animations but hopefully
those can be fixed when Samsung releases
their marshmallow version for the a nine
with the galaxy a nine sharing 99% of
its design DNA with a galaxy s6 it'll
definitely raise a question should I go
with the a9 or s6 size is going to be
the biggest difference between the two
the Galaxy a9 is one of the largest
phones on the market right now with this
huge 6-inch screen and although it's an
awesome size for viewing videos the low
resolution may steer some users away
however if you can get past this lower
pixel density you'll really love the
amount of power it saves to produce
amazing battery life obviously that's
something you couldn't say about the s6
the camera definitely is a noticeable
downgrade but if you're not comparing
side-by-side that a 9s photos will do
just fine for a $600 phone with great
overall performance battery life and
finally access to a microSD card slot
the galaxy a nine looks like I could
begin to put Samsung back on top when it
comes to creating phones for the power
user and that is it for the samsung
