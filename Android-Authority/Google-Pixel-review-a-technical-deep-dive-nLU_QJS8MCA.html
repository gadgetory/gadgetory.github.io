Andrew authority now google recently
launched the pixel and the pixel XL
Android smartphones and this really has
shaken up the status quo because not
only now is Google competing against
Samsung and HTC and LG and other
smartphone manufacturers but it's also
pitching itself directly against Apple
because now Google controls the hardware
the software and the ecosystem just like
Apple controls its hardware its software
and its ecosystem now we've done some
excellent reviews here on Android all
thority if you want to check out the
user experience views please go and see
LAN and Josh's review it really is X and
I wholeheartedly recommend it over today
and they take a different approach I
want to look at the technology behind
the pixel XL so if you like benchmarks
charts tables and numbers in general
then stick around
so let's just remind ourselves of the
specs of the pixel and the pixel XL the
pixel comes with a 5 inch full HD AMOLED
display whereas the pixel XL comes with
a 5.5 inch quad HD display they both
have the Snapdragon 801 processor they
both come with 4 gigabytes of RAM and
they both have this excellent 12
megapixel camera with the large pixels
inside of it now what I'm going to do
today is look at the different aspects
of these phones now I'm testing using an
actual Google pixel not a pixel XL have
a lot of what I've got to say applies to
going with the phones so let's start
with the display the Google pixel comes
with a 5 inch full HD AMOLED display
which means going to get deep blacks and
some vivid colors but let's have a look
at the color profile as you can see here
from this graph in the areas of the
Greenwood you'll find up there towards
the top of the graph they tend to move
left slightly towards the blues and the
yellows move slightly towards the greens
that meet overall the display has a kind
of a bluish tint to it but probably you
can't detect that with your eyes this is
just something picked up by our test
equipment so you look at the Reds and
the blues and the purples
they really do seem to be spot on true
representations of those colors now if
you look at the graph you'll see the
results square boxes that shows you what
the color should be at any particular
screen brightness and you'll see that
actually the dots are the actual result
and they're not perfectly matched up but
overall this is a pretty good display
except that slight twist there in the
area of the greens now talking of
brightness the Google's hexyl will give
you a brightness of 406 nits when it's
on 100% brightness inserting after you
put it on adaptive display brightness
and then you shine a bright light into
the sensor actually it manages to turn
out 110 or 410 nits so basically looking
at a 400 nits display which of course is
very good for both indoor and outdoor
usage so moving on to the processor both
the pixel and the pixel exhale have the
that dragon eight-to-one
system-on-a-chip from coal coal now
basically this is a quad-core processor
which has got four 64-bit ARM compatible
cause now it uses something called
heterogeneous multi-processing which
basically two of the cores are high
performance they're tuned for giving you
the best performance of the phone and
there are two calls which are tuned for
a high energy efficiency and these four
chords work in tandem and when there are
light jobs to be done then the two more
power energy efficient cause I use when
there's lots of complicated stuff and
lots of heavy lifting to be done the two
bigger calls are use now these four
calls are actually all used
simultaneously because there are lots of
tasks running on your mobile phone lots
of things happening at the same time and
basically they use according to the
scheduler to to the best of their
ability to try to get that best
performance and yet the best energy
efficiency out of your phone so the two
high-performance calls on top of 2.15
gigahertz whereas the two energy
efficient cause are clocked at one point
six gigahertz cause inside of an SOC
that's much more than just the processor
cores is also the GPU and a DSP and an
image processor and of course the modem
and those are all excellent components
inside of Snapdragon into one in fact if
we turn ourselves to performance we find
that the a Snapdragon 801 in the pixel
actually is faster in terms of the
antutu score than both the galaxy s7
both variants of it and the huawei mate
nine however when you look at Geekbench
you'll find it has a score of 1500 for
the single core test and a score of 4154
for the multi-core test and these are
actually slower than the ki-rin 960
which we'll find in the mate nine now
also ran my own benchmark suite against
the Google pixel I've got some
benchmarks I've written myself and the
first benchmark does some sorting and
some stuff with prime numbers and some
table hashes and things like that and
basically the pixel has got the highest
score of any phone eyes personally
tested which of course includes the
ki-rin 960 and include
the galaxy s7 so the pixel is definitely
fast when it comes to these overall
performance however I have a second
benchmark which could have put water
droplets into a physics simulation and
the idea is it runs for 90 seconds how
many droplets of water can it put in if
it's running at 60 frames a second um
two droplets are put in every single
frame now the Google people doesn't
score the highest mark at the moment
that is still the champion there is the
quirian 960 you find the while m89
however it does score ten thousand one
hundred and seventy eight out of a
possible score of ten thousand eight
hundred so at a pretty good score I also
have a 3d terrain that I built in unity
3d with a flyover that kind of just
flies through a different aspect of the
terrain to see what framerate we can get
out of this and again the Google pixel
has the greatest frame rate but I've
seen on any phone I have tested actually
managed 37 frames per second which is
greater some phones are down in the 19
18 frames per second so this really is a
good result
so overall the Snapdragon 801 in the
Google picture map it of a hill is an
excellent processor it's that quad core
heterogeneous multi-processing setups
and it's got a good GPU and there will
be no problem in terms of performance
for day-to-day use and when it comes to
the battery the Google pixel has two
thousand seven hundred and seventy
million power battery and the XL has a
three thousand four hundred fifty
million power battery now the difference
there is mainly because the google excel
has the bigger display and the big
display takes more power and according
to Larne and to George basically both
phones give the same kind of battery
performance because the difference in
the size is really just to cope with the
bigger screen now they're testing and my
personal testing has shown that you are
definitely gonna get around five hours
of on screen time during an average day
and I've done some artificial testing
throughout running some videos and
running some web browsing and some 3d
gaming and if you do that then you will
get over five hours or on your phone if
you're doing a specific car something
much simpler for example like watching a
video actually my testing is show me
you'll get over ten hours ten and a half
hours even out of the goo
who picks ups now if you're doing that
with a screen brightness at 47 percent
which is 200 nits on the Google pixel
then you're gonna get ten and a half
hours I wondered what would that mean if
we bump that up to a hundred percent to
over 400 nits and it didn't go down by
half by it by any stretch actually went
down to just eight and a half hours so
even watching a video on full brightness
you can get eight and a half hours out
of this setup and that's really quite
good
so both the pixel and the pixel excel
come with quick charge from Qualcomm and
you can charge the pixel from below 5%
up to a hundred percent in around about
100 minutes that's one hour and 40
minutes now if you want to just have a
quick boost if you've got not very much
battery life and you can get up to 50%
in just 30 minutes and likewise you can
get 25% in 15 minutes
however with all quick charge system the
initial charging is much faster than the
later charging so you can go from 0 to
70% in maybe 50 minutes but to go from
that 70% to 100% takes another 50
minutes so quick charging works very
very well for 0 to 70 0 to 80% and then
it does tail off as you top the battery
up to its full limit now of course the
camera is a very important aspect of any
smart phone and Google has put a lot of
work into the cameras on the pixel XL
and the pixel now basically you get that
12 megapixel rear facing camera with the
large pixel size which is good for
low-light situations
you also get phase detection focus you
get laser detection focus you can record
4k at 30 frames a second you can record
HD at 240 frames per second so this
really is technically a good setup but I
wanted to test it to see how good it
really was so I set up a little scene
inside of a light box and I took some
photos with the pixel and at the same
time took some photos with my Canon DSLR
a digital camera and I wanted to see
what they came out like now here are the
photos and as you can see the pixel is
slightly worse than the big expensive
Canon camera in good lighting situation
seems to me the Canon gives better
lighting depth there's some more nuances
to the
others and the pixel seemed a little bit
washed out however the really surprising
thing is when you go down to low light
situations you will find that actually
the Canon did quite a bad job compared
to the pixel in fact the pixel did an
excellent job in the low light
situations and if you look at the zoomed
in picture here that I did on with both
phones with both cameras you can see
that the again the pixel did a better
job of picking out the definition of
that writing there then you get on the
Canon so well done for Google which
really is a good camera setup both
technically and now I've seen
practically it works very well now when
it comes to the software of course on
the Google pixel you're running and with
7.1 which at the time of making this
video is still not officially available
for any other phones or some beta
versions out now as I'm recording this
but it's not officially available so you
do get that unique aspect of having
handling 7.1 and of course you've got
the Google assistant built into it and
there are also some good changes in
Android 7.1 there's a whole load of
videos out there about all the different
things in 10.1 but just two things I
want to mention one is this storage
saver option that allows you to kind of
delete things and put Muhtar the cloud
to free up space on your phone that's a
really good feature that can be
automatically launched by any
application and that's the new thing
that comes with Android 7.1 and of
course there's some big changes for VR
basically when you're doing VR you want
your VR app to have the highest priority
running on the device so it can deliver
that performance and deliver that
experience for the VR headset now in
Android 7.1 they've done some stuff that
when you're running in VR mode though
the app is sort of scheduled at a
greater priority so that it can get
things out onto display at the frame
rate that's necessary so that's a good
thing there of course that ties into
Google daydream and the VR experience
that Google is pushing with this phone
and of course with other phones now
what's interesting when you boot up the
phone's got four gigabytes of RAM and
when you boot it up it uses about 1.3
gigabytes and I must say but during my
testing running various apps I wasn't
doing anything particularly heavy but
videos web browsing that I didn't
actually see the average uses go over to
gigabyte so four gigabytes of RAM
is sufficient more than sufficient for a
device like this and we talked about
internal storage the pixel I've got has
32 gigabytes of internal storage that's
about 29 gigabytes once it actually has
been formatted and Android itself will
use about 6.5 gigabytes for its the
system and for the default app so you
get about 23 gigabytes free to play with
for your apps of your videos and for
your photos now all this has been great
I must say that the you've got a top
processor you've got good display
technology you've got a top-of-the-line
camera all this stuff is exiting the
Google pixel however there are some
things missing and we need to mention
the things that are missing from the
Google picture one of course is an SD
card slot I redo like SD card slot to
shame the pixel hasn't got one then of
course there is no wireless charging
some people we like that I use that on
my note 5 it's just great in the
earrings plot the phone down and it just
starts charging that's really quite
useful there's no optical image
stabilization of taller though there are
some software system software image
stabilization and of course it would
have been nice to have some front-facing
speakers to really get that full
multimedia experience and finally there
isn't actually much in the terms of
waterproof II really ip67 would have
been nice on a phone like this so
although we've got a good package got
some good things in it good process a
good display good camera good memory
excellent software Android 7.1 there are
some things missing you need to be aware
of that particularly when you consider
the price and this is maybe the biggest
bug bear that people have the price of
the Google pixel is not what we're used
to with the Nexus line and really here
we can see that Google are competing now
directly head-to-head with companies
like Apple controlling the hardware the
software and the ecosystem and the price
tag is coming with that and then we have
it my technical overview of the Google
pixel and pixel excel I hope you enjoyed
