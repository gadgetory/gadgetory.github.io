authority and I'm here in New York City
checking out the Moto XIII play this is
the successor to last year's Moto Z to
play and it's sort of been modernized
for 2018 so the first thing you're going
to notice is the display is now in 18 by
9 display it's also a little bit larger
than last year's at 6 inches but it's
still a 1080p screen and it's still in
AMOLED display so it's still very
vibrant very contrast II with those inky
deep blacks it also has much thinner
bezels now and because of those thinner
bezels they had to move the fingerprint
sensor to the right side of the phone
but this is just a standalone
fingerprint sensor the power button is
actually on the left side which I
thought was a little bit awkward but
it's really not that big of a deal since
you don't really interact with the power
button that much on a daily basis it's
impressively thin at just a little under
7 millimeters but as far as the rest of
the shape and the dimensions it's pretty
much the same as previous moto Z devices
which is to be expected because of the
support for the moto mods the big change
here is that it now has glass on both
the front and the back with a metal
frame that wraps around the sides and
the glass is made of Gorilla Glass 3 and
Motorola says they went with Gorilla
Glass 3 instead of Gorilla Glass 5
because they didn't really see much of a
difference in scratch protection between
the two you'll also notice that the Moto
XIII play doesn't have a headphone jack
which is unfortunate but it really isn't
all that surprising of a change in the
US it'll be priced at $4.99 which will
get you four gigabytes of RAM and 64
gigs of internal storage and it'll also
come included with the Moto mod battery
pack and in other regions it'll be
available with a six gigabyte version
with a hundred and twenty eight
gigabytes of storage and you'll also
have the option of a moto mod speaker
other specs include the Snapdragon 636
processor which Motorola says is 30%
faster than last year's model and you
also have the same 3000 milliamp hour
battery with turbo charging which should
give you the same amount of battery life
if not a little bit more
the cameras have also been improved over
last year's model you now have dual
cameras on the back with a 12 megapixel
sensor F 1.7 and a secondary 5 megapixel
sensor for capturing depth information
and the front-facing camera is now in 8
megapixel sensor you also have portrait
mode available on both the front and
rear cameras but the portrait mode on
the rear camera is a little bit more
advanced because of that depth sensor
one of the newest features to the camera
this year that I thought was pretty cool
is called cinemagraphs
and this basically lets you take a still
photo with motion and you can
selectively pick which parts you want to
keep in motion and it saves as a gif or
Jif so it's pretty easy to share to
social media or your friends and family
you also have google lens built directly
into the native camera app which gives
you all the features of google lens that
you would expect and as far as the rest
of the software it's running Android 8.1
Oreo and it's that close to stock like
Android experience that we've come to
know and love from Motorola because the
Moto Z 3 play doesn't have a
front-facing home button the gesture
controls that we saw on previous moto Z
devices has now been moved on to the
display but you can still swipe left to
go back swipe right to go to recent apps
and tap to go home this is very similar
to the gesture controls on Android P and
Motorola says that the z3 play will be
updated to Android P later on in the
year so this has been our quick hands-on
