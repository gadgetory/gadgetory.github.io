man Jordan thority what's going on
everybody and welcome to you from the LG
booth here on the last day of the Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona Spain and
we're taking a look at some of the more
mid-range phones there is still a market
for all these mid-range devices there
are plenty of people out there who don't
need the craziest specs or the craziest
features inside of their smartphones so
these are the devices to give them what
they need we looked at the L Series
already before and right now we're going
to look at the F Series now the F Series
is a little bit higher up than the L
Series and the the two devices that
comprise the F Series or the f5 of the
f7 right now we're taking a look at the
5 right here so the f5 has a 4.3 inch
IPS LCD screen if the resolution is Q HD
so bit of a far cry from the 1080p and
the 720p displays that we're kind of
getting used to you know it is aside
from that there is a 256 PPI density on
the f5 so the sharpness is quite good on
here as you can see the performance is
pretty good and it's backed by a 1.2
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4 so you
are getting quite a bit of performance
from this little mid-range device so it
should stand the test of performance
aside from that there is one gigabyte of
RAM and on the back here you have the 5
megapixel camera
there is a gigabytes of built-in storage
but on top of that it is expandable with
a micro SD card slot that being said in
the hand just like the l5 from earlier
it has a very it's smaller than most
phones that were used to these days but
that also that almost gives it a nice
charm because it's very easy to be
pocketable easy in the hand it does feel
nice this one in particular has that you
can see that crystal reflection display
on the back cover that LG likes to put
into their devices these days it also
has a plasticky feel not necessarily a
whole lot of grip on the back but then
again that's the reason why the phone is
a little bit smaller that way you'll be
able to keep it in your hand without any
fear of dropping it so that being said
that is the LG Optimus f5 and we're
going to come right back and talk about
the f7 in just a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
