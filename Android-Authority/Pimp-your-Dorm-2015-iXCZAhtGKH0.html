us are just getting settled into our
dorms at school and these dorms tend to
be quite small sometimes really
old-fashioned and more often than a nod
you have to deal with a roommate these
dorms are pretty much going to be our
new little homes for the next few months
so it's important to make them feel like
home hello everybody its Krystle and
welcome to my dorm we've gathered a lot
of cool gadgets and gear that will
really spicing up your dorm or even your
room at home we're calling this pimp
your dorm 2015 first thing you're going
to want to pimp out is your desk
everybody gets the desk when renting a
dorm as it is essential to getting all
sorts of work done it's the centerpiece
of the dorm where visitors eyes first
log on to upon entering and what better
way to catch someone's eye then with
this beautiful LG 34 inch ultra wide
monitor yes this monitor may be a bit of
an overkill but depending on what you're
majoring in this why scream owner could
be very beneficial to you it's an IPS
panel with a 2560 by 1080 resolution if
it's 21 to 9 aspect ratio
it's a beautiful display and can get
quite bright too all this extra screen
real estate can up with multitasking
putting apps or programs side-by-side
which can really help your workflow it's
gigantic and widescreen which also makes
running programs with lots of little
windows appear less cluttered and
organized it has a nice clear stand that
looks very sleek and helps the monitor
tilt and a very intuitive menu button
that says the lever which makes browsing
through settings very fast and easy this
LG ultrawide monitor leans toward the
pricey side at is 449 dollar price point
but is definitely an eye-catcher and
depending on the type of work you'll be
doing it could really be worth it next
we have the anchor 5 port USB charger
with power IQ technology depending on
who you are your college experience
could be a very social one where friends
always coming over to hang out and the
first thing they'll say when they enter
your room is do you have somewhere to
charge my phone and unfortunately a lot
of dorms only offer one or two wall
outlets which most of the time I already
used up by your fridge or air
well this small anchor USB charger can
charge up to five different devices at
the same time in a compact and simple
design while only having to sacrifice
one wall outlet it doesn't support
problems quick charge or anything but it
can charge devices quite fast just by
sending power to five different devices
at the same time another way you can get
the most out of your wall outlets is
with the quirky pivot power flexible
surge protector you're definitely going
to need a power strip of some sort with
the lack of wall outlets and the quirky
pivot power is a great buy because it's
flexible you can bend this quirky strip
into circular semicircular
or zigzag shapes so you can fit it
around furniture with desk legs which
really comes in handy in tight spaces
like a dorm room there also will be no
more plug traffic jams like on a normal
power surge strip some plugs are huge
and end up taking up to two spaces when
it's pretty much up to one power strip
to power an entire room you're going to
need every space you can get the quirky
power strip has six outlet pallets and
since you can adjust the shape large
power bricks won't hug up any space out
of all the cool gear in this video this
quirky power strip is perhaps the most
important now of course you're going to
need something to play some music and
for your dorm room this creative Sound
Blaster roar - portable Bluetooth
speaker is absolutely perfect it's
pretty small at four point three by
seven point four inches so it can fit
perfectly on your desk but it's still
able to offer some great sound quality
with two high frequency drivers a woofer
and two passive radiators on either side
the sound blaster roar - creates a nice
crisp and clear sound with great bass
it's not room shaking Basie and while it
can get pretty loud it's not loud enough
to make your neighbors upset which
obviously is good in a dorm environment
roar mode will boost overall loudness of
the speaker to create a wider sound and
tera base will make up for the loss of
bass during low volume playback and
that's typically the mode I use you can
hook the speaker up to your phone tablet
or laptop wirelessly with Bluetooth or
NFC or with a wired connection by using
USB or auxin you can even store your
songs in a microSD card and play them
directly out of the speaker the sound
blaster roar too has a built-in 6,000
milliamp hour battery and it lasts for a
long time if your music lover
or somebody who needs music to get
through the dreaded homework assignments
or hey I don't know if you're a crazy
college partier this sound blaster roar
too is perfect for a dorm so far we have
a lot of valuable equipment set up in
our dorm and with a new roommate having
access to everything while you're gone
you may be inclined to getting this Arlo
smart home security camera system
depending on the variant you buy you can
get to very small wireless security
cameras you can view on your smartphone
tablet or a computer live and this
system is extremely easy to hook up it
comes with a little bridge that plugs
into your Ethernet line a lot of dorms
give you access to one so hopefully
yours has it and after that you just
download the Arlo app and you're
connected these cameras are wide angled
so you can almost view your entire dorm
with just one if you really don't trust
your roommate or a single dorm just to
see what goes on you're not there you
get a nice clear HD live stream from
your cameras and they're even capable of
night vision you can set your cameras to
record manually or scheduled and easily
playback recordings in your library you
can get up to one gig of cloud storage
for free but if you like more you'll
have to purchase a planet one mode you
can set is motion activation so if your
camera catches some movement you'll
immediately get a notification on your
phone and you can quickly tune into the
stream and see what's going on one
downside is that these are low security
cameras you don't have any type of audio
recording or playback but in a dorm
situation that's not really that
important on the back we have a soft
magnetic indentation that works
perfectly with these wall mounts they're
extremely strong so they won't be going
anywhere
although you're not usually supposed to
hang things on walls and dorms but we'll
get the job done just sitting down on
the table if you have a lot of expensive
Technium these are low security cameras
will give you peace of mind college can
be a bit stressful and sometimes you
just need to lie down and relax and
probably one of the most comfortable
things that we have try is the sumo
gamer and suede sumo is a company who
probably makes the best beanbag chairs
out there right now there are different
than normal beanbag chairs you'll get a
covering and instead of actual hard
beams filling up the covering you'll
receive vacuum sealed stuffing with
little foam balls inside its
crazy-looking
but after pulling it apart filling the
cover with it and zipping it up you're
ready to relax on one of the most
comfortable beanbags on the market we've
really played around with this beanbag
and it took a beating but this material
is very strong I managed to hold up
beautifully what's great about having an
easy removable stuffing is that if the
cover stains you can just simply put it
in the wash and what's awesome about
sumo is that they have a huge
customizable lineup of these bean bags
we try the sumo gamer in a sway tide
pool color which is pretty huge at 48 by
48 by 30 inches so for a small dorm room
this may be a bit too much but you can
choose from a selection of different
shapes and sizes some Cimabue bags are
shaped like big pillows almost like a
human dog bed and some are longer or
shorter or some are straight up the size
of a bed you can choose between
different materials like suede or cord
and there's a large variety of colors
too
these go perfectly with dorms for
relaxing or doing homework watching TV
gaming hang out with friends or even
sleeping if you want to totally
transform your dorm into the ultimate
party room we recommend hue lights these
LED lights can change the entire mood
and ambience of your dorm in a beautiful
way first we have a hue lightstrip
you can bend these light strips shape
them and even cut them in any shape or
size that you like
they have an adhesive tape on the back
so they can stick to nearly anything the
best way to use these strips is to put
them behind something so you don't have
to actually see the lights but instead
you see the soft glow flowing into the
room around
putting them behind your desk is a great
idea as it creates a beautiful backdrop
behind your monitor just peel off the
protective paper to reveal the sticky
command tape and press it onto whatever
you like and if the strip is too long
for what you like to do you can easily
cut them on the dotted lines though
unfortunately the strip that you cut off
will become useless the beautiful thing
about hue lights is you can change their
color to any color you can imagine via
the hue app simply sly the light number
around and your light strip will change
color in real time you can make them dim
flash and even pulse and this is all
possible with a hue bridge which is very
easy to setup just connect it to a power
source and plug it into your Ethernet
line push the button on the bridge to
sync and that's it you're good to go but
unfortunately there's no way to just
purchase only the bridge the only way to
get it is to buy the starting kit which
cost around two hundred dollars but you
do get three you light bulbs which makes
a starting kit more worth it these bulbs
can screw into any standard light
fittings and can also be controlled with
the same you app changing to any color
that you tell it
these you lights are amazing for
changing the entire atmosphere of your
room and what's more amazing and so
every day your room can look entirely
new next on our list is inner gears
aromatherapy diffuser and humidifier
some dorm rooms just have a weird smell
that you can't get rid of who knows how
many different strange people have
doormen in the room that your dorming in
right now and who knows what they've
done in it - or who knows who your
roommate will invite over and do while
you're gone it can be a smelly place let
me tell you and since candles are
usually banned from dorm rooms for
safety reasons a scent if user is a must
have this diffuser releases a lovely
fragrance - a slight mist
by burning oil scents that you can buy
at many different places at the same
time this diffuser connect those
humidifier to prevent dry stuffy air and
cold rooms infecting your dorm it has
two settings you can never release some
fragrance mist for every 30 seconds or
continuous missed the inner geared
diffuser also can let up in a variety of
different colors and even slowly cycle
through to add to the relaxing
atmosphere that you've created another
type of diffuser that you can
to your dorm is the Oregon Scientific
aroma diffusor and sound therapy clock
this works similar to the inner gear
diffuser that has a few more bells and
whistles like the digital LCD clock on
the front it does have different style
modes that play relaxing sounds like
ocean waves or birds chirping but
depending on who you are
that could get annoying quick one cool
feature on the oregon diffuser is this
alarm mode where you can set it to
release of fragrance at a certain time
so for example every morning at 8 a.m.
they'll release a cherry smell that
makes with this alarm clock and maybe
even your heated lights pulsing can
create a wonderful wakeup routine one
little item that will impress your
friends is the ZTE s pro 2 projector
when most dorm rooms are small there's
not much room for a TV table and while
hanging are mounting objects like TVs on
walls is banned a small portable
projector is a way to go it runs Android
KitKat has a 5-inch touchscreen and
projects a beautiful image while only
being 5.3 by 5.2 inches and only one
point two inches thick
it's perfect for inviting friends over
for a movie night or even taking along
with you to class for school
presentation it's a bit pricey at $600
but given its portability and the fact
that a full Android phone is running
aside is a pretty nice seal for a more
in-depth look go check out Long's review
here on Android authority finally at the
end of the day when it's time to sleep
this dome natural white noise machine is
a lifesaver a lot of colleges are within
the hearts of cities which can be a
noisy noisy place for example I'm
dorming in New York City where drivers
will honk their horn at any chance they
can get all night long between that and
the nonstop police sirens and people
shouting getting enough rest at night to
stay focused in class the next day was
tough this dome noise machine totally
drains out the obnoxious sounds from
outside and the noise created is 100%
natural the dome produces a soothing
rushing air settled
kind of like how spam was down but much
more relaxing you can change these
sounds ever so slightly
are rotating the sides and top creating
a softer muffle sound or a higher louder
sound at the end of the day you can be
confident you'll fall right to sleep
