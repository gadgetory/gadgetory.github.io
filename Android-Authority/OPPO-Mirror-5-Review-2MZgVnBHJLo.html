smartphone featuring a facet design and
premium build but does the mere five
really stand out among the sea of cheap
Android smartphones this is Bailey Stein
with Android authority and this is my
for review of the Opel mere 5 if there's
one area where the mere 5 shines it's
got to be design quite literally
actually with individual cut glass
sections on the back cover the mere five
offers an increasingly popular
reflective design in fact you'd be
forgiven for mistaking the mere five for
the older r1x weighing in at an average
160 grams and with a thickness of 7.65
millimetres the mere five feels
comfortable in the hand the biometallic
frame is a nice touch and combined with
a smaller form factor makes the phone
easy to grip with a single hand the
power and volume buttons provide good
tactile feedback and are positioned
nicely along the sides of the phone one
drawback to the faux glass rear cover is
its tendency to collect fingerprints the
same is true for the front of the device
which makes it very difficult to keep
them near five free of fingerprints
there is a notification LED at the
top-right as well as a five megapixel
front-facing camera on the top left the
three capacitive keys on the bottom menu
home and back are sadly not illuminated
I wish Oppo would have given us the
option to use the Menu button is the
multitasking button like Xiaomi does as
the current implementation is to press
and hold to access the multitasking menu
which does seem to be a bit much the
mere fives five inch qHD display looks
about average but could definitely use a
bump in resolution it's funny to think
that the 960 by 540 resolution is just a
quarter of rivals like the Asus zenfone
2 everything looks a bit blurry and
while the low resolution may help the
phone achieve longer battery life it
does cause the display to take a major
hit in quality overall there's also no
display protection like Gorilla Glass so
it would be wise to keep the
factory-installed screen protector on
even after am
boxing the phone featuring the quad-core
64-bit Snapdragon 410 clocked at 1.2
gigahertz the mere 5 is packin a
relatively low end processor well I did
notice apps ticking a few more seconds
to load
dinner day performance was surprisingly
good for the processing package
luckily Oppo did include 2 gigabytes of
RAM so you likely won't have to worry
about not having enough unlike on some
other devices coupled with the Adreno
306 the mere 5 is able to play most
games without any issues thanks to the
lower screen resolution frame drops are
rare even in games like Need for Speed
Most Wanted the Oppo me r5 supports 802
11 and Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth 4.0
carrier support will vary based on the
model but the American version partially
supports HSPA+ on a TMT and 2g on
t-mobile
there are also 4G LTE bands however with
1 4 7 and 17 being supported on the
American version it is missing been 2 &amp;amp;
5 for AT&amp;amp;T and 2 and 12 for t-mobile
which may cause problems for certain
users in certain areas the rear speaker
sounds pretty good with little
distortion the placement is a bit
unfortunate however as it makes it
really easy to block when set on a flat
surface
battery life on the mere five was good
but not great the twenty four twenty
milliamp hour non use a replaceable
battery was able to get me from 9:00
a.m. to 9:30 p.m. with just over three
hours of screen on time that was with
brightness set to 75% and Wi-Fi on for
the entire day if you are a power user
chances are better than not that this
phone won't be able to make it through a
full day of use light users on the other
hand should have no trouble with battery
life there is a normal power saving mode
as well as a super power saving mode if
you really need to just get a bit more
out of the battery the eight megapixel
rear camera produce mostly good looking
images especially for the price as is
the case with most smartphone cameras it
performs best in well-lit environments I
do appreciate the slider next to the
focus point within the camera app that
lets you adjust the exposure quickly if
needed speaking of the camera app it's
undoubtedly taking some inspiration from
Apple there are many shooting modes
however although there aren't many
manual settings available the Oppo Mir
five ships with color OS version 2.1
over android 5.1.1 lollipop color OS
replaces a lot of stock Android elements
including the Settings multi-tasking
menu launcher and lockscreen that's not
to say that color OS is bad however the
animations are all very nice and the
launcher offers some of the best
customization options despite not having
an app drawer maybe it's a problem on my
end but I noticed that the multitasking
menu would occasionally refuse to close
certain apps I have to keep swiping
until color OS realizes that I want to
close the app and this can just be very
frustrating I've had this issue before
on other skins using an iOS style app
switcher and I think that it could use
some improvement in color OS perhaps the
best aspect of color OS is the gestures
that are offered out of the box not only
do you have your standard double tap to
wake draw letters for apps but you also
have screen on gestures like pinch to
open camera swipe three fingers to take
a screenshot or adjust the volume with
two fingers there's also a one-handed
mode but I found the gesture to activate
it to be
a bit jarring at times the small things
like the near lack of bloatware and the
ability to swipe down from anywhere well
in the launchers certainly add up to
make a very good software experience
overall the Oppo Mir 5 will be available
for about 245 dollars depending on your
region it's available in either white or
blue with 16 gigabytes of internal
storage you can expand that with a
microSD card up to 128 gigabytes since
the microSD card slot is separate from
the dual SIM card slots you also won't
need to give up one of those if you want
extra storage the mere five has several
strong points a nice design good speaker
quality and a good software experience
however the display resolution is very
low the performance is slightly below
average for what you can get and other
options and I do feel that it is a tad
overpriced with other Chinese
smartphones like the meizu m2 note and
Lenovo k3 note the Oppo me r5 is a tough
sell well it does offer a superior
design and build it falls behind in
display resolution performance and most
importantly price thank you for watching
