here and today we'll be taking a look at
some of the new features a swiftkey 4.3
if at any point you want to try it out
we've put the download link in the video
description so let's get started if
you're here you probably know about the
other features of swiftkey so we'll get
right down to the brass tacks and
SwiftKey 4.3 they've combined the tablet
phablet and phone keyboards all under
one roof so you can get the full layout
the thumb style layout for tablets and a
miniaturized layout for phablets in the
full view it's the usual swiftkey that
we all know and love it's the full
keyboard and there are no changes there
and the thumbs layout the keyboard is
split down the middle so it's optimized
for thumb typing this is best used on a
tablet but it could be used on larger
phones as well lastly in the compact
layout it'll shrink the keyboard down
and put it to one side for easier
one-handed use just long press the arrow
key to switch sides if you're
left-handed also included is the ability
to resize and move the keyboard anywhere
on your screen for added organ AMA
support so you can choose between five
sizes and move the keyboard anywhere you
may need it you can have it any place
any size and any type that you could
possibly need and that about does it for
