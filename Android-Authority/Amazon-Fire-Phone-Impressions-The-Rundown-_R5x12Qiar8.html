some time now for Amazon to create their
own phone and after a pretty successful
line of tablets in the Kindle Fire
series they have decided to create what
they call it the Amazon fire phone and
earlier today we got a lot of
information about it now I wasn't able
obviously as you can see behind me to go
to the actual event even though I tried
to get an invite but I did just watch
the entire press conference and so it's
josh from gone from android authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the Amazon fire phone event rundown I'm
just going to go ahead and jump into
everything right now we'll talk about
the phone itself and you can see the
footage here from the actual press
conference itself that the phone has
Gorilla Glass 3 on the front and back so
you got dual glass panels and it's all
put together with a rubber skeleton but
if you look a little bit closely you
might see that some of the design
choices are kind of eerily iphone so as
you with the to associate with the
bottom portion with the USB connector
and also those grills on the sides of it
but aside from that it has a pretty
minimalistic a pretty nice build and it
does look like it's going to be really
easy to handle especially because the
screen is 4.7 inches so usability and
accessibility is something that amazon
has always wanted to really drive home
when it comes to all of their devices
and that looks like it's going to be the
case here now we'll get into that in a
little bit but let's move on to some of
the internals what we have here is what
they didn't say was the type of
processor it was but it was pretty
obvious when you say 2.2 gigahertz
quad-core processor that comes with the
audrina 330 well it's pretty obvious
that it's not the Snapdragon 801 that is
available now but see Snapdragon 800 so
it might be just a small step backwards
in terms of the processing package
compared to what is available now but
for the most part that should make the
pretty minimalistic a fire OS work
pretty well already made a returns and
it was a very nice feature on the
tablets that allows the general user to
get the help that they need when they
just can't figure out exactly what they
gotta do in order to make a function
work on their phone Mayday is really
easy to use it is honestly probably the
best customer service experience you're
going to have
where and given the fact that all of
these users on May Day all of these
representatives are able to control the
phone you can pretty much have them do
what it is you need them to do and you
don't even have to touch the phone you
just let them do all the work so that's
kind of cool I can see a lot of general
users really loving the Mayday feature
and if they've never had a kindle fire
tablet before well now they're going to
see what it's all about in the fire
phone after that we have the Firefly and
Firefly is a very interesting feature
that might prove really useful for a lot
of people out there especially since the
SDK is on his way to a lot of developers
in order for them to create actions
based upon the Firefly essentially you
take the phone and you send and you give
it something to look at either it's a
product of some sort of barcode a QR
code or even information on any type of
surface like a paper or a flyer or
really a sign even a billboard of sorts
and when it looks at the actual content
you're giving it it will find the
pertinent information needed in some
cases it will find let's say the phone
number so that you can save it and then
after that if you show it a product it
might be able to scan that entire
product like say a book and find out
exactly what it is through some
recognition magic and after that head
over to Amazon and be able to give me
the links to be able to buy those
products or to call those numbers
yourself it's a very interesting feature
that according to a lot of reports is
actually very accurate source almost
surprisingly accurate so it's something
that might become very ubiquitous to
users of the fire phone to be able to
recognize anything in the world and be
able to do anything about it but Firefly
is also able to tap into various media
outlets as well if there's music playing
in a room or even if your TV is playing
a TV show you can have the audio capture
and Amazon will find everything that is
to know about that song along with
obviously links for you to buy the
actual content fireflight is ultimately
one of those features that has a few
very specific functions and there are a
couple things that you have to keep in
mind about it obviously it is a feature
that is made primarily for you to tap
into Amazon's ecosystem and continuously
buy products obviously that's the way
that Amazon makes money but it's also a
that might prove really useful even if
you're not a prime member or you don't
really use Amazon too much because all
of these other developers are going to
create actions for it that you could
still use outside of the Amazon
ecosystem I think that's the part that's
actually really exciting about Firefly
and I'm interested to see what
particular companies create actions out
of this particular function in order to
really open up what it can do and
finally here is the feature that I'm
still a little bit skeptical on because
well the the presentation basically made
it seem like oh look how cool this is
and the whole time I kept thinking well
it's not necessarily that useful it is
kind of cool but it's more of AI candy
than anything and that's the dynamic
perspective now the presentation started
off by showing you lock screens that
ultimately we're not all that exciting
pretty much you just move the phone
around and you get to look around the
lock screen that they have created
specifically for that purpose but then
they started talking or then Jeff Bezos
started to talk about more aspects of
the phone that take advantage of the
dynamic perspective and essentially a
couple areas were like in the maps where
you can see a 3d perspective of where
your location is and you can see around
the streets and whatnot which was kind
of cool but the one that I feel like
everyone is going to really start using
is well all of the gesture commands if
you're in the home screen and you want
to open up the shade from the right or
the left in order to perform more
functions you just tilt the phone in
that direction I think that's pretty
cool you will always end up having to
tap or swipe for the most part in a lot
of different areas of the phone but
that's okay being able to start off the
the natural movement of moving your hand
a certain way is kind of nice plenty of
users out there who are already seasoned
let's say iPhone or Android users might
not look at that feature and think it's
revolutionary but it might be something
they use from time to time the one that
I know a lot of people will end up using
probably is the scroll now we've seen
this kind of auto scroll in phones like
the samsung galaxy as four and five but
maybe they weren't completely
implemented well well on the Amazon fire
phone they might be implemented at it at
their best at least from what we've seen
so far because they have really upped
the ante in terms of getting the record
done right there are four cameras for
including infrared lights behind them on
the very corners of the front of the
phone that will always be detecting
where your face is and it actually
detects your face as the presentation
showed and it will be able to see what
perspective your face or your head is
actually in in order to create the
action and that's actually really cool
it's a way that amazon i guess had to
really figure out how to create that
particular function and make it work
flawlessly at least close to it because
in the past we would just use the front
facing cameras and hope that they in
their one optic package you know sort of
construction I hope that they would be
able to get the job done but now you
have four so they really just sort of
through all the tools in order to make
this one particular type of function
work after that what I do like seeing
from amazon though is the fact that they
are opening up so much to third-party
services like Netflix and Spotify and
because one of the biggest problems that
I had with the kindle fire tablets was
the fact that it really felt let's say
crippled if you did not use a prime
membership the reason why I think it's
interesting that they even were showing
netflix I Heart Radio all these other
services third-party Services is that if
you aren't a big Prime member you could
probably still use this phone to a
pretty good potential yes as you go
through the fire OS you're going to see
links everywhere about buying this or
shopping for that and yes that's the
reality of an Amazon product at this
point but it's actually not going to be
as bad if you are able to use other
services to get your stuff done anyway
like listening to music on Spotify or
watching movies on Netflix or HBO GO all
those are still going to be possible one
of the big features about this phone is
the fact that well it does have a good
performing it seems like at least that's
that what their claim was 13 megapixel f
2 point 0 0 is camera which is pretty
nice that's pretty much the spec that
you would expect from a flagship device
but all of your photos literally
everything that you do through that
camera is uploaded to Amazon Prime
servers for free unlimited storage and
it's basically the cloud service of
everyone's dreams where they can
literally put anything on there that
they want everything will be backed up
automatically they'll be easily share
all most likely to all of the services
that you want and that's that's kind of
a big deal because cloud storage is kind
of the future at least for a number of
people i know i use cloud storage quite
a bit and it's really something that
Amazon is pioneering with this
particular feature on the fire phone so
what does it take to get this phone well
it is on pre-order now and will start
shipping on july twenty fifth and is
exclusively found on 18t for the price
of 1 99 on two year contracts without a
contract at six hundred forty nine
dollars now I know what you're thinking
that's kind of a more conventional price
for a smartphone then let's say you're
used to from Amazon given that they're a
pretty good company when it comes to
creating hardware at affordable prices
now in the past the reason why is
because even though the bill called it
was very nice there wasn't anything
particularly special about it that is
the case here on the phone as well but
with all of these features coming in and
the fact that you are going to tap into
not just multiple third-party ecosystems
like Netflix which is great but you're
also going to tap in hopefully at least
as Amazon's hope into the robust prime
membership ecosystem and that's a very
big deal for them because that's where
the big money lies so really what you're
getting and when you paid the
quote-unquote full price for the Amazon
fire phone when you probably think you
shouldn't have to is the experience and
the really banking on the fact that the
experience is what you want to buy and
for the most parts if you are already a
Prime member you probably will buy into
this particular phone because well if
you've had the kindle fire tablet
already you see how the prime
subscription really enhances the
experience on that device and that will
definitely be true for the phone so keep
it tuned to android authority for all of
the best coverage including the coverage
of the Amazon fire phone once we get our
hands on it and then after that keep it
tuned here drop us some likes on our
videos and subscribe if you haven't
already after that head on over to
android authority calm because we are
your source for all things android
