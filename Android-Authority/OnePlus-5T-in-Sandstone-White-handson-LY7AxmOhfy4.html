existing phones to be a bit of a cop-out
it's just an excuse for manufacturers to
take old phones and jumpstart sales by
building hype over a new color that
being said there is one model that I
just thought was too cool to not make a
video for I'm David ml with Android
authority and this is the one plus 5t in
white opening up the box it looks pretty
familiar to the regular 5 team but
you'll notice the white trim around the
rim once you actually take it out of the
box that's when you start to notice that
this is a whole new experience you look
at this nice clear case so you can show
off that white to all your friends color
is pretty strikingly white but the cool
thing about this colorway is that has a
bit of a sandstone finish to it the
regular 5 T was smooth and glossy to the
white very adds a grittiness that we
really haven't seen since the oneplus
one it also adds a nice grip when you're
holding the phone without a case and I'm
pretty tempted to use it without one for
the next couple weeks the buttons and
logo are a stark black color and it
looks really great with the dark camera
lens
it honestly reminds me of a stormtrooper
which is probably why they decided to
make the Star Wars edition white to the
physical notifications which sticks out
nice and bright changing it up with a
really beautiful saturated red and it
really sticks out around all that black
and white the y5t really makes you feel
like 1 plus has come back to their roots
not only are they using a gritty
material reminiscent of their first ever
release the black white and red color
scheme of the phone mirrors the theme of
the company as a whole
the screen is still great the
performance still great and yeah this is
the exact same phone and this might be
one of the first colorways that got me
genuinely excited since the feel in the
hand is so drastically different if
you're wanting a 5 T but you haven't
gone around to grabbing one yet or you
wanted that Star Wars edition but you
couldn't get your hands on one this is
really the next best thing make sure you
drop your thoughts in the comment
