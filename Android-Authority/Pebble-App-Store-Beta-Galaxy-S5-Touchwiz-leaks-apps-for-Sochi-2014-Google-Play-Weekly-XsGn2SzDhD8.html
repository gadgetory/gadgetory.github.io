brought to you by Linda calm head to
lynda.com / android for your free 7-day
trial and start learning new things
right now hello began ladies and
gentlemen is Joe handy the android
authority app guy and it's also friday
which means it's time for another
episode of google play weekly in this
week's episode we're going to talk about
some TouchWiz applications that got
leaked the pebble appstore beta and some
applications that help you can warm it
so cheap so let's get started let's
start out this week with some good news
after a few months of waiting couche has
finally been able to add chromecast
support to his all cast app this was
precipitated by the official release of
the chromecast sdk which means we'll see
a whole lot more apps get the chromecast
support in the coming months all cast
which was denied chromecast support some
months ago is one of the early adopters
of the new SDK according to reports it
took couche only 20 minutes to install
the update and as you can see here it
seems to work fairly well the update
should be available in the Google Play
Store right now and if not it should
only be a couple of days there are some
kinks to work out but it's nice to see
chromecast playing well with third-party
apps again the everythingme launcher
lets beta this last week and the oft
talked about launcher is already making
quite the splash the beta was wildly
popular with over a million downloads
and now the finished product is here
this app has a number of contextual
features help improve your experience
without getting in the way it's free in
the Google Play Store and it is AD
supported in the form of sponsored apps
we gave this app a spin and you can see
our full review over at our youtube
channel or linked here at the end of
this video we've no doubt that this is
going to be a wildly popular launcher
but it isn't without its problems namely
the presence of region locks which
pretty much prevents use anywhere
outside of north america which sucks a
whole bunch after a long wait the pebble
appstore is finally available for
android kind of initially the full
version was released for iOS with a
developer stating that the android
version would be along later however
there were some bugs that were going to
take a little bit longer than expected
to fix so instead of delaying the
android release they simply released it
as a beta some of the known issues
include difficulty pairing to the pebble
smartwatch and forcing people to close
out of applications before they can
alter their phone settings through the
pebble there is no timetable for a
stable release just yet but the devel
the firs have said that people can
expedite the process by trying out the
beta and submitting bug reports it's
pretty much known that the NSA can spy
or at least has the capacity to spy on
everybody with a smartphone but a new
application by chainfire may make it a
little bit more difficult to do the
application is called prof I and here's
how it works your device has what is
called a MAC address and using that MAC
address applications your device and
certain government agencies can track
your location when your mac address pops
up on a Wi-Fi network so let's say you
go from your home to the airport when
you login to the airport Wi-Fi trackers
can go hey look there's that MAC address
again that dude must be at the airport
what this app does is randomized your
mac address so that this doesn't happen
it doesn't affect location services of
applications google maps can still see
exactly where you are and soaking
applications like facebook and
foursquare the difference is that your
mac address has changed so those who
attract you using your mac address can
no longer do so because it's random and
different every time you connect to a
new Wi-Fi network it's nifty it's great
for privacy and it's available in the
Google Play Store right now for free
it's getting to be that time of year
when OEMs are announcing their flagship
devices for the year so it's no surprise
that we're seeing some potential leaks
of Samsung's latest TouchWiz the first
one was as health and along with delete
came the rumor that this will be
packaged with the galaxy s5 it features
a new hollow tastic interface with a
flatter design more colors and less
TouchWiz for those who think that
samsung and google are working together
this should probably strengthen that
argument because it is way different
than last year's design the other big
leak was s voice like s health s voice
seems to have a brand new design that's
flatter and more colorful according to
reports this new version of s voice is
faster and more reliable than last
year's offering but only by a little bit
even though I'm one of those people who
loves all of Android including TouchWiz
even I'm like dude just go with Google
now already even so at least the design
has been improved so who wants to see
some trending applications in this
week's edition we're going to go over
some applications to help keep you
up-to-date in the sochi 2014 winter
olympics as usual if you want to check
out any of these applications you can
find the links in the written companion
which is in the video description first
up is Yahoo Sports having surpassed ESPN
as the
most popular source of sporting news
it's a natural choice for keeping up
with the Olympic Games you'll have
access to news as it happens along with
rosters based on nation simply put it's
a worldwide source of sporting news and
it's one of the best next up is sochi
2014 wow with this application Samsung
device owners can keep up with what's
going on in the Olympics one nifty
feature is a guide that explains what
each event is and how to play that
particular sport which can be helpful
and for those who are wondering Wow
doesn't actually mean the term that
expresses aw but actually stands for
wireless Olympic works NBC's Olympic
highlights app does pretty much what the
title says it does it delivers
highlights and video and photo format so
you can see what you may have missed in
Sochi it's not a comprehensive news
application like some of these other
ones but it is a good and quick way to
find highlights in your favorite events
if you're not down with reading all of
the articles or viewing all of the
highlights 2014 sochi winter games app
is a really good option all this app
really does is provide a metal counter
and a schedule of the day's activities
and times that's really it folks
something nice and easy for quick
reference finally the score updated
their application specifically for the
Olympic events which means there are a
lot of fun and useful features for those
who want to keep track this includes a
metal alert notification
up-to-the-minute news and separate
sections for men and women as well as
hockey because this is a Canadian new
source it's free and it'll have good
coverage plus it has good coverage of
other sports year-round so it's an all
around good option once again I'm Joe
