Android authority now maybe you've heard
the term CPU scaling or maybe CPU
frequency scaling or even dynamic
voltage and frequency scaling and you've
wondered what they mean well today I'm
going to try and explain so if you're
ready let's go one of the key
characteristics of mobile computing and
maybe the most obvious characteristic is
that all of our smartphones and tablets
and laptops run from a battery desktops
and servers run from the mains and
therefore they don't have power worries
they can just draw as much power as they
need but smartphones in particular have
a battery and the more power they draw
the quicker that battery will drain now
it turns out there's a direct
correlation between the frequency the
clock frequency of a CPU one gigahertz
1.5 gigahertz 2 gigahertz and the amount
of power that it needs that's because
there are all these transistors inside
of the chip and every time they have to
switch that uses air power and therefore
if you switch them less frequency then
there's less power used you could think
about it maybe like the Reds of the
engine in your car the more you rev your
engine the more petrol the more gas will
be used now when you're using your smart
phone maybe you're reading a web page
for example while you're actually
reading the text as phone is doing very
very little so it doesn't need to be
running at 2 gigahertz just to keep
displaying that webpage to you so
actually there's a system that's inside
the limits kernel and inside Android
that allows the frequency to be scaled
to be changed automatically when the CPU
isn't very busy and so this is called
CPU scaling and when the CPU seated for
nothing to do it's in the idle mode then
it works that it needs to slow down the
CPU fat there's also a stake where you
can switch off a core or switch off a
couple of calls but that's a different
subject than today now of course once
you then start to use your web
application again we started playing
game or you have to do something else
then of course the CPU frequency needs
to go back up again so this scaling
works in both directions
and it actually also turns out that when
you're running the CPU at a lower clock
frequency you actually don't need as
many volts to power that chip so you can
actually
or to the vault at the same time in
tandem with the clock frequency and
that's where we get the term dynamic
voltage and frequency scaling devfs
because both the vault and the clock
frequency are changed at the same time
now controlling this is a thing called
the governor the CPU scaling governor
and on Android it's set in the mode
interactive and it's the interactive
mode because it has a little trick
inside of it and that as soon as you
touch the screen then the CPU is wrapped
up instantly to give the user that fast
feedback to a UI interaction now if you
want to see the CPU frequency scaling in
action you can download an app like
cpu-z CPU Z depending on how you
pronounce it now inside that there's
information about your make of your CPU
and the model number the number of cores
and there's also a section which talks
about the clock frequencies and the way
the clock frequencies change inside the
app are actually dynamic you can see
maybe some of them are stopped some of
them are running at 300 megahertz and
then if you do something like scroll the
app up and down you'll see that it jumps
up to a higher frequency in fact if you
see running at a low frequency let's say
300 megahertz if you just touch the
screen you'll see it quickly jump up
because this is the interactive governor
working in anticipation of some UI
interaction with the user now it's also
possible to change the governor on an
android but to do that you need to have
a rooted phone there are several apps in
the App Store that allow you to change
it and there are some stories that if
you change it you get better performance
and maybe different battery life and so
on and some of it's true and some of
it's also a load of Miss information you
have to remember this one thing that
smartphone manufacturers spend millions
and millions of dollars designing and
building and selling these smartphones
and you would think that if they knew
there was a better governor out there
they would change it to give to use that
new governor in fact the interactive
governor is the best governor for
Android otherwise as I said they would
all be changing to the other one or even
writing their own which has been known
in the past but that's a whole another
story not for now now if you're a
developer I just wanted to point out
that this change from a low-frequency
state to a high-frequency state can take
around 20 milliseconds so if you're
doing some system profiling and you see
that you have a
dropped frame may be the beginning of a
particular segment in your program that
is probably likely due to the fact that
the CPU has to ramp up from a low
frequency state to pay high frequency
state so there's nothing much you can
really do about it but now you know why
it's happening now of course there is
more going on inside your CPU than just
DV FS one of the big changes that we've
seen last year that will continue this
year in many many phones is the use of
heterogeneous multi-processing or big
dot little from arm and that's what we
find these octa-core phones where you
have maybe four cortex a 72 cores and
four cortex a53 cores and what happens
is when the phone gets busy it switches
from using the lower performance a53
calls but they have a higher energy
efficiency and it starts using the more
power-hungry but faster cortex a 72
cause now if the dynamic voltage and
frequency scaling is like revving the
engine in your car then this is like
changing gear you change from one to the
other and the original implementations
are big got little the software
component or big got little use the
devfs system to switch from one quarter
other when it got to a certain limit it
would say well this core can't cope this
anymore let's switch over to a higher
power corner that's still actually one
of the basic principles but now the
whole thing is actually a lot more
complicated because the scheduler takes
into account not only what's going on
but it take into account maybe the
temperature of this of the CPU so it
knows whether it can reach a certain
level or not because otherwise there's
overheating and armor actually working
on an energy aware scheduler for Linux
for Android which will actually mean
that maybe rather than putting on a non
active core which maybe would be the
best choice in terms of performance it
might actually put a task on to an
already running core because actually
that's more energy efficient because
it's an energy aware scheduler rather
than starting up a whole new core and
ramping it up and start using energy for
that but that's coming out in this year
2016 and we'll start seeing that in
phones maybe towards the end of the year
that isn't there yet so as you can see
there's lots going on inside of the
processor to make sure it uses the
optimum out of battery the option amount
of power but yet delivers you the best
level of performance my name is Gary
Sims from Andrew authority
I hope you really enjoyed this video if
you did please don't forget to give it a
thumbs up also ever get to use the
comments blow to tell me what you think
about devfs what you think about edge to
Dias multi-processing what you think
about big dot little what you think
about energyaware scheduling what you
think about any of the technologies are
being used inside of your processor in
your smartphone to make sure that gives
you the best performance yet with the
best battery life also don't forget to
subscribe to and Reuters youtube channel
also you can follow me on social media
and ask for me I'll see you in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
