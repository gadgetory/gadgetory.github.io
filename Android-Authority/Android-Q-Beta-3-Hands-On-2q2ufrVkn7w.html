Authority and today Google had their
Google i/o keynote where they of course
talked a lot about Android cue and they
also rolled out the Android cue beta 3
update for pixel devices but you can
also flash this on a bunch of non pixel
Android phones like the oneplus 60 which
is pretty cool so let's go ahead and go
over some of the changes you can expect
to see in the Android cue beta 3 and
also some of the changes you can expect
to see in Android cue when it rolls out
officially later on this year so I have
the Android cue beta 3 release running
on my pixel 3 XL and while Android cue
focuses a lot on quality of life
improvements and under the hood
improvements that doesn't mean that
there aren't some aesthetic or visual
changes and one of the biggest and
probably most long-overdue changes is an
official dark theme so if you scroll
down and check your notification shade
you now have a actual toggle for dark
theme which you can enable just by
tapping on it and this was a feature
that was sort of seen in the beta 1
release but if you didn't have dark mode
enabled on Pi before flashing cue you
didn't have the dark mode and if you
wanted it you had to enable it through
ADB and it was sort of a janky
experience but now you actually have the
official dark mode on beta 3 with a
toggle to turn it on and off which is
really nice and as you can see it does
give you a true black at least in your
notification shade and also in your
settings menu and your notifications
themselves will also be blacked out as
well but not everything is a hundred
percent true black so you don't get
battery saving properties across the
board if you have AMOLED screen so if
you take a look at your app drawer for
example it's sort of it it has an
opacity effect to it and the same thing
applies with the Google feed so the
background is transparent and then your
Google cards are actually more of a dark
shade of grey so you don't actually get
any better saving properties from that
but overall I think it looks really good
and it's nice to finally have it
officially baked into Android with the
beta 3 update Google's also change the
way that gesture controls work so now
it's completely 100% gesture base this
means that there's no more back button
and it's a little bit more similar to
the iPhone or the oneplus 60 but it's
also a little bit different as well so
if you swipe up
from the the pill down at the bottom
there it does take you home and if you
swipe up and hold this will take you
into your recent applications you can
also get to your recent apps by swiping
right on the bar below and this will
take you through each individual app one
by one and if you want to go back you
just swipe inwards from either the left
or the right side if I swipe in here
it'll take me back and I swipe in from
the right it'll also take me back now
one thing that this does sort of get rid
of is you can't swipe in from
applications that have a ham hamburger
menu now so it google play for example
if you swipe in it's not going to bring
the hamburger menu open it's just gonna
take you back so instead you're gonna
have to tap on the icon instead to open
it so that's a little bit different and
the swipe in to go back will take some
getting used to but overall I do like
this gesture navigation way better than
the one that we had with Android Pi
Google is also focusing a lot on privacy
and security with Android q and with the
Android Q beta 3 update there is now a
dedicated privacy section in the
settings menu that pretty much puts
privacy front and center and it makes
things a lot easier to find like your
app permissions for example which has
now been renamed to permissions manager
is now only a couple of taps away
whereas in Android Pi it was a little
bit more buried there also adding a new
feature called location reminders
because there are a ton of apps out
there that use our location and it could
be hard to keep track of what all those
apps are so location reminders will
basically be like hey this app is still
using your location and you'll have the
option to change the way that it acts as
your location if you want perhaps the
biggest change with privacy and security
is the way that Google is handling their
security updates so now security updates
are going to be over-the-air and they're
pretty much going to be updated the same
way that apps from the Google Play Store
are being updated so this means that
you're going to get security updates a
lot faster and you're also going to be
able to update your phone without having
to reboot it and this will probably
benefit a lot of other OEMs
out there that aren't quite as quick
with security updates so it's pretty
much going to be a win-win situation for
everybody
Google also talked about a lot of
features today that we won't be
until later on this year and one of
those features is called live caption
and live caption is meant to benefit
people that are deaf or hard of hearing
with instant caption and it's going to
work across pretty much any application
that produces audio so whether that's a
video app like YouTube and audio
application like podcasts or even video
chat apps like Google do oh and it's
processed completely locally so third
parties can't listen in on it and you
can also use it when you're offline
another feature that you can expect to
see with Android cue is something called
focus mode and this is another digital
well-being feature that's meant to
separate you more from your phone and
allow you to do other things so you can
disable any apps of your choice to
prevent you from getting distracted and
allow you to will focus on other stuff
and it's sort of like the app timers and
digital well being - the whole timer
part of it and the cool thing about this
feature is that it's not only just
coming to Android cue but it's also
going to be available with Android PI
devices as well later on this fall
Google is also adding something else
called family link which is going to
allow you to set screen time limits
approve app installs and also set
bedtimes the next feature that I want to
mention is called Smart replies and
smart replies isn't necessarily new it
already exists in Android but Google is
making some improvements to it to make
it even better in Android q so it's
going to work across all messaging apps
and android q and on top of these
suggested replies that you get you're
also going to get something called
suggested actions so for example if
somebody sends you an address instead of
copying the address opening up Google
Maps and then pasting the address and
conducting a search you can now do all
of that with a simple press of a button
which not only saves you a lot of steps
but ultimately a lot of time before I
wrap up this video there's a couple of
other things that I want to mention with
Android cue 1 it's going to have native
support for 5g and 2 it's also going to
support foldable devices and have a
feature called app continuity so for
example if you're playing a game when
the phone is folded up and you happen to
unfold it the app will automatically
rescale to fit the main display and also
be exactly where you left off but that's
pretty much it for Android cue and the
beta 3 release let us know your thoughts
down in the comment section below let us
know what feature of Android Q is your
face
Ritt leave that again in the comments
and as always if you guys enjoy this
video give a thumbs up we definitely
appreciate it and I'll talk to you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
