Android Authority and today we're taking
a look at the honor magic to this phone
is available only in China so if you
live here in the US or any other regions
really it's gonna be a little bit
difficult to get your hands on one but
this phone has a lot of really neat and
interesting things going for it but
before we get into all that let's just
go over some of the hardware specs
really quickly so it has a Kirin 980
processor inside which is the same chip
set that's in huawei's very powerful
mate 20 pro so you have the same
processing power in the honor magic too
and this is a very fast and fluid
smartphone because of that you also have
plenty of RAM but six or eight gigabytes
of RAM and 128 or 256 gigabytes of
internal storage it also has a 3400
milliamp hour battery which is a little
bit smaller than some of other Huawei
smartphones but it's still more than
enough I'm getting around five hours of
screen on time fairly consistently and
it also has a 40 watt fast charger
included in the box which will get you
50% in only 15 minutes now this phone
does not have expandable storage but
with the amount of storage that you get
inside of the phone already I don't
think that's too big of a deal it also
doesn't have wireless charging or a
headphone jack and it's also not IP
certified against water and dust and
that's mostly due to this slider design
and when you have a moving part like
this it's a lot more difficult to make a
phone water and dust tight the slider
mechanism is also going to raise a lot
of concerns about hardware failure but I
don't really see the slider failing
anytime soon it feels very solid and
sturdy and everything clicks neatly into
place when you slide the phone open or
closed so I think the slider is gonna
last for a very long time
the automatic two is not the only phone
out there with this slider form factor
the me mix 3 from Xiaomi also uses the
same slider design and that phone is
probably going to be the better choice
if you want a phone with this particular
design just because the me mix 3 has a
much wider availability now having a
slider mechanism on this phone
accomplishes a couple of things one the
screen is surrounded by extremely
extremely thin bezel
without resorting to a knotch and the
screen is fantastic not just because it
has thin bezels and not just because it
doesn't have a notch but also because
it's just a good-looking panel it's an
AMOLED screen that's very vibrant and
colorful it's a great looking display
the other thing that this slider
mechanism does is it allows the
front-facing cameras to be hidden so
when you slide the phone open this will
reveal three front-facing cameras this
is three of the six cameras that are on
this phone but only one of the
front-facing cameras actually takes
photos which is the one in the center
and it's a 16 megapixel sensor the other
two cameras are 2 megapixels for 3d
facial recognition and also portrait
mode effects so this phone does have
face unlock and it's a little bit more
advanced than some of the face unlock on
other smartphones and I use the face
unlock on here quite a bit I like it a
lot more than the fingerprint sensor
that's on the magic 2 because the magic
2 uses an N screen fingerprint sensor
which is great and I think it's the
future of fingerprint sensors but I've
used a couple of phones that have n
screen fingerprint sensors at this point
and they all have one thing in common
and it's the fact that they're all very
slow and unreliable and the experience
is pretty much the same on the magic -
this technology is definitely gonna get
better over time but we're just not
quite there yet on the back of the honor
magic - is a 16 megapixel primary sensor
that's paired with a 16 megapixel
wide-angle lens and a 24 megapixel
monochrome sensor that's there for
capturing black-and-white photos and
again portrait mode effects and the
camera on the honor mat - is actually a
really great camera it takes fantastic
looking photos that are very sharp very
well detailed color reproduction is
fantastic
it also has really excellent dynamic
range I would say it's even on par with
something like the pixel 3 it captures a
ton of shadow and highlight detail and
you can really notice that a lot when
shooting in low-light low-light photos
on the
camera look amazing it's an incredible
camera when it comes to image quality it
also has a I scene recognition built in
which takes advantage of the NPU so it
can recognize a bunch of different
things from pets food plants cityscapes
you name it and it's supposed to make
your photos look better and it
definitely does do that but I don't
always notice the difference between the
AI version and the non AI version but
you can use this feature if you want but
if you prefer to tweak your photos
yourself it's better to have this
feature turned off if you rather edit
your photos in post the software in here
is Android 9pi but it's running a custom
skin called magic UI 2.0 which is
basically the same thing as emui so if
you like emui you'll feel right at home
here on the magic too and if you don't
like emui this phone really isn't gonna
do a whole lot to change your opinion
one of the more unique features of the
software is this virtual assistant
called yo-yo and apparently it's machine
learning capable and it's able to read
your mind which honestly sounds a little
bit weird and creepy but unfortunately I
wasn't able to test it because it only
understands Mandarin so that's really it
for the honor magic - it's a really cool
device that has a lot of interesting
things going for it it's just
unfortunate that it's not coming to any
other regions outside of China but
hopefully we'll get more phones like
this in the future that are more widely
available but what do you guys think
