first introduced the very first Moto X
it was really cool you could customize
it online with any back textures that
you wanted or any colors you wanted and
they would send the phone to you exactly
how you wanted not a whole lot of tech
companies are doing that nowadays except
for one Withings the same company that
was bought by Nokia a few years ago is
now back on its own again and making
smart watches on its own with its own
small team and they are allowing you to
customize your very own hybrid watch
here at CES 2019 they just announced the
Withings move and Withings move ECG the
regular weddings move it's just a basic
activity tracker and it looks like an
analogue watch it's really cool and it
only cost $70 the more expensive one is
130 and it actually comes with an
electrocardiogram so it's called the
Withings move ECG you may have heard the
term ECG thrown around with smartwatches
recently because Apple recently included
one in its latest Apple watch so the
Apple watch only works with iPhones and
so if you're an Android user you don't
really have a ton of options out there
for you know consumer ready ECG products
but that's what the way things move ECG
is here to do now at only 130 dollars
it's actually a pretty affordable option
if you are already going to the doctor
for heart issues the way things move ECG
is actually really easy to use all you
do is put two fingers on each side of
the bezel and your smartphone will
automatically start recording your
heartbeat and it will be able to tell
you if you're having heart palpitations
or any early warning signs of anything
serious now after you're done and if
you're satisfied with your results
obviously you can just go about your day
but if you notice something serious you
can actually send those results straight
to your doctor and that's huge
they are activity trackers but they
don't track everything so first of all
they don't have an onboard heart rate
sensor and that's kind of a big thing
for some people they also don't have a
built-in GPS which you usually only get
with more expensive
vices but they do have connected GPS so
you can actually pair it with your phone
and go out on a run and it uses your
phone's GPS if you want to get your
hands on the wings move or Withings move
ECG you can preorder both of them right
now like I said before the weddings move
cost $70 it's only available in five
color options at the start but later on
in the year they'll open up the
customization options oh and one more
thing if you are a u.s. resident and you
want to customize your own walk with
things is actually fulfilling all US
orders in the US just like moto maker
did years ago so you shouldn't have to
wait a super long time between ordering
your device and having a chip out it
won't ship until later on in the year
and you do have limited color options so
the customization is only gonna be for
the cheaper model so I really like this
SmartWatch and I want to know what you
guys think please leave a comment down
below and tell me your thoughts and if
you like this video be sure to give it a
thumbs up and of course Android
authorities here all week at CES 2019 so
be sure to stay tuned to our channel and
we'll bring you some more tech coverage
throughout the week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
