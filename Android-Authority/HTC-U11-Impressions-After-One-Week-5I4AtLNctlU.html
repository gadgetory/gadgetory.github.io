Authority and I've spent roughly a week
if not more with the HTC u 11 and while
that may be enough time to do a full
review I've actually been using a
Taiwanese version of the u 11 so it's
not optimized for us networks and until
we get a US version of the u 11 which
should be pretty shortly we're going to
hold off on the full review just to make
sure things like battery life and
network performance are as accurate as
possible but because I've been using the
U 11 for quite some time now I can still
talk about what it's like to use the U
11 as a daily driver and share with you
guys my initial thoughts and first
impressions so because there's just a
quick first impressions I'm not going to
talk about specs or go into full detail
about every aspect of the phone we're
going to save that for the full review
and instead I'm just going to talk about
a few things that have stood out to me
and what I like and don't like about the
U 11 so far first let's talk about how
this phone looks and feels it carries
over a similar design that we initially
saw on the U ultra and even though it's
similar to the U ultra the design is
much more refined on the U 11 it doesn't
have a large camera bump like the u
ultra did and it has a smaller 5.5 inch
screen so it's much easy to use in one
hand the edges of both the front and
back glass curve down to meet the metal
frame giving it a very seamless feel
with no sharp or rough edges it's very
similar to what Samsung has done with
the Galaxy s8
it is very comfortable to hold but
because it's made mostly of glass and
doesn't have flat sides or chamfered
edges to help with the grip it does feel
quite slippery
I love the liquid glass surface don't
get me wrong it looks amazing and some
of the colors like solar red will shift
and change colors depending on the angle
and how the light hits it it's a really
cool effect but the mirror like finish
shows and attracts finger prints like
crazy and HTC seems to be pretty aware
of this considering they've included a
clear case inside of the box to not only
protect the U 11 but also keep away the
fingerprints one thing that you will not
find on the U 11 is a headphone jack and
HTC is pretty firm on sticking with this
decision so I wouldn't expect them to
bring it back any time soon the biggest
reason why it's because HTC feels they
can deliver a better audio experience
through
USB type-c port and I have to admit
audio sounds incredible on the u11 the
included.you sonic earbuds not only
sound really good but they also feature
active noise cancellation which works
extremely well for blocking out exterior
noise
they're definitely above and beyond the
typical pair of earbuds that you're used
to getting with your smartphone this
time around
HTC has also included a three-and-a-half
millimeter jack two USB type-c adapter
with the u11 which they didn't do with
the u ultra this means you can still use
your favorite pair of over the ear cams
and while my Audio Technica m50
X's aren't exactly the highest impedance
headphones in the world the u 11 drives
these headphones what's significantly
louder and fuller sound in comparison to
the galaxy s 8 that I was using prior
the biggest standout feature on the U 11
is the edge sense technology the sides
of the U 11 are pressure-sensitive and
this allows you to physically squeeze
the phone to activate a specific
function or open an app like the camera
or web browser it does sound weird to
squeeze your phone to make it do
something simply because it's not
something we usually do with our phones
but I really like this feature it works
well has a lot of practical uses and
isn't a gimmick like you may initially
think it would be because this is a
Taiwan version of the U 11 it's not
optimized for us networks and obviously
that's going to impact things like
network performance and battery life but
I still wanted to provide you guys my
experiences so far with the battery life
even though this is not a US model and
so far it's been surprisingly good and I
say surprisingly because it doesn't have
the biggest battery we ever seen in a
smartphone it's only 3000 milliamp hours
but it's lasted me comfortably through a
full day with a consistent 5 hours of
screen on time
which is really impressive so it has me
feeling very optimistic for what battery
life is going to be like on a US version
the last thing that has really stood out
to me so far is the camera so you might
have heard that the U 11 has to be
highest the ExoMars core ever received
by a smartphone and I'm not entirely
sure how much I buy into those scores
but the camera has been impressive and
I've thoroughly enjoyed using it I think
it's a huge improvement over last year's
HTC 10 which by the way wasn't even a
bad camera the photos are packed with
detail excellent color reproduction and
overall good dynamic range mostly
because the camera auto processes
everything as aged
are similar to the pixel video is also
really great the built-in OS makes for
some very smooth looking footage without
a whole lot of noticeable shakes jitters
or any sort of warping my favorite
feature about this camera is the new
acoustic focus feature which leverages
before microphones on the u 11-2 record
360 degree or 3d audio and when you zoom
in on a subject the audio would get
louder or more amplified it's a very
neat effect and simulates the act of you
physically getting closer to a concert
stage a person playing an instrument or
whatever the audio source may be
overall initial impressions of the you
eleven are very positive it's been a
very pleasant smartphone experience and
offer some really interesting and unique
features that really make a standout
which is exactly what HTC needed
especially if they really want to
capture the attention of consumers now I
didn't talk about hardware specs or the
display but it does tick all the right
boxes in those areas and will go more in
depth with that in the full review HTC
has a lot riding on the success of the U
11 and so far they're certainly on the
right track to delivering a homerun hit

11 let us know your thoughts down in the
