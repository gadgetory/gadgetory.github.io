you read the title of the video so you
know are we here what makes a phone
great at audio not good great
what makes it the best and no we're not
talking about blind listening test or
YouTube recording comparisons you can
actually prove which phones are best at
audio sure there's some level of
subjectivity to how we perceive sound as
humans but audio is physics not magic
there's some key objective things that
we can point to and say okay this phone
is better than this phone but what are
they let's find out so let's start with
the obvious smart phone speakers suck
like really bad so what determines the
best phone for audio isn't gonna be how
well it blasts music when you're
listening to it on the subway it's easy
for us to say that they're bad but it's
important to remember that they don't
suck because they're poorly made they
suck because of physics it's just hard
to get something so small to sound good
with such little power think of the
smallest decent sounding speaker you've
ever heard and now imagine trying to
squeeze that into something the size of
a smart phone several companies like
Dirac are trying to make the most of a
bad situation by implementing some
psycho acoustic trickery to make bass
sound better but the problem remains
that smartphone speakers simply aren't
capable of doing a good job currently to
be frank speakers are also kind of hard
to test for it because the way that
something sounds in perfect ideal lab
conditions doesn't really translate to
the real world as I'm sure your bedroom
like mine isn't an anechoic chamber
other sounds from the outside world will
drown out or mask notes of similar
frequencies meaning that you won't be
able to hear everything coming out of
the speakers if your speakers can't
overpower outside noise then you can't
hear it let's look at the LGV 35 for
example at an average sound pressure
level of 72 decibels at max volume it
has some significant issues with sound
quality because many of the most
important notes are 1/2 to 1/4 as loud
because of this it's far harder to hear
them when there's any sort of noise
around you let's look at some examples
here focus on the music not the noise
doesn't really sound good does it weak
speakers that can't overpower outside
noise just fall flat even the best
smartphone struggle here so if the
speakers aren't much to write home about
how does a phone stand out from the
crowd how does it set itself apart well
one way that phones do that is with the
features they offer for example if you
really want the best smartphone for
audio then you need a headphone jack
most people like boosted bass and a lot
of consumer headphones give you just
that it's not coming from the phone it's
your headphones if your music sounds bad
the bottleneck is your headphones 99
times out of 100 that's also why so many
people are adamant about keeping the
headphone jack there's a lot of really
good headphones out there that use a 3.5
millimeter plug and they're often a lot
cheaper than two Bluetooth cans if
you're gonna limit what your phone can
connect with you need good options to
use the connection standards that you
have and at the moment there's far more
really great headphones and in ears with
wires than there are with Bluetooth or
USB C headphones maybe that'll change in
a future but for right now the best
audio experience comes from a 3.5
millimeter connection even USBC
headphones which should have offered a
better experience than the hundred euro
trrs tech don't really have any high
quality or even good options
trust us just Google USB C headphones
USB C headphones also seem to be slowing
down on releases as well just because
no-one's really buying them people are
finding compatibility issues even within
the same brands the oneplus USBC earbuds
for example work perfectly fine with the
60 but not with the older 5 T that's not
great where the headphone jack works on
just about everything
USB C just doesn't and that's even true
of the dongles there's not a single
dongle that works on every smartphone
and that's a problem now if you plan on
using bluetooth headphones then the next
thing you should be aware of are the
Bluetooth codecs luckily most newer
Android phones have many of them baked
into the OS like aptX apdex HD AAC and
sony's l dec unfortunately they don't
all work as they're supposed to
especially AAC which just isn't up to
snuff on Android devices though to be
fair it does work fine on iOS devices
and each connection will add very
amounts of noise that usually isn't very
audible however Bluetooth can sometimes
mean intermittent disconnects no music
when the battery runs out and limited
bandwidth issues lastly there's the
extra audio stuff that isn't really a
huge deal but just nice to have an
example of a random audio perk you might
want to consider is something like Dolby
Atmos support which might be important
if you plan on watching a lot of video
on your phone if you want to take it a
step further then you might also want
the better built-in deck or internal
amplifier in order to adequately power
some higher impedance headphones ok so
after all that let's prove ourselves a
bit we can tell just exactly how good or
bad each phone can read a music file
process it and output a signal by
measuring it ideally the phone wouldn't
change anything at all from the original
recording making this note higher than
that note adding Distortion you get the
idea in general we're looking for any
errors that you could possibly hear like
low dynamic range high noise or
frequency response deviations over 2
decibels so we use a pretty simple setup
to test the phone's physical output port
whether that's a 3.5 millimeter audio
jack or a USB C port and dongle while
there's lots of little variations
sometimes usually it's so minor that
you'd never know it was there bluetooth
on the other hand does sometimes have
audible errors but we encourage you to
check out our huge article linked below
on the subject basically Bluetooth
connections aren't as stable as a wire
and sometimes that can mean audible
issues last year we found that some
codecs will present some noise where it
shouldn't even exist even in ideal
conditions where lots of other devices
aren't interfering with your signal see
all of that noise above the dotted red
line yeah not good this isn't a problem
on wired if you're on Android you'll
probably want to stick to aptX HD or L
deck at 660 kbps neither of which
technically provides as good quality as
a wired connection but you'd never know
unless you have absolutely perfect
youthful ears if audio is important to
you then the best smartphone for audio
is basically one any phone with a
headphone jack - any phone that can
power your wired headphones if you have
any and three a phone with speakers that
can get loud even if they suck the
technical differences between phones are
to minut to make any real-world
differences
so as long as the phone you pick has
those three pillars then you're golden
and that pretty much does it thanks for
