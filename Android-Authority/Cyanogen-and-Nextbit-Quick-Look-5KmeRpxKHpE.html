Hindy the android authority app guy and
in this quick video we're going to take
a glance at the new cyanogenmod and next
bit project let's get started okay
here's how next bit works it transfers
application data from one device to
another think of it like a mixture of
cloud saving and NFC so say you're
working on something on your phone and
you want to switch to your tablet you
can use next bit to beam over a snapshot
of what you're doing and then you can
resume what you're doing on your tablet
it uses the recent apps button which to
this point has really only ever been
used as a recent apps button you would
long press that button and then the
options would pop up to ask you which
device you want to shoot this data over
to you select the device press the
button and the application will open on
that device with all of your work in
tact ready to go there appears to only
be a few limitations here you'll have to
have the same applications installed on
both devices so next bit can open the
application and put the data in so if
you're like me and you use some apps on
your phone and some apps on your tablet
you'll have to switch to using the same
apps on both now arguably the much
cooler aspect of next bit is its ability
to sync games and applications in the
background which means you don't have to
shoot it over to sync apps if you don't
want to continue what you're doing right
then and there if you're playing a game
on your phone and you want to continue
on your tablets you can do that as well
now you may be wondering what this is
useful for and the answer is practically
everything you can use this to send the
contents of your browser to the larger
screen of your tablet for easier reading
or you can send it from your tablet to
your phone in case you need to go
somewhere and you don't plan on taking
your tablet let's look at it another way
and say that you're working on a
document the system in place right now
requires you to save the documents
upload to cloud storage download from
cloud storage on the other device open
the application and then find and open
the file this can take a minute if your
connection is good and your devices are
high-end or it can take significantly
longer if one or both of those
statements aren't true in an instance
like that next bit saves a lot of time
like I said at the beginning this is
just a quick look video that I wanted to
put together to show you guys how this
works we expect there to be a lot more
information about features usability and
device supports we'll keep an eye out
here at Android authority because will
tell you about it as soon as we know
more if you haven't yet don't forget to
subscribe to the YouTube channel thanks
again for watching everybody and have a
one
all day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
