intelligence is supposed to be big but
exactly how big and to give you some
perspective you should note that for
many years Google would say that they
are a mobile first company until just
this past year they said that they are
an AI first company that has some pretty
massive ramifications but more
specifically for those of you interested
in Samsung's new flagship the s8
Samsung's VP of mobile communications
one of the record' recently by saying
that the s8 would have enhanced
artificial intelligence services exactly
what does he mean by enhanced well let's
start off let's first talk about what we
know and what we know is that Samsung
recently acquired an AI firm called viv
labs the company admitted that it was
bringing a new AI digital assistant to
the Galaxy s8 and other Samsung products
since then we've heard more reports
about a Bigsby and castra the male and
female voices Samsung trademarked for
its new voice assistant Samsung Bigsby
will reportedly be able to handle your
mobile payments using voice commands
alone courtesy of a feature called
Bigsby pay Samsung has also commented
previously on being able to use its new
voice assistant to order pizza or
request an uber all of this will be
achievable through Bigsby alone without
needing to launch your pizza app or uber
app and that's not all the platform on
which Bigsby is built supports IOT
devices and will be used to connect
smart appliances mobile devices and more
with this in mind Bigsby might end up
being a phone based competitor to the
likes of Google home or Amazon Alexa
rather than just a serie or Cortana and
this is a pretty important distinction
because I think that Samsung is not just
trying to create another better
competitor to Surrey or Google Assistant
but we're talking about a whole new way
potentially of interacting with our
devices via voice commands instead of
this we're doing jean-luc Picard
tl gray hot now we know what some of you
are thinking you're thinking chase that
may be decades away before we're there
but not quite because there are major
improvements that have been happening
just in the past 12 months on the AI
front case in point
when you use Google assistant and you
say hey how old is Bruce Springsteen for
example and then immediately I follow up
that question with how tall is he
Google should understand in the context
of that question that I mean Bruce
Springsteen because in the past two
years ago when you just said how old is
Bruce Springsteen you would have had to
follow up that question with how tall is
Bruce Springsteen because Google
assistant would not understand the
context of the discussion but it does
now or it should and it's improving and
if that's true that actually happens and
it's consistent or reliable that's
fantastic people like my mother can use
Google assistant and not get frustrated
so why do I love our new sponsor ting
because ting saves you cash ting is a
mobile phone service that is helping
people like you save a lot of money on
their monthly cell phone bills ting is
not just lowering their mobile data
rates across the board but you also just
pay for what you use with ting and that
now also includes data for just $10 per
gigabyte visit a a tang comm and see how
much you can save with ting and on top
of that you'll get $25 towards your
first device or ting service</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
