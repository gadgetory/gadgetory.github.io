rumor train keeps on rolling Google TV
goes by way of Google Talk and our
screen start to bend to our wills hey
it's Josh regard from Android thority
what's going on everybody and it's time
for another dose of the week's top
android news it's Android Weekly in what
was a pretty quick confirmation of all
the rumors we had last week Samsung just
went ahead and announced the galaxy
round a 5.7 inch screen device that has
a flexible display this is a brand new
line for Samsung that looks to really
take advantage of that curve sporting a
5.7 inch o LED display this phone is
also packin a 2.3 gigahertz XE knows
quad core processor and three gigabytes
of RAM one of the features that we have
seen regarding the phone's curves is a
quick glance screen that appears when
you tilt the phone to your face an
issuer reports state that the phone's
curve does make the phone very
comfortable in the hand which will be
one of its main selling points however
not to be outdone LG announced that
their plastic based flexible displays
have gone into production their version
of a display with the curve goes from
top to bottom instead of sites aside
like Samsung screen and it comes in at 6
inches point 44 millimeters thick and
weighs 7.2 grams while we don't know any
more details about the smart phone that
this screen will go on nor the timetable
of its release reuters reported that the
LG's iteration will launch in November
okay now we have a lot of rumors
regarding Android and the new Nexus 5
however we're gonna start with the
software and then move on into the
hardware our first story is in regards
to Google Hangouts sources state that
the chat app will also become a
messaging app fully integrating SMS and
MMS a few images spill the beans
regarding a slight revamp accommodating
these new features it is unknown when
this update will roll out but we can
expect the hangouts app to override the
messaging app in our Nexus smartphones
much like what happened to Google Talk
speaking of revamp so we got a lot of
news regarding Android 4.4 Kit Kats main
changes and one of them will be in the
downloads application it will get a
better holo look and allow for easier
sorting and jumping among the list
another picture reveals what this will
look like ahead of the Android 4.4
launch another makeover is in the
location settings area instead of some
jumbled jargon of the orig
second screen we get better toggles
explaining which parts of the phone will
be used to figure out just where in the
hell you are all of this information has
yet to be confirmed but we will say that
these screenshots do pretty much look
legit stay tuned to Android authority
when Android 4.4 kitkat launches and
we'll have all the details ready for you
we started off the news week with what
might be the biggest leak yet for the
upcoming Nexus 5 an entire manual for
the phone made it online and essentially
told us everything we needed to know
about what's running underneath the hood
the long 281 page document shows a lot
of technical information but the main
bits were all excited to know about made
it in the new Nexus smartphone will
support a 5 inch full HD IPS display the
Snapdragon 800 clocked in at 2.3
gigahertz weight 139 grams and featured
an 8 megapixel camera that features
optical image stabilization from what I
know so far the manual has been taking
down from the post that we had on
Android authority but if you look hard
enough online I'm sure you still will be
able to find it now the pretty
substantial leak shows us more pictures
of the smartphone along with more
Android 4.4 pictures a tipster reported
that the phone is a little bigger than
the previous Nexus 4 but isn't quite all
heavier dual stereo speakers will make
for a very good audio listening
performance too as far as the user
interface goes some aesthetic changes
include the newly translucent
notification bar and a camera icon that
can be swiped in the lock screen to
easily enter the camera app the app
launcher icon has been changed as well
while the app drawer itself has been
given an even cleaner look with a 5 by 4
icon grid Google now has been updated to
allow for more ways to access the search
for one thing you can just say ok Google
while in the home screens and it'll pop
right up finally we see a couple new
additions in the settings menu in the
form of a tap and pay for utilizing NFC
to make payments from your phone and
then the cloud printing feature that was
previously reported there are a ton of
changes coming in Android 4.4 KitKat and
we know that all of this information are
all still rumors however we might
actually be getting some confirmations
very soon the Nexus 5 or perhaps it may
be called the Nexus 4 2013 edition looks
to have an announcement date of October
15 apparently the news was slipped
during a recent event Google hosted for
startups where developers reportedly
teased
key lime pie even though we all know it
as KitKat now technically we won't know
any real information
perhaps October 15th rolls around but if
it does happen to be the day that we
find out about the Nexus 5 and Android
4.4 we'll have all the information ready
for you at Android authority comm we
finally move on from these rumors with
some real announcements of a couple of
new Chromebooks HP squarely putting
itself into the Google game unveiled at
a Chromebook 11 this is a
wallet-friendly laptop coming in at just
279 dollars while still sporting some
good specifications Acer had their own
Chromebook in the wings and they made
sure to put their price point below that
of HP Acer's C 720 Chromebook also has
11.6 inch display but comes with a
hassle a powerful Intel processor
lending it to a possible battery life of
over eight hours pre-orders for both of
these Chromebooks are already available
now we move to Sony with the
announcement of their own mini s
offering the Xperia z1 F at the
lowercase F became official in Japan
this week and is quite literally the
smaller version of the powerful Xperia
z1 as it is still an aluminum and glass
clad smartphone with a 4.3 inch 720p
display we have a much more accessible
phone for the general user but no lack
of power the c1f will sport the
Snapdragon 800 processor and two
gigabytes of RAM along with the same
great 20.7 megapixel camera of the
original it looks like Google wants to
drop the Google TV name and somewhat
change it up
according to GigaOM confirmation of the
name change sees Google TV become
Android TV this isn't the only place
we've seen such a change however as some
current Smart TV offerings don't
explicitly say Google TV but instead say
access the latest Google services for TV
while we are still waiting for the
actual announcements regarding the
changes these services will get this is
certainly one main start and finally we
end on rumors regarding the Samsung
Galaxy s5 we are moving more and more
into the general season for the s5 and
it looks like along the way we're going
to be seeing how the galaxy s5 is a more
complete offering than ever despite
rumors that the Galaxy Note 3 will be
made into a ruggedized or active version
a report from a Korean website states
that the Galaxy s5 will have water and
dust resistance right out of the box
eliminating the need for an active
version without more substantial details
this rumor is somewhat supported by the
fact that the Galaxy s4 active was
actually a pretty popular phone perhaps
popular enough to make
Samsung changed their tune a little bit
and the galaxy s5 might be getting a
bumped up release schedule than was
originally expected it has been reported
that Samsung might be announcing the
phone in January with a release date of
just one month later rumors like this
always come up but with Samsung unhappy
with their s4 sales numbers getting the
next version ready sooner than later
might make some sense what we are
interested in hearing is that Samsung's
moved to 64-bit processing is very
likely in the s5 future annex II knows 5
octa 5430 processor capable of 64-bit
was also reported along with a 16
megapixel camera with OAS even if we are
quite a ways off from the Samsung Galaxy
s5 we shouldn't be surprised to see that
rumors are starting up even this early
in the game and so there you have it for
