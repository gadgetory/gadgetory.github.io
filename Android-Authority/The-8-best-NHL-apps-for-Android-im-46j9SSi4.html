handy the Android authority app guy and
it's almost hockey season on September
1st the puck will drop and fans will get
to experience a full season of hockey so
in this video we're gonna take a look at
some of the best Android apps you can
get if you're a hockey fan first up is
the obligatory nod to the official app
of the NHL called NHL GameCenter this
app features news standings scores and
stats from your favorite NHL teams and
if you're willing to shell out the extra
cash for it
you can livestream out-of-market hockey
games on your Android device the app has
its flaws though it doesn't perform
overly well in comparison to some of
these other apps for many people the
streaming doesn't work right so they
don't get to enjoy it as much at the end
of the day it delivers the news and
stats you need so it's still a pretty
good option if you're doing fantasy
hockey this year on Yahoo then this app
is a must-have with it you can change
your roster check League scores add and
drop players and even check out some
news with Yahoo's Puck Daddy blog if
you're a fantasy hockey buff this is the
app you're looking for the Yahoo fantasy
hockey leagues have just opened back up
so the app still display stats from last
season we assume an update is in the
making or that these old standings will
be eventually archived to make way for
the new ones if you're an early adopter
have patience because it took them a
couple of weeks last year to number six
on our list is big win hockey 2013 and
it's actually the only hockey game on
this list it's a hockey sim game where
you build and customize a team sim games
versus opponents online and earn coins
for cards that give you either more
players or various in-game boosts the
game is very simple this is no EA Sports
NHL title however for what it is it's
actually pretty fun and doesn't take a
lot of time to play so if you need
something to do for a couple of minutes
to get through a commercial this ought
to do it
number five on our list is the second
Yahoo app to make the list unlike the
last one which was for fantasy hockey
purposes this one is strictly for news
it's also the first on the list that has
other sports present so you can look at
other sports along with hockey the app
is fairly easy to use you can set your
favourite teams to get news about them
first you can then check schedules
scores news standings and even leaders
in various stat categories there is
nothing really wrong with it but there's
nothing that shouts Wow at you either
it's just a good solid app if you're a
fan of our YouTube channel and you
watched our best NFL apps you may
recognize this next one as we stated in
that list the score is a great source
for all sports and that includes hockey
which is why it's here again in case you
didn't see the NFL list here are the
basics for the scores official app you
can view all the essentials including
league leaders standing scores schedules
news and even player transactions it's a
well-crafted app that works well and
according to their Twitter handle they
have some big updates coming in the next
few weeks which is always exciting
the first in our top three is the second
repeat app from the NFL list which is
ESPN score center while ESPN's coverage
of the NHL on shows like SportsCenter is
pretty inconsistent their app makes a
much better effort to cover the NHL like
Yahoo and the score the ESPN app lets
you view the essentials like standing
scores news and videos their app has one
of the best designs on the list which
makes it just delightful to use you can
find more frequent news elsewhere but
pretty much everything else looks better
on this app number two on our list is a
nifty little app called my NHL if you're
not a fan of RSS feeds but you want to
get news from top sites this is probably
a good idea it's not an app in the
traditional sense but rather a wrapper
app for a number of mobile sites from
around the NHL many may not be excited
about getting a wrap or application but
it does have some good stuff going on
it's the only app on the list that
includes the bleacher report Sports Net
Hockey Night in Canada ESPN and a number
of other blogs and sites all in one spot
if you want an easy way to get it all
and don't mind the slower performance
this is actually a pretty good app to
try
and here it is the number one rated app
by you the people and it's the official
Bleacher Report app we actually missed
this one when talking about the NFL apps
but we vowed never to do so again really
these guys need to work on their
keywords they don't show up in many
searches as for the app itself it's
really quite unique what it does is let
you pick sports and teams you enjoy then
it loads the feeds from various Twitter
handles that deal with that news so if
you like the NHL you'll get stuff from
CBS Sports 2 Puck Daddy
each team follows writers and handles
known to give news to the team itself
it's the best out there if you need news
at a breakneck pace if you take a look
at our leaderboard you can see how all
these apps stack up against one another
this list as usual was determined by you
the people and not by us there is no
bias on our part to check them out the
app links are in the video description
hockey is one of the most personable
sports out there and we expected this
appleís to be no difference aside from
these most teams have their own personal
app if you want to keep up on just your
favorite team also in the video
description I have included a short list
of some awesome hockey podcasts be sure
to check out our best podcast appleís
to find the best app to listen to them
