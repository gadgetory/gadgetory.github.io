handy the Android a thority app guy
Android has fantastic security but
sometimes people want that little bit
extra just for peace of mind so today
we're going to take a look at
BitDefender Antivirus so what does this
app do in terms of functionality this
app does a bunch without requiring you
to do much of anything on the user's end
you simply press the on button close out
of the app and forget about it
meanwhile the app will keep an eye on
your apps and storage to make sure
nothing bad gets in that's really it
folks
like any other anti-malware app you can
use this app to protect your phone from
outside threats you simply fire it and
forget it it does the work behind the
scenes and leave you alone until it
finds something that you need to see
there is a scanning function to make
sure everything is ok but you really
only need to run it the first time you
open it so here's what we liked the app
is dead simple you open it you run a
scan and then you close it and forget
about it it does the rest it requires
very little resources and batteries so
it's good for older devices and lastly
it's free and really you can't beat free
and here's what we didn't like so much
its best features also somewhat of a
weakness if you need a full featured app
with things like anti-theft and privacy
checker you have to go download
bitdefender's full anti-malware app this
is just a simple little app for people
who want something running in the
background which means all non-essential
features have been stripped out all in
all we thought this was a pretty good
little app it doesn't get in the way and
hug resources like full-featured apps do
and there's no reason why it can't work
well on older devices or devices with
lower specs even though Android has
great built-in protection some people
want that little something extra and
that's what this app will give you once
