Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly this
week we're going to talk about some IFA
2014 stuff some Google stuff and the
upcoming hit game destiny without
further ado let's get started first up
this week samsung has announced the gear
s SmartWatch and it comes with flexi you
know I gotta hand it to flexi I've seen
that keyboard everywhere over the last
year or so and they are now mentioned
right alongside names like swype and
SwiftKey the latest news for flexi is
that it will be available on the Samsung
gear as SmartWatch which was announced
at IFA just a couple of days ago good
for you flexi hey in our next bit of
news I get to talk about bungees
upcoming hit game destiny sweet ok so
here's the news that's been making its
way around there is a thing called
destiny planet view it was created as a
collaboration between bungee and google
maps and it works a lot like Google
Street View except inside of the world
of destiny this is really cool because
few games have had this kind of
creativity when it comes to game worlds
and aside from ingress one of the few to
be powered by google maps to see it go
to ww ste planet view calm next up
google has finally updated their
beautiful apps list for those who may
not know the beautiful design list is a
list of applications and games that
Google felt were designed so well that
they deserved more attention a brand new
list was released just this last week
and contains such hit apps as Spotify
duolingo and yahoo news if you want to
see the whole list check out the written
companion which is linked in the video
description below or just pause the
video because it's scrolling by right
now the so Nokia's powerful here maps is
coming to android but unfortunately only
for samsung phones some may scoff at
this in favor of google maps but here
maps is no slouch and features
admittedly better offline support than
Google Maps does right now the sad part
is that will be only available for
samsung devices thanks to its
compatibility with the gear s SmartWatch
if you have a samsung device you'll be
able to pick this up in the google play
store on the same day the gear s comes
out in our last bit of news this week
the developers of Temple Run have
announced that Temple Run will be coming
to the galaxy VR it's something you may
actually get to do Temple Run has
announced they'll be bringing their hit
game to the galaxy VR with some built-in
features specifically for the galaxy VR
one thing specifically is that you
able to look backward and see the
monster chasing you which is admittedly
a pretty fun premise it'll also be a
first-person thing instead of a
third-person thing which it is now which
looks like it could be interesting to do
wants to see some trending applications
as usual if you want to check any of
these applications out you can find the
links in the written companion which is
in the video description below yes
google news and weather makes its second
consecutive appearance on the Google
Play weekly show this week another huge
update was released and included tablet
supports google sign and support and a
whole lot more they've also acknowledged
some bugs that they plan on fixing with
future updates namely with Xperia
devices some people hate this
application because Google now does a
lot of this but I don't hate things
except swing copters so I still think
you could give it a shot last year i
reviewed wipeout and it turned out to be
a pretty decent little time killer now
Activision has released wipeout 2 and I
expect much of the same some people have
complained a little bit about the
gameplay in various other elements but
it is new so I'm sure tweaks will be
made eventually it's great to play with
in-app purchases and that's a pretty
good price for bouncing around on some
giant red balls next up is an
application called boxy pad and it's
actually pretty useful it's a
collaboration tool that let you call
people but when you call people you can
talk or do a bunch of other things like
view and annotate cloud storage files
insert pictures emoticons handwriting a
text along with some other cool stuff
it's free to use with no in-app
purchases but it is also very new or so
beware of bugs the google chrome browser
hasn't updated throwing out that brings
to the iconic browser exactly one heavy
dose of material design along with that
you'll get simplified sign ins a
revamped incognito mode experience and
the boilerplate bug fixes and
performance improvements it's rolling
out in the google play store right now
so if you don't have it yet just be
patient because it's coming soon last up
this week is moby 360 launcher beta this
interesting launcher is another
contextual launcher that totally takes
over your homescreen much like
everything dot me and a v8 there are
some nifty features like built in
anti-malware features some device
monitoring features and of course some
contextual features it's in beta but it
still seems to work pretty well and it
is free if you want to stay up to date
