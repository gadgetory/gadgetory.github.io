Sony Xperia device the footage that
you're seeing right now is from the sony
xperia z3 and that feels like a long
time ago two years to be exact but since
then we have gotten iterations of the
Xperia Line pretty much every six months
and there are quite a few out there now
however this latest one brings a 4k
display and some of the best
specifications you might have ever seen
on a Sony Xperia device how does it
stack up
well it's Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody and this is our full review of
the sony xperia x z premium now while
the word premium is in the name it might
not be the absolute best word to use for
this film's design the premium is
definitely a looker with glass on glass
designs that support a dark blue sheen
and least in our review unit the
translucent color shines beautifully and
makes for a very sleek device but the
glass all over design is something that
has been tried and true in the Xperia
line before and it makes for a phone
that is ultimately all too familiar not
to mention the fact that it smudges up
by a fingerprint all too easily even
after just a short time of usage the
screen is 5.5 inches and we'll talk
about that screen later however there's
so much bezel on the top and bottom to
accommodate the front-facing speakers
and a few other bits and pieces it just
feels like this phone is a lot bigger
than it should be
especially when you consider how tall
this phone is compared to other phones
that we've seen this year that support
things like infinity displays or have 18
by 9 aspect ratios that allow for a
slightly taller but also more narrow
device all around but despite all of
this the handling could be a lot worse
the flat bottom and the flat top help
rest the phone squarely on a balancing
pinky and for the rounded sides are good
for a nice vice grip to keep the phone
from slipping about thankfully even if
it did slip the IP certification allows
this phone to take a dip and still keep
on going but my favorite part about the
exiting premiums design is the tactile
input the power button even if it's not
the big silver power button that I
remember from the experience I used to
review is really easy to find and is
very tactile thanks to its concave
design and then below it further down is
the dedicated camera button something
that I absolutely adore on this phone in
the previous 4k toting Xperia device the
high resolution was only used when 4k
content was detected
in this case its 4k all the time as far
as specs go this 5.5 inch display is
3840 by 2160 in total resolution making
for some of the sharpest rendering we've
ever seen and sony has injected into
this triluminos display it's bravia tv
technology that allows for great colors
and a lot of customization when you go
into the display settings there are so
many options to allow you to change not
only the color gamut but also the white
balance which allows for a very
impressive amount of control but let's
get back to that 4k resolution for all
intents and purposes having the
resolution turned up to 11 at all times
makes the screen really enjoyable there
is an upscaling that occurs when viewing
anything below that high resolution but
that is where the Brava capabilities
come into play nothing looked overtly
pixelated or blown up to the point of
distraction on the flip side 4k native
content is actually kind of hard to come
by if you're using Amazon Prime video
that's one good place to watch some 4k
content but if you're on YouTube you
have to sort of dig through a lot of the
4k content that might be sprinkled about
its library the biggest issue with a 4k
display is not how fun or how good it is
to use but just the fact that there's
not a whole lot of content out there
that doesn't take away too much from the
4k display it is just going to be a
little bit too ahead of its time to
really make it an essential feature now
one of the most enjoyable experiences I
had on the XC premium was playing Final
Fantasy 9 for extended periods of time
and thankfully the sharpness and color
in the game were still top-notch but
also there was powerful performance
thanks to the Snapdragon 835 that comes
with 4 gigabytes of RAM and together
they allow for a very speedy experience
and I really mean it the Android
iteration on this phone is one of the
smoothest and snappiest I have ever used
mainly because Sony have tweaked the
animations inside of the software to
make it feel that way but I never had
any problems with having multiple apps
open and plenty of them in the
background still remained and going in
and out of different applications to
multitask was also a breeze it is not
only a skin of Android but it's enough
of a custom built that it has caused a
few holes NFC is clearly marked on the
back with an NFC icon however when
trying to use this phone with Android
pay a complaint that this version of
Android is too custom this ROM made it
trigger its security features making
Android pay inoperable in my usage and
another bummer about this phone is that
the fingerprint reader is not available
in the West this change is sorely felt
because I used the xD premium houghton
type a while I was in Computex and using
the fingerprint reader on that phone was
actually pretty sublime unlocking the
device easily by just pressing the power
button because it is also reading the
fingerprint made for a very speedy
experience and as for the rest of the
inclusions the micro SD card slot can be
used as an extra SIM tray depending on
what market you're using this phone in
and it bolsters the already included 64
gigabytes of on-board storage the large
bezels make way for those stereo
front-facing speakers which are small
grilles on the front that provide not
necessarily a very loud sound but at
least a good stereo sound and things get
even better in the audio department when
headphones are plugged in there are so
many options for catering the audio
experience that listening to pretty much
anything is enjoyable clear Audio plus
returns and allows for an automatic way
of boosting the sound without having to
go through the buy new customizations
and there's even optional enhancement to
make compressed audio sound more like
lossless audio called DC HX to round it
all out noise cancellation is also built
into the headphone jack when using a
compatible headset there's very little
to complain about when it comes to the
audio of the sony xperia XV premium and
finally in battery life this 30 to 30
milli amp hour unit actually does pretty
impressive considering the 4k display
you would think that the XD premium
would really falter in this category but
with a 4k display pumping out all of
those pixels at all times it's actually
kind of nice that we got almost 4 hours
of screen on time I just want to say it
one more time I love this camera button
I just wanted to use that non-sequitur
to get to the camera of the XD premium
really though it's not all that I
enjoyed about the camera on the contrary
there's been a lot to like about this 19
megapixel sensors I can capture 4k video
and super slow-motion video at a
whopping 960 frames per second before
building up to that highest setting
there are a couple of other modes a 120
frames per second mode where you can add
the slow-motion afterwards or you can do
just a one-shot that it gives you a 5
second super slo-mo shot if you can
figure out where the best time to do it
is the main setting allows you to record
a 720p video and then hit a button when
you think that the slow-motion will be
most effective it might be a little bit
tough to find those perfect moments but
when you do get it the results are
pretty great unfortunately the super
slow-mo doesn't work very well in any
condition other than maybe broad
daylight
because
even in mediocre lighting it just looks
like a smudgy mess on the topic of video
I use the eggsy premium as basically a
vlogging camera during a couple of days
in Taipei and then out in New York I
enjoyed what videos came out of the
1080p mode however one of my gripes
about the software is that you have to
go into the extra mode selector just to
activate 4k it seems like one too many
steps to get to a feature that should be
easy to get to
especially for vlogging types like
myself but overall the video experience
was quite good and the same could be
said for picture taking the superior
auto is still a great go-to in order to
get the best possible shot given the
scene and tapping on any portion of the
viewfinder to focus the camera allows it
to track that portion for proper effect
pictures get a great amount of detail
given the 19 megapixels packed in but
color and exposure are pretty much where
they should be I did find in a couple of
photos that exposure was just a little
bit too high but that was more than
likely because it was trying to
compensate for the dark area it may have
tapped in lower light DXE premium is
only really hindered by the slower
shutter speed that needs to compensate
for the f2 Point no aperture a slower
shutter speed means that even small
movements could blur the photo a little
bit especially if you're using that
dedicated camera button to press the
phone down portraits also get a little
less loved because of that slightly
higher aperture there is less of a
bouquet effect compared to other phones
like the galaxy s 8 as a result but when
the detail is as high as it is it is
kind of a small trade-off and speaking
of portraits the front-facing 13
megapixel camera does a pretty good job
on its own so as the top manufacturer
for the world's most common smartphone
camera sensors it's good to see that
Sony is using its own hardware to great
effect and finally we can talk about the
software a lighter edition of Android
that comes in the x/z premium especially
when compared to let's cite LG and
Samsung counterparts the simplicity of
this version of Android is pretty easy
to see just at the home screen it still
uses an app drawer button and you can
swipe over and Google now is already
built in Sony's own applications however
do fall into that redundancy trap there
are a few applications here that seem to
be out of place when you consider that
Google's own additions are already built
in the photos and video applications are
right alongside Google photos and
there's even a news aggregator that
while it does look pretty good is right
next to the Google now that's like I
said built into the home screen
it might seem a little bit
counterintuitive one of the greatest
strengths of the Sony Xperia XE premium
is the fact that it doesn't try too hard
with the Android software and as we said
before the fact that it has been sped up
especially in its animations really
shows that this phone is really powerful
speedy and incredibly smooth the sony
xperia x z premium is not going to be
widely distributed on US carriers which
is a thorn in the side of sony that
they've been dealing with for the number
of years now however it is available for
seven hundred and ninety nine dollars on
e-commerce channels for unlocked
editions and this includes places like
Amazon and Best Buy and really I have to
say it was refreshing to come back to
the Xperia line after having such fond
memories of the menu that I used to
review and Sony has done a good job of
keeping up with the competition it's a
little bit of a give-and-take though a
solid even if kind of all-too-familiar
design literally makes it shine and the
4k display on the phone is a wonderful
addition despite its lack of overall
usefulness but for anybody that hasn't
visited the Sony Xperia line in a while
this might be one of the best times to
check it out and you can have one of the
most forward-facing devices that Sony
has ever created as always thank you
guys very much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this review of the Sony Xperia
XZ premium it's kind of a mouthful but
then again there are plenty of things to
like about this 4k display toting phone
there's a whole lot that you can really
enjoy on this device and if you haven't
used a Sony phone in a while well this
might be the time to check it out keep
it tuned to Android 34 even more and
more reviews and comparisons on all of
the flagships that are coming in this
year keep it tuned here and don't forget
