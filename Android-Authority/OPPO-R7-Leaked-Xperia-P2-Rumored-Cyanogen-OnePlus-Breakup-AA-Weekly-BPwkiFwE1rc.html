brought to you by domain.com so lots of
good and interesting news in the world
of android this week including the media
darling Kurt and mcmaster the CEO of
cyanogen when he's referring to how
cyanogen is going to now end the
relationship with one plus he said this
without cyanogen 1 plus would have sold
like one device in international markets
essentially they built their brand on
the back of cyanogen there he goes again
using the media to help measure his
Johnson speaking in Beijing at the
global mobile Internet conference
signage and CEO Kurt McMaster and Steve
Condit its CTO have been discussing the
past and future of the fledgling company
after a fairly rocky relationship it may
not surprise you to hear that signage
inand 1 + R now parting ways according
to signage and Steve Kondik the two
companies ultimately had different goals
for its software and as a result there
were collisions between personalities as
the two attempted to proceed with their
own visions not to mention that the two
stepped on each other's toes when it
came to launching the 1+1 in India last
year cyanogen had already signed an
exclusive deal with the rival low-cost
smartphone manufacturer micromax which
temporarily banned the sale of one plus
handsets powered by the custom OS in
India colliding visions or colliding
personalities Kurt McMaster the CEO of
cyanogen has sought every opportunity to
flame his enemies in public you may
think something in private but to say
something on a public platform just
burns bridges of course another big
reason for ending the relationship with
one plus is that they wanted to partner
with a manufacturer that could sell a
lot of handsets internationally now
there are rumors that have leaked that
Sony is coming out with an Xperia P to a
successor to the Xperia P which was a
bit of flop but this one if true is
certainly flagship powered the leak
consists of an alleged render of the
device the Xperia P 2 will reportedly
feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810
processor 3 gigabytes of ram 32
gigabytes of internal storage a 5.2 inch
HD display at 12.1 megapixel rear camera
and a 5.1 megapixel front facing camera
and it positively massive
4240 milliamp hour battery if these
specs are true and the p2 is really
coming the device would be a dream for
many users the battery alone would put
the Xperia P 2 and very select company
now let's talk design the leak claims
the p2 will feature a design that
closely resembles the 2012 Xperia P with
a chin at the bottom separated from the
screen by what appears to be a metallic
strip the big difference here is the
almost edge to edge screen resembling
the sharp aqua crystal with a slightly
higher bezel at the top hosting the
front camera and speaker now kindly
remember that this is a rumor with
nothing super substantial to go on just
yet but if true that battery alone would
be fantastic Google never being one to
rest on their laurels is now allowing
you to use google search to give
commands to your phone and it's not just
commands like send directions and find
my phone it looks like Google is adding
a slew of commands to let you control
your Android phone from google search
for now sadly the features are only
available in the US though find my phone
works worldwide so there's a very good
chance the other commands will follow
too if you want to try them out from
elsewhere you can try adding and GL
equal us at the end of the URL of your
search query like this to set an alarm
on your phone you just type set alarm
and you'll be shown an interface that
lets you pick the hour and the device
you want to set the alarm on you can
also type set alarm for 12pm to
pre-select the hour now for those of you
interested in the rumors surrounding the
Oppo r7 opal contacted us to clarify
some things about the teaser images opal
reached out to us and wanted to clarify
that the teaser image here actually
contains several key words in Chinese
that help us better picture what to
expect from the Oppo r7 it is super slim
lightning fast charging speed and has
2.5 d glass now to better illustrate
this super thin design opal referenced
the three previously leaked images of
the device all but confirming that the
images are indeed legit now quick update
on don't be cute eat the fruit calm mr.
Joe Hindy has not yet eaten the fruit he
claims that he has not been able to find
a place to buy durian fruit that has not
stopped us from barraging him with
pressure to do so
further illustrating the power of a
dot-com why because no domain name
extension tells your story with the same
level of trust as a.com or.net domain
name dot com and.net domain name
extensions and Jack credibility and your
online presence and who doesn't want
more credibility you can say fifteen
percent on domain name and web hosting
is when you use our coupon code android
at domain.com check out don't forget
fifteen percent off when you use our
coupon code android when you think
domain names think domain.com thanks for
watching android army my name is Jace
I'm right here on google+ and twitter
and i read all the comments below now i
wanted to follow up on a whole t-shirt
contest thing we had two or three weeks
ago the guy who won was the guy who came
up with a domain name the droid you're
looking for com it was a great
domain.com contest and i responded to
him and tried to get his address for him
the t-shirt but he never responded so i
never got his address i couldn't send
the t-shirt but we have sent out
t-shirts many times before and people
have posted them wearing their android
authority shirt on google+ so I'd like
to create another contrast where I can
send out another t-shirt because it
really fires up the comments and we get
talking and it's all good I like that so
make some suggestions in the comments
below about a t-shirt contest that we
can do that would be fantastic you don't
want to forget about my brethren my
brothers nandroid Josh Joan the tech
ninja Kevin Lonnie Chris Guerra Nash and
Taylor I'll working super hard to be
