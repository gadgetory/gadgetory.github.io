android authority and Google i/o is
right around the corner so let's talk
about it let's talk about what we can
expect from google i/o this year so 2014
has been the year of wearables and this
year at Google i/o were expecting a lot
when it comes to wearables earlier this
year Google unveiled Android wear and os
made specifically for wearable devices
because up until this point OEMs have
had to either make their own wearable
operating systems or heavily modify the
phone version of Android to work on a
wearable device but obviously Google is
looking to resolve that with Android
wear but we still don't know everything
we need to know about it so we're
expecting to learn a lot more about
Android wear I oh and on top of learning
more about Android wear we're
anticipating an official announcement of
the LG G watch which is rumored to also
be given away this year for i 0 at n DS
and then there's the Moto 360 these are
both unveiled at the same time as
Android wear and will be the first to
smartwatches to carry the new OS but we
don't know much about either of these
two watches outside of their design so
we're definitely going to be expecting
to learn about the specs of both of
these watches and most importantly the
pricing and availability besides the G
watch and the motor 360 there's also
been some rumblings that we might see a
samsung Smart Watch also powered by
Android wear and potentially ones from
HTC and a sous there's no doubt that
we're going to see the G watch and the
Moto 360 but as far as everything else
we're just going to have to wait and see
as far as any other mobile hardware is
concerned there's been a lot of rumors
of a new nexus 8 / nexus 9 tablet
codenamed the volantis supposedly made
by HTC rumor specs include an 8.9 inch
display at 2048 x 1440 resolution a
Tegra k1 processor 2 gigabytes of ram 16
or 32 gigs of internal storage and 8
megapixel camera on the front 3
megapixel front facing camera and
aluminum zero gap construction and
stereo front-facing speakers whether
we'll actually see this tablet at i/o
seems unlikely as it's rumored for a
fall release but based on the rumored
specs it sounds like it'll be a beast of
a tablet if we do indeed get a new Nexus
tablet typically we don't expect a new
version
Android without some reference hardware
to go along with it and Google usually
doesn't unveil a new version of Android
at i/o they've only done that once so
far a couple of years ago with the
original Nexus 7 but sundar pichai
recently just confirmed that we will be
seeing the next version of android at
i/o whether that will be 4.5 or five
point 0 or the official el release that
everyone is anticipating we don't really
know yet but what we do know is that it
is coming but it's only going to be
shown off at i/o and not officially
released until the fall which falls in
line with other major Android releases
and the rumored release date of the next
Nexus tablet what we do know though is
that there definitely is going to be a
new design refresh at least when it
comes to the apps with what Google is
dubbing as quantum paper along with a
new design quantum paper is supposed to
unify and create a much more consistent
experience across all apps whether it's
on Android the web or iOS we might see
some android TV related stuff as google
has been trying to establish themselves
in the TV space for a while now and the
Nexus Q and the Google TV have pretty
much been failures but they've had
success with the chromecast and they're
looking to capitalize on that success
with Android TV which is basically
Android adapted for large screens so
instead of an actual device it's been
rumored to be a platform that OEMs can
use to manufacture devices with from the
leaked screenshots that we've seen it
looks to be very simple and intuitive
with a tiled interface and you're going
to get access to all of your usual apps
that you'd expect from a set-top box
including the Play Store and supposedly
gaming is going to be a big part of
Android TV as well Google is also
looking to bring Android into cars with
partners like Audi GM and Honda already
on board and we're expecting Google to
introduce auto link a feature that will
allow drivers to interact with their
Android smartphones directly through
their in car dashboards we don't know
much else about it but don't expect
Google to make any announcements as far
as to what cars will actually be
carrying the technology we don't really
know what other surprises Google might
have up its sleeve but I'd keep an eye
out on project tango project ara the
driverless car nest Chrome OS and the
list goes on but that is it guys let us
know in the comments section what you
are looking forward to most at
google i/o or what you're hoping to see
at Google i/o our very own Josh pagar
will be there covering it live so make
