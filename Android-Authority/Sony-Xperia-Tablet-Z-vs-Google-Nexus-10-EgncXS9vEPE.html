manager authority what's going on
everybody and we're bringing you yet
another blockbuster purses now we're
moving from the phones are moving over
to the tablet space because sony has
come out of the woodwork really putting
all the chips on the table with the
Xperia tablet Z force it what you're
looking at here is a 1920 x 1200
resolution display on a 10.1 inch so
logically we have the vs over here with
probably one of the big dogs in the
10-inch market that is the extent axis
10 so this one is designed by set by
samsung and is of course the Google
official 10 inch tablet device and we're
going to take a look at some of the the
aspects on here i will say that there
the resolution on the nexus 10 is 2560
by 1600 which is an incredible display
but that doesn't mean that the Xperia
tablet Z doesn't have some tricks up its
sleeves there is the Snapdragon s4 pro
processor inside of the
you have the dual cortex he knows which
comes down a very very fast feed you
have very comfortable experiences on
both of these tablets you can have a lot
of speed nonetheless let's just jump
into the apps a little bit here just
take a look at a couple things so some
of the oops I open up maps there you go
some of the elements of the UI is here
of course you're going to be running the
latest version of Android on the Nexus
10 the jellybean 4.2 4.2 point2 if
you've updated recently however on the
Sony Xperia tablet Z you're going to be
running 4.1 point2 but all of that all
of that aside we do have to take a look
at some very very important a very
important advantages to the Xperia
Tablet grant it is primarily the
thickness at six point nine millimeters
this is quite frankly one of the
thinnest if not then as tablets on the
market today and at 495 grams this thing
is a nimble performer this is seriously
one of the lightest tablets I have ever
what lies devices even that I have ever
had the pleasure of using especially of
this form factor the nexus 10 on the
other hand does have a much thicker back
as you're going to see in a comparison
shot that will show you right now much
thicker back a little bit a much heavier
also and it is heavier now don't get me
wrong while the heavier feel of the
nexus 10 does lend to its great handling
that's not to say that the Xperia tablet
said doesn't have some great handling of
its own to be honest even though it is
light there's no fear that i'm going to
set this is going to slip out of out of
my hand and that is due to a nice matted
back that allows you to have it very
easily in the hand and that's in
comparison to the sort of rubber sticky
feel on the back of the nexus 10 so
there are definitely some advantages to
both but i will tell you this much for a
tablet like this a blockbuster tablet
that has a smaller profile and is a lot
lighter there really is a lot to love
about the Xperia tablet Z or Zed if you
wish to call it that so that is our
verses here for our two of the big ten
inch tablets in the android market today
so stay tuned everybody is Joshua
