Jace not Joyce not Jason but Jace and
this is where we try and answer your
most pressing Android questions and
today the most pressing question is the
new year is upon us coming soon how do I
become a better person other apps out
there that can help me be a better
person and stick with my new year's
resolutions who you have come to the
right place because I stay up late at
night trying to answer those very
questions and last night I stayed up so
late that I had a nightmare from
wrapping Rudolph come on sit back relax
but on your radio gear get ready for a
trip for some holiday cheer gonna take a
full ride to the android zone I don't
need a spaceship please microphone so
hold on your leg go gather y ok cuz I'll
be answering to you an aids for the rest
of the beer alright well put away
wrapping Rudolph for now but before we
get to those new year's resolution apps
I want to answer a question from sigh
Ken Russell do you think that Google
will be able to integrate google now on
super budget phones so Ken that's really
going to decide on how you define super
budget phones that term concerns me a
little bit because you could be talking
about ultra ultra dirt cheap Android
devices and there is a lot of crap out
there my wife bought our daughter
unfortunately about our daughter a
tablet that was but that thick it was
like 50 bucks and it was running a
forked version of Android and it was
horrendous I mean we didn't use it ten
minutes out of the box and it was so
laggy and so slow we just never used it
again it was horrible and there are
devices out there like that but if you
want to talk about entry-level phones
like the Moto G that is a fantastic
phone for the price and of course you
can check out Joshua's detailed review
of the device but I also spoke to him
last night just for you about the google
now issue and how Google now worked and
he said it worked great now it wasn't as
fast as the Moto X or the Nexus 5 but it
was comparable and it was a great phone
for the price you should check that out
so if you're talking about entry-level
devices I would go with something like
that the next question came from strippy
notice hey Jace what is system-on-a-chip
and yr cortex processors included
in the Snapdragon yes so what is a
system-on-a-chip and how does it matter
for me and my android phone good
question you see in the olden days when
people use desktops you had the major
components of a computer integrated
through the motherboard but on a small
tablet or a smartphone engineers must
economize on space and so they've taken
most of the components of that computing
device and integrated them onto one
chimp called an integrated chip or more
commonly known as a microchip this this
integrated package is called
system-on-a-chip now you also may be
were a bit confused about your terms
there you said why is the cortex on the
Snapdragon the cortex is not included in
the Snapdragon system-on-a-chip
snapdragon uses the Krait processor the
cortex is used by the Tegra 4 processor
but great question all right since I was
about 19 I had major plans to change the
world but I soon realized that none of
that was even remotely possible unless I
had some measure of self-discipline and
I didn't have much and I had to work on
it a lot and since the advent of
smartphones has actually helped me
significantly and I know coming up in
the next week he were going to be
thinking about their new year's
resolutions to you know change their
lives improve on things whether that's
how they eat how they exercise they
educate themselves and they have various
different goals and I want to share with
you the apps that i personally use these
are apps that I've you know reviewing
for just this segment these are apps
that I use almost every day and I love
them and I wanted to share them with you
all right the first of all I wanted to
talk about was audible for those of you
who have goals that relate to your own
education your own career goals audible
is fantastic why well it allows me to
you know read and educate myself on the
topics that I'm interested in while I'm
doing other things because the biggest
challenge with reading is that people
are not time to read you have to sit
down and read and be undisturbed well
with audible I can read while I'm
driving walking the dog doing the dishes
my favorite thing to do my favorite
pastime I could dump you know 10 hours a
day in it is to play most of my favorite
video game while I'm listening to an
audible book
and honorable is not a sponsor of this
show but hey audible if you want to
sponsor us I will make you an amazeballs
commercial okay I love audible and let's
talk about the apps okay so audible has
a great app both on Android and iOS it's
pretty much perfect in my opinion except
for two things one you can't do in app
purchases on both platforms and two they
took oh they used to have it but they
took out the fast forward option you
have the rewind option for 30 seconds or
60 seconds within the book but you can't
fast forward anymore so if you want to
fast forward you have to like scrub with
your finger manually and you're always
going too far not too far enough but
otherwise amazing I go through about two
books a week inaudible just talk about
the subscription model for a moment if
you become a subscriber I think I'm like
there's two levels to it there's like a
19 or $17 option and then there's a $22
option that the premium membership and
you get two credits per month or one
credit per month and most books can be
bought for one credit some of the real
premium ones take two credits but then
you get a discount on all the other
books within their library and I have
bought their competitor audiobooks calm
and they're also really good their app
that does have the fast-forward version
but the app isn't is pretty for sure and
they just don't have the same selection
as audible and in the end I went back to
audible because of their subscription
model is just a little bit more cost
effective in the long run and for
someone like me who read so much audible
is really fantastic check it out alright
the next step is runkeeper and many of
you will know about this it basically
tracks your exercise with your running
walking biking hiking anything like that
and i use it for when i'm walking the
dog when i'm hiking all that kind of
stuff it tracks my distance my laps you
know organizes my goals and that kind of
stuff and a voice will come on and tell
me what pace I'm on in that lap how what
distance I've gone how far I have to go
all that kind of stuff and it allows me
to listen to my audio books at the same
time it's playing on in the background
so it's really fantastic the only
drawback to it is that it gets expensive
to operate because it does use gps and
depending on your data data plan it can
be expensive to operate I've noticed a
noticeable hike in my bill when I use
runkeeper a lot but otherwise fantastic
now the next appt I'm sure almost all of
you use or have used to some extent in
the past but I'm going to talk about it
because it's the app that's probably had
the biggest practical impact on how I
organize my life and that is google
calendar here's the thing people like me
who you know loosely call themselves a
DD we don't just need reminders we need
harassment right and Google Calendar
allows me to set up at least 5 reminders
on the iOS version allows me to 10 and I
use that one too for reminders for
appointments for deadlines phone calls
you know anything I need to remember to
do it will set up constant reminders and
I have a warn you I have spent over two
hundred dollars on different types of
Calendar apps because this was really
important to keep myself organized and I
always came back to the google calendar
at least on Android because it allowed
me that kind of flexibility the most
important thing for me is multiple
reminders color coordination that's
really important and automatically
syncing up to the cloud which it does
all that really really well Google
Calendar love it alright the next app is
a nap and a gadget and it is Fitbit i
bought Fitbit for like I don't know 110
dollars or so a few months ago and I
like it I like it a lot I like it
because it automates the process of
tracking you know my calories and my
exercise and all that kind of stuff and
it doesn't require me to think about it
very much and I like that I like that a
lot I just really need to remember to
charge the Fitbit and sync it up with
the desktop app and it works really
really well I don't have much experience
with the mobile app but fit when we're
talking about new year's resolutions you
know to be able to stick with one of
these news resolutions you need as much
as the process automated so you're not
thinking about it and Fitbit does a
fantastic job at that for me it was
worth the money if you're willing to
take your exercise seriously all right
so the last appt recommendation for this
isn't a nap at all it's a book and it's
audible you can also get it on kindle
course and it is called the power of
habit and this is a fantastic
potentially life-changing book why well
I have read a number of different books
like at least a dozen on the subject of
self-discipline and changing habits and
stuff like that and a lot of them
require is it is basically their
inspirations they're meant to encourage
you to just have more willpower to have
you no more discipline to be more
determined and that's not a really smart
long-term strategy the power of habit
cites numerous cave studies where people
have studied how to change habits that
have been formed over time right so if
you have learned like me if you're a
drink coca-cola you know 8 to 12 times a
day like I do it's a very serious habit
that I developed from childhood and it's
very very difficult to stop I have quit
many many times and I hit like a
four-month barrier and then you know I
ended up going back to it it's very very
difficult but the power of habit breaks
down how these habits form and the
mechanisms behind changing them and they
they cite some case studies where
longtime habits have been changed and
for me it helps it helped me understand
why I do some of the things I do better
than any book I've read before so check
that out the power of habit it's both on
audible and kindle check it out thank
you for watching Android peeps kindly
