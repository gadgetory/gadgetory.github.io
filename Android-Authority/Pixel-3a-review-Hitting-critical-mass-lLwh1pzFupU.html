pixel three and we called it the Android
iPhone and that's because Google no
longer wants Android to be a nerd brand
anymore they want it to be something
that can be really well used by everyone
and that is a premium experience and
with the pixel one through three they
nailed the premium experience all three
of those phones were exceptional devices
that had an amazing ecosystem you know
where they messed up it's not the
physical quality of a phone that gets
people locked into ecosystems
it's the experience and how are people
actually going to try the pixel
experience unless they can get it in
their hands well this is the pixel 3a
and it's Google's Play for actually
getting the pixel experience in
everybody seems how exactly do you get
the pixel experience into more people's
hands well you cut out the things that
only us nerds really care about and that
includes the latest Snapdragon processor
and official IP rating wireless charging
in a glass body but none of those things
are what makes a pixel a pixel what
defines the pixel is the amazing UI the
best-in-class camera and things like an
OLED display so you can have things like
an always-on display now playing an easy
access to Google assistant so the pixel
3-8 doesn't have the best specs in the
world has specs that are gonna work for
most people it's got a snapdragon six
seventy four gigabytes of RAM and 64
gigabytes of storage and for most people
that's gonna be just fine now I do have
to say that four gigabytes of RAM wasn't
really enough for the pixel three and
it's not really going to be enough for
the pixel 3/8 either but I couldn't
exactly see Google adding more RAM to a
cheaper phone this phone will close apps
in the background every now and then but
they did seem to solve the issue of
where music apps like Spotify would just
stop playing if you opened up too many
apps and it kicked it out of memory now
the good thing is that pixel UI is
really lightweight it's Google's vision
for a stock Android and that means it's
got a really really good integration
with all of googles core apps it's not
gonna have any third-party apps unless
you consider Google a third-party
company and its really nice to get a
phone where you really get to dictate
everything that goes on your device and
just like the pixel three the cameras
are best-in-class seriously I don't know
how they were able to get the pixel
three cameras in this phone when it's
$400 but they did now the image quality
is only slightly slightly worse than the
pixel three but I don't think the
average person is actually going to be
able to tell a difference the camera is
still miles better than pretty much
every other Android phone on the market
right now and most people consider it to
be better than the iPhone - the
front-facing cameras were you're
probably gonna see the most noticeable
difference now you don't have two front
facing cameras in here anymore so you
don't have that ultra wide-angle lens
beauty of a lens that's pretty wide and
it's probably wide enough to get you and
a couple friends in a shot like I said
before they still have an OLED screen
and it still looks amazing
yes it's not gonna be as perfect as the
display on the samsung galaxy s 10 or
the one plus seven pro but it's still
really really good for a $400 phone and
it also enables things like now playing
or and always-on display to show your
notifications and of course another
thing that is core to the pixel
experience is the Google assistant and
Google's maintained pretty much all the
ways that you can access the assistant
here you've still got the Haji keyword
to pull up the assistant
we've also still got active edge which
means you can squeeze the phone to pull
up the assistant which can be really
convenient if you don't want to set off
that key phrase now you're not getting
those front-facing speakers that
everyone really loved in the pixel 3 but
another key part of the pixel experience
is good speakers and you've still got
stereo speakers on the bottom of this
phone and they actually sound really
good they sound a lot better than a lot
of higher-end Android phones that cost a
lot more than this thing and here is the
kicker
what is the one other thing that people
are not willing to leave their iPhone 6s
for that's the headphone jack and yeah
Google included it in the pixel 3a now
one thing that I think that Google does
need to put a little more effort into is
battery life because that actually does
affect the average consumer that
actually is something that every single
person wants in a phone battery life is
average it's not incredible but the
combination of the lower specs processor
and also the bigger battery especially
in the pixel 3a XL does you get you
through a full day most of the time and
these also work with 18 watt which are
and probably the last main difference
between the main pixel 3 and the pixel 3
a is the build now the pixel 3 is made
of glass the pixel 3 a is made of
polycarbonate the thing is I actually
really like plastic phones way back when
the Nexus 5 was released everyone really
praised that phone it felt really good
in your hand and that's the case here -
I really like polycarbonate because you
can drop it and is much less prone to
cracking so what are you really getting
out of the pixel 3 a is a whole package
what you're getting build quality that
most people would be fine with you're
getting battery life that most people
will be fine with you're getting an
experience that most people have not
even tried yet but are really going to
enjoy and you're getting the best camera
on the market right now and look this is
why this phone is important Google
doesn't need to make premium phones they
need to be get people to actually try
their ecosystem people are going to just
switch ecosystems willy-nilly because
when you're moving from an iPhone you're
not just moving OEMs you're moving
entire ecosystems so how much is Google
asking for the pixel experience they're
pretty much taxiing $400 and at the time
of making this video there are deals
almost everywhere they get you $100 off
this phone effectively making it $300
not only that but it's available on
almost every carrier no longer is the
pixel exclusively available at Verizon
you can get this almost anywhere except
for AT&amp;amp;T and that is a wonderful thing
surrounding this out I think Google
finally realized that the pixel is not
about premium build quality it's about
hitting critical mass in their ecosystem
and what's gonna do that price in the
pixel experience that's minute guys I
understand that this review is not too
technical but we do have a full written
review that has a ton of specifications
we got a ton of sample photos and a ton
of pictures of this phone if you want to
go check it out head over to Android or
30.com and make sure you stay tuned to
our YouTube channel we're gonna have a
whole lot more information from the
premium sector to the low-end sector to
everything in between and I will catch
you in the next video
