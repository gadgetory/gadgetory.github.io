bitter red pill and talk about that the
essence of this story is not about your
loss of privacy you lost your privacy
years ago and it's not coming back
anytime soon what this is really about
is control that's right I'm talking
about matrix level control so come with
me down the rabbit hole and try and get
to at least a little bit closer to the
truth okay first the facts back in 2015
a professor named Alexander Cogan was
working with a company called global
science research using his credentials
as a professor and researcher Kogan
created and promoted what was then
referred to as a personality quiz
application on face book admitted many
of you took that test
well what those two hundred and seventy
thousand people likely didn't know was
that by agreeing to take the quiz which
was delivered by a Facebook app they
were inadvertently giving Kogan and
global science research access to not
only their own user data but also to all
their Facebook friends data GSR didn't
obtain any passwords or other login
credentials but the company now had
mountains of data on millions and
millions of Facebook users but hold on
because it goes deeper Kogan then gave
that data to a company called Cambridge
analytical if that company's name rings
any bells it should the upstart voting
profiling company had a huge hand in
President Donald Trump being elected in
2016 now when Zuck found out about this
data transfer he not only canceled all
the Facebook accounts of those
individuals and organizations involved
but he also demanded that the data be
deleted it should have ended there but
it didn't meet Christopher Wiley a
Cambridge analytic whistleblower and he
told the New York Times that the GSR
data had never been deleted and that
Cambridge analytic I was still using the
data for its social media influencing
businesses now it should be said here
that there was no data breach like we've
seen in the past Cogan didn't violate
any laws or Facebook policies by
creating the app and collecting that
data he did violate Facebook's Terms of
Service when he transferred that data to
Cambridge analytics
all right so you may be thinking Jase
great that just means we need stiffer
more comprehensive laws surrounding how
companies collect and use personal data
and then the problem solved right
because with enough time and resources
it is just too easy to access digital
data no amount of legislation is going
to prevent that to prove that you just
have to look at how recently countries
like China and Russia have nefariously
access peoples user data and use that
for their own political purposes so what
is the solution you know the answer to
that question I don't know I don't have
all the answers but I do know this the
vast majority of you living in
industrialized countries live in a
real-world matrix and you don't even
know it you see in 2018 the powers that
be are not just using this data to
create better ads cater to you and sell
you more stuff no they're actually
manipulating the conversation to effect
what you think that's where control
comes in we know from what's happened
the last 18 months that organizations
governments and entities want to use
social media and data to manipulate
things like election results what you
think about climate change a whole
number of issues that they have
interests in and it only works when you
and I fuel the matrix it is of course a
way of those things you see when you
dump a disproportionate amount of time
online into debating or arguing pro-life
versus pro-choice pro-gun versus
anti-gun climate change versus climate
hoax social justice warriors versus the
alt-right whatever the issue is you fuel
the engine that runs these platforms and
those who want to control the data from
those platforms what you don't do is
produce substantive change it's just
very similar to 3540 years ago when big
advertisers wanted young people like me
to watch four to five hours a day of
television because that's how they made
their money so they made that
really really addictive just like social
media today my friends you are part of
the matrix and you don't know it you
fuel the engine that makes you a slave
to this now I'm not saying that these
issues are not really important and
merit meaningful discussion I am saying
that social media does not facilitate
meaningful discussion I know I've been
creating content for many years now this
can either be a tool or it can be a ball
and chain it depends on how you use it
if you want real change if you care
about an issue that you like to debate
and fight about online I suggest that
you go out and do stuff make your life
better make someone else's life better
you'll be far happier and you won't be a
slave to the matrix now if you want to
get serious about branding yourself
