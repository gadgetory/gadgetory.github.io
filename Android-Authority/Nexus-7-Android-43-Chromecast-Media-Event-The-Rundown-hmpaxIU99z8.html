but there were a few extra tidbits and
we've got to look at all of the new
information hey it's Josh Flagg are from
android authority of what's going on
everybody and this is the rundown let's
start with the hotly-anticipated Nexus 7
now if you were following the news just
before the announcement was actually
made today best buy an officemax kind of
spilled the beans by shipping orders
ahead of the actual launch what it
resulted were a bunch of advanced photos
and leaked specs but when Hugo Barra hit
the stage and popped out that Nexus 7
from his back pocket we were all still
floored first big detail was that he was
able to grip the entire device in one
hand also considering there was a lot of
information already leaked on the Nexus
7 you didn't hear all those cheers from
the crowd like from an event like say
Google i/o was a little bit
disappointing at least for me but then
again this was a pretty private event so
that might have explained it anyway
let's get to the new Nexus 7 it's
thinner lighter and narrower than the
original making it even easier to use in
one hand the new tablet gets a boost by
using some tried-and-true specifications
with the Snapdragon s4 pro clocked in at
1.5 gigahertz back to bite the Audrina
320 and 2 gigabytes of RAM after all of
the great smartphones in the past year
we know how good this package is and it
will work well for the 7-inch tablets
the display experience has been greatly
upgraded as the new Nexus 7 has been
given a full HD 1080p display with 323
PPI stereo speakers have also been added
but no they aren't front-facing for a
better audio experience and then there
is the 5 megapixel rear facing camera
another pretty huge upgrade from the
original Nexus 7 the new Nexus 7 is
going to run you two hundred and twenty
nine dollars for the 16 gigabyte version
and 299 dollars for the 32 gigabyte
version also as on another announcement
that Hugo Barra made there's going to be
a 4G LTE version of the nexus 7
available that can connect to AT&amp;amp;T t
mobile or verizon networks and it can
all be done from the same device but
what also matters is beneath the surface
as the new Nexus 7 will be the first
device to ship with Android
4.3 this updated version of Android
isn't a big overhaul but it does come
with a few pretty nice features the user
switching that was introduced in 4.2 has
been enhanced for greater control now
the owner of the device can essentially
limit the amount of content that the
other people can view or use this is
important for maybe kids or employees
Android 4.3 also comes with OpenGL ES
3.0 an updated engine that should allow
for even greater graphics capabilities
and games and then there's Bluetooth
smart a protocol for Bluetooth
connections that helps preserve power
and battery life there are quite a few
other enhancements but these were the
main ones another noteworthy enhancement
was to the Google Play Store which got a
hub for games but this is something we
saw at google i/o already and finally as
a product that was pretty much expected
but sort of not in this fashion the
google cast dongle was unveiled if
you've ever used a Roku stick or some
sort of streaming peripheral for your TV
this is Google's own take on it and
honestly it's pretty damn cool using
your phone or tablet from either Android
or iOS you can hit a cast button from
media apps like netflix youtube and
pandora to send content to your
chromecast connect it to an HDMI port in
your TV and previously connected to your
Wi-Fi network what makes this product
unique is that the chromecast works
directly with the cloud connecting to
the media instead of streaming from your
device the content continues to play
while you are free to use your phone or
tablet for anything else all of this
functionality is also available on
computers as media outlets are starting
to add that cast button and finally
although this feature is currently in
beta the chromecast can broadcast a
chrome tab from your computer this new
and honestly pretty awesome device is
available for thirty-five dollars at
best buy stores or online at Amazon or
at the Google Play Store however it does
seem to be selling out pretty quickly
online so you better act fast so I guess
it's pretty safe to say that Google made
a lot of people happy today with their
new announcements and their new products
tell us what you think about them in the
comments below and stay tuned to android
authority for the reviews for all of
these products if you want a hint on
which one's coming first well I've got
it right here
