Hindy the Android a 30 ad guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 180 so let's get
started there are a variety of games on
sale in the google play store right now
among them are xcom enemy within
oddworld strangers wrath and munch's
oddysee at civilization revolution two
and NBA 2k 17 most of them are going for
over fifty percent off for a limited
time additionally they're all pretty
decent games if you're looking for
strategy sports or platforming these
deals are worth checking out ESET the
antivirus security company has noticed a
rise in ransomware here lately their
most recent reports showed that Android
users were targeted over fifty percent
more often than they were last year it's
important to note that most of those
people probably don't have the Google
Play Store available to them or are
installing side-loaded apps still it's
an uptick to keep your eye on because
ransomware really sucks Matt Groening
creator of futurama and the simpsons
announced a new futurama game the game
is called futurama worlds of tomorrow
and the game was written and produced by
series regulars david cohen and matt
groening while the developers will be
TinyCo the bad news is that it'll be a
free-to-play game like other show based
titles we don't have a release date yet
but you can pre-register now in the
google play store if you want instagram
received a rather large update this last
week the service now lets you share
multiple photos in a single post people
using the social network no longer have
to pick the best of their photos they
can now just upload everything if they
want to under a single post it may not
seem like much however just
fundamentally changes how people will
use the platform the update is rolling
out right now so be prepared for those
multi photo posts very soon word around
the digital grapevine is that YouTube is
doing away with 30-second unscalable
advertising in exchange the service is
going to be using more frequent
six-second done skippable ads that
sounds pretty bogus but six seconds
isn't nearly as annoying as 30 this is
likely in response to Facebook focusing
a little bit more on video YouTube wants
to make fewer people angry and keep them
around longer while still showing as
it's really not that bad although your
opinion mayberry octave is a new horror
adventure game its features
point-and-click mechanics to solve
puzzles and regret
through the storyline you play as a guy
who happen to be in the wrong place at
the wrong time and your job will be to
survive it features some creepy
atmospheric elements dark themes and
other classic horror stuff it's a 2d
game and the mechanics are simple enough
to learn perhaps the best part is that
it's cheap and it has no in-app
purchases it's a rare horror game that
isn't half bad Bart is a fun little
application that cuts up videos the way
it works is that you choose from a list
of videos and then you'll be provided
with a script that's word for word
you'll choose which words you want and
then the application cuts the video to
make the video say those things the
possibilities are limitless although the
application definitely isn't perfect of
doing it it's likely something you'll
download play with for a few weeks and
then uninstall still it'll be a fun
couple of weeks at the very least the
application is free with no in-app
purchases linked wind is another one of
those indie puzzle games that people
seem to love so much the game revolves
around a set of twins and your goal is
to use the environment to move the twins
along with various objects around to
achieve the objective it features over a
hundred levels ten mechanics and five
worlds for you to play through it has
that indie developer look and feel so
it's nothing you haven't seen before the
game costs a dollar ninety-nine and has
no in-app purchases that means there are
no pay walls to get stuck behind NBAD r
is a daydream only application for
basketball fans it won't let you watch
live games at least we don't think it
does however it does let you watch
highlights interviews and other NBA
generated video content it gives you
kind of a lounge area to chill in while
you watch all of this stuff goes down
it's basically a glorified highlighted
interview app but it's one that works on
Google's a dream at the very least it's
free to download and check out for
yourself it's a must try for NBA fans
who also have google daydream island
delta is the latest game out of noodle
cake studios this is a third-person
action platformer where you'll be
running around shooting stuff solving
puzzles defeating bad guys and the whole
nine yards apparently it comes complete
with a full story 30 levels hidden areas
bonus levels and a whole lot more the
game looks pretty good and plays well
enough on most devices it's also a pay
once game with no in-app purchases or
advertisements it's pretty good and
