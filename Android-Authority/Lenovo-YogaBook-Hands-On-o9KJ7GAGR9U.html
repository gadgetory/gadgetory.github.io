authority and we're taking a quick look
at a pretty interesting product from
Lenovo called the yoga book there's a
Windows version but the one that we're
checking out is the Android version and
it's basically an ultra portable
convertible notebook it's got a nice
metal bill that gives it a very solid
feel and it's incredibly thin and
lightweight which makes it perfect for
traveling and overall it looks extremely
sleek there's a chain mail like hinge
which we've seen Lenovo used before and
other products and this allows you to
rotate the screen 360 degrees and put it
in whatever position you want including
a tablet mode for as thin as it is it
does come with a couple of different
ports like micro USB for charging mini
HDMI a headphone jack and speakers on
the left and right sides with support
for Dolby Atmos the screen measures in
at 10.1 inches with a resolution of
1080p and it looked fine and will
probably work well for anything you need
to do but it wasn't anything too
mind-blowing the rest of the specs
include the Intel Atom x5 processor 4
gigabytes of RAM 64 gigs of internal
storage of which you can expand upon
with the microSD card slot for extra
storage
it also has support for 2.4 gigahertz
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 and there's a
massive 8500 milliamp hour battery
inside that should get you at least a
day's worth of use the coolest part
about a yoga book is definitely the
keyboard Lenovo calls it the halo
keyboard and it's backlit with this very
Tron s looking blue and you'll notice
that it's a completely flat keyboard
there's no real physical buttons so it's
basically like typing on a touchscreen I
will admit the typing experience does
take some getting used to as it's very
different from a normal keyboard with
physical keys but it's kind of addicting
and sort of make you feel like you're
using something from the future the
other really awesome part about this
keyboard is that you can place any
ordinary notebook on it right on it and
it'll digitally convert anything you've
drawn or written right into the yoga
book this is great if you still love
writing stuff down but you also want to
tie all into your digital notes we don't
know what the exact limits are on how
thick the notebook can be but we were
able to use a notebook that was over a
half an inch thick and it still
registered everything we wrote
it's pretty impressive to say the least
it's running on Android 6.0 marshmallow
and it does have some customizations and
a few apps to take advantage of the
writing technology but it's not a forked
version of Android or anything like that
so you still have access to Google Play
and everything else that you typically
expect from a stock build of Android we
don't know the exact details on pricing
and availability just yet but it should
be available later on this month or
early next month for the most up-to-date
info we'll definitely keep you posted
over on the site at Android or decom and
