brought to you by audible go to audible
podcast.com slash authority for a free
audiobook download of your choice when
you sign up today hey everybody on chris
woke you ask we answer its android
authority Q&amp;amp;A for july 17 2013 David
asks is there a way to run jellybean on
the samsung galaxy 3 aka the 580 as long
as you don't mind a custom rom than yeah
there are a bunch ways i'd suggest
heading over to XDA developers and then
checking out the android development
forum in the galaxy 3 section and there
are quite a few options there just take
your time and make your choice Meredith
says hi Chris I just read that the HTC
One is now HTC pro certified what does
this mean for HTC One users HTC pro
certification is basically HTC's way of
saying to companies that hey you can buy
a fleet of these for your employees and
they'll work exactly as intended that's
why when you go to the HTC pro website
you'll see a bunch of guys in suits
basically for an individual user it's
not that important but for businesses
it's very important Jake asks is there
any way to completely turn off a phone
without a removable battery for example
if it freezes yes there is as long as
something hasn't gone horrific alee
catastrophic ly wrong just hold down the
power button and keep holding it until
the device powers off I've never seen
that not work
john says hello hello John I recently
read your article about the changes to
the sprint Terms of Service and how this
can get you out of your contract with
sprint and I wanted to ask does this
pertain only to ymax devices or all
devices in general here's the thing
Sprint is basically said that in their
opinion the changes aren't significant
enough to just let anyone out of their
contract no questions asked that said
they have said that customers are free
to discuss issues including those
related to their service with sprint I'd
say give it a try it can't hurt to ask
how be James says hi I have a phone
that's two years old and newer apps
don't work on it will this be fixed or
should I get a new phone if so do you
recommend anything well without knowing
what phone you have it's kind of hard to
say whether or not you'll be seeing any
updates that said with a phone that's
two years old they're probably not going
to be coming too quickly for your phone
so yeah it might be time to move on when
it comes to recommendations that's kind
of tough to answer because there are a
lot of good phones out there I would say
your best bet is decide what you want to
spend then just start checking out a
bunch of reviews and figure out what
works for you by the way android
authority does a lot of those so you
might want to check them out valentine
says this might sound stupid but do you
think that the LG g2 what we've seen
leaked anyway could be the nexus 5 it
could be possible even likely last week
we reported that a Korean website was
saying that a nexus 5 based on the LG g2
and running Android five key lime pie
could be coming in october rumors are
always iffy so I'm not making promises
but stranger things have happened and
the LG optimus G and the nexus 4 were
basically the same thing so yeah it
seems like it could happen Giovanni says
I have a galaxy s4 and it's memories
almost full how can i transfer my music
photos and apps to my SD card moving
your photos and music to the SD card is
really easy just use the my files app
track down the files you want to move
and then copy them over the SD card
for apps just go into the application
manager and settings select a nap and
hit move to SD card just a quick note
this does require the latest software
update for the s4 and not all apps can
be moved to the SD card still this
should help you free up a lot of space
and that wraps it up for this week folks
