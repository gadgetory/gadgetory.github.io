language and some enhancements
underneath the surface does this new
smartphone continue the legacy of the
note line this is Joshua freghar from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is a samsung galaxy
note 5 perhaps the most important part
of the new galaxy note 5 is that it
feels like we've been here before and
that starts with the design though much
of the galaxy design language remains as
familiar as ever the note line takes on
the material choices of the S line
making this the first unibody in the
phablet line glass panels are kept
together with a metallic frame and I'll
include the translucent colors I
literally make this phone shine and
reflect this also means that this is
probably the most fingerprint prone note
device we've ever seen which is another
trope that derives from the galaxy s6
the note 5 manages to be just a bit more
than a larger s6 though as there are
subtle curves on the rear sides that
actually help with the handling of this
big phone that said however much of what
we all remember from samsung devices
returns here the buttons are all where
one would expect them with the
fingerprint reader under the home button
now being a press type rather than swipe
type down on the bottom or all of the
ports a speaker grille and of course the
S Pen nestled very neatly in the bottom
right corner now the S Pen got some real
updates in design as is evident when you
pop out the top this has to be done in
order to actually pull out the entire
pin which does feel and looks sleeker
than before and I click on the top use
yet another toy to mess with and any
avid S Pen users will probably take
advantage of it in between their
thoughts ok yes we will talk about this
somewhat controversy about the s-pen in
the Galaxy Note 5 now Samsung did
unfortunately created so that the s-pen
can be inserted backwards into here but
really if you're just feeling for the
right portion of the pen to insert into
this particular slot then you should be
fine the clicky top part goes last ok
and if it's long as you're just worried
about it and you shouldn't have any
problems with the s-pen on your note 5
this new design language in the note
line means one big controversial change
now we have the lack of a removable back
cover and all that you get underneath it
that means that there are no SD cards or
removable batteries available here now
those two features have made the note
line the go-to phone for the power user
and as
just not the case anymore we will
explore this notion a little bit more in
the hardware section where our time with
the phone reveals pros and cons for
these changes but sacrificing these two
features does make for the thinnest most
beautifully constructed galaxy note ever
handling might suffer from a pretty
slippery glass design up until your
finger prints and smudges kind of kind
of slow it down but the note 5 still man
just have one of the most appealing
aesthetics even if it feels a little too
familiar but familiarity is something
that this device can really benefit from
especially when the company has already
succeeded in a lot of areas up until now
that starts with the display which is
the same quad HD performer from last
year again incrementally enhanced for
this year's viewers 2560 by 1440
resolution makes a lot of sense on a
larger display and makes for some really
high pixel density in this 5.7 inch
display but what we think is most
important about this panel however is
the really small bezel ratio there's so
little space on the sides and this
really helps for handling but the high
saturation Super AMOLED construction
still proves as great as ever with
really high saturation that can still be
tweaked down mind you and more than
adequate viewing in broad daylight
considering this as a phone that deals
in text and writing the screen really
shines but fire up a colorful game and
you'll have just as much joy with it
performance continues to be a high point
for the galaxy because the in-house
processing packages have been optimized
for the toned down TouchWiz the exceed
no 7420 returns from the galaxy s6 were
really shined and brings with it 4
gigabytes of RAM for some real
multitasking especially considering the
s-pen now there's no doubt in our minds
that the processor is a great performer
as a whole week with the phone has yet
to slow down this phone that we've
installed apps games trackers and even
have jotted a lot of notes down on a
quick thought on the onboard storage of
the galaxy note 5 though as this was the
case for the s6 the storage of the note
5 is ufs 2.0 which is a standard that
can rival speeds of solid-state drives
and if the galaxy s6 was any indication
it does its job in keeping the speed as
high as possible in this version of
Android now for a lot of people this
might not be a good enough reason to
forego expandable storage but the speed
of the Galaxy Note 5 itself kind of
makes up for it especially when you
consider that everything in here has
been optimized for the overall
experience again this might not be
enough of a reason for a lot of you out
there but we
thought it was something that should be
considered nonetheless the note 5 does
succeed where the note has always done
so in being the fastest and best
iteration of the galaxy experienced in
any given year in hardware we start off
with some of the familiar additions on
the back of the phone right next to the
camera or package the heart rate sensor
can be found and works about as well as
ever because the s-health
application has been somewhat
streamlined that said we know that it's
not something everyone will use too
often and every connection is available
here including NFC that is the main part
of the upcoming Samsung pay ecosystem
now phone calls come in loud and clear
also with no dropped calls in my usage
on the t-mobile network speaking of
audio the speaker on the bottom that it
fits from a better placement from before
but provides the expected quality it
does get pretty loud without providing
too much body in the sound but we're
glad it doesn't overdo the high ends
fingerprint reading is a thing of the
future and Samsung makes it work quite
well in the note 5 setting it up for
website incredible is also possible but
for the most part the fingerprinting
will be for unlocking the phone and that
is incredibly easy by just waking up the
phone with the home button and then
leaving your thumb there in no time
TouchWiz is ready for anything we've
already explored the lack of expandable
storage a bit in the performance section
but we will say that the lack of sdcard
support is a bit of a bummer
while this 32 gigabyte version of the
phone has yet to run out of space we do
dread the moment that this phone
actually does and finally in battery we
are dealing with a 3000 milliamp hour
unit here that seems a little bit small
at first but in our testing we found
that the note 5 could still handle the
full day of work without any problems
though getting more than that is a bit
of a stretch screen on time never really
got further than four and a half hours
though standby time is really good so if
the note 5 is simply laying around most
of the time it can go for a bit more
than a day in keeping the note as thin
as possible Samsung can only fit this
capacity battery in and then focused on
charging as fast as possible instead
for example Samsung boasts faster
wireless charging on the note 5 though
it is not something that we really take
advantage of all the time it is nice
that this phone supports all wireless
charging out of the box but the cordless
life that samsung pondered in their
launch event still feels a little far
off
fast-charging is probably going to be
every users best friend as samsung
claims that this is the fastest charging
device they've ever put out only about
10 to 15 minutes is needed to get the
phone back to proper working condition
with just about an hour needed to top
off the battery now this means that
something like a quick charge 2.0
portable battery could become an
indispensable tool
even if fast charging feels like a
consolation prize to true longevity
there are plenty of 15-minute windows in
the day that the galaxy note5 could use
so that power never feels too far out of
reach
Samsung continues to bring the quality
in the camera department quite literally
- as the camera on the note 5 is
basically the one from the galaxy s6 16
megapixels @f 1.9 aperture with 4k video
recording in the rear is backed by a 5
megapixel wide-angle front-facing camera
now by far the best part about the
camera app is the ability to bring it up
by just hitting the home button twice
but even then the app itself is pretty
familiar the manual controls have been
given a few more options namely being
able to change the Kelvin reading in the
white balance slider is an addition that
wasn't in the SX camera there are all
the usual modes as well with everything
from slow motion to a new video collage
mode that was kind of fun to use now
live broadcasting is also available with
YouTube as the platform which is
basically a periscope built into the
camera app we think it isn't something
most users will use and even then the
established streaming services like
periscope might still take priority
picture quality remains as great as ever
then keeping Samsung at the top of the
heap and Android good saturation across
the board keeps pictures from ever
really being dull and details are
captured really well users can benefit
from the F 1.9 aperture for depth of
field effects and it does help a bit in
low-light situations where pictures do
get the expected level of noise due to
higher ISO compensation but the app does
get a little bit slower in low-light
when trying to focus much like the
galaxy s6 proved earlier this year the
great camera experience we already had
in the note 4 could be further improved
on and thus the note 5 gets all the
benefits of this year's evolution in
camera quality and performance and
finally in software we will focus
primarily on the s-pen though there is a
lot offered in this version of TouchWiz
as well the main story is and how
streamlined this version of Android has
become as much of a bog down Samsung's
operating system has been stripped away
what remains is actually pretty
useful namely certain gestures and a
theme engine that does well to change
the look of the interface plen'y can be
found with just a bit of digging like
easy access to the multi-window
from the recent apps screen as well as
one-handed operation features easily
triggered by hitting the home button
three times just like in the s6 there
are far less tutorials and annoying
reminders of what the phone can do which
is probably our highlight of this
version of TouchWiz of course the
additions are mostly in the S Pen which
has been proportionately streamlined
with the rest of this operating system
some features from before have been
taken out - prioritizing the most use
abilities of the S Pen creating memos is
easier than ever in the note 5 as
removing the S Pen when the phone is in
standby no longer wakes it instead the
display remains black and a screen off
memo pad opens up for any times when the
user needs to quickly jot down info like
phone numbers this makes the note 5 as
accessible as a pad of paper in the back
pocket taking the S Pen out in any other
situation or pressing the button on it
opens up the better looking air command
menu which now includes a few shortcuts
to user-defined apps though it does feel
weird to put anything here that doesn't
take advantage of the stylus the action
memo is still able to read handwriting
and then insert it into a number of
different applications with varying
degrees of success but it is still
mainly just a way to add to s note but
in S note every note can be pinned to
the home screen as well as made into a
reminder both practical features that
make the screen off memo that much more
appealing to use regularly smart select
is also as powerful as before as any
portion of the screen can be cut out and
very easily shared for anyone that likes
to talk in messaging apps through
pictures and memes like me sometimes
smart select is pretty awesome and
finally there is screen write which
takes screenshots of the current
workspace for editing and sharing but
now scrollable pages like webpages can
be pieced together automatically by it
creating a long image or note that
encompasses everything on the page you
want to save think long recipes from
your favorite Pinterest for example what
is probably best about the S Pen is that
it actually feels a bit more essential
than before and that was achieved by not
over saturating it with buttons or
tutorials or even raw features the list
of s-pen abilities is not as long as
before and there are some use case
scenarios for every single one of them
and even if you never use the
ten it is an edition that proves it's
worth every time you say why not and
perform your typical task with it
instead prices for the Galaxy Note 5 are
expectedly high though the phone was
made available just days after the
announcement across all major carriers
in the West in total at least $700 is
what you'll shell out to get Samsung's
latest outing whether or not you use
payment plans on t-mobile 18t or
elsewhere it is hard not to look at the
note 5 in comparison to what Samsung has
offered in the past because this year
the company decided to take quite a
departure in design and hardware choices
the note 5 might not feel like a power
user device anymore and people who feel
that way are completely validated in
doing so for those who expected more
this new iteration feels too much like a
galaxy s6 in terms of what it decides to
leave out but it also succeeds in
offering the best that the s6 started in
a bigger and even better package the
stellar display is better at 5.7 inches
the performance is super smooth and
reliable for any and all usage levels
and the camera is still one of the best
in Android today expandable storage and
replaceable batteries might be missed
but we were still able to enjoy the note
in spite of all of that in the note 5 if
we work with what we're given this phone
still delivers as always thank you guys
very much for watching and I hope you
enjoyed this review of the samsung
galaxy note 5 the note 5 is still a
spectacular device no doubt about it it
just doesn't really offer the things
that we kind of expected it to even if
our expectations were a little bit high
the impact of the note 5 just isn't
where it was last year with the note 4
and even before then with the note 3 but
if you spend some time with this a new
version of the Galaxy Note we're kind of
certain that you'll still pretty much
fall in love with it that being said
however you can keep it tuned to andro
30.com for even more explorations into
the note 5 including comparisons between
it and all of the flagships currently
outs right now and even in the future as
we still have a few more months left and
