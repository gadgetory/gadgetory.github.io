gone hey buddy hey hey it's Josh magar
from Andrew authority what's going on
everybody and we're taking a look at the
cameras of the iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S
to compare the two now because these are
the smaller devices in their respective
lines we're going to just use those
cameras and you can take a look at our
comparison of the note 7 versus the 7
plus and now we'll be in a different
video but for now we're just taking a
look at these now we're mainly going to
be passing judgment on the picture
quality so you'll see a lot of still
shots here and we'll zoom in to them
with 100 crops from time to time
however in abundant light for the most
part we found that it's kind of a
toss-up between these two cameras while
the galaxy s7 might tend to saturate a
little bit more than the slightly more
accurate iPhone 7 in its pictures we did
find that both pictures were actually
really pleasing to the eye we also did a
lot of these photos with HDR off so
unless otherwise stated all of these
photos are purely from the sensor and
camera app in auto mode without HDR we
do have one main example to show the HDR
effects then we'll let you know when
that comes up main camera recording was
done in 4k resolution which means that
video stabilization the software videos
let it be off but all of these clips
will be optically stabilized still so
you can see what that effect has on the
videos both cameras use 12 megapixels
and the galaxy s7 uses dual focus pixels
to help with autofocus which will be
shown in a clip in a little bit but from
there you have 4k video recording and on
the front facing cameras you have the 5
megapixels on the galaxy s7 and 7
megapixels on the iPhone 7
however the galaxy s7 is capable of
recording 2k video on the front shooter
how are you good I'm good
kind of snuck Gannon got some Oprah
right in attending this conference now
you may notice that the Galaxy s7 s
front-facing camera is using software
stabilization at 1080p this is mainly to
demonstrate how it does have this
software stabilization over the iPhone 7
which does not so in this particular
situation from the top balcony at the
nerdcon in Pasadena
I was able to zoom into this photo and
notice that the iPhone 7 does tend to
overexpose just a little bit while the
galaxy s7 does tend to over saturate
however in this picture the details are
captured very well no matter which one
you look at that changes when I'm taking
a look at this particular close-up photo
where the close-up when zoomed in
actually shows that the galaxy s7 is
better at getting the details in the
fari√±as of this little Flareon even
this awesome rendition of ash from the
Evil Dead was better rendered on the
galaxy s7 which did a better job of
sharpening the image as you can see in
the chainsaw hand there where it's just
a little bit softer in the iPhone 7
putting the galaxy s7 above it in terms
of just overall quality now in judging
dynamic range I had to keep HDR off and
then I've turned it on later to see what
the effect would be in these photos with
HDR off there definitely was a little
bit better dynamic range of the iPhone 7
which was able to better expose the
darker areas while not blowing out the
rest
however when HDR was turned on the
galaxy s7 simply blew away the iPhone 7
in terms of its high dynamic range and
also the fact that the HDR on the iPhone
7 is actually quite a bit more subtle
my super commercial and I know everyone
knows
Hey
let's take one last look at HDR before
we get into our few low-light shots
basically what the galaxy s7 is trying
to do is compensate and kind of over
exaggerated shadows while the iPhone 7
is trying to tone down what might
otherwise be an already pretty well
exposed photo and as I did mention the
autofocus speed of the galaxy s7 is
actually a lot better than the iPhone 7
mainly because of its dual focus pixels
in this particular example you can see
after tapping on the same area on both
cameras while recording video the galaxy
s7 simply does it a lot faster and for
our final shots here in this camera
comparison we'll take a look at
low-light comparisons the galaxy s7 does
tend to go warmer in its color
temperature but as you can see here in
Mega Man the details and the sharpness
overall in the galaxy s7 is better for
its subject and there's no better place
to actually take a look at these
low-light situations than in a
restaurant of foodie pictures coming up
just after this but you can see via the
text on the wall that the galaxy s7 has
better sharpness even if it is a lot
warmer in color temperature and our
final shot here is a foodie photo and
you can see that all of those mustard
seeds are looking better on the galaxy
s7 and so there you had for this
comparison between the cameras of the
iPhones and the Samsung Galaxy s7 the
galaxy s7 did excel in sharpness and
detail and plenty of the shots that we
saw but really if you take a look at
both of these cameras you're going to
get a good image or video either way
they're both very capable cameras and
you can let us know in the comments
below which one you would prefer keep it
tuned to Android or for even more
coverage of Android up against the new
iPhones and remember to stay tuned
because we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
