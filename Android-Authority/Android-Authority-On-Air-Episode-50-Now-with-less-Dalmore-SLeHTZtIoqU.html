original android hang out chill on
google+ I'm Derek Ross and I am Scotty
Anderson and with us this week we have
rookie AKA Christopher book not the
other way around from android authority
as well as Johnathan Franklin and Dan
Charlton CPU expert hi everyone um so
thanks for joining us this week we have
a whole bunch of rumors to talk about
unfortunately there wasn't a whole lot
of major news in the Android world but
we have a few topics such as you know
what's Android and Windows going to do
here in the near future you know is
Android going to take over the windows
desktop with tablets and everything uh
we actually had a big story about that
on android authority this week we're
talk about some upcoming device rumors
because like i said it's rumor week
we're gonna talk about some chromebook
rumors we're gonna even dig into some
processor rumors ah and we have some
Android ecosystem news is usual and uh
Dan do we have any Dan's wani time to
talk about patent wars this week or no
uh there's been some news and patents
but not really a whole lot this week I'm
sure you can find something to yell
about right alright so Oh before we get
started on the Android news let's talk
about some android authority news we had
some milestones this past week actually
two major milestones we we had a hundred
thousand subscribers on youtube so those
of you that are watching via YouTube
right now thank you very much what's due
time if you subscribed if you did not
subscribe yet go and hit that little
subscribe button that's up in that
corner or maybe it's up in that corner
wherever it's at you know go ahead and
hit that if you're watching on Google+
right now thank you very much for
watching Google+ we now have 100
thousand plus ones if you have them plus
one android authority yet go ahead and
hit that it's you know it's over there
actually it's like I down that way go
ahead and the plus one that and yeah
help us get towards a 200k so anyways to
celebrate us getting a hundred thousand
youtube subscribers and a hundred
thousand plus ones on google+ we're
going to give away a nexus 4 fan is at
an international giveaway why yes yes it
is good to know no matter where you're
from on planet earth you are eligible
and usually on these type of contest now
we're saying hey go here circles follow
us like a share share share you know you
know we we don't really need you to do
that we you know what would you want you
to do is give us some feedback so we're
gonna go and put the comment in the show
feed here and you can get in the in the
comments the link to where you can go
give us some feedback so just go to the
website you'll find the form just ask
for a mule hey how we're doing you know
uh you know what can we do to better
serve you what can we do to improve and
I'm really interested in is what can we
do to do better on air because well
obviously we're doing some hell
something wrong you know Scott he can't
even give away a contest he's a lot of
giveaway contest anymore but uh hello
there was no more Nexus back door
Fiasco's if with your life I would like
to add is that people don't even have to
tell us anything yeah that's awesome
we've really appreciated if they did but
you can say nothing and still enter the
content exactly say something because
they do take courage but you just click
the button then you're eligible but if
you want to say rookie he is doing great
but he could improve upon such things as
yeah it was more guitars more guitars
yeah yeah boring guitars on the back
wall yes green maybe sometime Noah hey
that's definitely an area you need to
focus on good put a pillow in the corner
over there then
to be a definite improvement yeah maybe
add a mandolin or a full drum kit set up
in the back a little drums in the
background that's what yeah that's a
good suggestion I could see that maybe
you could do a live intro and outro for
she dual jam session you know maybe a
soldier yeah no I yeah yeah like what's
the table on I'll do it any suggestion
for me would be and make my bed what
that actually i'll tell you right now if
you submit a suggestion to have scott
maybe then make his bed for a show that
will be amazing I can't go my way too
i'd asked him i will listen to all the
feedback that people give me um whether
it's outrageous or whether it's
constructive criticism i will listen to
all of it and I will do all of it all
right so so anyways android authority on
air has a big announcement coming up as
you notice this is episode 50 now with
less now more an episode 50 is two weeks
away obviously from 50 to 52 weeks in a
year that means we're going to be year
old soon so we're gonna do some cool
stuff as well in two weeks we're gonna
have a ton ton of giveaways uh we have a
few things lined up a few things in the
works such as we're gonna give away a
hundred and fifty dollars worth of
cruzerlite gift codes so if you like
need some cases need some plushies some
you know cruzerlite cool stuff we're
gonna have that and a whole bunch more
we have planned so we're gonna be
announcing a little bit more next week
about we have planned as well and
obviously in two weeks we'll have
giveaways for those of you that watch
the show live web some special stuff for
you but we know everybody can't make it
lives we're gonna make it fair so we're
gonna give away some stuff after the
show for people that you know watch on
youtube later or they listen on
soundcloud or stitcher or wherever else
you can find us on the web which is
pretty much like everyone right alright
so let's get to some android stuff ah
android 4.2 point2 has been making the
rounds via leaks over the past week or
so who saw in yo show up in brazil with
a blurry screen shot we saw another
blurry
screenshot of somebody else running
Android 4.2 point2 and people so that
said you know what you can fake a
screenshot you can edit a build prop
which yes you can I could be running
android seven-point 53 right now I
wanted to buy editing my build up
problems what's that Dan I would cause
some interesting problems yeah but
either way i can edit my build up prop
to say i'm running whatever I want um so
a lot of people said you know it has
screenshots or you know kind of
inconclusive and we know it's obviously
coming and you know but we need some
more evidence so I asked our webmaster
here at Android authority Derek Scott to
dig into our logs and book the Apache
web server logs and show me everything
that said android 4.2 point2 and I saw
Nexus Galaxy Nexus is running Android
4.2 point2 I saw Nexus 4 Nexus 7 Nexus
10 I saw every support a Nexus device
running Android 4.2 point2 and I thought
well you know somebody could really be
trolling the android community right now
and are editing the build-up prop on
every Nexus device they own and that
that's very possible but then I love
your servers with whose requests well
yeah so I thought okay they could do
that but then I looked at a little bit
further and there's multiple versions of
the build such as jdq 23 which actually
is the most popular one but there's
there's a good half a dozen if not more
different build so that means they would
have to edit their build up prop again
restart their phone log into the website
shut down that's but I mean yeah that's
a lot of work so you have four different
devices six different builds showing up
on each one and we saw multiple builds
of chrome and Chrome Beta and also
Flipboard so that's a whole hell of a
lot of work to fake all that stuff and
it wasn't just one or two visits it's
dozens of hits hundreds of hits the
actual most popular device was the the
Galaxy Nexus actually and it visited the
site a thousand times in the past week
that is so
yeah um well it's a thousand hands I
guess it's on a thousand visits so it
was on the site more than just one page
it browsed around and opened a whole
bunch of stuff so I'm gonna say that's
pretty much a done deal that it the
builds their it's actively being tested
by internal Googlers most likely um it's
you know it's probably coming soon when
do we know when no come tomorrow if you
come in the month who knows but it but
it's definitely there and chances are
somebody's watching us or reading this
right now from one of those devices
since it pretty much hammered our server
with that so I mean the android
authority websites pretty popular with
google testers yeah we you know I've
always wondered that do they go around
visiting all the different Android news
sites just to see if somebody you know
figures this out or you know just to
laugh at them when they get stuff wrong
hahaha they think we're working on that
well you know I want one of the bit I
didn't mention this in the article that
I wrote this past week but one of the
builds actually said cyanogenmod four
point to point to it was a Santa Mon
nightly from November 25th 2012 so I
mean that's obviously fake but soaps so
somebody ended their build up prop
couple months back the it was probably a
CM nightly me I might not have been but
either way they edited to say four point
two point two and that was obviously
fake and you can you can obviously tell
those type of things so anyways yeah
it's you can tell us someone's 12
basically I mean no offense to whoever
did that I'm just saying that like when
I was around that age I did that kind of
stuff like I you edited your build up
her off when you were 12 years old well
I would like compile code and I like 20
years ago you ready to act like i I just
I i programmed all this and I'd changed
the name of things because I you know I
knew how to compile stuff I knew how to
edit little bit but I didn't know how to
code yet so i have a feeling that's kind
of what you're seeing there
they may not be 12 they could be
tomatoes McIntosh deliver to 3.1 what's
that you made his Macintosh look like
Windows 3.1 back in the day all right so
we have some some with some other
ecosystem news here the no surprise
right the Android ecosystem Android
continues to dominate the market q4
numbers are out and so that's all sales
of devices from sep tember to the end of
december and fifty three point four
percent of the market share for those
three months was android and that's
massive but now that we know that it's
actually slightly up from last quarter
it's almost up by a percent so there is
there's growth or from this quarter last
you that was from last quarter III had
apple is usually an apple comes in
second place they grew two percent over
the last three months so Apple you know
apples are slowly slowly coming back you
know two percent growth they're cute one
right like that's going to be the best
quarter they have because they just
released these like room yeah 2013
exactly and you know coming in in the
last three spots or obviously blackberry
Windows Phone and and Symbian as well
they but they barely to show up on the
charts yes symbian Simeon comes in at
Point sick point six percent you know so
there's trucking along and blackberry
and Windows Phone make up less than ten
percent so and they're continuing losing
market share as well and desperately
trying to call their way back yeah and
on the device front apple sold more
devices than samsung and then we have
HTC and then Motorola then LG actually
rose a little bit i'm assuming because
of you know nexus for sales because I
would doubt time
you like that joke huh no I'm serious
they haven't sold enough for that Jews
like helps there I know I know once they
saw this razor thin margins about algae
they never do they were the one of the
lower guys to actually grow yeah but did
they really didn't have anywhere to go
but up hey now simians bought him and
they're still going down well send ian
is dead there's no device available now
the simians oh yeah if we all I'm going
to say I'm an LG fan I really am I
probably shouldn't be I have no reason
to be but if I didn't have the droid DNA
right now I would have an optimist g oh
yeah oh no I said their latest cluttered
devices are great and there's a leak
actually we're going to talk about here
in a minute about the optimus g pro well
that's a new vice news uh let's move on
a little bit here a little more Android
ecosystem news so I believe dan you have
some information about Samsung and Apple
yeah so the brand keys consumer loyalty
index was released off in February and
Samsung is leading a lot of electronic
categories which really isn't all that
surprising because they make tvs that
people like as well as a lot of other
appliances but this is the first year
they're beating apple on the category
smartphones they're also tying happen on
the category of laptops computers in
general so they've really go a long way
because you know enlarge samsung was
never a big computer company so for them
to be catching up in laptops is a huge
huge step forward for that um amazon
also get out apple in the category
dedicated to tablets so that's not just
you know that's the ipad losing to the
kindle right like that's a huge step
forward for android in general and
especially for amazon not a good sign
for Apple at all this isn't just some
little
serving right like this is a 40,000
person survey that they put ninety-five
percent confidence in so it's a pretty
big deal and the difference between
Apple and Samsung wasn't small so Apple
has been leading in all these rankings
for pretty long time and that lead is
disappearing so we're bad news for Apple
yeah I've noticed the one of my friends
who have samsung phones will see laptops
like I had a Sam look terrible samsung
netbook for a while and they'd be like
oh samsung makes computers to like they
had literally started to think of them
as just the phone company so what's
interesting to see that they're doing
more with their computer stuff which to
me was more what I thought of when I
thought of Samsung's but yeah I mean I
before cell phones I just think of them
as general electronics right like TV
yeah TV is here TV is a stereo equipment
yeah a DVD player whole electronics
right yeah it makes sense that they jump
into cell phones just like Vizio is
trying to jump into computers and cell
phones and tablets right like it's not a
big jump from electronics manufacturers
here manufacturing some other type of
electronics that use him most of the
same did you diversify themselves you
know yeah that way they don't get bought
out like Merola it was diversified and
still not stable they had a pretty clean
start with computers to in if you look
at their computers they're beautiful I
mean they're very well designed a
comparable course they are they could
they copied Apple right Oh games samsung
products are designed for humans yeah
look everybody else's products that are
parently not i don't know i'll so my
little samsung netbook the it started
falling a play George is falling apart
everywhere literally bits and pieces of
plastic popping off open it up in little
bits would spring that we're supposed to
be covering wires it was not good
alright so let's talk about some devices
so anybody here and yeah oh yeah oh yeah
you know however you want to say and
people say different ways but uh that
kid that android console Kickstarter
from last summer anybody a backer no no
no I gave him a hundred bucks you know I
I'm not even a console gamer but I
thought it was a heck of an idea so I
gave a hundred bucks um they're gonna be
shipping out to Kickstarter regular
backers sometime next month does the
developer edition has already gone out
if they made an announcement recently
that there's going to be a different oh
yeah product every year similar to
smartphones such as you know the galaxy
galaxy s2 then the galaxy s3 then a
galaxy s4 so they're gonna follow that
hardware so roll out and that makes
sense because the mobile technology is
changing extremely fast you know that
there's new processors there's better
processors there's more RAM or you know
prices are falling so that makes sense
but what's interesting about this is
most consoles now last four years you
know the Xbox last four five seven years
seen it you know I mean so nothing how
the Xbox also cost hundreds of dollars
and this only cost a hundred bucks so
it's a little you know I'm curious yeah
ill approach it they can very easily
jack up the specs in different ways and
you put more ram and it or put a real
hard driving in it and make a three or
four hundred dollar device that's more
designed to compete with the other
big-name consoles and eventually you
know after the first like roll out I
mean they might do that but I think with
like the each device per year the
concept is awesome if they're trying to
go after the big big guys you know um I
mean it's awesome in that they'll sell a
lot of devices and make more money than
the big guys there's
for the long game but the trade-off is
that you get much more in depth and you
know big games on those consoles because
they do last for so long and so you get
game development companies to quit years
into making these games so they're
highly refined and highly polished in
android games are getting better but
they aren't on that level they have
nowhere near the wherewithal of the
bigger companies better console
themselves yep and part of the reason
for that is how fast the hardware is
moving a mobile right now right like
your company is not going to invest
eight months into developing some game
because everything that's on the market
right now it's going to be obsolete in
eight months well began from a
development standpoint let's say right
now you develop for the first generation
product that's it has a Tegra 3
processor a year from now the o'yea two
comes out and it has a tiger for so now
developers got to make a game that is
compatible with both platforms they'll
want one thing I saw the both platforms
what the CEO said that all games are
gonna be backwards compatible the CEO
can say that but when Android stops
being backwards compatible he doesn't
have a choice she Lydia she the program
like there is a muster designed to run
for android 4.2 that don't run on
Android to point out yeah i mean that's
nothing that any three more days gonna
do is going to change that fact was very
true college when they're expecting
fourth parties to be developing games to
sell them on their fee on soul doesn't
look they make everything better agree
software that's released they can't
promise that and if they make anything
backwards or if they don't make things
backwards compatible then it will give
them an incentive to purchase the new
one because it all have hardware and
software that's a little bit different
yeah one thing that this is going to
help them out as you take your games
with you so when you a couple years from
now you buy the oh yeah 3 you're you
know you don't have to go buy all new
games you know your games are gonna come
forward with you and you're not going to
lose those titles you're not going to
lose money which is sometimes different
you know some going from maybe the
PlayStation 2 to about the upcoming
PlayStation 4 you
that those games might not work I guess
you'd say that with a place for right
now I mean you can get it on you know
yeah I mean that's the same thing so
there is trying to make throaty only one
who absolutely hates this idea for a
game console no because I mean for a
phone yeah I understand I'm gonna buy it
I'm gonna use it it's gonna get obsolete
after a while but I can still make calls
and things like that but with games I
don't want to have something that's
obsolete in a year I don't want to have
something that's obsolete in three years
I'm going to have something that's going
to last at least four years of
entertainment and your things may come
out that are going to be more
technologically advanced but I want to
be supported at least that long yeah and
you also want to have the big name games
that people are talking about on the
other platforms and you know you might
have developers develop just
specifically for oh yeah and not
Microsoft they might do it Dan I mean I
mean and I don't know how big names are
going to be but they they're gonna have
to do that in order to add another
luring effect there will be some games
specifically just for it that only are
on that better that's that's gonna be a
hard thing to get because the majority
of the people that develop for this are
going to be independent developers that
just don't have a ton of money to put
into it with the other thing is you risk
if you remember pc gaming especially
when pc gaming started and everybody's
having a rush to hug great their
graphics card every couple of years
because beginning to get so big and who
you is going to go through the same
thing if they decide that they won't use
mobile hardware but when you make a game
for something like that you have to
cater to the lowest common denominator
if i make a game for iOS and i can
optimize it for an iphone 5 but there
are so many people still in an iphone 4
that I really can't choose to make a
game that so graphically intense this
going to you know completely obsolete in
a minute any get any game developer that
wants to make money has to cater to that
market so right now you've got consoles
that are
16 years old and the pc gaming market is
you know it's still going but most he's
pc games are ports from games that were
intended for these consoles so the piece
of Enzo is nowhere near where it should
be because the consoles are holding it
bad and I hear everything you're saying
on that but let's back up a second and
then compare the two we're talking about
a stick seven hundred dollar computer or
a six seven hundred dollar you know new
brand new playstation whenever whenever
a brand new xbox versus a 100-dollar
game console and so no upgrades what
what is the true but that still leaves
you buying them every year and it still
leaves you getting new games because the
games are gonna get obsolete too but the
game just like I doubt and I could be
wrong because it's not released yet but
I doubt we're gonna see a fifty-dollar
game like we do right now with the big
name consoles we're gonna see five and
maybe a ten dollar game you know that's
the heart of the problem with having an
android-based console if you're gonna
get a console you want to play console
level games you want ok fifty dollars we
didn't play a game like halo but the
thing is you want to get a console that
is X amount of dollars that's
significantly more so I mean you're not
when you're buying this you're not
thinking i'm buying a console right yeah
people who are buying it are you look at
it and say why the f do i want to buy a
box to play Angry Birds on my TV it's
very true and I think a lot of people
would think that but you can also you
know think that they're not necessarily
you know like I'm not a you and Dan my
three-year-old son would love to play
Angry Birds on the TV that's a good work
and I do that very I look I think
they'll sell products but I mean even
still when you're talking about
obsolescence it's already obsolete it's
coming out some months in the future
yeah exactly great where is nothing
extras are building devices with tegra 4
and I said that seven months ago I
already hundred bucks I said seven
months ago I said all right you know I'm
gonna back this for sure it's coming out
seven months from now it's gonna be
obsolete by then but I said I had faith
and I was only a hundred bucks but yeah
I was very curious what their
going to do and then what do we see at
CES a few weeks ago Wookiee we saw
project shield which is going to come
out with exactly kegger for and it's
going to come out I'm guessing in a few
months probably shield is doing it the
right way shield is saying like hey
we're gonna use your computer so you can
just upgrade that and you can still use
shield and think of anything with it I
mean because android games on the device
enough to but you're never gonna them
will net not never but I mean shield is
not going to become as obsolete nearly
as quick as anything else one thing to
mention would be the dying breed of
desktops all right let's move on because
it is turned into whoo yeah all the
things and games all the things but
which is good but let's move on we'll
talk about some rumors we will talk
about some real news ooh I like rumors a
little bit all right so fingers crossed
confidence hype rumor the galaxy s4 is
gonna be available very soon maybe maybe
a months maybe March fifteenth who knows
that that's what the latest rumor is a
but supposedly it's going to roll out to
Eastern countries in Europe first then
all of Europe and Asia followed by that
and sometime in April then the United
States and Africa and Australia will
follow in may and june by the time y'all
us you may have to give us carriers a
few months to screw things up so i'm
guessing you've us if this is right
won't get it till june but we'll see the
international version come out maybe in
in april so look I really think I don't
know what you guys think but with
regards to looks it's going to be
between the note 2 and the s3 and
they're going to form them into one
thoughts I can definitely see that
happening I would personally rather see
something a bit more I don't know I know
people love that design but it always
seems a little clunky to me I don't know
what it is I might go change something
I'm gonna say it's not going to be
extremely different from the s3 it'll be
a little different but it's going to be
similar enough that people are gonna are
going to see it in and then home if they
had a s3 prior right yeah exactly in the
s3 is the best selling phone right now
so they don't want to go and change
everything on people yeah plus ammo
similar to Apple's method you don't want
to change it but you won't change it
every few years not you know keep it the
same for five years you know yeah I mean
I think that the the hardware will be a
generational update the software
obviously would be the latest jelly bean
come out um but I think design guys know
they're going to try and sort of
streamline things into making sure that
people know that this device is a little
generally like this our galaxy essence
just like people know devices that look
like iPhones or iPhones yep yeah and I
don't think that devices don't look like
everything else on the planet are also
iphones or the hell thinks they're that
stupid Damon Hart said just say no to
the hardware button I'm with him one
hundred-percent hundred-percent the
doing it just because the history is
popular does not give them an excuse to
let off the gas as far as being
comfortable because there's still a lot
of things that Samsung could do the
Samsung is very good at marketing and
they've done extremely good job of
making people aware that their brand
exists but LG Sony HTC Motorola have
really raised the bar for build quality
in this if you look at the heck
seriously and phones like that it makes
an s3 I mean realistically samsung
phones are fairly durable but they feel
like T plastic and yeah step up those
kinds of things then you know they don't
need to let off the gas there they need
to do that they need to work on touch
with yeah I think it'll be interesting
if they do bring up the build quality I
mean you talk about them wanting to be
familiar with the prior device so I
don't think it will change like with
leaps and bounds but I definitely think
that they will screen resolution they'll
definitely increase that and that will
be something that will be appealing to a
lot of people but they can still make
the phone feel and you know be familiar
with the s3 something bigger and you
know better hardware and better screen
resolution would be kind of the touting
features but know that that build
quality is I'm sorry to say I think it's
crap Jeff is what Samsung does and they
doing well yeah we're gonna do when the
s4 comes out wiki we're gonna do another
drop test like we did last year and
we're gonna we're gonna see how it does
you know we're gonna scrap yeah it's not
even just about durability though it
looks you'll feels cheap yeah it's not
just like I'm not saying that the build
qualities is flimsy or poor I'm just
saying it feels cheap very true you know
and my legs as both of those things I
think I actually did this with a friend
of mine today I had him take my DNA
which obviously has its flaws and a note
Mary and I told him they'd take him and
try to twist it and he twisted the the
note 2 around and did it with a DNA and
and the DNA just feels more solid did
not say is solid whoopee it is it's a
very solid fo night yeah AJ you know I I
hate and I love the phone I love the
built quality I did hate with you by the
way I just hate well there's a couple
things i hate about it I hate that I
have to use my fingernail to turn the
power on or off I shouldn't have to I
shouldn't have to like not like cut my
thumb nail you know for weeks at a time
just so I can use my phone um and not
really but I'm over exaggerating a
little bit and I hate I hate hardware
keys i do but it's a very well-built
film but anyways let's move on and talk
about some other other devices here some
some newer devices out the vizio co-star
gotten over the air update this week
Scott you have a vizio co-star correct
have an opportunity you have an update
right so I will so Scott and those of
you that have the vizio co-star this is
actually the first google TV set-top box
to get the version 3 update version 3 is
actually a big deal it adds a couple
different things on the co-star it added
amazon instant video which before it was
just a web browser interface and it was
absolutely horrible yeah i mean it was
bad in my opinion i never used it
because it was so bad the app is amazing
um it also added voodoo to the co-star
and at in it added the new version of
MGO which you could men manually updated
in the past actual MGO came out finally
uh about a month ago so you can but if
you didn't update it yet it added it for
you food with a rocker service of buying
a movie and having to digital copy
available MGO is that service emgo's at
service this is a boo doo de doo doos a
movie round service ok so does nothing
to do with buying something and having
it in the cloud i'm going to say i also
don't know cuz i don't i don't use
voodoo I use Amazon Instant Video i use
netflix i use google play for all my
content I don't use voodoo so I don't
know what Allah all there is to know
about it um but I do know about em go
except tried it and MGO izle is a locker
and let's use ultraviolet um content
anyways I think that's what it is haha
clothes making of and in back to the the
co-star co-star owners now have the
primetime quick guide so when you hit
guy it doesn't bring up your DVR box
your cable provider box brings up a
little quick guide showing you if you're
watching a TV show let's a drama it'll
bring up other drama shows that are
currently playing right now you're
watching sports I'll show you other
sports shows and then you can scroll
through it it's very really nice i like
that primetime quick guy it's pretty
awesome but we don't want no drama and
it also added voice search support
widget which is actually kind of
interesting because
the remote unlike other remotes doesn't
have a mic built in the Hisense pulse
has a remote that has a mic built in so
you need to use another bike on the
google play app doesn't fully support it
the way that Google TV the new google TV
version google TV version would want you
to when you try to launch voice search
it says something like hey a new version
of the Google TV app is coming check for
in the play store soon something like
that but but but you can you can still
do voice search like you always could
have with the existing Google TV app
able remote and it allows you to do
searches a that way I want Google now on
google TV now what Dan you said your
review actually got version 3 as well it
did not I don't think it got version 3
but it did get a significant update
cuzzo I didn't think it was it was I was
going to be shocked if it got version 3
because I was specifically told that
that version 3 was not coming to the
review well I mean I think that it was
on some ancient version it had gotten
updated honeycomb but I think that it
was 3.0 and this just stepped up to 3.2
okay so okay so that man so soon as we
can update over what it was yeah and
thats collecting these are actually
works now where's before it gave some
bizarre menu for your my abs area okay
didn't show any of my apps there nothing
ever updated i can download anything the
Play Store actually works it's a new
like the fresh new UI the y an old TV
and movies app that they released a
while ago that's been working on the
coast are for Jim that update actually
been out for a while then maybe I've
been yeah no no I searched for it it's
never come through okay and of course
it's not like you can root it not edit
yourself you can read it read yet hand
but it's a real oh let's cry bone right
so those of you that have a coach store
need to get your update yet on the
legend a little secret if you force
cliff you go into settings manage
applications then you go down and you
scroll down the list to the co-star
dataservice if you force close that
clear data if there's any data then
force close it and then power off your
co-star we're pull the plug out and plug
it back in when you boot back up chances
are the update will be available for you
if it's not we just calling kind of like
what you do with the framework on an
Android device yeah you III that's
actually how I force the update on mine
and I hope I've told that to a whole
bunch of other people and they've
actually forced the update as well so
there you go good luck um Oh moving on
here let's uh grab real quick nexus 4
images are available again so if you're
into root and ramen this week you want
to make sure you download a copy those
have so you haven't for safekeeping the
probably said if you're under root and
rom and you know what the nexus binaries
are it's an easy way to get back to
stock miners I'm sorry that's the wrong
word next is 42 somatically not the
binaries yeah uh yeah the actual
binaries are still not available yet but
the factory images are there so if you
flash a bad bootloader colonel radio
wrong whatever you do you can get it
back to stock and they're great to have
I've done numerous times on my Nexus 7
Galaxy Nexus so yeah it's it's nice to
have those on the Nexus 4 as well ready
for another rumor ruin all right so
Verizon DNA owners such as me and
Wookiee there's a rumor going around now
that the HTC m7 their new flagship I
hate that word but their new flagship
device is going to come to verizon and
it's basically the exact same phone with
a little smaller screen and a little
bigger processor and a little bigger
camera so you're conscious for a faster
processor faster faster okay okay I mean
they're the really same processor just
close yeah they're real a little bit
bigger it'll make your device a lot
heavier actually with it with a smaller
screen it should actually be lighter
should be but I mean it's just such a
similar device I
I I'm surprised but there was a leak
showing a device on verizon's network or
a device coming to the verizon's network
called the dl X plus and if you remember
the original code name for the DNA was
the DLX and we commonly refer to that as
next the droid d IX a while but it's a
good x it looked like di X because
people writing it in lowercase so a
lowercase alkenyl second i knows that
aged everybody called the the HTC dicks
IX drug pics so so so the overall so the
DL ex-con some people thought it stood
for droid incredible x but after you
know what I can I get into it so anyways
that the Scott so anyways the HTC m7
might be coming to verizon and it might
be called the DNA plus or the deluxe
plus who knows i don't take rumor it's
speculation do you guys think that that
works I mean they dry with the HTC One X
and it does it the plus version kind of
just seems lackluster do you guys think
that as well really I mean like just
come up with a whole new thing and don't
just try to improve on something else
like at least add another number to it
like the galaxy s3 or the egg galaxy s4
but like the plus part of it is verizon
though you think so I did look how many
freaking Motorola's they spit out every
other month there's a new max or plus or
two or drink focal LTE maximum battery
life forever ok that one's coming out
next month well I mean even motorola got
that done this year where you had the
original razr and razr maxx come out
like december of 2011 yeah a few months
later they had the updated version come
out oh no it was like August I mean it
was almost a year remains action
came out then like three months later as
the Razorbacks and then like three
months ago racer too and the thing is
it's too but the thing was it had a
meaning to it it had a meeting to it the
max was battery life HD but why didn't
the original just come with that that's
my way because they have to sell you on
other devices sun-hi whatever can boost
mobile verizon though he's like a
surprise to see it from HTC Derek you've
got to be pissed about this right I'm
getting rid of the DNA anyways because I
hate that damn phone who you can't do
that I a 600 bucks but I can't use that
damn thing anymore I hate it I loved it
for the first month that I had it wiki
it was awesome but I can't stand sense
anymore I need an AOSP rom on it you
know I know what you mean but that's the
worst thing is that I have to have mine
for reviews and for I mean not reviews
anymore but four verses and things like
that so I you know what here is I'm
hearing you need a raise so you can get
a new phone no no all right I can I have
a note to hear that I can totally use I
just can't use it on that's a will put
Mike Weston to get you did it's fine why
don't you know I've got it I really do I
really want to like the DNA well you
know working horizon keeps trying to
make me not like it the authorizing
typically does that's what Verizon does
there's a this is their motto I believe
you know yeah Google's motto is don't be
evil Verizon's is like yeah we're evil
within we don't care yes he really feels
like as much money as you can all right
so just me one let's talk about
something groups let's talk about
something not so much related to Android
but kind of related Android but
definitely related to google and we're
all gonna go fans let's talk about some
chromebook stuff so i give my
impressions of mine of what my your own
book ya know two minutes niggas
because we're talking about Chromebook
rumors oh my god can I just talk about
mine and I got it and I'm excited okay
so Chromebook pixel the google the
internet on fire a couple days ago uh
Chromebook pixel no what no one really
knows what the hell this thing is or if
it's even real and then for a hundred o
mine you know thank God hangouts have
mute Scott there we go okay so it's a
Chromebook pixel you know it is it Rio
is it a rumor is it fake is it a PR
stunt who knows um it was a video that
showed up on YouTube showing a very
professionally done video advertisement
for a supposed new Chromebook called
Chromebook pixel and it has a massive
display for those of you that you know
for lack of better terms will just say
had a Retina display I'd hate I hate
using that word but that's that's really
what it was it had me a 234 ppi i
believe it was massive the screen had
four million pixels so very very it was
a touchscreen too and if you guys
remember sometime back in November there
was a leak out of China saying Google's
building a new Chromebook it's going to
have a touchscreen yada yada yada and
then we don't hear anything for months
then all of a sudden this video pops up
so is it real is it not real well you
know in my opinion nothing you know
nothing confirms something like takedown
requests and immediately video started
to be taken down all across YouTube now
there's new ones up there that are taken
down but the original one was taken down
so who knows if it's real or not then
the the CEO of the company said that
sorry the video was leaked we didn't
post it our servers were hacked people
stole the video and uploaded it and then
the guy publicly apologizes to Sergei
on google+ you know plus mentioning him
which is kind of interesting you know so
if you like was is this real is this a
you know PR stunt nobody really knows um
and who knows uh there's been other
people that have looked into a little
bit jr. Raphael from computer world
looked into it a lot and he said that
basically that he doesn't think the
company is professional enough to work
for Google they have you know Shawty
advertisements with spelling mistakes
and broken English on their website you
know it doesn't look like professional
operation that so chances are it's you
know a fake or a PR stunt which very
well could be true and then I looked
into a little bit and i found out that
chromebook pixel calm was registered
last October and the company that is
holding it right now is Mark monitor
which you know they hold a lot of
domains but mark monitor does various
domain services for google and
markmonitor list google is one of their
top 100 companies that they do work for
a top one on our clients now they also
do work for many other clients too so i
don't know oh you know i don't really
know what to believe the the fact that
you know we already heard about this
from china leaked months ago then
shortly after that the domain name was
bought by a company that Google uses the
video is very well done it's not you
know if somebody spent a lot of time
doing it I don't know you know what what
do you guys believe the Chromebook pixel
is it real is it not real I personally
want it to be real and I think the name
is badass I think it's a great name I
think it's a good thing a good milestone
to start off a new type of their own
Chromebook that is theirs I can be cool
but as to the rumors and if it's valid
or not who knows we all in the Android
world would love to have all the rumors
be true and that would be cool but I
don't know
there's any validity do this yeah I mean
I question whether or not they want to
you know start competing with themselves
yeah I think I think nothing would kill
him droid tablets faster than
touchscreen Chromebooks that could run
android apps well and that goes along
with it with other rumors you know
another speculation that hey Google put
out a new statue last week it is a
Chrome Android hmm you know is that just
supposed to be something that's cool but
it's google everything has like an
underlying in a meeting right you know
that's what we'd like to thank you you
know it's a lot of people haven't
noticed that statute that statue is
actually one pixel one yes I don't know
Elsa some chrome colored the foil hats
people there ooh so you know everything
else so many people have said no they
want a marriage of chrome and and an
Android and could this happen could have
you know eventually happened and forever
ago people said no they were on
different architectures and then we see
projects like android x86 you know
saying well it's poured into that
unofficial reports and then we see
chromebook running on arm I thought the
samsung chromebook you know so we say
okay what can be done and then we start
hearing things like a touchscreen you
know so Chrome OS using trem west on a
touchscreen that just doesn't sound very
intuitive because it's not built for
touch so why in the hell would they
build it you have to do a complete you
know a bunch of UI changes that's my
opinion I could be wrong then you start
thinking well what if chrome can run
android apps it just speculating and
then you have a rumor such as today
we're references to certain code from
Nvidia showed up on chromium org the
there Garrett they're their code review
site and you know what does that mean
who knows it means that while they're
testing a new processor from Nvidia
the Tegra 4 there's chances are there's
a new device codenamed puppy that
they're building for and Android was
mentioned in one section in the code
what does that mean I don't know it
makes me excited to find out you know
the future but it's a bunch of
speculations and a bunch of rumors and
you know the code doesn't lie it's
obviously there it says that chromium is
being built for the Tegra 4 and the code
name for for that cpu is wayne we had a
long discussion about that and the code
that was pulled from nvidia mentioned a
board that we know the nvidia to be
using it for testing so maybe Google is
using it for testing or on chromium you
know who really knows all we know is
that there's nvidia code there many
videos coming out with a badass
processor that probably could drive all
those pixels in chromebook pixel and
then we'll 4 million pixels because it
has an insane amount of course nothing
to GPU cores yeah so i think they just
could drive tiny chorus to say FU apple
brag about your quad-core GPU now yeah
so so they have all these cores to drive
all these pixels um it's going to be
fast enough to run maybe chrome and
Android who really knows it I'm just
talking out loud will use the name I
mean as a linux user and i'm pretty sure
i know for a fashion you guys are too
what in linux right nvidia is like the
only company that actually supports
linux even though it is a binary blob
nerd do you know Linus Torvalds game
entities a finger a few months re did
you know what Linus said to Nvidia a few
months ago right yeah and and what his
gesture was right well yes I'm aware of
that boom told him they were number one
and what they could go do to themselves
no but my reason that there's a
difference between being like an open
source kind of person and there's a
there is using you know your your code
base to actually hope people use the
hardware they bought I'm sorry nvidia
won't mind supporting linux after buying
tegra floors i mean you know they'll
support the hell out of that well my
point is i only buy geforce cards
because they actually work on linux yeah
i mean that's you know i understand i
have to click that box every time when i
install some like ubuntu or something
luckily fedora makes me go the hard way
into it but uh you know i have to
understand every time I on install
anything that yes I know this is not
open source and I'm tainting the colonel
by doing this but at least they're
letting me use my hardware we're is try
to same thing what eti does the same
time uh yeah except I've never had a TI
actually work well that's the main
difference to me but uh anyone but then
the GPUs that Nvidia puts in laptops
don't work with linux at all yes
actually i have no experience just get
the desktop system out of ships they're
making art utterly and completely
incapable of running linux right now
that i did not run anyways anyways back
on topic so anybody go my erection war
chrome look android your real quick was
just that i think they have a bit more
experience writing for those kinds of
systems so that say nvidia stuff with
chrome OS not so unbelievable as it
might be for somebody else yeah and they
votes have been a lot better in terms of
open source with arm-based production we
have with some of their desktop stuff
for laptops in particular hello the
question is is is let's say this is true
let's say
pixel or puppy you know or maybe that's
its code name who knows this device does
come true is it going to be android
based and chrome is going to run in it
and chrome is going to bring web apps or
is it going to be chrome chromium OS
chrome OS and chrome is going to get
Android app support I think Chrome OS
getting android apps acuerdas far more
likely of virtualizing and yes I easier
than gersiol as in Chrome OS yeah yeah I
definitely think the second option is
definitely more doable and it seemed it
makes a lot more sense so that if that
actually happens that I mean what does
that do to current android tablets not
much I don't think so is it doesn't do
much to tablets at all it's interesting
though so you would have a tablet and a
phone that runs just plain Android and
then you would have a laptop or a debt
or a chromebox or desktop that runs
Chrome OS and you can go ahead and pull
in all your Android apps it you know and
Android content I don't think either one
of those is going to be the case because
I bear with me on and I was having a
discussion about it the other day but I
think the purpose if you look at things
like Google now on android and how many
native apps is that replacing but chrome
in a way chrono has any way they need
something because anything especially on
the desktop or anything tablet form
factor touch UI on a web browser is crap
it is garbage if you because it is still
optimized for mouse and keyboard
realistically and developers just don't
have anything there I think the purpose
that they're going to use the chrome
Chrome OS was really initially intended
for business and education but also
Chrome OS can be something to bring to
Android to actually get the web on
Android as platform because they need to
find ways because Google that's their
monetization method
exactly they want as many people
possible to be on the web so they give
it away for free the more people that
are on the web the more money they make
but the developers have to get on board
too so if they get a platformer they're
dominating the desktop web browser and
they're dominating you know the
smartphone you know hopefully the tablet
market too but you have to create ways
to make mobile users use the web more
than they currently do and chrome OS
actually gives I don't love this I n
device will be nothing but chrome but it
will give them a compelling device to
develop for the web yeah all i know is
i'm excited for google IL to see what
awesome things Google and Android and
chrome have coming for us and to see if
any of these things that we've talked
about today end up coming true or a lot
of or something we don't even we haven't
even speculated yeah yeahs comes from it
I think it'll be a revolved around the
Nexus Q in some type of way shape or
form no but I think it'll be something
about bringing those features and
integrating them into something which is
going to be done it's going to be you
know cannibalized and it's going to
happen I just don't know what platform
is gonna go in to be kind of cool to
figure that out Bobby from the hot said
it was an idea in search of a platform
that they package to do a platform that
was totally inappropriate for it yeah
but I'm just interested to see what they
form it into all right so we talked
