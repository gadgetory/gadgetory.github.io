that seems to have a rather polarizing
effect while an influx of new wearable
tech is coming this year there is one
company that harnessed the demand for
this new form factor and the update to
their popular SmartWatch is now on my
wrists hey it's Josh regard for manager
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the pebble steel but first a
quick disclaimer while this version of
the pebble the new pebble steel has been
out for a little bit already I actually
have been a pebble user since Christmas
and my version is the original that was
bought at Best Buy
now while this review is about the
pebble steel it will be somewhat in
comparison to the original pebble that
I'm more used to and after that I will
go over what it's like to use the table
itself in into general experience now
one of the hurdles when it comes to
smartwatches is that they can't seem to
figure out how to merge the two
different mediums while having extra
functionality and a watch is pretty
unanimously desired it's proven rather
difficult to put it all in something
that rivals a real timepiece the
original pebble was able to look pretty
simplistic and didn't try too hard to
mask the fact that it's a piece of
technology that goes on your wrist and
for a lot of people that might be a
little too far away from the timepiece
collector side of the spectrum and it's
more in the trendy nerd area than might
be comfortable
enter the new pebble steel instead of a
completely plastic build the pebble has
started to move more into familiar watch
territory with a metal or matte black
construction that can be outfitted with
either a metal or leather band both
bands look quite nice on the pebble
steel and aren't too hard to change up
but if you want to use your own watch
bands on the pebble steel it won't quite
be as easy as it doesn't take the
standard measurement band that the
original did this is a level of
customization that thus has been lost in
the transition but the trade-off is a
new look that actually works incredibly
well and much better sits alongside real
watch offerings the body of the watch
face itself has a more decisive look to
it with rigid lines and more thickness
it isn't too large for small wrists nor
does it look weird on larger ones and
because of the better build materials
all around every button has a much
better feel than before having a much
better click to them rather than the
somewhat soft squishiness of the
original
there's really only one problem that I
have with the new design choices in the
pebble steel and one of them has to do
with that logo now I understand that
traditional watches have the advantage
of being able to put their logo
underneath the glass and that's not a
luxury that the pebble has but I did
feel a little bit miffed that my
SmartWatch has to pretty much yell at
you that well it's a pebble and the
final gripe in terms of design deals
with the charger while it won't be a big
deal to newcomers of the pebble those
who use the original will find that the
charger has been changed while the new
charger has a stronger magnet and seems
to stay on better than the one before
it's just a bit of a bummer that I
couldn't ostensibly have an extra
charger when buying the next iteration
but thankfully battery life on the
pebble is very good as long as I wasn't
constantly getting notifications I was
usually able to go for five days without
needing to plug in over all the pebble
steel is a proper update to the original
that was already a pretty great
SmartWatch and the new design choice is
bringing into a more conventional watch
style the metal band or the leather band
on a metal body or a matte black body do
provide very little room for
customization so if you want a little
bit more freedom when it comes to the
look of your SmartWatch then the
original pebble is probably the one for
you and if you happen to be like me
you'll also find sometimes that metal
watch is just ring really aren't your
back and in that case we always have the
original to fall back to
and thankfully the pebble ecosystem is
very reliable so choosing either version
of the watch will bring you the same
overall experience in the transition to
the pebble steel the operating system
has been updated to version 2.0 bringing
along with it the ability to check your
notification history and also a new
Android app that quite literally
consolidates the entire software
experience while in the past you were
able to install your applications by
scouring a number of different sources
and installing a bunch of different
companion apps for each and every one
now every pebble app and watch face has
been brought under one roof I already
have a feature focus available showing
the functionality of the brand-new
pebble 2.0 application when it was in
its beta version but the full version
that came out on the Play Store really
just brings a much faster experience and
is largely the same as you would find in
that feature focus video now the best
part of the new app is really the
consolidation of those pebble apps
especially when coming from an earlier
model of the SmartWatch signing into the
app allows you to easily grab all of the
apps you were using before and
automatically load them into your
SmartWatch and with the ever-growing
breadth of watch faces and applications
searching for the ones that you need is
never too difficult but now here comes
the most important part since having the
original pebble and having a paired up
with my smartphone that I use every day
I have found that there is one
particular benefit that it has never
failed to provide ultimately when you
have the pebble set up with a
third-party notification system or even
the one that is built in you'll find
yourself not looking at your phone
nearly as much as you did before
now call me a communications guy which I
am but the growing problem of people
being constantly glued to their phones
is helped by the ability to have them
all send to the pebble if something
comes up you can glance at it and if
it's not important you just dismiss it
and get back to what's really important
and for everyone else the time no longer
taken up by constantly checking your
phone every time it goes off really adds
up sure you can easily find places
nearby to eat using Yelp you can keep
yourself focused and productive using a
Pomodoro app or you can even read your
notes using Evernote like I am right now
but ultimately what the pebble does best
is easily bring you your immediate
information to your wrist so you don't
have to go searching for it and waste
time and to me that is the ultimate
appeal of
pebble while the pebble steel brings
more conventional style to the ecosystem
ultimately it is a SmartWatch that sets
out to perform at least one great
function notification consolidation and
it really succeeds while other
smartwatches might simply try too hard
to replace your smartphone or at least
parts of the smartphone experience the
pebble complements that experience you
might still need your phone nearby to
get the most out of the pebble but its
benefit is undeniable and just like how
you might feel a little naked when you
don't have your favorite watch around
your wrist you will also feel the same
way when you go out with your smartphone
and it doesn't have its trusty pebble
connected to it so as always thank you
guys very much for watching and I hope
you enjoyed this review of the pebble
steel SmartWatch as well as the original
pebble and overall the pebble experience
itself it is a great SmartWatch to have
I wouldn't say it's the best one out
there because we have a ton of them that
are coming out especially with Android
wear being announced recently so keep it
tuned to Android 34 that and all of the
future SmartWatch and wearable tech news
and remember to watch our reviews on
them or comparisons and to watch all of
the content from my buddies in android
that's Jace Joe and Kevin the tech ninja
so keep it tuned here and remember to
head on over to android authority comm
