is considered a great smartphone it's
actually been one of my daily drivers
for the last year the way I look at it
Samsung did set the bar on what we want
a phone that looks premium that's
water-resistant features wireless
charging and takes amazing photos and
videos while many phones are still
playing catch-up at least matching what
they s7 is brought to the table there's
still another secret weapon that the s8
will surely have that no other phones
can come close to offering and that's
none other than Samsung pay which is
crazy right it's seriously an
underappreciated feature when you think
about it samsung pace without a doubt
the most underrated feature that the s8
will offer compared to other mobile
payment solutions out there I find
Samsung paid to be the most reliable
nowadays the success rate is almost
guaranteed and signifying higher than
say Apple pay or Android pay most
payment terminals have NFC connectivity
which is used to initiate your payment
however in the instance that it's not
available the Galaxy s7 and most likely
the SI will then fall back on their
magnetic secure transmission MST for
short the magnetic coil embedded inside
the galaxy s7 generates a dynamic
magnetic field effectively mimicking the
magnetic strip found on your credit
cards and debit cards okay so even
though it hasn't been confirmed yet and
this is just all speculation it could
surely bet that ESA will have Samsung
pay I've tried all sorts of mobile
payment solutions including Apple and
Android pay as well as these electronic
credit cards that have gained popularity
the last few years take for example the
coin card which I thought was the
godsend a couple of years ago but it
turned out to be the least reliable
solution that of the bunch and frankly I
hardly use it anymore like I said
already Samsung pay in my experience has
been almost perfect using it to do
things like pay for parking at a
terminal which was surprising because I
didn't think it was going to work a lot
of terminals rely on having you to
insert the chip in your credit card to
process the payment but Samsung pay
still works with them the only places
that it doesn't seem to work are ATMs
best of all Samsung is providing some
incentives in the form of boom war
by using Samsung pay and that's on top
of whatever rewards or cashback
incentives you get with your credit card
already so while other phones catch up
to meet what Samsung has done with its
flagships
including its upcoming one in the s8
there's still no one else that can touch
what they're doing with Samsung pay the
s8 will more than likely have a few
surprises we haven't seen before
but Samsung paid is that not so secret
weapon that other phones still can't
compete against so you know the SI it's
gonna be a beast of a foam but the most
underrated feature we'll probably see it
will still be Samsung pay so if you guys
wanna learn more about any of the stuff
