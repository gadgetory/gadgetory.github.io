to you by HipChat so this is question
that comes up many many times what is
going on with battery life innovation or
lack thereof we got great innovation
when it comes to system and the chips
when it comes to displays but battery
life lagging behind and they're
important no in fact there's a recent
survey that suggests that battery life
is the number one determining factor
when users decide on which phone goodbye
so what's the dilly according to an IDC
survey called top 10 smartphone purchase
drivers battery life is the top
consideration by a distance way ahead of
ease of use operating system and camera
resolution battery life topped the list
in a similar UK survey by GM i which
found that eighty-nine percent of
respondents felt that long-lasting
batteries were important compared to
sixty-eight percent of brand in second
place and sixty percent for a fast
processor in third so i know what you're
thinking why oh why is there so little
innovation when it comes to battery life
and it really comes down to moving
goalposts the lithium-ion batteries that
power our smartphones have been
improving but the processors and screens
that they're powering have also been
improving much faster as we jump to qhd
displays and octo-core processors we
need more power just to maintain the
same level of usage as we pack more and
more features our expectations for
performance grows and battery life
suffers our smartphones are also getting
prone to overheating which has a
knock-on negative impact on our
batteries but why aren't they improving
faster it's becoming increasingly
difficult for engineers to squeeze more
power out of the existing technology new
breakthroughs require expensive and
time-consuming testing at a much larger
scale safety concerns are paramount with
batteries because they can literally
explode if the manufacturer gets it
wrong there's no substitute for
long-term testing exciting findings in
the lab can always be scaled up for mass
production
how do you balance output capacity
longevity and charging speed even if
something has been extensively tested
and it can be scaled it's going to be
prohibitively expensive compared to
older technology which is already being
manufactured for the mass market it
comes down to the fact that batteries
are just much more difficult to innovate
on and there's also much more safety
concerns to consider so in the short
term you may want to consider a
workaround some people are already
working around the problem by using
extended battery cases external chargers
and extra batteries but there are always
obvious downsides there's no getting
away from the extra expense and added
bulk of a battery case or an external
charger many manufacturers are also
embedding batteries now and making it
harder to replace them ostensibly
because that enables slimmer unibody
designs it can also help with water
resistance and potentially tougher
phones of course it doesn't hurt from
the OEM perspective if you decide to
switch your phone every year or two
because the battery is dying now the
next best thing is simply to charge your
device faster let's talk about that
something like wat up from energy switch
uses RF and Bluetooth technology to
charge a device within 15 feet of a
transmitter could be a game-changer if
truly wireless solutions like that are
proven safe and they hit the market with
the right level of support then perhaps
wireless charging can still be the
answer you also want to remember
Qualcomm's quick charge 2.0 technology
that offers 75 percent faster charging
there's also store dot that wants to
take it much further and promised a 30
second recharge but the technology is
yet to be perfected and it cannot be
retrofitted now I would venture a guess
that many of you would give up your sexy
slim devices for some that's a little
bit thicker for a removable battery so
you could add on extra batteries and
solve that problem that way that's kind
of the low-tech solution to it let me
know in the comments below how many of
you be willing to do that I know I would
so how is your team that you work with
collaborating and communicating if
you're a team like ours here at Android
Authority email alone just ain't cutting
it but hit chat is an instant messaging
video chat document sharing screen
sharing system and updates and code
sharing integrated into one
simple platform emails too slow and
meetings get sidetracked and regular IM
doesn't work well for groups but HipChat
keeps your team in sync no matter where
you are on any device and the best part
is that HipChat integrates with all the
top developer tools like github JIRA
Zendesk and check out the 57 services
that hip-hop plays nice with hipchat
brings your entire project team together
get your team on the same page in
seconds I want you to try HipChat for
free no credit card required if you go
to hipchat com forward slash android
authority sign up by clicking start
chatting and then invite a few team
members and try it out free for 30 days
and for the first 100 signups hipchat is
going to extend their 30-day free trial
to 90 days hipchat your team your
project in sync instantly thanks for
watching android army my name is Jace
love to connect with you right here on
google+ or twitter i really do read them
and i respond to as many as i can i like
talking you guys so let's keep it up you
know what forget about these guys over
here that work really hard to deliver
the very best content on the web to be
your source for all things android i
should see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
