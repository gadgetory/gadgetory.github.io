Authority what's going on everybody and
I have something a little bit different
to show you guys today
lenovo has had some great products here
but we have a small peripheral that is
attached to the top of the phone and it
looks like this this is the selfie flash
and essentially what it is is it goes
into the headphone jack up top right
here and there's a little button on the
back you can see the vibe logo right
there what you get that little button it
becomes a very easy to use selfie flash
self-portrait flash and it does trigger
the picture-taking right there as you
saw but nonetheless in dark situations
you should be able to take a picture
with it there are eight little LEDs in
there that will allow for I'm taking
some horrible pictures of myself but
nonetheless it is able to trigger the
the actual shutter on here and you'll be
able to get pictures that way so we're
just taking a couple of pictures here I
did have a few examples that I use on my
personal moto X using this oh it's a
very lit so you're not going to see
really too much of what it will be able
to do in low-light situations but given
the shots that I already had it does
look like it illuminates the subject
quite well I'll take a real picture
right here and here we go
there you go there's a little bit of a
delay when it comes to the shutter going
off after turning on the flash but you
can always hit the button down here in
the interface anyway so that was just a
really quick look at the selfie flash
I'll go ahead and disconnect it there
and you can see it's quite bright
especially for something as small as
this and the price point will be around
$29.99 which is actually a really nice
price for something that you might end
up using and a lot of low light
situations I can see quite a few people
using it personally I probably would
have it in my bag at the very least and
then use it when I really need that
extra boost so that was the selfies
flash right here and we're here at CES
2015 in Las Vegas Android Authority your
source for all things Android make sure
you stay tuned for the rest of our
coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
