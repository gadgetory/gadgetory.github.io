Authority what's going on everybody and
we're coming to you live from CES 2016
and we're kicking it with ZTE right now
taking a look at their brand new premium
affordable device looking to bring some
very premium features to a market that
is looking for a more affordable price
of course so what we have here is the
ZTE grand X 3 and this new grand X
device right here is bringing a lot of
wonderful features including this 5.5
inch screen up front that does come in
at 720p resolution but in our testing
just right now now we really don't see
too many problems with it 720p is still
a good resolution and at this larger
size people will still have a lot of fun
using this device for media and even
beyond underneath the surface however we
have a couple of really great features
we'll start off with the snapdragon 210
right now that comes with 2 gigabytes of
RAM and 16 gigabytes of on-board storage
that can be bolstered by a micro SD card
slot so expandable storage is still
going to be a feature that is available
here on an affordable Cricut based phone
one of our favorite features already in
the x3 however is the sizable battery we
have 3080 milliamp hours in a removable
battery in the backing as you can see
here the backing is removable and the
battery is replaceable so if you have a
spare you'll be able to get some power
like it lasts for days USB type-c is
another feature on here that is looking
to keep the Grand x3 in line with the
current flagship and high-end offerings
and it also provides quick charge as far
as the cameras go we have a 8 megapixel
rear-facing shooter with a 2 megapixel
front-facing camera but this little shot
that you're seeing right now is me
having some fun with the selfie mode
where it can actually detect when you're
smiling and take the photo right away
which was pretty fun to use the manual
mode in the rear-facing camera also
provides quite a few options here as we
take a look at it you have the ability
to change the ISO you also have a couple
of grids here and you can change the
white balance as well overall however
what we have here is in an affordable
device one that actually feels quite
great we have a very nice textured
plastic on the back right here and again
this backing is removable and at 6
ounces this is really easy to handle
especially in one
and despite having a 5.5 inch screen we
really have no problems getting from
left to right on here in particular
especially when you're trying to get to
the buttons down here in order to open
up the recent apps screen as you can see
here and also the back button if you're
using of course your right hand but
these buttons can also be customized to
switch those two as well as has been the
case for a couple of ZTE phones already
going into the settings we also have
lollipop at the helm right now as you
can see the easter-egg right there in
the lollipop splash screen and really
just the interface seems to be going
along quite smoothly and we have the
snapdragon 210 to thank for that it's
still providing a pretty good experience
with 720p resolution in this larger
screen that should be able to bring some
nice experiences but that all-in-all
would be the ZTE grand X 3 our first
look at it here at CES 2016 yet another
offering by ZTE that is looking to
provide a very easy to enter price point
for those of you who want to have pretty
much high-end features and a phone that
is still able to provide a pretty easy
time on the wallet so keep it tuned to
Android Authority for even more from CES
2016 and even more from ZTE as we bring
you all of our coverage from this year's
Consumer Electronics Show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
