according to Wikipedia the red panda
also called the lesser panda the red
bear cap and the red hat bear is a
mammal native to the eastern Himalayas
in southwestern China but honey but
pandas are there left according to the
dodo poaching and habitat loss have left
only 10,000 wild adult red pandas
remaining in the world this is a red
panda make for a great pet according to
Korra wild endangered animals have all
the drawbacks of unand ange earth while
pets plus are illegal if you want to
hear from a red panda research zoos that
have programs which allow you to adopt a
zoo animal a zoo with red pandas an M
adopted zoo animal program would be
happy to find you up so are you the kind
person that uses voice assistance
service a lot well if you are then
Google home is right up your alley for a
long time now Google has been refining
its voice assistance service and its
mobile devices but just like Amazon they
see a promising future in the home and
that's where Google home comes to mind
it's more than just another smart
speaker it's the first step but is it a
good one well one of the nice things
about Google home is that it has a very
discreet way of actually blending in
with its surroundings whereas the Amazon
echo opts for a cookie cutter speaker
design Google's approach is a stark
contrast with its more homely styling
it's not pervasive thanks in part to its
diminutive size and peculiar looking
shape the mesh like fabric hiding its
speaker array again emphasizes its
inviting demeanor and certainly
complements furniture a lot better
especially when you can swap out the
base for other colors the simplicity of
its design continues to be apparent by
how it has a clean look to it such in
the way you won't find a ton of buttons
on it in fact there's only a single one
the back to mute the microphones the top
service features touch controls for
volume adjustment and pause or play song
plus the embedded LEDs light up to
indicate respective functions
the only thing only to side is where to
place it just because it requires a
constant power source via its power cord
at first we felt as though it was
restrictive but Givens always
on premise it makes perfect sense going
with this implementation the set of
processes a breeze after they download
the Google home app and connect it to
your home Wi-Fi network it's pretty much
ready in waiting your commands as usual
you say ok Google to initiate it
unfortunately this can't be customized
at all something else so if you have
other Google assistant power devices
around they'll also be initiated but it
seems as though Google home takes
priority when it comes to voice
assistant functions Google home does
what you'd expect it integrates
seamlessly with Google services most of
them but not all that means you can play
songs via google play music you can
watch YouTube videos through chromecast
you can pretty much leverage all that
Google assistant has to offer
it delivers relevant actions and answers
so there's nothing having the ordinary
here with Google home but still doesn't
quite integrate into all of Google's
ecosystem well one of the downsides of
Google home is that it's still learning
a lot of stuff like for example if I
asked it to read the last text message
that was sent to me it can't do that yet
and it can't even also scour through my
emails to search the last time a person
actually sent me an email and read it
back to me so in that way it doesn't
quite have the same breadth of smart
features you would expect from a
traditional voice assistant service now
despite that it's far field microphones
do a pretty good excellent job of
recognizing our voices even when it's
playing a song we're just at the tip of
the iceberg so even though it's support
for services is limited it'll only be a
matter of time before it reaches the
same capacity as the Amazon echo for
music you have Google Play Music YouTube
Spotify and Pandora it can integrate
with connected devices in the home too
but that support extends to Google's
chromecast nest fill - and smart things
that's not a whole lot but we expect it
to grow rapidly faster would be better
of course
don't underestimate its diminutive size
for a moment it's quaint design is
deceiving just because it delivers quite
a punch with its audio quality there's
no hiding its preference for audio in
the low ranges where produces a thumping
level of bass in the process
me
at the highest volume however you get a
sense that it's training which makes for
an unpleasant listening experience so we
wouldn't recommend ingesting it any
higher than 3/4 of the way up there's a
promising future for Google home even
with its price tag of $130 that's a
hefty sum for a speaker by itself but
it's lower being the ambassador for your
home with its voice assistant service is
enough to recommend it just as long as
it continues to add support for value
services and hope connected products in
a timely manner in its current form
however some will certainly say that it
pales in comparison to what Alexa is
able to provide with the Amazon echo
while it's not entirely integrated with
Google's ecosystem yet you know that it
won't be long before it can do
additional functions so just reading
your last text message scouring your old
emails for reference and even behaving
more like a human with some of its
responses obviously if you're the kind
of person that religiously uses a voice
assistant services Google home is a
no-brainer compliment to how you live
and interact with your devices in the
home however if you're not then all be
nothing more than just another speaker
