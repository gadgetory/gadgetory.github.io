hold true the HTC One X 9 looks pretty
sick now a note should be added here
before we start that the specs stated
here today lend itself to the belief
that this is part of the m-series and
not a new x-series so take it with a
grain of salt here we go the flyer
simply displays the rumored smartphone a
beautiful background and a quote that
says packed with City smarts whatever
that means but it's the stapled specs
that have a scratching our heads and
being hopeful that these leaks are true
reports claim this phone is to have a 5
inch qhd that's 2560 x 1440 resolution a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor or a
MediaTek Helio x 20 processor 4
gigabytes of RAM a 23 megapixel rear
facing camera a 4-megapixel ultrapixel
front-facing shooter and 64 to 128
gigabytes of internal storage all
powered by a sizeable 3500 milliamp hour
battery the image also shows capacitive
hardware buttons and what looked like
boom sound front-facing speakers all
unusual HTC fashion does all this add up
for you it only seems to make sense if
HTC is trying to do one of two things
one just change the name around the HTC
em series devices or create some sort of
series devices that's above the hecm
line what do you guys think let me know
in the comments below thanks for
watching edward army on a sad and tragic
note i did want to extend my most
sincere and heartfelt condolences to all
of our french viewers especially those
of you in Paris I spent a lot of time
there it's a fantastic country and city
and I'm so sorry that so many innocent
people had to suffer please extend your
best wishes and prayers to our French
friends and i'll see you on the next
show
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
