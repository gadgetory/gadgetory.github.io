handy the Android authority app guy and
in this quick video we're going to take
a look at the best SNES emulators for
Android John SNES is a solid emulator
from a developer who has a history of
releasing solid emulators it has turbo
mode fast forward and slowdown modes
high game compatibility and good
performance it's also pretty cheap retro
arch is a popular all-in-one emulator
solution and SNES games happen to be one
of the things that it can do it's open
source and totally free with no
advertising the only negative part is
that it hasn't been updated in quite
some time as any X 9x e x plus is not
only a mouthful to say but it's also a
pretty decent emulator it boasts high
compatibility and you can use saved
games from your PC if you need to it's
also totally free to use and it's from a
developer who has historically done
emulators pretty well
SNES droid is another free option that
has most of the features that you would
want
it's another relatively older emulator
that hasn't been updated in a few years
but it's still a good option for older
devices super legacy 16 is likely the
most popular SNES emulator on this list
it has a long list of features including
cloud storage support fast forward and
slowdown modes third-party controller
support and a whole lot more
it just works well last up is kind of a
wild card called SNES oyd it was booted
out of the Google Play Store some years
ago but now it's available for free from
the developer it's a solid emulator
that's great for older devices and it
works rather well and that about does it
for this video folks the video likely
won't be updated but the article will be
so check back from time to time to see
if anything's changed if you have any
recommendations let me know about them
