flagship and Wow is on a sub-brand
is just one of the companies aiming to
offer premium specs at an affordable
price in the case of the honor 7 the
company has taken last year's flagship
ascend mate 7 and combined it with the
honor 6 plus to create a affordable yet
premium smartphone hey what's up guys
it's NER over here for Android Authority
bringing you a quick look at the Huawei
107 and how it compares to the honor 6
plus one of the biggest changes is the
build quality with the honor 7 taking on
an all-new metal design that reminds us
a lot of them ascend mate 7 rather than
plastic of the honor 6 plus the metal
build on the honor 7 has been crafted
from aluminium at 8.5 millimeters thick
the handset is one millimeter thicker
than the honor 6 plus for 8 grams
lighter and while the honor 6 plus is
comfortable in the hand the extra
thickness on the honor 7 feels a lot
more reassuring the back of the honor 7
also sees another change with why we're
dropping the duo camera of you on a 6
plus in favor of a more traditional
single camera arrangement the two
cameras on the honor 6 plus meant that
you could change the focus of the image
after capture but this feature is
dropped in the honor 7 the back of the
honor 7 has a matte finish that has been
blasted with ceramic particles and feels
smooth yet comfortable to hold in the
hand the plastic finish on the honor 6
plus was definitely less than premium
but the honor 7 fixes this and feels a
lot more premium to hold beneath the
camera is the fingerprint sensor which
is a standout feature on the honor 7 and
one of the best on any smartphone like
this n mate 7 from last year it can be
used to unlock your phone in half a
second but Huawei is also updated the
design and add additional features to it
first it doesn't come with a metallic
ring on the sensor which is a world
first for smartphones secondly the new
features include the ability to return
to the home screen by pressing and
holding the sensor accessing
notifications by swiping down on it and
accessing the recent apps menu by
swiping up on the sensor both handsets
house the power and volume keys on the
right but while the 6 pluses keys are
mostly recessed the honor sevens keys
are less recessed made from ceramic and
easier to locate and press without
looking beneath the keys the 6 plus has
the sim and microSD card trays while on
the honor 7 these have been combined
into one
which is located on the left the honor
seven also comes with a new smart key on
the left which lets you launch favorite
applications or toggle certain features
as an example I have it set up so a
single press launch is Twitter a double
press takes a screenshot and a long
press pulls up Google now the bottom of
the honor seven has also been redesigned
with while we opting to follow a similar
design to the Huawei p8 on the honor 6
plus the speaker is located on the back
of the handset but with the switch to
metal while way has moved the speaker to
the bottom of the honor 7 like the p8
the honor 7 speaker is a mono speaker
but it's actually surprisingly loud the
honor 7 is a successor to the honor 6
and not the 6 plus and as such the
handset sports a 5.2 inch full HD
display the display itself is smaller
than the honor 6 plus which has a 5.5
inch panel and offers the same
resolution resulting in a slightly
higher 445 pixels per inch density the
higher density coupled with the IPS
technology does mean the honor 7 display
appears to be better than the honor 6
plus and it's definitely more enjoyable
to use the honor 7 offers a slightly
lower screen to body ratio of 72.4%
but the design does mean that it's
easier to use the handset in one hand
both handsets come with optical
processes and while weighs own high
silicon Kirin chipset but key difference
is in the chipset being used the honor 6
plus sports at carrying 9 to 5 with 2
gigabytes of RAM while the honor 7 uses
a Kirin 9:35 paired with 3 gigabytes of
RAM other than the p8 max the honor 7 is
the first Huawei smartphone to use this
newer chipset both handsets feature
cortex processors in a big little
formation but the honor 6 plus uses the
older cortex a15 and a7 cores while the
honor 7 uses much newer cortex a53 cords
the honor 6 plus is certainly no slouch
in the performance Department but the
addition of an extra gigabyte of RAM
coupled with the much improved Kirin
9:35 CPU delivers much better
performance on the honor 7 like the
honor 6 plus the honor 7 comes with
expandable storage and your sim
capabilities the honor 6 plus comes with
the year 16 gigabytes or 32 gigabyte
storage while the honor 7 is available
with either 16 or 64 gigabyte it's worth
noting however that the 64 gigabyte
variant of the honor 7 has only been
released in China and at the moment it's
unclear whether it's going to be
available elsewhere like most your sim
devices the second slot can be used for
either microSD card or the SIM card on
both devices only one sim can be used
for LTE and while it's a shame that you
can't use both sims for data it's
certainly nice to be able to use two
sims at one under the hood the honor 7
has the 3100 milliamp hour non removable
battery which is actually 400 milli amp
hours smaller than on the honor 6 plus I
found the battery life on the honor 6
plus to be more than satisfactory
and although the honor 7 does drop the
battery capacity we'd still expect it to
last between one and two days what our
way itself claims at the handset will
last two point five seven days with
moderate usage and at least one point
two days even for the heavy user for the
times when it is running low the honor 7
also has you covered as it is the first
Huawei smartphone to come with quick
charging built in compatible with both
the British and the European standards
the quick charging on the honor 7 means
you can charge for five minutes to make
up to an hour's worth of phone calls and
charge the 50 percent battery in just 30
minutes
given the price it's unsurprising that
the quick charger doesn't come included
in the box but it shouldn't be too
expensive to acquire it as an
aftermarket accessory both handsets also
support reversible charging which allows
you to charge another phone using a USB
on-the-go cable while the battery on the
honor 6 plus is certainly large enough
it's unlikely that you'll use this
feature with the honor 7 thanks to its
smaller battery capacity the honor 7
also comes with dual antenna and signal
plus technology that promises to ensure
the metal build never interferes with
the signal strength using the dual
antenna design the handset can
intelligently switch between antenna in
a microsecond depending on which is
providing the best signal strength
alongside this the honor 7 also supports
Wi-Fi plus technology which improves
battery life by automatically disabling
Wi-Fi and then re enabling it when it
recognizes you are near an own Wi-Fi
network both the honor 6 plus and the
honor 7 come with other hardware specs
that you would probably expect from a
modern smartphone these include an
infrared port to control your electrical
appliances Bluetooth 4.0 to connect to
smart appliances and LTE cat 6 which
offers download speeds of up to 300
megabits per second and upload speeds of
up to 50 megabits per second on the go
now to the camera and one of the most
notable changes in the
a seven compared to the honor 6 plus is
the camera the honor 6 plus stood out as
it came with 2 8 megapixel cameras with
one used to capture the main image and
the other used to refocus the image
after capture in comparison in the honor
7 while we switched to a much better
Sony AMX 230 module which delivers 20
megapixels resolution and all
importantly phase detection autofocus
while we claim the phase detection can
focus on a subject in under 0.1 seconds
making it the fastest in the world on
any smartphone the honor 7 comes with a
range of software based camera features
that initially launched on the PA and
these include the good food time-lapse
and like painting modes Huawei has also
added a couple of new features including
a D mist filter to remove fog or smog
photos a star tracking mode to capture
the night sky and two additions to the
light painting mode in the form of silky
water and tail light tracking to the
front and both smartphones feature 8
megapixel selfie cameras that come with
huawei's beauty mode but the honor 7
trumps out thanks to the addition of two
new features first the presence of a
soft light lets you capture selfies in
varying lighting conditions and second a
new perfect selfie mode lets you replace
your facing group shots with a
pre-programmed selfie a key problem that
many users have with huawei smartphones
is in the company's emotion UI otherwise
known as emui which can sometimes feel
like an incomplete experience the honor
7 runs on Huawei's latest emu i version
3.1 on top of android 5.0 lollipop
just like the Huawei p8 while the honor
6 plus runs on the older Android 4.4.2
kitkat OS has identified in our p8
review there were several software
elements that just felt strange
including a notification menu that
duplicates notifications and a color
scheme that can make notifications
difficult to read sadly these elements
make their way to the honor 7 but while
Huawei hasn't improved some of these
elements they have added a few
interesting new features the knuckle
screenshot which was absolutely
atrocious on the wall a PA has been
improved so you can now double tap with
your knuckle to take a screenshot or
completely turn off the feature in the
settings Mui also comes with a new far
shot setting that lets you double press
the volume down button to launch a
camera and take an image
sadly emotion UI still doesn't come with
an app drawer which most users find
quite jarring and while we've asked
while way to introduce
feature via an option in the settings
it's unlikely we'll see it anytime soon
mui has certainly come a long way since
past huawei devices and while it's not
perfect I find it somewhat manageable in
my personal opinion the software
experience should not deter you from the
honor 7 which is otherwise an excellent
smartphone the honor 7 is launching in
the UK today for $249.99
which when you consider the specs is an
absolutely fabulous price in comparison
the honor 6 plus costs more at $299.99
and given the choice I know which one of
these two I would rather have what do
you think of the honour 7 and the
changes made by Huawei since the honor 6
plus came out let us know your thoughts
