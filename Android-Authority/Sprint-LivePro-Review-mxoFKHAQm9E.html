Android authority and this is the ZTE
live pro or the sprint live Pro and it's
an Android device an external battery a
Wi-Fi hotspot and a projector all
bundled into one but the biggest
question is is this something that you
would even want or need and is this
something that you would find yourself
using quite often well that's what we're
here to find out so let's go ahead and
take a closer look at the ZTE live pro
so let's start with the hardware of the
ZTE live pro because that's probably the
easiest place to start with a device
like this but in terms of its design
it's just a square essentially it's made
entirely of plastic and it's kind of
large and thick but I don't think that's
going to be too big of a deal since
you're probably not gonna be holding it
in your hand for long periods of time
it's certainly still small enough to fit
into a book bag and whatnot on the
bottom there's little rubber feet to
keep it from sliding around when sitting
on a table and there's also a tiny
kickstand for propping it up when using
the projector on the left side you've
got a couple of buttons a power button
and a button for turning the power bank
on and off there's also a dial for
adjusting the focus of the projector and
you'll also find your SIM card and
microSD card slot hidden underneath a
plastic flap on the backside is where
all your peripherals are located so
you've got your 12 volt power input for
charging the live pro a USB port HDMI
and a 3.5 millimeter headset jack which
you can use to hook up external speakers
which I would recommend because the
built-in speaker doesn't really sound
all that good and it's not very loud
either directly on top you've got your
typical Android keys back home and menu
but you'll also find a few extra there's
a dedicated button to sleep and wake the
display a button to turn on the
projector and volume up and down keys on
top you're also going to find a 4-inch
display and it's got very low resolution
coming in at 800 by 480 and it's got
really bad viewing angles so when using
a live pro as a normal Android device
you're not going to get the most
enjoyable experience but if you
absolutely must you certainly can use it
like an Android phone or tablet as it is
running a full blown version of Android
it's running on Android 4.2.2 jelly
beans so a pretty old version of Android
but it's a mostly stock build of Android
and on a device like this I don't think
you'll really need the latest version of
Android anyways since it is a full-blown
version of Android you can download apps
watch videos and play games on it like
you normally would on an Android phone
or tablet the specs are just about as
outdated as the operating system itself
it's got a dual-core Snapdragon s4 and
one gig of ram inside and it's good
enough to do basic tasks on it but it's
pretty obvious you shouldn't used a live
Pro for any intense or graphically
demanding tasks as it wasn't really
designed for that purpose okay so we
know the ZTE Live pro can be used like
any other Android device but you can
also use it as an external battery to
charge your phone a Wi-Fi hotspot and
you should get pretty decent speeds on
Sprint's park network provider in a good
coverage area but if you're buying a ZT
Live Pro you're most likely buying it
for its most unique feature the
projector now please don't buy this if
you're hoping to use this as some sort
of home theater replacement it's only
got a hundred lumen DLP bulb so it's not
super bright and pretty difficult to see
with the lights on but in a dimly lit
room it works pretty well there's a few
different ways you can use the live pro
to project media but they all have their
pros and cons the first way is obviously
directly from the projector itself and
this is probably the easiest since you
don't have to connect another device the
projector just basically shows whatever
it is that you're currently looking at
on the screen now this might be the most
simple and easy way to use the projector
but if you're planning on consuming
media like watching movies and YouTube
videos you're not going to be able to
watch anything in HD simply because
you're restricted to the resolution of
the screen which again is only WVGA so
if you want to watch a YouTube video
you'll be stuck streaming at
360p resolution method number two is to
wirelessly connect your phone or tablet
to the live pro this takes a minute or
two to do but once connected you can
pretty much display anything whether
it's your home screen a webpage photos
or videos and you're not restricted to
the resolution of the Live Pro either
the problem with this method is there's
a little bit of delay from when you
interact with your phone or tablet to
when it actually shows on the projector
and not only is there a visual delay but
the audio is also delayed as well so
everything is going to appear out of
sync if you're trying to watch a YouTube
video or play a movie the third way and
this is probably the best way in my
opinion is to connect your device via
HDMI so you can connect your laptop to
it if you want and the live Pro does
come with an HDMI cable included so you
don't have to go out and buy one but the
reason why I think this is the best
option is because you can stream videos
and movies and HD display photos or
presentations and you don't have any
issues with latency because it's
directly plugged into the live pro now
no matter which way you decide to play
your media the most annoying thing about
the live pro is how loud the fan gets
when the projector is on and it's not so
bad when you're not doing anything that
requires any sort of audio but when
you're trying to watch a video or a
movie the sound of the fan does
interfere with the audio when it comes
to the battery life it's got a five
thousand milliamp hour battery inside
and has a power pack that's enough to
get a few charges from it but as a
projector that's just really not enough
the most you'll be able to get out of
this is about two hours which is just
barely enough to get through a full
length movie so if you plan on using
this to watch a lot of movies with be
prepared to have it plugged into an
outlet so that it doesn't die on you in
the middle of a movie the ZTE live pro
is available now on Sprint for $300 on a
contract or $450 outright and the price
is a little bit steep in my opinion but
I guess if you plan on using it a lot it
just might be worth it but that is it
for this review of the ZTE live pro it's
an Android device a Wi-Fi hotspot
an external battery and a projector all
rolled into one making it sort of a
jack-of-all-trades Android device
