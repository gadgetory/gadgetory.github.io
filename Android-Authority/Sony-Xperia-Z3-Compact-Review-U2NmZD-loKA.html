form of a smaller Sony Xperia z1 one
that didn't compromise on performance
just to make a small phone half a year
later we got a z2 but we didn't get an
upgrade to what was one of the best
small phones available now at Eva just a
couple months ago we finally saw the
update to the compact line and we were
just as excited for it as we were for
the brand-new z3 now it's Josh Vergara
from Android Authority and this is the
Sony Xperia z3 compact for the most part
the compact moniker tells you exactly
what you will get with this version of
the new Sony flagship with a much
smaller 4.6 inches screen compared to
the majority of today's flagship
smartphones the entire body of the
compact keeps everything within reach
harkening back to the z3 proper the new
small speaker grilles adorn the front
and come in a dual setup around the size
or all of the same buttons even the
dedicated camera button found near the
bottom and the corners have been smooth
out much like in the z3 but the compact
does not retain the same metallic frame
and instead has a hard plastic feel to
it the covers look a little different to
remaining flush with the overall width
of the side and finally the glass back
completes the glass on glass
construction of this smaller Xperia z3
handling is the highlight here as just
about everything is within reach when
using one hand while it would have been
nice to have the same higher quality
construction of the original z3 the
styling is still close enough that its
aesthetic is just as pleasing it's funny
that just a year ago this size would
have been considered normal and then
five inches was considered too big now
4.6 inches is considered mini and
compact but since it is still a great
handling experience we're definitely not
complaining or the compact a name does
mean some real changes is in the display
experience but with a 4.6 inch display
it's hard to find a lot to dislike about
the 720p resolution display 319 pixels
per inch work just fine for a smaller
size so all text looks nice and sharp
still though I questioned how much long
reading I would do on a screen of this
size the same thought came up when
viewing media or playing games if you're
already spoiled by the very large
screens we're seeing these days then
this probably won't be your cup of tea
however the high quality IPS
construction still provides the
contraire
in color production that the triluminos
display gets with x-reality engine
enhancements and with the trade-off of
easier handling we'd say that 720p makes
more than enough sense for the compact
and if you're really looking for a
higher experience in the display then
the compact is probably not on your
radar anyway but that's why we really
like sony's take on the smaller device
because even if you do decide on the
smaller screen you'll still be getting
the same big performance expected of its
bigger brother the Snapdragon 801 makes
a return here and isn't at the bleeding
edge but provides great speed and
reliability backed by the audrina 330
and two gigabytes of RAM you could make
arguments that the Xperia UI is
minimalistic and has a big hand in the
snappiness or that the 720p resolution
lightens the overall load but the real
takeaway here is that the Snapdragon 801
continues to provide flagship
performance even when playing some
intensive games I found little to no lag
and when easily multitasking between
apps using the recent apps screen I had
no doubt that Sony's choice to stick
with a tried and true performance
package was the right one Sony's
hardware offerings remain largely the
same with all of this phone capable of
taking some real punishment due to an IP
certification for water and dust
resistance after all these flaps protect
the precious innards from the elements
many of the same tropes you'd find any
Sony Xperia phone return here NFC
clearly marked on the back bluetooth and
the dual speaker setup while the Sun
experience of the Xperia z3 was pretty
great it should be understood that
you'll get a fraction of it here it's
simply a smaller and thus quieter setup
but it still provides a nice stereo
sound
calls all came in loud and clear though
I will admit that I use the front-facing
speakers for calls more often than not
and in battery life a 2600 milliamp hour
battery is more than enough for a
smaller phone like this and it certainly
does the job I got an average of two
days with moderately heavy usage made
even better when turning on some of the
power saving features once I hit around
25% moderate users will probably get a
hell of a long time from this phone
making it one of the best companions for
anyone looking for a phone that goes as
far as they do the camera is another
point of no compromise as the same 20
point seven megapixel shooter returns
here bringing along a two point two
megapixel front shooter as such the
experience of photography will be much
like its bigger brother only even easier
considering this phone's pocket ability
the dedicated camera button might be a
little small for some though indeed
popping this phone out of my pocket
holding down the camera button and then
having a blast was the highlight of the
compacts camera fun but in the app there
are still plenty of modes to play with
including background defocus 4k video
recording and AR modes that impose
characters on your real-life scene
manual mode is where you'll be able to
take full advantage of the megapixel
count but it will be a raw shot without
the software enhancements but that being
said the higher data capture of the 20
point seven megapixel pictures is offset
by the low noise performance of the
superior auto eight megapixel pictures
though the difference is not as glaring
as it was in the original z3 colors are
rendered quite well though you might get
the occasional overexposure a high ISO
range helps keep some usable shots in
low light and actually works more often
than not which can't easily be said for
other phones all in all it's another
good camera from Sony who sticks to its
guns in both high-powered optics and
feature full applications and finally
the Xperia UI returns once again and
there actually isn't a whole lot to say
about it which tends to be a good thing
for Sony simple stock like elements are
on the surface like the home screens
notification shade and all that any
Android user may already be used to but
the small additions like the small lapse
in the recent app string give quick
multitasking tools while Sony's own take
on the gallery app and even the built-in
Walkman music application bring that
distinct Sony style a big addition to
the whole z3 line is the ability to
stream ps4 content straight to your
device on the same network as excited as
I am to do
I haven't bought my own ps4 yet and
actually to be honest playing video
games on the screen this small might not
be the business for many ps4 titles and
then there's the life log Sony's huge
data capture apparatus that quite
literally logs your entire life on the
z3 compact everything from internet
usage to steps take it to even my jog
earlier today we are recorded by it
shown by an avatar that will reenact
what you've done if you choose to look
back at it it's almost creepy how much
it logs without you really knowing about
it because it's always on but if you're
the type that does love to journal your
life you might find something actually
pretty useful in the life log while
releases on major carriers is still
unclear for North American users the z3
compact can be found for the unlocked
price of around five hundred and twenty
nine dollars main competitors used to be
pretty bare in this space but now the
compact has the likes of the Samsung
Galaxy alpha to contend with what once
was part of the market dominated by Sony
is now getting a few new members but the
z3 compact remains a pretty sure thing
in the small phone space and so there
you have it the Sony Xperia z3 compact
you've heard me say it many times before
that with our market of big phones using
a small offering is usually refreshing
and that hasn't changed with the Xperia
z3 compact on some level this is
probably the more anticipated release in
this cycle of Sony's bi-yearly schedule
the Sony Xperia z3 the original was a
wonderful phone certainly the best main
Sony flagship but the compact takes
pretty much everything the z3 offers and
puts it into a package that is
accessible by just about everyone and
that is why it gets our editors choice
award for continuing to set the bar in
the smaller phone market distinguishing
itself through a distinct lack of
compromise and that quintessential Sony
style as always thank you guys very much
for watching and I hope you enjoyed this
review of the Sony Xperia z3 compact it
gets our editors choice award because it
still pretty much stands alone in the
small market space where there are now a
few competitors but it still brings the
big performance and the big camera
performance despite its smaller stature
