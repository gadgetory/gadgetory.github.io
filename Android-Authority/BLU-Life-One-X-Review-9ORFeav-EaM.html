phones got really cheap it seems that
the entire year was leading up to this
the most bang for your buck smartphone
there may be a new king when it comes to
budget smartphones with the release of
Blue's latest the Blu life 1x second
generation hey everybody it's Krystal
Laura and this is our review of the Blu
life 1x when it comes to budget
smartphones you don't really expect much
but when first taking the blue life one
X out of its box you'll be greeted with
a pleasant surprise the life 1 X's frame
is made from a high quality aluminum
that spinach has been sandblasted to
create a nice matte texture this makes
with this leathery looking plastic
backing that's been coated in a smooth
paint layer really helps make this phone
feel great in the hand the backing has a
soft feel to it making it very grippy
especially with little bumps
indentations and grooves found
throughout it it's also not too big not
too thick and not too heavy at all
creating a very comfortable one-handed
experience now the phone is a little
taller than last year's model due to a
slightly larger 5.2 inch screen but the
2015 Blu life 1x still manages to look
very sleek and have a much more premium
feel and look than you would come to
expect with such a low price phone
you'll find the headphone jack up at the
top with the power and value buttons
here on the right side they don't have
any texture patterns to help distinguish
between them we're not looking but
they're spaced far enough apart while
you'll probably never have any issues
the display you'll find here on the blue
life 1x is a really beautiful 5.2 inch
full HD IPS panel that extra bit of
screen real estate makes for a slightly
better media consuming experience a
pixel density of 424 PPI makes for very
sharp text and colors look very nice
here this is thanks to Mir vision which
is a set of engine so you can toggle on
and off within settings it helps enhance
the picture quality by mostly boosting
colors by default is set to the standard
mode but I really do enjoy that you're
punching colors so switching to the
vivid mode makes for less accurate but
more appealing images there's also user
mode you can toggle will you'll gain
access to basic color tuning like
contrast saturation and picture
brightness and advanced tuning like
sharpness color temperature and dynamic
contrast really the standard and vivid
color modes will be enough for some but
for a full HD IPS LCD screen we were
very impressed and loved
watching videos on it the display is
protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 so
it should hold up pretty well over time
without any drops or Falls so this
year's Blu life 1x is available to
purchase unlocked and supports dual SIM
cards we use ours while connecting to
AT&amp;amp;T and didn't have any problems at all
while being connected to 4G the majority
of the time your New Jersey of course
you get to these two SIM cards you'll
have to remove that leathery looking
back and no you won't find a removable
battery here but instead you'll find a
micro SD card slot which supports up to
a 64 gig card which is a huge feature
for some people as most budget phones do
not have much internal storage the blue
life 1x is no exception as 16 gigs of
internal storage is the only available
model under the hood we have an
octa-core MediaTek mt6752 processor
along with a mallet e720 GPU these
processors and graphic cards are
obviously more so designed for cheaper
mid-range phones so you shouldn't expect
the One X to dominate when it comes to
benchmark ratings but you'll find that
this dual of hardware really makes for a
great experience with some help from his
two gigs around and that's a pretty
decent amount of memory for such a cheap
device now even with this year's One X
being a little thinner than last year's
model just by point two millimeters blue
managed to cram a battery with 900
milliamp hours of extra capacity 2900
milliamp hours is what you find here
which is quite impressive I threw this
run through some benchmarks just to give
us all an idea of how it ranks up
against other phones and Geekbench gave
the single core score of 628 with the
multi-core score of this octa-core
processor being 2854 that's not too
shabby really for a phone at this price
and just to compare that to one of the
most popular budget phones out there
right now the Moto G the blue life for
Nexus keep and trading nearly doubles it
and Tutu's benchmark tests gave it a
score of thirty seven thousand eight
hundred and twenty two and GFX OpenGL
benchmark gave some pretty decent scores
for GPU now the most important thing is
all this makes for a very responsive and
reliable experience when it comes to
performance apps launch very fast and
without two gigs of RAM multitasking and
flying in and out of the recent apps
screen is a great experience much better
than most budget phones out there when
comparing to a flagship smartphone of
course you'll notice a bit of an extra
pause when clicking the recent apps
screen and sometimes the phone may take
a second to become responsive when
scrolling to webpages but these aren't
as common as you would expect with these
facts and really they won't break your
workflow when doing basic things the
phone even holds up well during gaming
the most graphic intensive games like
asphalt 8 you really get a
nice and smooth gameplay experience some
frames will drop sometimes but not as
much as I first suspected and it doesn't
make games harder to play that 2900
milliamp hour battery is a huge
improvement over last generations and
should definitely get you through the
day if you pick up a bunch of smartphone
usually won't be doing heavy power user
type things with your phone or be a huge
gamer or picture taker but I use the
phone just as I would use a normal
flagship phone gaming here and there
taking lots of pictures sending lots of
text sending emails to push and without
disabling account syncing the phone will
continuously last me the full day with
four and a half to five hours of screen
on time there's no quick or fast
charging here unfortunately but it
shouldn't be much of a problem because
like I said I never found the need to
charge my phone
other than overnight the Blu life 1x is
running Android lollipop 5.1 right out
of the box and this is probably blues
best software experience yet in the past
you never knew what you were going to
get when it came to blue software with
every new blue smartphone release the
software experience look and feel seem
totally different from the last
sometimes having no app jars or being
full of blues versions of standard apps
but it seems blue has finally decided on
something great the software the One X
is very much like stalking Android with
a few extra features there hasn't been
much rescanning at all the pull down
menu is the same although with some
extra tiles the recent apps screen is
exact same but with a clear all button
on the bottom and when diving into
settings you won't notice any
differences besides these extra menu
stores the bottom smart awake allows you
to draw different characters on the
screen while the phone is off launching
different apps like drawing and M
launches you prefer music player C
launches your camera and launches a
flashlight
also double tap to wake is present here
which is an awesome feature and is
extremely underrated of course double
tapping to turn off the display is
present too but this mode can be found
under smart gesture here you can also
enable pocket mode which uses a
proximity sensor to save battery and
some other gestures like flipping the
phone over to silence a call or an alarm
even the home launcher which they call
carefree launcher is quite nice it's
very simple and very functional you may
not be a fan of the messaging app or
keyboard but that's the beauty of the
Google Play Store also Blue has
previously stated that they are making
timely software updates a priority so
hopefully that means that we won't have
to wait too long until we see Android
marshmallow 6.0 on the blue life 1x
usually cameras and budget smartphones
are nothing special
there just in case you really need to
snap a picture of something important or
take a picture of something for your mom
of references and that's pretty much it
but recently this is changing especially
when it comes to the 1x here we have a
13 megapixel main rear facing camera
with phase data autofocus and flash and
of course our front-facing selfie cam at
5 megapixels and interesting enough this
camera also comes to a flash you're not
going to find any optical image
stabilization here but with a pretty
fast shutter speed in bright areas you
shouldn't have too much problems with
blurry images the 1xs cameras has pretty
much the same pro's and con's that you'd
find in most mid-range smartphones with
enough light you're consistently going
to take really nice photos the images
that you'll take will often be quite
soft which isn't such a bad thing colors
are more subdued compared to most
cameras but they still look very nice
and in the end you're going to be able
to take pictures that you won't feel
embarrassed about sharing with people or
even posting to social media that's not
something you can say with a lot of
bunch of smartphones but like I said
cheap phones are getting really good
these days in every department and the
blue life one axis camera is no
exception the camera interface is very
simple while still having your go to
features ready to be clicked around the
preview area except one feature I would
have liked to have on my fingertips is
to talk within a menu and this HDR so
you can click this box here to get a ton
of nice features like Beauty modes sport
modes dual view modes night modes and
even a pro mode unless you have just ISO
white balance and more so yeah there's
no auto HDR so you'll have to dive into
this menu every time you want to enable
it but it works pretty well it'll most
likely bring out the shadows rather than
lower the exposures of the skies maybe a
little too much but it does add a lot of
sharpening we'd say stick with HDR being
off usually you get a better photo
without it it's hidden under a menu and
it does take a while for it to take that
picture however in low-light it helps a
little all it does is bring up the
picture just a tad but it definitely
looks better every time just make sure
you keep a steady hand because it does
take a while there's a night mode too
although it takes even longer and you'll
have to keep an even more steady hands
video looks good
allowing up to full 1080p video but make
sure you dive into settings to change it
to 1080p from the default 720p like the
pictures it takes the colors will be
more toned down compared to most cameras
and it'll be a little cooler rather than
it's warmer competition but it really
makes for a nice video although a little
shaky selfies look quite good with a
good amount of detail too and yes we
have the front-facing flash which could
be helpful in really dark scenarios but
most of the time you'll probably want to
turn this off because it can
be a bit harsh sometimes overall
compared to phones in the blue light for
Nexus price range the camera here is a
lot better than I was expecting and it
definitely creates photos and videos
worth sharing when it comes to budget
smart phones most users will prioritize
a lower price over the great hardware or
software the phone has but in this case
you're getting one of the cheapest
phones out there with a great software
experience and great internals the Blu
life 1x 2015 will only set you back one
hundred and forty nine dollars and
that's really an amazing price for this
phone that has great internal hardware
that actually performs a great imploded
and on skin softer experience sleek
design and a good camera to swing the
deal even further blue include some
really nice in your earbuds out of the
box along with the screen protector and
a nice case it actually is more of a
clip-on backing so once you remove the
leathery plastic backing you can replace
it with this the front will cover up the
display putting it into a dark mode
showing the time along with music player
controls with price being the most
important when it comes to budget
smartphones this second generation blue
life 1x is very appealing and with a
great hardware that it comes along with
this really is one of the best ones you
can get right now for under 150 dollars
