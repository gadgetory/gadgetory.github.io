brought to you by the LG g3 hey what is
going on guys lon here from Android
Authority and today we're doing a
hands-on of an official accessory it's
the quick circle case for your LG g3 all
right so here it is this is the quick
circle case for your LG g3
and this particular style of case has
become pretty popular lately so LG has
sort of come up with their own and as
you can see it comes with the back piece
here which obviously attaches to the
back of the phone and then there's the
front piece which goes over the screen
and it not only protects your screen but
there's a lot of other extra
functionality built into it as well so
we'll take a look at that in a sec but
let's go ahead and just install it so
you can see how it goes onto the phone
so it is a replacement back so you do
have to take off the original back on
your g3 so I'll go ahead and do that
right now go ahead and take this right
off so when it's on your phone it
basically becomes part of your phone
which is kind of nice so just slide in
your g3 like normal go ahead and put it
in and it snaps in real easily so there
you go and now it is installed and you
can see that right there and there is
the clock and that's pretty much how it
looks like installed onto your g3 it
pretty much just becomes a part of your
phone like I said and all the buttons
and ports the laser autofocus
everything is perfectly exposed the
speaker as well obviously nothing
obstructed there's nothing on the sides
of the g3 so it's not going to obstruct
anything the top is perfectly exposed
along with the bottom where the 3.5
millimeter headset jack and the micro
USB port is everything lines up well and
everything is perfectly exposed so that
is how it looks and how it fits on the
g3 so let's talk about the functionality
of the case here so first things first
it does have sleep to wake so if I open
up it does wake up the g3 and if I close
it up it puts it right back to sleep so
let me go ahead and show you that one
more time so if I open it up and then
close it you'll see it shows that shows
the clock face for a couple of seconds
and then goes right to sleep
secondly knock on does still work so if
I double tap you'll see that it wakes up
and shows you the time so this is really
convenient for when the only thing you
want to do is just check the time on
your phone you don't have to open up the
cover to do that you can just double tap
and it'll immediately show you the time
now you can actually customize these
clock faces here so this one that I'm
using you don't have to use this
particular one you can actually change
it to a variety of different ones so
just double tap to wake it up swipe
across and then tap on the Settings icon
here and as you can see there's quite a
few to pick from so you should be able
to find something that you like here so
let's say I want to go with this weather
one here I'll just select that and hit
back and then swipe across again and you
can see that I have the new clock that I
just selected there so that's really
nice also there's some some shortcuts
that you can easily access directly from
the case itself so you can see if I want
to open up my camera I can easily do
that and if I want to take a photo all I
have to do is just tap on the screen and
it automatically takes a photo so very
quick and easy and convenient no need to
open up the case unlock your phone and
then open up the camera you can just
access the camera directly from the case
itself let's go ahead and go back here
you can see there's LG's music player
here so you can pause play and skip
tracks which is really great and there's
also LG's health app here so you can see
it's tracking my steps and my calories
and if I open up the case it takes me
directly directly to the app itself to
give you a lot more functionality and
control but let's go ahead and close it
up here and check out some additional
settings so if I go to these
again here and if I swipe all the way to
the very end of the watch basis you'll
see that it says four additional
settings open this cover so if I open it
up it'll take me to the settings for the
case itself and as you can see there's a
feature to turn off the auto unlock
screen if you want to turn that off and
you can also select the apps that you
want to see three quick circle windows
so let's say I want to add the call log
here I can do that and hit save and I'll
go ahead and close it up here and swipe
across and as you can see my call log is
now added so if I wanted access to that
I can easily just gain access right to
my call log from the case itself but
there you have it for the quick circle
case for your LG g3 hopefully you guys
