what's going on everybody let's take a
quick look back at the xperia z it holds
on its shoulders the hope that sony
becomes not only more relevant in the
smartphone market but one of the top
manufacturers in the game in my review
of this pretty spectacular phone i said
that sony got a lot of things right so
what we are doing here is comparing the
xperia z2 a couple of other phones that
helped propel their respective companies
higher than they already were the
best-selling samsung galaxy s3 and the
iphone 5 by apple how does the xperia z
as the newest device stack up against a
couple phones that were honestly built
to stand the test of time let's find out
in this vs. Triple Threat we start off
by looking at design there is no other
way around it the Xperia Z is the
biggest phone in this bunch the black
slate look is further enhanced by the
completely flat design found all around
and the rectangular shape that you
honestly don't see enough of anymore the
big power button and volume rockers are
found together on the right side of the
phone right where your thumb would land
all ports are covered by a tethered
piece of material to help with the
phone's water resistance and it also
keeps it quite literally flat all around
the glass all around helps make this one
of our favorite looking phones but it is
an incredible fingerprint magnet
Samsung's Galaxy s3 has arguably the
most endearing design to date as many
phones have been modeled after the phone
Giants more rounded look the 4.8 inch
screen lends itself to a smaller form
factor that is easier to grip the button
layouts are signature Samsung with the
power button on the right side opposite
the volume rockers the home button below
the screen is flanked by menu and back
buttons the back cover is removable but
it and the rest of the body are made up
of that trademark plastic that Samsung
has pretty much put in all of their
phone since and with the iphone 5 we
have the smallest phone of this
comparison Apple took a stand against
large screens and kept the one on the
five the same width as the for just a
little bit taller the smaller size does
make this the easiest phone to grip and
hold without needing to adjust too often
the buttons are signature Apple with the
power button at the top with the volume
buttons and the Cylons toggle on the
left the trademark home button is on the
face below the screen
the aluminum unibody is definitely a
tried and true designed for Apple that
has been deserving of praise at the
bottom is the controversial charging
port however that did cause a few
headaches for those with original iphone
accessories ultimately I have to give
the design point to the Xperia Z
primarily because it brings us a design
that we haven't seen in a while if at
all everything these days is so rounded
in the smartphone market and honestly I
prefer this more rigid rectangular
design on top of all of that Samsung has
taken the plastic feel and look of the
samsung galaxy s3 and has put it in
pretty much all of their phones since
it's a design that honestly we're
getting a little bit tired of and as
with the iPhone 5 it's basically the
iphone for just a little bit bigger I
give props to the Xperia z4 giving us
something new that all being said
however when it comes to the point for
feel I have to give the second point in
this comparison to the samsung galaxy s3
yes the Xperia Z is a wonderful looker
and its larger screen size gives us a
lot to be happy about but it isn't
something we're completely used to yet
2013 is the year of the 1080p screen but
any newcomers to that particular market
will find a learning curve before we
think I'm just picking on the iPhone
however I do have to say that having a
4.7 inch phone for a while now has made
me used to it now when I pick up an
iPhone it just seems way too small and
it's feels really foreign and weird thus
the comfort and feel point does have to
end up going to the tried and true
design of the galaxy s3 the battle for
the display might seem like an uphill
battle and that is kind of true the
screen on the Xperia Z is after all what
we're going to be seeing more of in the
coming months 5 inches and 1080p
resolution the 441 ppi pixel density
also helps propel the screen to great
heights in sharpness a nice touch
further is the high refresh rate which
makes this phone seem like a tiny bravia
television the only real gripe here is
the color production which is
unfortunately pretty poor for a top-tier
device colors look a little washed out
and our further hurt by the viewing
angles it might not be a deal-breaker
for many but it is definitely worth the
mention the Super AMOLED display of the
galaxy s3 on the other hand makes its
already colorful TouchWiz UI pop out of
the screen and basically punch you in
the face the smaller screen makes for a
720 resolution in
dead and a pretty low 306 PPI pixel
density thus things aren't necessarily
as sharp as the Xperia Z but there's
still quite viewable though the specs
are a little bit low the practice on
this display is still ultimately pretty
great and most users these days will
still be very happy with the display
found on the galaxy s3 the iphone
continues its smaller stature rolled by
having the 4-inch display capable of 11
36 x 640 resolution and in this case the
medium level 2 326 ppi pixel density it
is a very good display ferd size and it
does hold its own with good colour
production and decent sharpness this is
actually Apple's greatest display on any
of their phones and it does deserve that
praise now I have been getting to know
the 5-inch display phones quite well and
to be honest I get it now 1080p displays
do a great job of making media even
better than on smaller screens or lower
resolution displays or god forbid both
the Xperia Z screen is an example of our
future as smartphone users even if the
screen does have some lackluster color
vibrancy I have to admit it is still the
most enjoyable time of this bunch for me
so it gets the point in display in terms
of performance the experience he has the
advantage of being the newest phone it
sports the incredible quad-core 1.5
gigahertz Snapdragon s4 pro processor
backed by an Adreno 320 GPU a set that
powers current top devices it gets over
20,000 in antutu benchmark which is very
impressive indeed the galaxy s3 on the
other hand has the Exynos cortex a9
processor that clocks at one point 4
gigahertz with a mali-400mp graphics
processor this was the most advanced
phone about half a year ago but even if
it has been blown away by current
offerings it still does hold its ground
as a more than capable performer and
finally we have the iphone 5 with an
in-house developed dual-core 1.2
gigahertz a6 processor backed by a power
vr sgx graphics processor it is a
package that has been able to power some
of the best that the Apple App Store has
had to offer and that is a feat in and
of itself some good optimization and
control by Apple's part makes this phone
still seem as sprightly as the day it
was first released though practice means
more than scores
you just can't deny how much the Xperia
Z excels all the great scores that has
been putting out definitely translate
into usage so it gets the point for
great performance in this round when we
look at hardware we look primarily at
extras now two features that many
top-tier devices have been lacking as of
late are removable batteries and
expandable memory while the unibody
design of the Xperia Z does keep the
battery fixed one of the many covered
ports is indeed the SD card slot NFC and
the rest of the connectivity bevy are
still available here as well the samsung
galaxy s3 has a removable back cover
however which allows full access to both
the battery and the SD card slot just
part of all the things that it did get
right at release NFC in this case takes
the form of S beam in the s3 and it was
a very well marketed feature and finally
the iPhones signature aluminium body
design keeps all of these bits from
being available there's no replaceable
battery no expandable memory and also no
NFC so for all that it does the samsung
galaxy s3 gets the point for having
everything our users crave from their
top tier devices some true differences
are found in the software the Sony
Xperia Z sports jellybean 4.1 and thus
includes with its customized UI Google
now the inclusion of small apps makes
multitasking even easier aside from all
this however sony has put in a few of
their own touches generally however the
Xperia U I hear actually looks a lot
like ice cream sandwich the black and
grey tones are accented by blue by
default and the whole interface looks
very simplistic while remaining
functional I find that you either love
TouchWiz or hate it it is one of the
most colorful user interfaces for
Android and sticks with rounded almost
bubbly design choices rather than the
more rigid field of other operating
systems jellybean 4.1 is what you have
here if you updated recently so the
great google now is also available
however the feature that i want to
mention here is multi view which allows
you to essentially cut the display in
half for two different apps to run at
the same time it does take multitasking
to a whole new level and finally we have
iOS which is only found on the iPhone as
one of the first truly advanced
interfaces for mobile phones it was
quite the innovation however despite
changes here and there through the years
the operating system essentially looks
and works the same there is no app
drawer and all apps are put on the home
screen
to be organized by folders only in the
last couple iterations did apple finally
include the notification drop-down that
lacks the power widgets found in the
other two in this comparison that all
being said however the controlled app
ecosystem doesn't sure that the general
feel of iOS is pretty seamless it has
smooth transitions and generally
continues to perform about as well as it
did out-of-the-box optimization in a
system without fragmentation is one good
advantage here but I've never quite been
a fan of the app centric design of iOS
the lack of widgets an easy
customization make iOS unappealing to me
and to most Android users if I have to
pick one here it would have to be the
Xperia Z because of its simplistic
design that does just enough to look
good while remaining functional and as
far as multi-view goes imagine how good
that will look on a 5-inch 1080p display
and finally we have the camera the
Xperia Z has the most megapixels in this
bunch with 13 it is definitely the
biggest gun and all those mega pixels
are for the most part use quite well
pictures have a nice color reproduction
and the details and photos are very good
obviously lighting takes a big role here
as it should for any photography the
samsung galaxy s3 with 8 megapixels
however has largely the same kind of
deal colors in this and the Xperia Z
tend to take on a cooler tone and the
detail quality is still quite nice but
then you got the iphone 5s camera which
takes on the obvious warm tones that you
notice quite immediately while detail is
great across the board with these three
cameras this warmer tone that the iPhone
gives just looks more pleasing and this
yields a more usable picture I don't
like how the iPhone 5 has very few
options for tweaking the camera as 16 by
9 ratio is more my style than the 4 by 3
that it will always do in the built-in
camera app nonetheless I am happy with
the pictures from the Xperia Z and the
galaxy s3 but with the iphone's camera
once used to film an entire independent
film my mind you it is definitely
deserving of all of that praise and so
there you have it I have one point that
I want to drive home here while the
Xperia Z did walk away with the most
points I look at these three phones and
realize that the mere act of just
picking one of these phones is really
awesome here we have three phones with
great specifications across the board
for people to choose from iphone what
the smaller screen is still one of the
most capable smartphones
existence the best-selling galaxy s3 is
the wonderfully built phone that
continues to be marketed and sold for
good reason and the Xperia Z is the
phone that might make sony one of the
biggest names in the smartphone market
again it is also the example here of the
smartphones of our future so it deserves
its praised for being the most powerful
and enjoyable of the bunch at least for
me in this comparison so stay tuned to
android authority because we have a lot
coming in the following weeks as we are
