hindi the android authority app guy and
it's about that time of the month to
round up the best new android apps that
were released in September of 2017 and
it was actually a pretty decent month
being my eyes is a volunteer app it
helps blind people with problems that
are easily solved by people with normal
vision here's how it works both blind
and sighted people sign up for the
service whenever a blind person needs
help with something they call the
service and a sighted person answers to
assist it currently boasts around 50,000
blind people and 500,000 volunteers
however the blind are encouraged to use
the service as often as needed so no
amount of volunteers is too many the app
and the service are both entirely free
direct chat is a chat companion app it
doesn't send or receive messages on its
own however it does allow the chat heads
feature on almost any messaging service
there are a variety of customization
options and they help prevent issues
like overcrowding what a bunch of chat
apps are present it does seem to work
fairly well although there are a few
bugs here and there
the free version does have advertising
while the paid version is ad free along
with some additional features Google
assistant is a weird new app it doesn't
house Google assistant or anything
special like that's however it does
offer one tap access that inexplicably
wasn't available before the application
works by opening Google assistant as
soon as you tap on the icon as opposed
to opening the google app and then
finding it there and that's about all
that the app does it makes it easier to
find and gives assistant a proper spot
on your home screen or your dock
otherwise it doesn't do anything else
yet Google family link is a new
application for parents the application
shows parents what their kids are doing
on their smartphones additionally it
gives parents a little more power over
those smartphones and parents can do
things like check usage lock the phone
and monitor other vital stats it's a
real pain in the rear end to set it up
however it does seem to work okay once
it is we recommend you keep this one on
your radar at the very least launch air
launcher is a new free open-source
launcher it looks and feels a whole lot
like Google's pixel launcher that
includes similar home screens afters and
Google now
access the launcher also adds icon pack
supports various customization options
adaptive icons for Android 7.0 and up as
well as a lot more the application is in
beta right now and that means there are
bugs however it still works rather well
it should also remain free in perpetuity
facebook Messenger light isn't
technically new however it is finally
out in first world countries like the UK
US Canada and Ireland this is great news
because facebook Messenger Lite is a
lighter easier and more data friendly
alternative to the normal Facebook
Messenger app it rips out a lot of the
useless features and bloat and what's
left is a basic experience with material
design chat functionality and call
support it's also entirely free and
highly recommended over the regular app
Microsoft edge is the mobile version of
Microsoft's desktop browser it features
all of the usual stuff like an incognito
mode browsing history favorites and
other stuff it can also sync to the PC
version and also save things to read
later it is in beta right now and that
means that there are some features that
aren't available and there are also some
bugs this one should be a pretty good
browser once is officially out Microsoft
launcher is Microsoft's new launcher
obviously it's a rebranding of arrow
launcher but it's not just a flat
rebranding there are some new tricks
here the launcher removes Wunderlist
support in favour of Microsoft to-do
list app there is also a new newsfeed
functionality along with some other
smaller features it's in beta right now
and there are a few bugs and some
jumpiness to the launcher but we expect
it to improve a lot in the coming months
movies anywhere maybe one of the most
important applications released in 2017
it lets you watch movies from Amazon
iTunes Google Play Movies and Vudu you
simply log in with all your various
accounts and all of your movies are
readily available in one spot the
application also comes with a decent UI
chromecast support and more it's an
essential application for movie fans
especially those who buy movies across
multiple services there are some bugs
but it is new so that's to be expected
this is going to be a very big deal
streak complete is a new crowdsource app
for OpenStreetMap the idea is actually
pretty simple the application asks you a
bunch of questions about your immediate
vicinity you answer those questions and
those answers help open
Reeth map and prove some of the
questions include things like speed
limits for various streets building
addresses park purposes and a bunch of
other stuff the application is easy
enough to use however you do need an
Open Street Map account linked before it
lets you answer any questions and that
about does it for this one folks if you
want to check out any of these apps for
yourself you can find those links in the
video description and also don't forget
to click Subscribe and ring the bell to
get the latest android authority videos
as soon as they come out as always
thanks for watching everybody and have a
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
