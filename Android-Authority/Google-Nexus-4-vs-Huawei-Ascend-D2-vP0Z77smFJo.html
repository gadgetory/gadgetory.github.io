authority we're taking a closer look at
what we thought was the logical versus
for us to do to you while we had the
opportunity here at Huawei's boot
they've been kind enough to loan us a
few bad boys like the Ascend mate oh
nice and big anyway we're not going to
do that right now so what we're looking
at here is the nexus 4 versus huawei's
ascend d2 what makes this device pretty
cool is that first of all we're looking
at a 5-inch 1080p display whereas on the
Nexus 4 it is only a 4.7 4.8 inches
display depending on how I exactly want
to be so other than that we have a 3000
milliamp battery in the huawei ascend d2
where it wears on this one we're only
looking at a 2111 battery now this
features Claude welcomes s4 pro
technology the crate course there's four
of them and they're very very fast and
powerful sadly on this one on the ascend
d2 we're only looking at a 1.5 gigahertz
of a 949 and it's actually hisilicon
which is their internal processor
division so other than that we have a 2
megapixel camera on the rear I don't see
me on the front here for the ascend d2
and it is a little bit thicker obviously
than the nexus 4 but that three thousand
million battery is really really going
to make a big difference that's almost
as big as the one in the galaxy note 2
so the main fact is remains also that
this device is a little bit heavy or two
at 170 grams the this features are
always of emotion UI which is really
really customizable and very very fluid
so I don't think performance is really
going to be a problem so we just want to
do a nice quick hands-on for you one
gigabyte of RAM on this guy 2 gigabytes
of RAM in the nexus 4 and a 13 megapixel
camera on the rear versus name megapixel
also it should be mentioned that the
Ascend d2 incorporates water resistance
dust resistance and Gorilla Glass 2
there's gorilla glass 2 on this one but
if you drop it in the water you are
probably I got a little bit of Epic Meal
Time there for you guys so they start
stuck over here we're with android
authority here at CES 2013 thanks for
checking our videos and let us know what
you think guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
