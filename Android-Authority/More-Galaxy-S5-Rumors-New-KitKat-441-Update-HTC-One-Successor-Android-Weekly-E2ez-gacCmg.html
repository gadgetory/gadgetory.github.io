is Jace and this is where we cover the
week's Android news and provide insights
into what it means for you the Android
lover case in point the Nexus 5 although
lauded and loved by many had subpar
camera functions namely the speed with
which it could take a photo it was slow
and when capturing the right foot away
just the right second is gross well that
can be disappointing even downright
dangerous in my face when I simply tried
to prank my wife with a fake rack
capture her reaction at just the right
time but the app took too long and I
paid the price for it no it's too big to
be a mouse it's got to be a rat here I
saw it right under the chair here comes
here comes get ready see Google I really
need my update so let's start off with
getting deeper into that KitKat 4.4
point one camera update as expected the
update primarily focuses on improving
the camera experience through a
refreshed camera app that will include
hdr+ mode the new camera app promises
faster focusing especially in low light
faster white balancing truer colors and
even the ability to pinch zoom the view
finder in HDR plus mode even the app
itself is said to load about a second
quicker than the previous version moving
on to news about the HTC One successor
which we really hope is not called HTC
one two now in an interesting leak found
in the UK Nokia vs HTC legal case a
judge's ruling may have inadvertently
revealed a launch period of the next HTC
One flagship model according to the
ruling HTC has not revealed the launch
date but nokia has adduced evidence
which suggests that the launch date is
in the first quarter of 2014 and
possibly as early as february2014 and
while no one ever seems to get sick of
galaxy s5 rumors we found some more for
you so not only did the Korean et news
again suggests that the s5 would be
released in the first quarter of next
year but that it might be coupled with
the Galaxy Note 3 Lite interesting to
see what that would be also GFX
benchmark suggested that the s5 would
have those specs that we rumored about a
couple weeks ago with the whopping 2560
14
already pixel display you can check out
the links below to read those articles
in detail but check this out we found a
video launched by Samsung Taiwan that
got a lot of people excited the words
just fit just simple just elegant just
fast emerges across the screen over
shots of a metallic samsung phone an LTE
logo appears on the phone and a fat
diamond resting on the back of the phone
drives on the point that this is a
high-end product the teaser concludes
with the words just for you coming soon
now before you get all hot and bothered
you should know that that is not a
galaxy s5 leak no it is the galaxy J to
be launched later in Taiwan but some
might argue that if the galaxy J is
getting a metal case then Samsung's
flagship phone the Galaxy s5 would also
get a metal case look forward to seeing
how that all turns out now for those of
you hungry for more Android news there's
some links below about Google Play
updates I gotta go and find a better
prank I know that's not a rat it's not a
prank that was a distraction I have your
phone I'm gonna go break it now you
don't know how to break a phone oh but
her son does
