year ago and was very well received for
its 250 dollar price point it had
impressive specs and became the phone to
beat for budget-conscious buyers now
honor is back with the 7x bringing an
updated 2017 design better camera and
faster processor but can it still
compete with the other budget devices
out today the honor 7x has a very
premium look and feel much like the
honor 8 Pro it uses an all-metal chassis
with nicely rounded corners and it's
near 6-inch display is still quite
manageable thanks to minimal bezels
while the screen isn't 2k that's fair
enough for a budget device rather this
is a full HD Plus LCD panel but it's got
nice vivid colors and sufficiently high
pixel density for most folks in keeping
with 2017 trends the 5.9 3-inch screen
uses an 18 to 9 aspect ratio with an 83%
screen to body ratio that's up there
with the flagship crowd while we've
grown accustomed to this look on more
expensive phones it's always nice to see
on such an affordable device the current
659 octa-core chipset is paired with the
mali t 830 GPU for some power sipping
pixel pushing globally will see a 64 gig
version with 4 gig of ram while the US
will get 32 and 3 both versions have
microSD expandable storage up to 256
gigabytes but neither is water-resistant
and there's no wireless charging here
nor NFC for Android pay like the 6x the
honor 7x sports a dual lens camera the
main shooter is 16 megapixels while the
secondary 2 megapixel camera is there to
provide portrait mode bokeh
unfortunately this doesn't work quite as
well as the more expensive competition
and we were slightly disappointed with
the depth effect however improvements
can always be made later with a software
update the 16 megapixel camera with
phase detection autofocus lacks some
color accuracy but otherwise holds up
pretty well and is still capable of
getting some nice-looking shots with
good sharpness there's also a beefy 8
megapixel front facing camera with
portrait mode for the selfie inclined as
a fingerprint sensor around the back a
single bottom firing speaker and that
most elusive and sought-after of 2017
features the headphone jack battery
capacity remains the same as the 6 X at
3340 milliamp hours charged via microUSB
rather than USB
type-c full cost-cutting purposes we'll
bring you more amana seven x's battery
and camera in the full review so stay
tuned for that the honor 7x runs Android
new get it launched with the usual
promises of an update to Android Oreo as
soon as possible it'll be available in
black blue or gold and while we don't
have official pricing yet the interweb
rumor mill has it pegged in the low 200s
but we'll give the honor 7x a full run
for its money over the coming days it
does make quite a good first impression
from its contemporary design and full
screen display to its metal build and
dual cameras as cheap phones get
increasingly good the feature gap
between flagships and mid ranges
continues to shrink even as price
differences only seem to get bigger yana
7x is one of an increasing number of
devices aiming to buck that trend and
we're happy to see it thanks so much for
