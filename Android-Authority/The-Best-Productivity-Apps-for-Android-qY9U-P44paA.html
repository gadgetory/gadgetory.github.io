Joe handy the Android authority app guy
do you like being productive I sure
don't but it's something we all got to
do after the intro we'll take a look at
some of the best productivity apps for
Android you can't really be productive
if your phone is dead right and our
first app is one that will keep your
phone trucking a little longer to help
you get more done it's called juice
defender and there are many Android fans
who've already swear by this app it
contains a number of features and
options for you to squeeze every minute
of battery life that you can out of your
device most of them are connectivity
settings but there are some more
advanced settings and even some settings
that require route if you've got it most
office apps cost money
many cost a lot of money most of us who
have computers who already have office
software don't really want to pay for
more this is where Kingsoft office comes
in it's completely free which is great
and has support for Word PowerPoint and
Excel along with being awesome and free
there are also a lot of other options
and features that will keep the
experience from being bland controlling
your documents spreadsheets and
presentations as easy and navigating the
various effects and menus are also
really easy if you're looking for a new
free and highly rated office app it's
worth giving this a shot
lecture notes is one highly rated
application in fact we caught a little
flak for not putting it on our best
note-taking apps for Android list there
is a reason though and that's because we
wanted to include it here this app lets
you use your phone like a trusty
notebook and to take notes it's all
stylus and drawing based so if you're a
type or and not a drawer you may not
like lecture notes however if you like
to scribble away notes at breakneck
speeds and then organize them in a
colorful and fun way then lecture notes
is worth picking up one way to help
productivity is having a good clean way
of searching through your device to find
the files that you need root explorer is
one of the best for this without root
it's a solid file explorer with a number
of great features with root it's the
best file explorer for android as the
name implies you'll get the most out of
this app if you are rooted however even
without root you can still get a lot out
of this app it features a simple user
interface that can handle things like
zip and tar files with no problems it
doesn't have any visual frills but when
file browsing that's probably a good
thing for most people long gone to the
days when you took a card punched it and
put it in a slot every day to clock in
to work to borrow a line from the
competition there's now an app for that
it's called time recording timesheet and
it can help you keep track of when you
it's essentially a clock in clock out
app with a lot of extra features this is
perfect for those who work at regular
hours or anyone who has to keep their
own hours there are features for
archiving and sending your hours
anywhere so if you need that sort of
thing this is a really good app for it
if you take a look at our leaderboard
you can see how all these apps stack up
against one another as usual this isn't
how we feel about these apps but it's
how you the people rated them in the
Google Play Store if you want to try
them out the app links are in the video
description there are a lot of
productivity apps and even the
definition of productivity can be
different from person to person usually
it isn't even about finding a single
productivity after your needs but
finding several with that in mind there
are probably some productivity favorites
that weren't ranked high enough to make
the list if there were and you want to
tell us about them leave a comment below
