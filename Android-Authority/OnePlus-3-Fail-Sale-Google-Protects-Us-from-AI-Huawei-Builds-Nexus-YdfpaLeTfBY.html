one plus three wasn't so blind at all we
were a bit dubious when one plus
announced that their latest promo stunts
would be encouraging their fans to buy
the one plus three sight unseen the
company created a quote blind sale
meaning users could purchase the device
without ever laying eyes on it starting
june six however the phone wouldn't be
revealed until June fourteenth meaning
customers were essentially buying a
black box and being asked to trust one
plus with a design but that's all a moot
point now because opal mark currently
has the device proudly displayed in
their store with a price tag of 369
dollars u.s. and a listing that says
it's currently out of stock thanks to a
tipster who let us know about the post
even the most fanatical 1 plus fan won't
have to take a leap of faith before
forking over the cash for 1 plus 3 early
you'll notice that there is a price
difference from the 2999 one or four
hundred fifty five dollars us that the
blind sale participants would have paid
so we assume that as per the terms of
the promo any participants will be
reimbursed the difference the open Mart
listing also shows the smartphone specs
but we were already well aware of these
at Snapdragon 820 4 or 6 gigabytes of
ram 32 or 64 gigabytes of on-board
storage at 5.5 inch full HD amoled 3,000
milliamp hour battery and a 16 megapixel
rear cam and in other news google is
making it possible to securely stop AI
robots from causing harm worried about a
robot apocalypse some may think this is
nothing to worry about but it is true
that a self-learning intelligent machine
will not be perfect even if they turn
out not to turn evil and not want to
take over the world chances are there
will be times that these AI robots may
make harmful decisions this is why
mother Google is creating a safe way to
interrupt these actions the Google own
company called deep mine specializes in
AI research and is in charge of this
study think of it as a kill switch of
source this system would allow people to
stop self learning machines from doing
harm to themselves people or their
environment this framework makes it so
a human operator can easily and safely
interrupt whatever an AI robot is doing
and because these agents can also learn
deep mine is making sure that an AI
robot can't learn to prevent such an
interruption in essence disobeying you
would be one of the very few things
these AI agents can't learn well at
least so deep mine claims and I know
that you I robot fans are already
thinking those of you who were fans of
the Nexus 6p will be happy to know that
a huawei executive says that they are
doing the Nexus again this year the
general manager for huawei's consumer
business group in South Africa told gear
burn that quote we are doing the Nexus
again this year by the way while most
rumors have pointed to HTC being the
2016 Nexus partner for both the high-end
p and the more affordable ex Nexus
devices these latest statements throw
those rumors for a loop now this is not
the first time we've heard that Huawei
could be behind this year's high and
Nexus but it is the first time we've
heard it directly from a hallway
executive of course this may be
referring to something else like a
tablet for example but whatever she
meant it certainly adds a nice spin to
the accepted state of affairs that HTC
is making the 2016 Nexus codenamed
marlin and sailfish what do you guys
think
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
