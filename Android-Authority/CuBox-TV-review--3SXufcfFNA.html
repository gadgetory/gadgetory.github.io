header Authority earlier this year
I reviewed the cubox I a mini PC and
media player that can run Android and
Linux and now solid run the devices
manufacturer has released a new version
the cubox TV so let's see how the old
version compares with now let's see how
the new version compares it ok let's see
how the new version compares at just 2
inches by 2 inches by 2 inches the cubox
TV is a marvel of engineering on one
side of the cube is a set of ports
including the power socket HDMI Ethernet
and 2 USB ports while the rest of the
cube is fairly bland except for a few
labels logos and LEDs the cubox TV comes
in three variants with different amount
of ram one gig two gigs and four gigs
all three models pack a quad-core
processor and you have the option of
adding a Wi-Fi module and buying an IR
remote control my test unit is the cubox
TV 4gb with Wi-Fi and the remote control
as the TV part of the name implies the
cubox TV is designed to be a media
center and there are two ways of doing
this one is to use Android with apps
like Netflix and YouTube and the other
is to use Linux with programs like Cody
solid run provides a couple of linux
distros boot straight into cody one of
them is geek box XBMC and the other is
open elec openelec is a small Linux
distribution that turns the cubox TV
into a cozy media center when you buy
the cubox team it comes with an 8
gigabyte micro SD card preloaded with
cody this makes using Cody a breeze just
boot up the cubox and you're straight
into the media player since the cube
count of two years be ports you can
connect flash drives or external drives
packed full of your media I did a brief
test by connecting up a transcend 2
terabyte external hard drive with some
mp4 files on it the hard drive was
recognized by the cubox without any
problems
navigate to the files from within Cody
and play the videos the playback was
smooth and the sound comes through the
HDMI cable to the TV cody itself is
quite sophisticated piece of software
and offers easy ways to view your videos
and pictures as well as listen to your
music however it also has a powerful
add-on system which allows third-party
developers to create plug-ins for
example there is a youtube plug-in
available I downloaded it and installed
it by a Cody's internal installation
system and I was able to access YouTube
without any problems there are a myriad
of add-ons available however your
mileage may vary in terms of which
commercial services you can access you
can opera by an infrared remote control
which works specifically with the cubox
and cody the remote is easy to use and
allows you to perform simple navigation
with a set of Direction keys and OK
button in the center to perform actions
there is also a back button a menu
button and a play/pause button the cubox
TV also work with a variety of kodi
remote controls that you can find in the
google play store
although open Elect comes by default it
isn't your only choice of os if you want
to try another operating system then
solid run has a special boot image
called ignition to allow you to easily
download new firmware version is a
download ignition from the cubox TV
website unrest onto a memory card using
win32diskimager
then you move the cubox TV with ignition
and use its simple UI to pick which
operating system you want to use
ignition will then download the OS and
write it onto the micro SD card once a
copied you just reboot the cue box and
the new OS will start up the cubox TV is
compatible with Android and currently
runs Android 4.4 KitKat is one of the
official firmware you can download fire
ignition I understand the slide run I'm
working on Android 5 for the cubox TV
however there is no official release
date yet the Android experience of the
cubox is pretty good and for the most
part you get the same experience as you
would as from a smartphone or a tablet
of course without the touchscreen like
the humming board and the previous
generation of the cubox the new model
includes boo
apps so you can access the Play Store as
well as Google services like Gmail
Google+ YouTube and so on the
performance of the cubox TV is better
than the humming board I to e^x
and the cubox I mainly because of the
jump from dual core 2 quad core
processor the cubox TV scored fourteen
thousand eight hundred and twelve on m2
to some two thousand five hundred more
than the previous generation and the
Epic Citadel you get frame rate of
around 27 or 28 fps there are two minor
problems of using Android on the cubox
TV the first is that only the first two
gigabytes of RAM are recognized even on
the four gigabyte model now from what I
understand so later on are working on
them via point X release of Android and
that should fix this particular problem
the second problem is that external hard
drive and external USB drives aren't
recognized when they're plugged into the
USB port on one way that's
understandable because isn't something
that normally happens on an Android
device people don't often plug hard disk
drives into their smartphones there are
several different Linux distributions
available for the cubox TV many
Magnusson on the list you will find
popular names like Debbie an arch and
open SUSE unfortunately many of the
distros come without a desktop and you
to log in via the command line interface
that doesn't mean you can't pad a
desktop but some extra effort is
required one exception is open SUSE
during the ignition installation you can
opt to install X f c/e there's quite a
strong community behind all of SOI
brands products including the humming
board and the cubox range there's no
shortage of the next distributions for
those who want to hack port code in
tinker this means that the cubox offers
just as many opportunities as any of the
other popular SBC's and mini pcs however
i would say it is only a mini pc and you
probably can't replace your desktop pc
with this particular machine a two-block
TV is certainly an interesting mini pc
and media center it offers lots of
flexibility since its support for
Android and Linux an excellent and it
does it sell out running kollene the new
iteration updates the internals of the
box and has the options for a 4 gigabyte
this isn't a major revamp just a further
development of the previous generations
but as with most tech a bump in specs is
always welcome the design of the little
cube is neat and elegant the box is
certainly unpretentious but yet when
notice it will surely impress it's
certainly a tidy way to turn a normal TV
into a smart TV or a media player you
can purchase the cubox TV starting at
$99 $99 drums cubox TV website okay so
they have it the cubox TV the fact you
can get 4 gigabyte variant is a great
option for this little device it's very
versatile excellent running linux exit
running Android but really comes into
its own when it runs a code if you're a
fan of Kodi you should definitely
consider one of these if you love the
cubox I your definitely loves the cubox
TV the main sticking point however is
still the price it is more expensive
than other products that are available
