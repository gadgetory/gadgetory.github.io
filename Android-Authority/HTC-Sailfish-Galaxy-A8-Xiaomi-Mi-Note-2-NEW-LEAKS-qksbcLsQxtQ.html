sort of sounds like something you'd see
in a Jason Bourne movie like Bourne
aquarium not Treadstone not blackbriar
but sailfish I can hear any a playing in
the background as the title goes hey
this could work HDC the face of our
partnership with on leaks we can now
show off the sailfish from every angle
the new renders here confirm what we've
seen before but also revealed that the
sailfish will sport a USB type-c port
rather than the micro USB variant which
is currently being phased out also not
seen in previous leaks is the dual
stereo speakers which are both placed
behind two rectangular holes flanking
the USBC port on the bottom of the
handset although not shown in the
renders we can also confirm that the
headphone port is located on the top
left edge of the metal frame when
viewing the handset from the front this
calls the rumours that Google would
follow an apple and echoes lead by
dropping the headphone jack ain't
happening what else do we know about the
HTC Nexus codename sailfish well thanks
to previous leaks we can expect a full
HD display probably measuring around 5.2
or 5.3 inches alongside a Snapdragon 820
processor although it might be a
Snapdragon 820 one and have four
gigabytes of RAM
speaking of leaks we have more on the
Xiaomi me note - a selection of rather
put together renders including the
phone's box and some additional hardware
specs have popped up on Weibo real
pictures would have been great so take
this rumor with a pinch of salt
according to the post there are two
versions of the smartphone in the works
one regular and another premium model
the main model will apparently come with
a Snapdragon 810 processor 4 gigabytes
of RAM and 32 gigabytes of internal
storage the premium variant features a
newer Snapdragon 820 one processing
package a colossal six gigabytes of RAM
and either 128 or 256 gigabytes of
internal storage both phone models
should feature the same 5.7 inch display
with qHD that's 2560 by 1440 resolution
and forced touch technology other specs
include a dual 16 megapixel rear camera
configuration a
4000 million power battery and Android
7.0 new get onboard impressively the
phone is said to just be six point five
millimeters thick despite the large
battery the smartphone is expected to be
unveiled as early as this week September
14th and we have even more leaks giving
us the first look at the samsung galaxy
a8 the 2016 edition along with the
upcoming refresh to its smaller galaxy a
series handsets Samsung appears to be
working on a successor to last year's
galaxy a8 as well on leaks has provided
us the first look at the upcoming galaxy
a8 2016 edition with this little
selection of renders based on this early
look it appears the Samsung Galaxy AAA
2016 shares a familiar design with the
company's flagship Galaxy s7 thanks to a
glass looking back cover and metal trim
however this is a much larger phone than
the s7 in fact it's shaping up to be
bigger than the note 7 as well there is
also no curved edges on this 5.7 inch
display with a 1080p panel other
hardware specs include an octa-core
exynos 7420 processor from the galaxy s6
series three gigabytes of ram 32
gigabytes of internal storage the rear
camera looks to be a 16 megapixel sensor
which is paired up with the familiar 5
megapixel front-facing camera and
android 6.0.1 marshmallow onboard you
know what I didn't know if I was gonna
bring this up but I will for the small
chance that some of you might actually
appreciate this but last week's isis
video or the video where I talked about
Google censorship when it comes to Isis
and terrorism the comments just went
bananas I mean it went insane and some
people I think not just that video but a
lot of videos especially when we're
covering something that's heated and
controversial you know they hear me say
one thing and like they overload and
short-circuit and they can't hear
anything that was said after that or
before that or context or any of it and
they make a comment that just shows
their idiocy or shows that they were
just not listening or they're not
thinking and contributing intelligently
to the conversation
I promise that I will read the comments
because I think it's an integral part of
the YouTube community and I want to
contribute to that but God to suggest
that I was directly indirectly somehow
sympathetic to Isis
bloody hell people gave me a break think
to what was said I'll link it here
watch it think I was not suggesting that
in any way you could not possibly
conclude that that's what I believe
from that video anyways again let me
know what you think in the comments
below let's have an intelligent
discussion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
