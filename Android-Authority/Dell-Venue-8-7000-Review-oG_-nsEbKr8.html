interests and cells are slowing entries
on the Android side of the fence are
heating up and an unlikely competitor
appears Dell Dell is quite literally one
of the last manufacturers we would
expect a high-end extremely
well-put-together competitive tablet
from but that's exactly what the Venu
eight 7000 appears to be from the
outside and on paper
despite its uninspired name the question
is how does this tablet hold up in the
day-to-day is it yet another letdown in
the Android tablet space let's find out
I'm Taylor Martin with Android authority
and this is our review of the Dell Venue
8 7000 as a whole Android tablets have
almost always been aesthetically
underwhelming a few OEMs have managed to
mix things up from time to time but from
the appearance of the venue 8 7000 Dell
appears to be hell-bent on visually
differentiating its tablet from the rest
and it definitely succeeded this tablet
is truly stunning to look at and hold
it's industrial design is comprised
mostly of precision machined aluminum
with hard edges and corners it looks and
feels fantastic safe for the glass
section at the bottom of the backside
which is a terrible fingerprint magnet
the primary design feature here is the
nearly edge-to-edge display the screen
runs up to just six millimeters from the
top and side edges paired with being the
thinnest tablet in the world at just 6.1
millimeters the Dell Venue 8 7000 looks
almost surreal like a render of a
concept device except it's very real and
surprisingly its extra thin build
doesn't take from its sturdiness it
feels very solid in the hand without
being too heavy for extended periods of
use however all of those staggeringly
small numbers for bezels and thickness
mean the larger components have to fit
somewhere the stereo speakers 8
megapixel rear camera 2 megapixel front
camera and likely the antennas have all
been crammed into the bottom bezel or
chin as I like to call it this adds to
the venue 8 7000 s unique design and we
don't necessarily hate how it looks but
rather the ergonomic challenges it poses
this chin comes with some added utility
like a place to actually hold the tablet
since the other edges are so close to
the screen at the same time it gets in
the way and often makes me question how
to hold the tablet portrait is the only
orientation that feels natural both
because the chin is at home at the
bottom and because the navigation
buttons don't always follow the orient
the tablet particularly when you open
the camera app and unless you hold the
tablet from the narrow top edge it's
virtually impossible not to cover up one
of the cameras or depth sensors it's
almost like the tablet doesn't want to
be held in anything but portrait on top
of that the power button and volume
rocker are positioned along the top half
of the left edge which is opposite of
most devices plus while they're metal
they're only slightly raised and have
very little travel and tactility and all
the design is stunning even if the
ergonomics simply don't work out most of
the time adding to the impressive nature
of this Hamlet is the OLED display it
measures in at eight point four inches
diagonally with a resolution of 2560 by
1600 pixels it also has a relatively
high pixel density of 359 pixels per
inch the blacks are deep colors have a
distinct pop without being super
saturated and the brightness range is
quite good
still outdoor visibility is a common
problem among OLED displays and could
definitely be improved on this tablet as
good side visibility but for gaming and
viewing multimedia this is doubtless one
of the best displays around
unlike most Android tablets the Dell
Venue 8 7000 relies on the intel atom
z3580 chipset which is a combination of
a 2.3 gigahertz quad-core CPU and power
vrg 6430 GPU and so far as performance
goes the Venue 8 7000 has very little
trouble holding its own through most
menial tasks like scrolling through
lists and swiping through home screens
we noticed no serious signs of lag or
stutters but it wasn't too hard to find
some performance quirks and reproduce
them seemingly at will especially when
pressing the recent apps button and
changing orientation still the overall
performance is pretty much on par with
all the competition out there and it
handles gaming like a champ which is
great since this tablet is basically the
perfect size for casual gaming the rest
of the internals on the video eight 7000
are pretty standard it has 2 gigabytes
of RAM with 16 gigabytes of storage no
surprises there however it does have a
card slot for microSD card expansion and
it's capable of reading up to 512
gigabytes for the record a 512 gigabyte
microSD card doesn't exist yet and
regular SD cards in the half terabyte
flavor go for upwards of $1000 so this
is mostly future proofing more than
anything
connectivity options are par for the
course to Wi-Fi a total 11 BG NAC and
Bluetooth 4.0 but it doesn't come with
an FC which is a bummer
as for the speakers were torn we were
surprised by how loud and fooled the
sound coming from them actually was
they're loud very loud and they don't
sound half-bad mostly thanks to the
built-in equalizer app Mac's audio by
waves
it comes with four presets movie music
voice and gaming the difference between
Mac's audio being on and off is night
and day however despite being
front-facing if you use the tablet and
landscape all of your audio is coming
from just one side of the tablet taking
from the immersive effect in portrait
this isn't much of an issue all the
sound comes from the bottom but when it
comes to stamina this tablet is killer
only after three days and 12 hours did
the tablet reach 28% battery remaining
when the screen is off it barely sips at
the battery dropping just between 2 and
4 percent each day but if you jack the
screen brightness up and use you're
gonna see that awesome stamina take a
hit doe claims 10 hours of use and
that's definitely doable if you manage
the screen brightness well the camera on
the venue 8 7000 is admittedly strange
it's very gimmicky the setup around back
is a primary 8 megapixel camera with to
720p cameras which work as depth sensors
not totally unlike HTC's duo camera this
is what Dell calls intel realsense 3d
technology simply point the camera at an
object in the depth snapshot shooting
mode hold it steady
and snap a photo if you open this photo
in Dells gallery app you can adjust the
focal point the amount of D focusing and
more further you can estimate distances
and measure items within the photo using
that captured depth information this
realsense technology works pretty well
as good or better than most other fodi
focusing methods but there were a few
problems one it doesn't work in
low-light - the images take what seems
like forever to process once you open
them in the gallery and three snapping
photos is extremely awkward with this
tablet not only because it's a tablet
but because all the cameras are
positioned around the only place you
really have to hold the tablet the chin
it's easier to accidentally take a photo
than it is to take one on purpose
and even Dells depth snapshot
instructions look awkward and show the
user holding the tablet by the screen
and in portrait and the front-facing
camera isn't any less awkward to use all
of the cameras are in strange positions
that are entirely too hard not to cover
up and on top of that the image quality
itself isn't much to get excited about
in fact it's pretty drab and
unimpressive Dell is so close to a solid
execution but the unwilling nature of
capturing photos with the venue 8 7000
makes us wonder how much better this
technology would be if it were on a
smartphone one of the most upsetting
aspects of the venue 8 7000 is the
software not that it's bad the software
would actually be quite good if this
were early or even mid 2014 it ships
with Android 4.4.4 kitkat in a very near
stock form normally that would be a good
thing but it's been over three months
since lollipop officially arrived and
even longer since it was announced if
you've never used lollipop this tablet
software will feel quite natural and
polished that said if you're coming from
a phone or tablet which currently runs
on Google's latest firmware even after
just a few days with lollipop the sulfur
on the venue 8 7000 will flow borderline
archaic the separated panels for
notifications in quick settings recent
apps instead of the overview menu and 5
permanent home screens are stark
contrasts and reminders of just how much
the lollipop update has improved the
usability and appearance of Android I
constantly found myself long pressing on
the home screen to add widgets but they
still reside in their old home on this
tablet the app drawer and the tab to the
right of the applications outside that
there isn't much to say about the
software a few applications like Kobo
books McAfee security cam card and file
commander come pre-installed and Dells
additions are pretty minimal it has its
own camera app the my Dell app some live
wallpapers a custom gallery app for
editing photos with depth information
and del cast that's right
Dell has replaced the screencasting
feature of Android with its own
proprietary software which requires Dell
specific hardware while unfortunate for
purists it's a slight modification that
won't affect most users and all the
software is pretty solid even if it does
look and feel a little old fortunately a
lollipop update is in the works and is
expected to land sometime in the near
future it's also nice to see the app
situation for Android tablets constantly
improving though even some of Google's
own app
still have their own courts when it
comes to larger displays Dells video 8
7000 tablet sells for just 399 a fair
and comparable price to much of the
competition we figure many potential
buyers will be torn between Dells 8.4
inch slab and the 8.9 inch Nexus 9 which
goes for the same price with many
similar specs and features but
expandable storage a killer edge to edge
display and a really sweet industrial
design means you might be getting more
bang for your buck with the venue 8 7000
our biggest cause for concern with this
tablet is its ergonomics and just about
anything but portrait it doesn't feel
quite right and accidental screen taps
or button presses are inevitable but
those issues are small potatoes when you
consider all the high points of this
tablet it's definitely one of the
best-looking Android tablets to hit the
market in a very long time the speakers
and display make it ideal for multimedia
consumption and it offers up some pretty
impressive battery performance well not
perfect the Dell Venue 8 7000 is a
surprisingly great tablet and we say
it's well worth the cash guys that's
