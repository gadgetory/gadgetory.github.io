lee jae-yong has been charged with and
let me read the list embezzlement
bribery perjury concealment of criminal
proceeds and illicit transfer of assets
abroad for those of you keeping track he
is the son of the chairman of Samsung Li
Kong he and Li Kong he was charged and
convicted of tax evasion and
embezzlement in 2008 so how bad is this
for uncle Sammy
hmm according to the Korea Herald major
business projects have already slowed or
even stopped entirely
this includes Samsung's acquisition of
Harman International Lee was arrested a
day before Harman shareholders were
expected to vote on the acquisition
other investments are also going to be
trickier to finalize as there are limits
to what Lee's stand-in can do Samsung's
share prices also fell in wake of Lee's
arrest now that all sounds pretty bad
right but if history is any lesson it
probably won't affect Samsung's
day-to-day operations at all now you see
this elderly man here his name is Lee
Kum Kee and he's not only the chairman
of Samsung but he is the father of Lee
jay-yong you see in 2008 Lee Kong he
left Samsung after being indicted and
found guilty of tax evasion and
embezzlement he was given a three-year
suspended sentence however Lee Kyung he
received a presidential pardon soon
after and returned to work as the
Samsung Electronics chairman year later
why you ask well it's sort of like
Canadians irrational devotion to the
Toronto Maple Leafs they can suck
criminally bad on ice and we still love
them in an article from The Verge in
2012 writer Sam Byford asserts quote
affection for Samsung runs deep in South
Korea and an assault on the company's
culture can almost be seen as an attack
on the country itself even when Lee Kong
he is a convicted fraudster unquote now
to get back to the consumer level
Samsung is relying on its upcoming
flagship the Samsung Galaxy s8 to
deliver the company from all of its woes
including the note 7 disaster
though there is concern about how the
situation will impact its development it
is unlikely that Lee's absence will
cause any significant delay in the
delivery of Samsung's next flagship the
s8 is well underway and Samsung would
have been preparing for this possibility
for months so guys I have a genuine
question for you does this corruption
actually affect your buying choices
would you actually go for an HTC One or
Sony Xperia X instead of going for the
next flagship because of the corruption
would that actually change your choices
let me know in the comments below
you guys remember from like 15 years ago
when people were making money hand over
fist in the dot-com bubble remember we
didn't call it a dotnet bubble or dot
org bubble we didn't call them dot biz
billionaires we called them dot-com
billionaires because that's the power of
a dot-com now why is that because no
domain name extension tells your story
with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions and jet
