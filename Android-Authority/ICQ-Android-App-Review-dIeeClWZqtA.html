Authority today I'll be reviewing ICQ
mobile for Android and here's what we
got so far
contacts chats feeds so weak any feed
from Twitter Facebook or whatever and
his repost your statuses and
notifications so far
don't I've had a few problems with that
biggest two would be I cannot sink my
facebook feed with that
so I cannot post statuses to Facebook
but I can post them to Twitter and I CQ
my second one is they cannot link my
phone ty c qs so my phone number will in
sync with i CQ so i can't send text from
my computer through my phone through
that feature also the last thing i
really don't like about it is it is
pretty draining on the battery so brings
might better down pretty quick otherwise
it's pretty straightforward it you know
you like this chat there you go that's
that's Chad that goes right to your
Facebook feed also here's posting up
status I did just a down the wall
where's everyone you know simple and
this will post to Twitter Facebook if
you can get it'll synced and I CQ and
whatever else you wanted to as you can
see the little icons there so there you
go close chat windows you have options
you know anything like this view
Facebook profile it's nice if you can
get it all the work if you deal with the
battery drain I can't deal with it I
need my battery thrill today any other
Facebook apps will work with it but this
would be nice to consolidate them all
down but I don't think really think it's
worth the battery dream overall if
you're a big ICQ fan I would recommend
it give it a shot at least otherwise if
you just use Facebook or anything else I
want to recommend this over that it has
a few problems that just hold it back
and that's I CQ total for Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
