is Jason this is where we cover the
week's Android news and in the past week
it became clear that Samsung is hurting
hurting so much you can put a dollar
figure to it to the tune of four point
two two trillion won Wow yes Samsung is
bleeding with a net loss of forty eight
point eight percent from this time last
year and that's a total of four point
two two trillion won or roughly four
billion dollars u.s. ouch in theory it's
quite easy to understand the driving
force behind Samsung slipping sales it's
always difficult to be number one and
like any leader power and performance
eventually wanes over time Samsung is
especially noticing declining market
share in China India Thailand and the
Philippines now these are markets where
companies like zo Milla Nova and Huawei
work exceptionally well due to their low
cost upfront pricing now Samsung seems
to recognize their failings and gave us
a hopeful response albeit a little
cryptic senior vice-president at Samsung
Mobile's communication business said
quote we will fundamentally reform our
product portfolio now is this just a
well-crafted PR response or will Samsung
actually start to reduce feature creep
in their phones and maybe reduce the
amount of phones they produce we can be
hopeful but don't fret you Samsung fans
because Samsung will be launching the
Galaxy a3 and the a5 which on paper at
least look like very decent mid tier
options both the Galaxy a3 and the
Galaxy a5 are designed in a similar
fashion but the a5 is clearly the larger
and more powerful device of the two
while the galaxy a5 may be larger when
measured edge to edge it is the thinner
of the two measuring in at just six
point seven millimeters while the
thicker galaxy a3 also measures in at
just under seven millimeters now both
the a five and a three will come packing
at 1.2 gigahertz quad-core processor 4G
connectivity and include galaxy lines
specific features including the ultra
power saving mode private mode and multi
screen in addition a3 and a5 will come
with adjustable audio which will adapt
to noise levels in your surrounding
environment to adapt and enhance
sound-up hood of the devices the galaxy
a5 has a 5 inch HD Super AMOLED display
backing the system-on-a-chip will be 2
gigabytes of RAM 16 gigabytes of
internal storage with support up to 64
gigs via microSD slot and has a larger
13 megapixel rear-facing camera now they
did say that these two phones would be
launching in select countries including
China but when I hear select countries I
hear not launching here in the West
so we'll see now I wanted to bring you
an update on the oneplus one although
there's been great hype and excitement
about this phone very few people can
actually get one to the surprise of only
a few things did not go exactly
according to plan at last week's oneplus
one one hour pre-order event the
server's froze up they had to extend
times and there was plenty of bugs and
issues with the pre ordering process now
oneplus one has officially taken to its
blog to apologize and to offer up a
second chance to preorder those that
were not successful the first time
around
now get your clicker finger ready for
November 17th at 1500 hours GMT that's
3:00 p.m. GMT time now for those of you
who are eagerly awaiting a lollipop it
should be coming out for Nexus owners
this week there are some interesting
security features probably one of the
most important ways to prevent your data
from falling into the wrong hands is by
using a lock screen but Google notes
that many people don't use a lock screen
or a pin or password because of the
added inconvenience and that's where
smart lock comes into play which lets
you use bluetooth pairing or NFC this
means you can pair your SmartWatch or
your Android TV for when you're at home
or really any compatible device in order
to skip the pin password process there
is also a new and improved face unlock
experience that Google says is much more
advanced and secure than previous face
detection screen unlock methods thanks
for watching Android R me my name is

on Google+ or Twitter you don't have
forget about my brother's Android Josh
Joe in the tech ninja Kevin lawn and
Chris all working really hard to deliver
the best Android content on the web
