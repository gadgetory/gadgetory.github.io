Authority what's going on everybody and
Here I am with the sony xperia z3 tablet
compact now we have the same kind of
performance on the inside that you would
expect from a Sony device Xperia devices
even especially when it comes to the
tablet and here in this eight inch form
factor it is even better for all of you
out there who want something a little
bit slimmer and smaller for your tablet
needs now we're going to talk about the
screen and the performance on the inside
but first let's talk about the design
take a look at that it is such a thin
device already all around that gives it
a very light profile in a very thin
profile very easy to grip as you can see
me right here using one hand gripping it
quite easily and there you go eight
inches is really just within the realm
of comfort when it comes to the tablet
size and this is definitely there
now the thin profiles I said already
does allow it to have a very nice feel
but when you get on over to the back we
have the soft touch plastic that even
adds more to the premium feel of this
particular device now let's take a look
at the actual display itself you have
the usual triluminos display with the
x-reality engine that provides a very
good look all around they're going to
see in the colorful Experion you I end
with any media and also texture you're
going to find now we move on to the
display and you get the same great
performance that you're going to get
with any other experience especially
recent ones with the triluminos display
as you can see here with the X reality
engine now I'm just one of sort of
scrolling through all of the elements
here in the color for Xperia UI and you
can see here that the 1920 by 1200
resolution will work very well with the
tablet of this size and is exactly what
you would expect when it comes to an 8
inch tablet especially one that performs
as well as this and everyone always
talks about bezels when it comes to the
screen on various experiences and we do
have one that's a little bit sizable
right here but what I do love about it
what I've always loved about the bezels
on these particular devices is the fact
that when it comes to the top and bottom
when you're looking at it in landscape
your thumbs rest so easily right on the
side as you can see right here something
that I've always thought was a good
feature when it came to the
actual device itself when we get to the
performance underneath we have the
Snapdragon 801 the adrenal 330 and the
ability really it's a game on here with
a couple of enhancements one in
particular that I'll show you is right
here and that's the PlayStation icon now
when it comes to the z3 line of all of
these phones and this tablet right here
one of the great features that we have
here is well unfortunately the network
features turned off on this de River
particular device but being able to
connect to your PlayStation 4 inside of
your household on the same network will
allow you to stream your games to this
particular screen so it for whatever
reason you have to give up your position
on the television you will be able to
just open up that PlayStation app and
still be able to play your games
straight from your Playstation 4 to this
screen and it will provide a great
resolution and a great experience
already just in a smaller size and on a
portable size so you'll be able to have
it all around your household that's a
great feature that I'm really excited to
test out myself especially since I'm in
the market for a Playstation 4 myself
now let's move on to the camera
experience now this time around on the
camera of this particular tablet we have
an eight point one megapixel performer
and it does come with plenty of the
modes that are available in the other
Xperia iterations as well everything
from social life to creative effects to
an AR effect as well an AR fun but we'll
go ahead and jump into the manual mode
and take a look at the resolutions that
are available here you see here we have
a four by three 8 megapixel size right
here but the sixteen by nine comes in at
the six and it also comes with the scene
selection that is available here but the
superior auto is probably what you're
going to be using the most of the time
it does a pretty good job of finding the
right settings for the photo that you're
taking
right there so that is the camera
experience on here but other than that
we have a great tablet all around here
that provides a lot of the same features
you would expect from Sony Xperia Z also
includes water and dust resistance there
are plenty of demos around here already
showing that every single Sony product
that is on the floor today really is
waterproofed basically and they have it
dunked in a lot of water already and
really showing that this can withstand
the elements as far as the design goes
we're going to revisit it one more time
we do have the power button with the
volume rocker on the side no one could
know dedicated camera button on here but
you probably aren't going to be taking
that many pictures with the tablet
anyway as far as the ports ago we do
have this port right here on the bottom
that allows you access to the micro USB
charging port and then from there we
also have a port on the side right here
for a micro SD card slots now that one
is a little bit tougher to open but
there you go
you have the SIM tray if you so happen
to have a version that takes mobile
connectivity and also the micro SD card
slot right there but overall that is the
Sony Xperia z3 tablet compact we already
had a great offering in the z2 tablet
from last from the last time we saw Sony
but now we have a smaller iteration that
takes the the design optimizations that
they put into the phones and puts it
into this tablet that has a smaller form
factor that must be more accessible for
plenty of you users out there so keep it
tuned to Android or thorny for all of
the best coverage of every release that
they have here on the floor at Aoife in
Berlin at Aoife 2014 and keep it tuned
here because we are going to get an even
closer look at this tablet and possibly
compare it to a couple other ones on the
market namely the Nvidia shield tablet
that comes in at a very similar form
factor and
we'll be able to provide plenty of
competition for this brand-new Sony
Tablet so keep it tuned here and Android
Authority because we are your source for
all things FIFA 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
