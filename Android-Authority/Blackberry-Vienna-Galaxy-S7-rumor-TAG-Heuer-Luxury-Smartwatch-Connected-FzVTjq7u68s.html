gonna take another swing at an Android
device this image comes from renowned
BlackBerry fansite crackberry.com which
has gotten ahold of every possible angle
of what is said to be the upcoming
BlackBerry Vienna we haven't even gotten
over the BlackBerry Prive craze yet but
we do know that the phone is not exactly
for everyone these purported vienna
shots display the phone in multiple
colors white blue black and red as well
as a keyboard that looks very similar to
the prints but is no sliding mechanism
this keyboard one looks to be always
present which some of you might prefer
remember please be aware that we can
exactly confirm the validity of this
image quite yet regardless of how
credible a website CrackBerry is well it
looks like the tog hoyer connected is
going to be androids first luxury
SmartWatch fired by the company's
Carrara watch the connected is made of
grade 2 titanium and comes in a total of
seven colours it also comes with a 1.5
inch circular LTPS LCD scratch resistant
sapphire crystal display with a
resolution of 360 by 360 and a pixel
density of 240 PPI it is twelve point
eight millimeters thick 47 millimeters
in diameter and also comes with a rating
of ip67 for water resistance there will
be a number of useful watch faces on the
connected as well and you can customize
each one with different information such
as weather step count or calorie count
it sports a 410 million power battery
which tog says will get users 25 hours
of use at minimum additional specs
include a 1.6 gigahertz dual-core Intel
processor 1 gigabyte of RAM and 4
gigabytes of on-board storage the
connected SmartWatch just went on sale
this week you can go to the tog Hoyer
website and buy it for a massive $1500
and yes the leaks and rumors are already
heating up about the galaxy s7 and it
sounds like it could be coming very soon
according to an anonymous industry
insider Samsung has already begun
developing its firmware for the galaxy
s7 a whole month earlier than the
company started work for the galaxy s6
if we expect a similar development time
this would put the galaxy s7 on course
for a February 20
steam release now in light of what Sammy
has done in the past with such events
it's reasonable to expect that we could
see this phone officially revealed just
before the Mobile World Congress end of
February 2016
good news for geeks out there Google is
giving away its secret sauce Google is
open sourcing tensorflow the quote
secret sauce behind features like
intelligent image recognition and google
photos or the smart reply feature that
arrived in inbox last week tensorflow is
a set of free tools for machine learning
applications or in technical terms an
open source software library for
numerical computation using data flow
graphs
now that's geek speek for being able to
dramatically improve the following
better web search results better
real-time translations improved
thumbnails on YouTube improved voice
recognition on Google now now I know
what some of you are thinking you're
thinking jace machine learning is just a
euphemism for AI and we use it so we
don't scare people with whole Skynet
stuff but no machine learning is just
one part of AI and Skynet is already
