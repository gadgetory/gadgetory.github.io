Hindy the android authority app guy its
nearing the end of May which means it's
time to take a look at the best new
Android apps and games that were
released this month belief is a free
messaging service from believe it or not
BitTorrent the premise of this app is
very simple it stores all of the
encryption keys and messages on your
device instead of on the cloud like most
this helps prevent hackers from
intercepting and decoding your messages
and gives you a very secure private way
of messaging other people the interface
is also pretty nice broken age's a game
from double fine productions that has
you playing the stories of two teenagers
and you can switch between their stories
at will the game includes gorgeous
hand-drawn graphics and all-star cast of
voice actors including Elijah Wood Jack
Black and many others it's a bit
expensive at nine dollars and
ninety-nine cents but there are no
in-app purchases and it's a good looking
game chrome dev is the developer channel
release of the google chrome browser
this is very popular with the tech nerd
community because it gives you a glimpse
of the latest features that could be
coming to chrome if you like living on
the bleeding edge of development this
application is for you but do beware
that there will be bugs because this is
essentially the Chrome browser test bed
goatse is a parody of the popular daisy
game that is based on the popular goat
simulator game you play as a goat as you
take out zombies get hit by cars and
cause other goat related mayhem the
graphics are good and the game is buggy
but it's kind of supposed to be it's
pretty funny and there's a lot to do
there are also no in-app purchases and
plenty of zombies this year's Google i/o
is fast approaching and those interested
in keeping up will need the official
google i/o app in order to do it the
application is done completely in
material design and features the ability
to livestream sessions see what's going
on check events and otherwise engage
with the event everyone who is going
will definitely have this app but it's
still useful for pretty much everyone
layup from Instagram is a new photo
manipulation application that allows you
to turn your photos into collages
despite its origins you don't actually
need an Instagram account to use it and
you can post the collages you make
almost anywhere it's a fun little
application for those who like collages
and it even comes with a variety of
effects it's also totally free to use
mirror
cat is one of two new streaming
applications out this month that allow
you to stream live footage from your
smartphone camera meerkat allows you to
stream footage to your Twitter followers
straight from your camera people can
only watch it live and the video doesn't
get saved afterward but it's a fun
little concept that's already seen some
controversy and it's really fun to play
with Mix Radio finally released an
android application earlier this month
the uk-based streaming service is kind
of like Pandora and that you can
subscribe to stations and listen to
music it also takes the music you listen
to and tries to guess what kind of music
you might like based on that it's good
for music discovery and radio style
streaming it's also free to use and it
has a pretty decent interface periscope
is the other video streaming application
that was released this month alongside
of meerkats unlike meerkat periscope
allows for video replaying so people can
watch your streams over and over again
otherwise the concepts are pretty much
the same both rely on Twitter
integration and both stream live from
your phone camera also like New York at
periscope has already seen some
controversy all on its own see beard is
a puzzle adventure game where you walk
around solving puzzles and beating up
bad guys the graphics and design a
reminiscent of a Nintendo game and there
is quite a bit of stuff to do the main
premise is to build a trading empire and
most missions revolve around that idea
it's great for kids and for adults it's
free to play with in-app purchases and
it looks really nice snake rewind is the
long-awaited spiritual successor to the
hit game snake that we all used to play
on our mobile phones back in the day the
mechanics remain largely untouched in
while many may not like the controls I
really didn't think they were that bad
the graphics are decent and the game is
free to download it's a snake game
through and through and it's a good
burst of nostalgic joy Saturday Night
Live is one of the best sketch comedy
shows of all time and they released
their official application earlier this
month included is the upcoming lineup of
hosts so you know who is doing what and
when there's also access to archival
footage from years past so you can
relive the hilarity over and over again
it'll even eventually recommend sketches
the app thinks you might like last up
this month is sunburned a new game out
of noodle cake studios this retro style
game has you exploring the harshness of
space as you attempt to save your
crewmates after a space ship wreck you
have to find all of them without dying
and without
running out of oxygen it includes 50
levels and Google Play game services
it's a fun little game and there are no
in-app purchases once again I'm Joe
