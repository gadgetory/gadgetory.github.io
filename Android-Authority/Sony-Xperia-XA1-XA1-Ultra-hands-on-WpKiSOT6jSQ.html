cost of Sony's upcoming flagship bones
the equity premium and the xes
then the xperia x a1 and x a1 altar
should prove to be more cost effective
without sacrificing the charm with
Sony's designs following in traditional
Sony design these are two very similar
looking phones with their flat looks but
there's obviously a huge size disparity
when it comes to being pocketable the XA
one's one of the few phones in the
market that can be handled with a single
hand however the XA one ultra is on the
complete other end of the spectrum with
its gargantuan size sure suddenly loves
to have the borderless designs with
their edge to edge screens but the
compromises seen in the space above and
below this place now the huge bezels are
an eyesore but despite that we can't
deny that the screens look lovely
especially in the XA one ultra and it's
six inch 1080p screen it's room ly say
the least but unfortunately for the XA
one it's been stepped down to a 5 inch
720p screen Sony managed to slide 23
megapixel Exmor RS sensors into both
phones which are being paid for the low
light performances they're so confident
about the performance of its new cameras
they're promising stellar quality even
at ISO 6400 for those selfie lovers out
there though the whole gravitate towards
the 16 megapixel front-facing camera
that's on the xperia x a1 ultra which
also features built-in optical image
stabilization and a front-facing LED
flash specs wise they're very similar if
you look down the sheet but there's just
a slight advantage with the XA one ultra
like it's screen resolution the larger
2700 milliamp battery battery and its
front-facing camera everything else
however are pretty much identical take
for example the processor which is a
64-bit base octa-core MediaTek Helio
chip which handles all the basic stuff
nicely promote seen so far and they're
both also running Android new get out of
the box with Sony's usual custom skin in
terms of pricing and release
sony has announced that the xa1 will
begin to go on sale on May
first through retailers like Amazon Best
Buy B&amp;amp;H and much more and will be
selling for $300 that's pretty good
that's not too shabby too when you think
about it but we're curious to see where
they place the xa1 Ultra later on in
late spring we're hoping to see it under
$500 at the very least just because
anything more than that and we'll be
competing against other Giants in the
premium space and there you go guys
that's a quick hands-on look at these
two phones if you want to learn more
