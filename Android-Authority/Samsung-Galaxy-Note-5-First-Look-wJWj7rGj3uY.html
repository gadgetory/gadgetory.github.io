Galaxy Note line follows the lead of the
Galaxy S line for better or worse it's
Josh suffer guard from Android authority
what's going on everybody and here is
your first look at the samsung galaxy
note 5 if you're already familiar with
the samsung galaxy note 4 and the s6
from earlier this year then you pretty
much know what to expect in the note 5
the larger note series with its s-pen
now gets the design choices that the s6
started and that also means the omission
of expandable storage and removable
batteries which we'll get to in a little
bit as far as design goes however the
note 5 does take on everything that the
s6 started with a metal frame and dual
glass design where the backing does
taper down into the edges a little bit
so you get a nice little curve that does
make the phone sit pretty well in the
hand and it also sheds about a
millimeter in all directions when
compared to the note 4 the result is a
phone that is a little bit more dense
than the note 4 mostly because of its
material choices but ultimately it does
feel very nice in the hand and makes it
feel very premium not much else changes
in the design department especially when
you consider all of the button layouts
the fact that the heart rate monitor is
on the back next to the camera and
really the only big change is in the S
Pen itself now it not only feels a
little bit lighter and it also feels a
little bit more nimbler the top part of
it does have a clicking mechanism on it
which is very interesting and it's
something that you might find yourself
clicking from time to time not only to
pop it out of its little slot but also
to just click when you need something to
do in between your thoughts writing with
the s-pen the display continues the grey
prowess that Samsung already has on all
of their devices and at 5.7 inches you
get quad HD resolution with this
wonderful performing Super AMOLED
display and underneath the surface an
accede nose processor that clocks in at
2.1 gigahertz for a quad core and a
backed-up 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
processor create the octa-core package
that you're probably expecting Samsung
to put in their flagship devices and
probably already experienced a little
bit of in the galaxy s6 and edge
four gigabytes of RAM does round out the
spec sheet in that regard but that also
means that multitasking should be a
breeze in the galaxy note5 allow you to
do everything from multitasking with the
multi window and also performing a lot
of tasks with the s-pen now we were told
that the note 5 will come with 32 and 64
gigabyte storage options but as we
mentioned already there is no microsd
card slot and the omission of a 128
gigabyte option might miss a few people
who really need a lot of storage for
let's say their media consumption but
however the returning features also
include the fingerprint scanner up front
and the heart rate monitor that is on
the back both being touch applications
of course and they still both seem to
work quite well for their main
applications and of course with the
battery 3000 milliamp hours is the
capacity that you'll get in the unit
here which seems a little bit poultry
for a larger device especially when you
consider that 3500 milliamp hours did
appear in the Samsung Galaxy s6 active
which is a smaller device so we're
hoping that the optimizations found with
it will still allow this phone to go the
distance and we're really crossing our
fingers for that now what returns from
the galaxy s6 is also the fantastic 16
megapixel camera with its low aperture
construction and optical image
stabilization along with a 5 megapixel
front-facing unit with a wide angle lens
we don't really have any pictures to
show you here but we did look through
the modes inside of the camera app and
we did find a few nice additions on the
one hand we did have a video collage
that was kind of cool to try out but
then the main addition that they are
trying to market here is the live
broadcasting to YouTube as available
when you go into the mode you would log
in to your YouTube account and you'll be
able to do a live broadcast stream of
whatever the cameras are showing from
the camera app itself and finally in
software we do find a very familiar
version of Android lollipop here and the
TouchWiz overlay on top is very
reminiscent of the one that was already
found in the Samsung Galaxy s6 now with
that in mind Samsung was looking to
improve what is really unique about the
note 5 and that is of course the s-pen
aside from the actual construction of
the s-pen being a little bit different
we also have a couple new features now
one of them is the ability to actually
start an action
memo from the turned off screen you'll
be able to just pop out the s-pen when
the screen is off and the entire screen
just lights up a little bit and gives
you a black slate in order to quickly
write down and jot down a note this is
called the screen off memo now for those
of you that actually use the s-pen for
quick written notes this might be a very
easy and very quick way of doing that
and it does look quite nice and it was
pretty fun to use now the other
capturing ability is called the scroll
capture now if you were going to do a
screen write and be able to take a
picture of what is on your screen and
then just sort of jot on top of it now
the screen write will allow you to take
and piece together multiple pictures of
the same webpage in order for you to
have the entire web page available you
can scroll through and find your
different notes that you've jot down on
it and then of course the air command
window looks a little bit more unique
this time around it does fade out the
background a bit and gives you access to
not only the three main functions of the
s-pen but it also gives you a few quick
application shortcuts so that you would
get to your most used applications a
little bit easier now there are pros and
cons and taking on the galaxy s6 design
and while we do think that it makes this
new note device feel even more premium
than before it does omit some features
that we were expecting or at least
hoping that the note line would continue
to have and without expandable storage
or removable battery we can't help but
think that some note loyalists are going
to feel a little bit miffed in this new
iteration but really with all of the
features that are found inside it really
shows that Samsung has really reached a
very far point in their smartphone game
and with the great galaxy s6 that we
already liked so much we can see those
enhancements already making the note 5 a
pretty great device to have and we can't
wait to put our full review treatment on
it while we get our hands on a review
unit so keep it tuned to Android
