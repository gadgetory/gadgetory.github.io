domain.com so what's next for one plus
the so-called flagship killer now first
allow me to take you through a very
brief one plus history lesson 1 plus was
really one of the first manufacturers to
do what Chinese manufacturers are good
at doing producing decent electronics at
scale and selling them at bargain prices
now this was so much so that one could
arguably say that the oneplus one was an
even better bang for your buck bargain
than the nexus 5 where one plus one
began to stumble is in their marketing
now for those of you who've been
following me for some time you might be
thinking Jace you yourself said that
they were very good at the whole social
media marketing thing and that's very
true but consider this yes they
understand supply and demand they build
demand through marketing and then they
limit the supply by their invite system
but here's the problem there's
conflicting branding that confuses the
consumer on the one hand they're
building a so-called best bang for your
buck price right a flagship powered
without the flagship price and that's
great but then they make it precious to
get very difficult to get and at some
point when the invite system becomes a
hassle or people believe it becomes a
hassle at some point you just order the
Nexus 5 because that's going to be here
in two days and I'm not going to deal
with the hassle when you have a very
expensive device a device that's limited
in supply truly limited in supply not
limited arbitrarily but it's truly
limited then yes you want to make it
expensive and difficult to get that's a
whole different marketing strategy but
you don't have that strategy when you
have a best bang for your buck bargain
product you want to make that easily
accessible to get like Google did with
the Nexus 5 aside from the difficulty in
actually buying a one plus one the
handset was special as it was the first
time we really saw any company offer a
flagship handset at an affordable price
aside from of course the Nexus 5
although the likes of xiaomi had done
this before and select markets 1 plus
gained significant global traction very
quickly much faster than any of the
other established players had managed to
do
you up until that time but in the year
that passed between the one plus 1 and
the 1 + 21 + as rivals caught up and
even surpass the company let's take a
look at the oneplus 2 specs and how it
compares to other flagships now although
it's not exactly a geeksphone because it
lacks expandable storage and NFC it's
still a great bang for your buck phone
but as you can see when you compare the
oneplus 2 2 similarly price products 1
plus suddenly faces significant
competition for more established players
who have the distribution channels and
partners to put their devices and more
hands quicker than 1 plus can case in
point you remember the number one reason
why cyanogen ended the partnership with
1 plus it was distribution Santa janu
that one plus did not have the muscle to
get their phones and enough hands he
couldn't reach enough consumers it's
really hard to get a 1 plus device my
mother-in-law can't go down the street
and and buy a 1 plus phone like she can
buy a new samsung phone and that's going
to be an issue a big issue in fact the
primary issue 41 plusses future coupled
with this one plus also failed on the
launch of the oneplus 2 which the
company has publicly admitted ahead of
the handsets launch 1 plus said they
would have 30 to 50 times the inventory
yet they repeatedly missed dates for
releasing invites even after the
handsets launch on august eleventh
customers with the invites couldn't buy
the handset the dreaded invite system
which some would say maybe worked well
in the first handset proved to be its
downfall of this time round in addition
the oneplus two failed to bring quad HD
which many expected instead it has a 5.5
inch full HD display that doesn't stand
out in any way and it fails to have NFC
which the company suggested that they
left out because no one uses NFC but
there's one slight problem with that
mobile payments are growing to become a
large part of the smartphone industry
and the lack of NFC immediately rules
out the 1+2 from this key growth market
but we all know that the title of
flagship killer cannot be won just on
specs alone that's a combination of
features marketing and price but none of
that is going to mean anything if they
can't get their device in more markets
