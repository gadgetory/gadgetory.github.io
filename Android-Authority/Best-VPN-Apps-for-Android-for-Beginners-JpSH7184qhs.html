hindi the android authority app guy do
you like Virtual Private Networks I know
I do and after the intro will show you a
few good VPN apps for Android we'll
start out with Heitmann VPN which has
more than enough features for the casual
VPN user it's also simple enough for the
beginner VPN user the free version
starts out with 6 free hours of service
but then you must buy it to get any
further time so plenty of time to
experiment when you open the interface
it'll show your location and the country
you want to connect to there's a pretty
decent list of countries you can connect
to and even more when you buy it using
it is pretty easy pick your country then
hit connect and you'll start a VPN for
that country nice and easy
next on our little list here is hive
ninja VPN this very simple VPN app
follows many of the same steps as
Heidemann VPN does the app opens to a
very easy to understand interface that
shows your current location the location
you want to connect to and a nice big
connect button like the first app you
can choose which country you want to
connect to there is a much smaller list
than - VPN but some people really only
need a couple of countries the United
States is only available in the pro
version so people who want to use this
to use Google services will have to pay
for it hotspot Shield VPN is the most
simple VPN app on this list and probably
the best for beginners who don't know
much about Virtual Private Networks you
open the app you hit the connect button
and all of a sudden you're connected to
a virtual private network it doesn't
have the options that the other VPN apps
do for instance it doesn't give you the
option to select which country you want
it does however offer things like data
compression to lower your data usage
when you're on the limited network as
with all of these VPN apps the free
offering is limited and you have to buy
the pro version to get all of the
benefits last on our list of VPN apps
for the beginner is tunnel Bayer VPN
this is another very simple to use VPN
app where one essentially taps a button
and connects it's very nice and simple
and when you connect there's an
animation of a bear tunneling no one can
hate that at the top there are knobs
that let you choose your country and
switch the Virtual Private Network on or
off aside from these knobs there isn't
much else to the app like the rest
you're limited unless you upgrade but
this app gives you 500 megabytes per
month to play with before they make you
buy it it's really not that bad of a
deal we don't really have a leaderboard
for this one because when it comes to
VPN apps it's all about finding the one
that works best for you while these apps
all have similar features people have
reported them all
working and people have also reported
them all not working at times there are
also hundreds more VPN apps in the
Google Play Store some maintain the
simplicity while others let you get
really in-depth with your VPN settings
if you're not 100% sure what a VPN even
is staff writer Brad Ward has an
excellent post on using VPNs on Android
and you can find the link for that below
