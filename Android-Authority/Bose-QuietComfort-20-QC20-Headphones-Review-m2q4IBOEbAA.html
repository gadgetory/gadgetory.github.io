standard set which i have here and the
QC 20 our come with two additional
buttons which work iphone music control
and Siri voice commands the android
blackberry and windows compatible QCs 20
still comes with the standard answer and
call button and the aware mode control
once you simply slide the box from the
sleeve you open the Bo's flap once the
flap is open and the protective foam is
removed you will see the headphones both
earbuds and the control module are fully
exposed and ready to go once you pull
the plastic housing out of the way there
is some documentation for support and
then a bolus carrying case the carrying
case is a nylon mesh material inside you
have documentation for the headphones
and also the state ear tips the state
your tips are bose patented design that
are made for comfort and a great seal it
also comes with the USB cable for
charging the noise cancellation features
the quiet comfort earbuds at first
glance appears to be like any other
normal earbuds but when you take a
closer look you see a few differences
first there's a three and a half by one
and a quarter inch module this control
module allows you to turn on and off the
noise cancellation but I first heard
about the noise cancellation I cringed a
bit because I assume conventional
batteries were being used I was quickly
relieved when I saw that it has a
built-in rechargeable lithium ion
battery and it supported the standard
microUSB cable for charging meaning
you're never too far away from a charger
the built-in rechargeable batteries
provides up to 16 hours of listening
time but what is really unique is that
you can even listen when the battery is
drained just the noise cancellation
features will not be active fortunately
both has also included a battery
indicator light to tell you when the
juice is running low it's located right
next to the power button the control
module is a molded mat rubber and still
remains grippy even after holding it for
a while a new feature included with the
QC 20s is the aware mode each of the
headphones earpieces has two tiny noise
cancellation microphones on it during
the regular noise cancellation mode all
four of these microphones are picking up
external noises to determine the proper
amounts of inaudible out of phase tones
required to drown out
external noise when pressing the aware
button on the remote to the microphones
passes external sounds through so you
can still hear some outside sounds great
to use when you quickly need to hear
your surroundings the cord is 2-tone
thick and tough the cord sports a black
and gray color scheme and feels like
it's made for the long haul but only
time will tell
also about seven inches down in the cord
you'll find the inline microphone this
part is made from normal plastic and it
has two buttons on it and also a mic
hole the case that it comes with is a
cloth zipper case the material feels
middle of the line nylon but it should
still offer some protection against wear
and tear the air buds are also two-tone
grey and silver with a black stroke
around the Bose logo the silver part is
preffer eight it actually looks like a
speaker the buzz themselves are one inch
wide by two inches long a bit bigger
than other air buds in this price range
but for good reason the QC 20s follow a
clean color scheme and style this goes
from the packaging all the way down to
the headphones the overall presentation
is clean stylish and modern the QC 20's
are an extremely comfortable wear due to
the light weight of 1.55 ounces the
stator tips may look intimidating but do
their job shockingly well sliding it to
your ear easily and locking into place
with a slight turn of the wrist the tips
also come in three different sizes as
well small medium and large the tips are
soft and also has a lot of give and they
really conform to your ear the silicone
ear tips seal off the canal and has an
extra fin like piece that presses
against your ear for added stability
these earbuds are designed for the
traveler in mind the tips do not get
abnormally warm during activity and the
cord is just thick enough so it does not
bounce around when walking you can also
clip it to your jacket for even more
stability there are a few annoyances
with the headphones without and about if
I have one complaint the control module
at time gets in the way when walking
it's a bit cumbersome but some quick
adjustments like moving it to your
jacket pocket which are normally deeper
it shouldn't leave you ate that issue
after a few hours at times my ears can
become sore where the stay fit tips are
pressing against I know that nothing
compares to the over ear headphones but
other air buds around this price range
have managed to make long
usage more comfortable however in
conjunction with the secure fit these
are true pleasure to wear in all
circumstances the first thing I noticed
when putting the headphones on was the
base I was shockingly impressed by the
amounts of base produced and how low it
actually gets listening to the song rap
guide by Eminem gives it a great example
on how low base is picked up during a
song the bass tips down low and during
my test these earbuds can get down to
around 20 Hertz on the low end listening
to a song that has more of a punchy bass
like on the song happy by Pharrell
Williams it keeps the bass tight and
quick the bass isn't as booming as other
in earbuds but it feels just right and
as always you can use eq's to tweak to
add more bass if that's more of your cup
of tea on the high end of things
listening to a song that has a vocalist
with a good range really shows off the
versatility of these headphones listen
to the song Ellie Goulding I need your
love you can really hear her when she
hits the higher notes
unlike other earbuds this does not have
that clashing sound you can hear that
can make a listening experience
uncomfortable there's a smooth
transition from lows to highs but the
mids come in a bit soft and sometimes
are overpowered by the highs even when
the volume is cranked all the way up the
sound stays consistent and clear the
only drawback is that the highs
sometimes can be overemphasized sound
stage for the QC 20s is exceptional for
earbuds it's tough to create separation
with ear buds but somehow both figured
out a good way of emulating it it's
enough separation to really immerse
yourself in the music when turning on
the noise cancellation you instantly
hear the difference noise seems to drop
down to almost inaudible my commute to
work is in a car but I can only imagine
the amount of satisfaction these would
bring if you use public transportation
daily flipping the switch on can easily
make the person sitting behind you who
is loud into a quiet murmur then once
the music is laid over that that
nuisance can no longer be heard also
since the cord is pretty much silent
with rubbing against other objects it
adds to the overall feel of quiet and
comfort
don't get me wrong these are by no means
the greatest sounding in ears ever to
grace the world but it's the combination
of comfort
superb noise cancellation and a
laid-back warm tone that makes these one
of the best in this price range perhaps
not for their sound but for the overall
package and there you have it folks that
