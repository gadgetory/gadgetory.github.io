used by the new company one plus and
here we are going to see if this really
is the one to take on all of that
flagship devices out today hey it's Josh
regard from Android thority what's going
on everybody and here is your first look
and hands-on with the oneplus one while
at first glance you might see some
shades of another phone coming out the
Chinese market the Oppo find 7 we do
find some subtle differences and the
oneplus one does stand on its own with
its own design language the gorgeous jet
black display is pretty much all you're
going to see on the front you do get
capacitive buttons below the display but
there is a way to switch between using
those and on-screen keys which we will
talk about a little bit later the
minimalistic design language continues
as you turn the device around as a
13-megapixel reader shooter with dual
LED flashes there with the oneplus logo
at the center and a CyanogenMod logo at
the bottom edged into the smooth plastic
back along with the volume rocker on the
left and the power button on the right
of the phone positioned perfectly for
those of you who need better ergonomics
on the on the phone the buttons land
exactly where your fingers would and
provides a nice experience the sleek and
elegant lines make the device very
comfortable to hold despite its size and
relative heft and though the one is at
its thickest at 8.9 millimeters thick a
curved back results in a tapered edge
the dimensions of the phone are actually
similar to the Oppo find 7 but not as
wide as the Galaxy Note 3 and so the
handling experience is just on the line
of discomfort when it comes to
one-handed use but the width does help
and it should be quite easy to get used
to after some time that is really what
struck me most about this phone was the
weight distribution while this phone is
not very different in size from the fine
7 I found that the oneplus one was
nimbler in the hand with a light feeling
throughout to making the hand gymnastics
you may have to perform to reach
elements of the screen fairly easy over
time oneplus pretty much promised that
it would feature the best design and
while that does come down to personal
taste we do have to admit that the
oneplus one is certainly a great-looking
device also if you are wondering about
the replaceable back covers they are on
the way in the various materials that
you have read about they just won't be
available at launch moving to the
display you get a 5.5 inch JDI IPS
display with a 1080p resolution
resulting in a pixel density of 401
pixels per inch you get the expected
sharpness and colors that are vivid and
pop on this beautiful large display
viewing angles are also fantastic
allowing for 178 degrees of vision the
screen is an LT PS low temperature
poly-silicon LCD display that brings
along tol or touch on lens technology
that eliminates the display between the
touch sensor and the actual display
panel and it is also significantly more
shatterproof than other screens due to
their strong Gorilla Glass 3 get
underneath that hood and we find what
oneplus promised in its teaser campaign
the fastest processing package currently
available which is of course the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor backed
by the audrina 330 and 3 gigabytes of
RAM which should make multitasking and
general performance an absolute breeze
now CyanogenMod is also cater towards a
very smooth experience and with this
processing power the oneplus one was
able to get through all the elements 2cm
rom with really no trouble at all when
it comes to microSD expansion there is
none available on here but you do get
built-in storage including 16 and 64
gigabyte options keep in mind that your
choice of storage also determines the
choice of color with the 16 gigabyte
device coming in this silk white and the
64 gigabyte version of being available
in sandstone black you also get the full
range of connectivity options including
4G LTE support everywhere NFC Bluetooth
Wi-Fi and of course GPS now I was able
to test the speakers for a short amount
of time and the initial impressions were
that the speaker is really somewhat
lacking in volume and sound fidelity but
further testing of this will be done
with our review unit when it comes to
the battery you get a large but not
removable 3100 million power unit so
that coupled with the energy-efficient
display and the power of frugal
processing package should allow for more
than a full days of use in according to
one plus now while it might not offer
all the bells and whistles that you are
afforded by other flagship devices out
there the oneplus does give you power
and performance without skimping on
what's required you get the core Android
experience here at a very very fast
speed as we move on to the camera as we
find a sony exmor RS 13 megapixel camera
with an f 2.0 aperture and the dual LED
flash and this whole package promises to
deliver amazing shots made more precise
distortion-free and detailed by these
six physical lens
now selfies are your thing you do get
the 5 megapixel distortion-free
front-facing camera with a lens that
allows for an 80 degree capture that
should work wonders for you the rear
camera is also capable of shooting
slow-motion 720p video at 120 frames per
second which we can't wait to try out
now working with the CM camera app
showed a number of different modes and
applications of the camera optics and in
my initial testing it performed well to
get shot after shot but of course we'll
have to save the picture quality
judgment for when we're able to really
run it through its paces during a more
comprehensive review finally when we
make it to software we'll find a pretty
familiar face which is actually a strong
suit for the oneplus one as the software
is CyanogenMod 11's a special release
specifically designed for this device
and is able to take advantage of all of
its features and is based on Android
4.4.2 kitkat you get a clean
minimalistic look at its core that keeps
the software experience fast and once
again if you keep it simple you keep it
fast but as is expected already with
CyanogenMod there is a high level of
customization underneath and it is
available through the new theme engine
and storm and of course you can switch
back and forth to the stock like
experience if that is your cup of tea
sandwich and mod staples such as SMS
encryption and the privacy guard are
available and you also get the advanced
camera and gallery apps to help you get
the most out of the camera some useful
software features include a voice
command that lets you wake the device or
you can launch your favorite apps by
drawing preset gestures on a sleeping
screen and also as we mentioned before
you can choose between the on-screen and
capacitive navigation buttons to suit
your preference now whether or not you
prefer soft keys or capacitive keys
doesn't really matter here as you can
cater the experience to your liking and
thankfully the bezel on the bottom of
the phone is not so jarring that you
would feel compelled to use one over the
other
overall savage' mod brings a catered
experience made holy for the oneplus one
and for any signage ahmad veterans out
there this will feel very familiar and
also it'll provide a fast and smooth
experience so not only does it feel
right at home with this stylish device
it actually adds in some unique
functionality on top of that that
further differentiates the oneplus one
from the rest now here's where the news
gets pretty incredible this entire
package considering the grade 5.5 inch
screen the snapdragon 801 the sony
camryn and saturn janmaat out of the box
we'll start at the wonderful price out
of $2.99 for the 16 gigabyte version
making this the biggest absolute steal
in the flagship game Bar None even with
the sandstone black version the 64
gigabyte version it comes in at a price
rivaled only by the Nexus 5 349 dollars
and so there you have it - the oneplus
one should you believe the hype when it
comes to this phone well that is
entirely up to you you get a stylish
device that comes in at an incredible
price and provides power that is only
rivaled by the flagship smartphones out
today and although you may not be able
to get your hands on one as easily at
first because of an invite system we're
sure that a lot of you will be clamoring
to get your hands on this device just as
much as we are to bring you our full
