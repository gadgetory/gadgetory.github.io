watching the android authority channel
on YouTube Apple has just released its
very first mini tablet a 7.9 inch or
aptly named the iPad Mini is it a little
too late into the 7-inch tablets price
or does the ipad mini pack enough punch
to intimidate one of the well-loved
leaders in the 7-inch tablet game the
google nexus 7 find out in this video
review of the ipad mini versus the
google nexus 7 as always we begin from
what are most apparent to the eyes the
tablets exterior and physical aspects
the ipad now has a smaller sibling
called the ipad mini compared to the
earlier ipad this new one definitely
deserves being referred to as a mini but
at least against the Nexus 7 the iPad
Mini is not as many it is actually
slightly bigger and slightly wider than
the nexus 7 what's even more amazing is
that despite its bigger size the iPad
Mini is thinner than the nexus 7 and is
also lighter Apple did a good job in
making this tablet thin and light I'm
sure a lot of folks will appreciate the
thinness and light weight especially
those who use a tablet primarily for
long hours of reading the ipad minis
predominantly aluminum housing shows
apple's touch of simplicity and
minimalism the Nexus 7 on the other hand
also appears simple and minimal but with
an air of classiness because of its all
black theme accentuated by silver edging
on the front of the nexus 7 you find
nothing but the front camera at the top
center of the screen and the centers
nearby on the iPad Mini you'll find the
front camera right here and apple's
iconic home button down here as far as
minimalist design is concerned we give
it to the Nexus 7 for not having any
physical home button not even the
capacitive one navigation is software
driven on the Nexus 7 we'll talk more
about software later let's check the
sides the left side of the ipad mini
doesn't have anything same thing for the
nexus 7 except for the dock connector
pins here here on the right side of the
ipad mini are the mute orientation lock
button and the volume buttons below it
the volume buttons on the ipad mini are
not merged into one volume rocker they
are separate unlike the volume rocker on
the next
all the nexus 7 the power button is also
here on the right side above the volume
rocker these are the only physical
buttons that you'll find on the exterior
of the Nexus 7 at the top side of the
ipad mini are the headphone jack here
and the microphone here this one's the
power button it's still near the volume
buttons but on a different side the top
edge of the Nexus 7 is bare there's
nothing here at the bottom edge of the
ipad mini arts loudspeakers in between
the loudspeakers is the Lightning port
for charging and data connection in the
case of the Nexus 7 here's the headphone
jack here and the microUSB port here the
iPad minis back is made of aluminum it
smooth and slightly textured it feels
like suede the Nexus 7's back in
contrast is made of rubberized plastic
with pock marks although the iPad Mini
has a slightly textured bag it is easy
to grip without fear of slipping
primarily because the tablet is light in
the case of the Nexus 7 its back is
easier to grip because of the rubbery
and dot textured back and it has to be
easier to grip because it is also
heavier these two devices are actually a
pleasure to hold either in one hand or
in two as for screen and display both
tablets use led-backlit IPS LCD displays
both Springs of course have oleophobic
coating which is just a high-sounding
term for oil resistant coating so no
need to worry about oil seeping in
terror sticking to your screen both
screens use tough glass for protection
against scratches the Nexus 7 in
particular uses Corning Gorilla fit
glass one of the toughest glass products
from Corning Google's tablet has a
7-inch screen diagonal with 15 29 aspect
ratio resolution of 1280 by 800 and very
sharp display because of its 216 PPI
pixel density apple's tablet has the
bigger screen at seven point nine inches
diagonal but it has a lower resolution
of 1024 x 768 a 423 aspect ratio which
I'm not very fond of when it comes to
watching HD movies and only 163 ppi
pixel density this doesn't use retina
display the touch screens on these two
tablets are snappy and very alert to
touch in
they're very responsive transitions
between home screens are very smooth no
jitter or lag too I like the better
contrast on the iPad minis display
blacks are blacker and whites are wider
than on the Nexus 7 however the nexus 7
seems much better with colors they're
brighter and more vibrant than those on
the iPad Mini the Nexus 7 has sharper
images too thanks to its higher pixel
density let's talk a bit about the
processing power of these two tablets
the ipad mini uses apple's very own dual
core apple a5 chipset but it's one
gigahertz cortex a9 cpu and a power vr
SG x 54 3 MPT graphics processor it has
512 megabytes of RAM in these days of
quad cores and 2gb of ram this tablets
dual-core chip and 512mb of ram seem a
little behind meanwhile the nexus 7
flaunts a quad-core NVIDIA Tegra 3
chipset with its 1.3 gigahertz cortex a9
processor and ulp geforce graphics
processor this baby has one gigabyte of
RAM these are very powerful hardware
specs the nexus 7 surely has the
hardware for heavy multitasking extreme
web browsing or hardcore video gaming as
for storage neither of the tablets
provides micro SD storage expansion
apple lets you choose from 16 32 or 64
gigabyte models google on the other hand
offers only two storage models 16
gigabyte and 32 gigabytes apple's tablet
uses a lithium polymer battery rated at
4400 mah google's tablet has a
lithium-ion battery rated at 4325 mah
apple claims that the ipad mini can last
up to 10 hours of web browsing on Wi-Fi
watching videos and listening to music
asus claims that the nexus 7 can last up
to nine and a half hours of playing HD
videos with gmail running and sinking in
the background and with an external
headset plugged in all while Wi-Fi is on
also while we're at this Apple insists
on its proprietary lightning port and
cable it's not a standard port or
standard charger in contrast the nexus 7
uses a completely standards-compliant
microUSB port this may
means that if you ever forget your Nexus
Evans charger you can just use the
charger cable of your other Android
phone let's talk a bit about
connectivity you can't make phone calls
on either tablet but both are capable of
Wi-Fi connections both also have
bluetooth connectivity the iPad Mini has
a Wi-Fi only model and an LTE model the
Nexus 7 also has a Wi-Fi only model and
the 3g capable model reportedly coming
out this month as for data sharing the
Nexus 7 has near field communication or
NFC which she can use to share files
between two NFC devices just by tapping
them the ipad mini doesn't have this
feature now let's talk about the camera
most of us here at Android Authority
don't find a bad camera necessary on a
tablet it's great and very useful on a
phone but not so much on a tablet
whether 7 inch or bigger the front
camera is usually enough for video
chatting and probably for using a mirror
app for fixing one's hair both the Apple
and Google tablets have front-facing
cameras and both are good 1.3 megapixels
on the ipad mini and 1.2 megapixels on
the nexus 7 these cameras can capture
acceptable quality photos and videos
especially with adequate lighting Apple
slapped a bad camera all five megapixels
of it onto the ipad mini even named it I
site we still find it a bit too lavish
and opulent to have a primary camera on
a tablet some will definitely find it
useful but I feel it's just an add-on
cost regardless this camera is a snappy
one there's no shutter lag at all and
processing time as quick photo and video
quality or of acceptable quality to the
nexus 7 doesn't have a bad camera at all
I've been using a nexus 7 myself for the
past few months and I never missed the
back camera these two tablets can play
multimedia files quite well stereo sound
from the loudspeakers or external
headphones is of good quality and has
enough volume though I noticed that the
ipad mini provides deeper and richer
bass though on the Nexus 7 you can
adjust the sound levels via the built-in
equalizer in the Google Play Music app
the ipad mini music player doesn't allow
you to change equalizer settings as for
video the two tablets can play high
definition videos without stuttering or
game playback is very smooth let's now
turn our attention to the software and
user interface on these tablets the ipad
mini comes with apple's ios 6.0 out of
the box but you can update it right away
to version 6.0 point 1 the nexus 7 comes
with pure google android 4.1 jelly bean
being a Nexus device it's bound to be
one of the first to get upgrades to the
latest Android 4.2 jelly bean very soon
this discussion about the two tablets
operating systems software and user
interfaces can easily reach a couple of
hours or more so let's take a look at
some of the important and basic features
both Android and iOS are strong reliable
and stable operating systems both are
equally capable of allowing you to use
your tablet satisfactorily they do
differ in so many ways and implement
solutions differently for instance the
lock screen here's how it looks like on
the ipad mini and here's what you see on
the nexus 7 see this picture frame icon
here if you tap this the photos in your
gallery will be displayed one at a time
in a slideshow right here on the lock
screen like this this feature is not
available on the Nexus 7 let's see the
Nexus 7 lock screen tap and drag the
status bar downward like this to access
a notification menu you can't do this on
the iPad Mini drag the lock icon upward
towards the google logo to instantly
launch Google now right on the
lockscreen alone Android already shows
its mighty muscle and already gives you
a foretaste of the many awesome things
that Android allows you to do to unlock
the ipad mini drag the slider to the
right on the Nexus 7 drag the lock icon
to the unlock icon
now we're here at the home screen so
let's check it out on the iPad Mini all
your app icons are here on the home
screen the logic is that of immediate
access all your apps are laid out before
you ready for you to launch right after
you unlock the tablet screen to view
your notifications just pull down
Notification Center like this
notifications are grouped according to
the app you can delete a notification
group but you cannot dismiss individual
notifications you can't even dismiss all
notifications at the same time you can
however control which apps will display
messages in the Notification Center this
bar here is called the dock bar you can
add your most frequently used add
shortcuts to the stock so you can launch
your favorite apps regardless of which
home screen you're at this button here
is the home button it is the central
control of the ipad mini and it performs
several functions click it once to go
back to the home screen click it twice
to view your most recently closed apps
hold it down to launch sri the
voice-activated assistant if I could sum
up the ipad mini's overall principle and
just one word it would be efficiency on
Android things are different not
necessarily much better but definitely
more flexible clearer and fun on the
Nexus 7 you get five home screens which
you can view by swiping either to the
left or to the right to be your
notifications just swipe downward from
the status bar to open the notification
menu this button here is for locking the
screen orientation this one here is a
shortcut to the settings menu those are
a lot of things that you can do on
Android and we're still talking about
the notification menu this bar here is a
dock bar you can also place your
favorite app shortcuts here you can even
organize the app shortcuts into folders
just tap hold and drag an app icon over
another to create a folder the nexus 7
doesn't have physical buttons it has
virtual buttons instead these three
buttons here are four back home and
recent apps on the nexus 7 your apps are
kept in the app drawer tap this middle
button here to view your app drawer
below all your apps are here you can
place apps shortcuts on your home screen
too if you like just tap hold and drop
an app
hang on any of your five home screens
like I said Android is more dynamic and
flexible widgets are a testimony to such
flexibility all the available widgets
can be accessed from the widgets tab
next to the app drawer you add a widget
to the Home screen in the same way as
you add an app icon let's add a photo
gallery widget there you go you will
never be able to enjoy this on your iPad
Mini customizing your Nexus 7 home
screen is easy too long tap on any empty
space on the home screen like this and
you can easily change your home screen
wallpaper speaking of which you can use
animated wallpapers better known as live
wallpapers let me show you how this
breaks cool huh again this is one of the
nice things on Android that you can
never enjoy on your iPad Mini if I can
sum up the Nexus 7's overall principle
in just two words they would be
flexibility and freedom or choice both
Android 4.1 jelly bean and iOS 6.0 have
more software features than we can cover
in this review so check out our text
preview on android authority to find out
more about what other software bells and
whistles the Nexus 7 and iPad Mini can
offer you now we're down to the last bit
of this review price how much did they
cost in terms of price the nexus 7
leaves the ipad mini and the dust the
base nexus 7 model with 16 gigabytes of
storage for example costs about two
hundred US dollars while the wifi-only
ipad mini with the same storage capacity
costs around three hundred thirty
dollars the Nexus 7 is a hundred and
thirty dollars cheaper the upcoming 32
gigabyte model the Nexus 7 will
reportedly cost around three hundred
dollars while the 32 gigabyte Wi-Fi only
ipad mini is priced at four hundred
thirty dollars Google doesn't have a 64
gigabyte Nexus 7 but Apple has 64
gigabyte Wi-Fi only ipad mini priced at
around five hundred thirty dollars the
apple ipad mini and the google nexus 7
are two great tablets each one has
something to offer that the other
doesn't both run powerful and stable
operating systems the ipad mini may be
best for you if you're looking for a
sleek efficient and lightweight tablet
the sturdy build decent but fast
hardware a five megapixel
back camera and a virtual assistant that
you can chit chat with don't go for it
if your wallet can't reach its sky-high
price for those who prefer an affordable
tablet with heavyweight hardware a solid
and comfortable build no extra baggage
such as a back camera and the
flexibility and the freedom to
personalize your tablet the Nexus 7 is
perfect for you which of the two is your
next tablet Apple iPad Mini or Google
Nexus 7 let us know by leaving a comment
