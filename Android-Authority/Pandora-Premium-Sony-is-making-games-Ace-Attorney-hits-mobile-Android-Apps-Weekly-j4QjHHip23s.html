Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 169 so let's get
started niantic and starbucks have
announced a collaboration over the
course of the coming weeks 7800
starbucks locations will be turned into
either a pokey gym or a pokey stop this
comes just a couple of weeks after a
similar sprint deal salt 10,000 stores
joined the ranks of pokey stops or gyms
additionally starbucks will be
installing a Pokemon go Frappuccino this
is just in time for the massive December
update that promises more Pokemon along
with more features pandora has finally
announced a relative release date for
their Pandora premium service for those
who don't know the service is going to
be a lot like Spotify Apple music google
play music and others it'll have on
demand access to a larger music library
playlist and a whole lot more while
still having some of the features of the
original app pandora is launching the
service sometime in early 2017 and we
don't know how much it'll cost yet but
we're guessing it'll be the standard 999
like most services google play is
reportedly testing a new and separate
apps and games section in the google
play store currently both of them are in
more or less the same spot earlier this
year Google started removing the games
from the app section in the top charts
this seems to be a natural continuation
of that effort we don't know if it's
rolling out to everybody or if it's just
an a/b test but it would be really nice
if it did a while back Sony said that
they could be getting into the mobile
gaming fray this week they officially
announced that they were working on 10
mobile games forward works will be
developing and releasing all 10 games
for those who don't know that's a
company that Sony set up specifically to
make mobile games based on PlayStation
IP the release date is set for 2017 for
all ten games in a surprise twist Square
Enix will also be collaborating on a
game with Sony early next year google
has officially opened up google home for
application development the platform
should allow developers to integrate new
voice commands into their apps to make
it compatible with home a few developers
are already working on it including
yahoo dominos CNBC and a few others
google will also be adding an additional
features over time some examples are the
ability to purchase things or book
things like airplane flights
the cult classic courtroom sim from
Capcom has finally hit android Apollo
Justice Ace Attorney was released this
last week to critical acclaim the game
is the fourth in the series which is a
bit odd but it isn't that big of an
issue it has been faithfully ported with
all the gameplay of the original the
controls have of course been adapted to
mobile for easier play it costs exactly
one arm and one leg at 1599 but there
are no in-app purchases paypal business
was quietly released by paypal vez last
week as the name implies the application
was made for business owners it has a
variety of business oriented features
including the ability to manage invoices
send invoices transfer money access
customer information and you can even
manage sales and account activity it has
a simple design that is quite easy to
use it's also completely free you can do
a lot worse than this if you run a
business out of paypal dawn of titans is
a new strategy game okay it's not
exactly new it was actually soft
launched a few months ago the game was
officially launched earlier this week
the game shares a lot of mechanics with
other large-scale war games and strategy
games the difference is that this one
actually looks pretty good you can build
and command a giant army that you'll
have fighting against massive Titans it
has the usual array of stuff including
daily quests events and campaigns you
can engage with it's a freemium game but
it's worth a shot if you don't hate
those trusted contacts is a new
application from google that tells other
people your location thankfully it's
only when you want it to the application
works by allowing you to define a number
of trusted contacts those people can
then request your location it will if
you don't respond in a reasonable time
frame the application will let them know
where you are it's great for emergency
situations natural disasters and
especially for families it's also
completely free bully was originally
released by Rockstar Games all the way
back in 2006 like it's Grand Theft Auto
titles that received its fair share of
controversy but had a loyal cult
following anyway now the game is on
Android for those who have never played
it's an open world adventure game where
you play as a kid your goal is to
complete various missions go to class
and engage in various other activities
it's relatively inexpensive at 699 but
it has no in-app purchases for even more
