feature is going to move the needle for
that manufacturer and better yet
separate you from your cash so what's
our first example of a killer Android
feature well when it comes to the Galaxy
s8 it is undoubtedly the screen and it's
likely what made many of us interested
in it in the first place
Samsung finally found a use for its
curved displays by using them too almost
entirely wrap around the front of the
phone it looks gorgeous and it makes
consuming media all the more enjoyable
you disagree what else would be the SAS
killer feature Bigsby and for our next
killer feature we got to talk about the
Google pixel and no it was not for
design now some may argue that the
software is what sets the pixel apart
thanks to the full integration of Google
assistant that's present on any modern
smartphone running Android 7 but with
the caveat that the screen must be
turned on or the device must be plugged
in just to be on the safe side though
Google threw in a show-stopping camera
would you claim to be the best camera on
any phone and with the DxO mark mobile
score of 89 it had support to back this
up now whether the average user was able
to notice the difference is really
arguable the s8 also had a great camera
and our readers really love the more
affordable LG G 6 the best camera in a
blind shootout but this is a device with
a great camera nonetheless and Google
clearly made a big deal of that now I
also got to talk about the LG g 6
wide-angle lens now the LG G 6 is a
somewhat hard time standing out from the
crowd however the most impressive
feature is its wide-angle lens on a
secondary camera it might not be quite
as head-turning as some other truly
bezel is displace but whether you're a
backpacker who likes snapping panoramas
or someone who just has a lot of friends
who can't fit into a photo it's
something that is surprisingly handy now
one of my killer features is the slow-mo
in the sony xperia x z premium you can't
see it from the outside but when you see
the truly awesome footage captured on
the device and learn that the x set is
responsible you're almost certain to
have your interest piqued I know I did
and it's a good thing too because
why is the experience much more of a
carbon copy of what's gone before
although the 4k screen is still rather
exciting the 960 FPS slow-motion is the
true head turner here just to put that
into perspective for a second my much
more expensive professional-grade
DSLR can only do a hundred and twenty
frames per second compared to Sony's 960
damn so this show is based on an article
written by Adam snicky over tannoy
desert accom it'll be in the show links
below and he makes the case that the
killer feature for the Galaxy Note
series is the S Pen and I disagree I
just don't see people using their s pens
in the wild now many of you are gonna
say no I love this pen yeah yeah yeah
you like hyping and playing with the
s-pen but you don't like to actually use
it prove me wrong in the comments below
and if you really got the stones show me
video of you actually using it in some
like practical functional daily way on
video on Twitter we'll see how many I
really get and how many are actually
believable yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
