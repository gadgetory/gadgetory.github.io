what's going on everybody and here with
the brand new oppo n3 we wanted to put
it against one of the flagship phones
that it can squarely compete against and
that is the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 when
it company so the size differences we do
get a slight bump up in the screen size
for the samsung galaxy note 4 but as far
as the actual devices ago the n3 is
pretty much on par with the size of the
note 4 overall and that means you'll get
a pretty similar handling experience but
the mental construction of the note 4
has really elevated the note light to an
even better place when it comes to
design you could say the same thing
about the oppo n3 primarily because it
has shrunken down from the 5.9 inch
display from the original n1 and thus it
actually makes this package a lot more
accessible than it was before when that
screen which is way too big
aesthetically Samsung and Oppo stick to
their guns as the Samsung Galaxy Note 4
retains the same button layout on the
bottom as well as the s-pen that is
nestled in the bottom right opal on the
other hand has kept their white on white
design with capacitive keys of below
that 5.5 inch screen and of course we
have some additions with the rear
fingerprint scanner the O touch area as
it is called and the top rotating camera
the display situation is where the n3
does fall behind just a little bit
because it's 1080p resolution screen is
simply trounced by the note 4 quad HD
display now for all intents and purposes
the differences between these two in
terms of resolution might not be seen by
the general user but it is something to
take into consideration nonetheless the
n3 did show some pretty nice colors and
some nice brightness from its TFT
construction while the note 4 continues
to still show how Samsung has a great
prowess when it comes to their screen
technology while the spec sheet will
favor the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 just a
little bit especially because it has the
updated Snapdragon 805 underneath the n3
does have the Snapdragon 801 which still
should provide the same type of flash of
experience you would want from a phone
like this and with the updated KitKat
version of color OS you can expect that
the entry will still fly through
everything that it needs to as opposed
to the feature-rich
TouchWiz which does perform as well as
it ever has for a Samsung device
but still plenty of people out there
might be hypersensitive to the type of
lag you might find in this interface
nonetheless as far as the rest of the
specifications go they are pretty
similar in story what happens in the n3
is we now have a micro SD card slot that
is available to bolster the 32 gigabytes
of storage underneath the same can be
had for the note 4 though the note 4
does have a removable back cover that
will allow you access to its battery
both of these phones now have a fast
charging apparatus available now but the
VUCA fast charging originally introduced
in the Oppo find 7 has been shrunken
down a little bit so you can actually
use it in more places whereas the big
break of the find 7 is one that you
might not have been able to bring it
around all the time
nonetheless rapid charging is available
on both of these devices and they do
work quite a treat fingerprint scanning
between these two phones is a feature
that they can both boast but the scanner
on the note 4 is one that you have to
swipe over the home button on the bottom
now no matter which way you slice it
it's a little bit awkward to use from
time to time and it is definitely not
quite as easy to use as the oppo n3 s
now the n3 s back fingerprint scanner
allows you to just rest your finger on
the scanner and then press it down as it
is also a button and you will
immediately get into the interface from
a prone standby position it's a great
feature for the n3 and honestly I think
it is a better implementation of
fingerprint scanning than it is on the
Samsung device it's in the camera that
we're going to have to wait for our full
review units with the n3 in order to
really see how its quality matches up to
what has already been a pretty good
pretty great camera on the note 4 the
note 4 it does have 16 megapixels as
does the m3 but optical image
stabilization is something the note 4
has whereas the n3 is simply does not
have that but the enhancements in the
actual rotation of the top camera is due
to a motor insight that can automate the
movement and if you use the oak click
you will be able to just press a couple
of buttons on there and it will move the
camera for you without you having to do
so it's nice to be able to do that so
you can use a remote in order to frame
your shot and then you'll be able to
take it from there
while the n3 does definitely have some
tricks up its sleeve the note 4 has the
trump card that it has always had in its
line and that is the S Pen this stylus
experience is one that many users
probably do use or
and we do not an either way they have a
good time with the note but in the note
for the s-pen has provided an even
better apparatus for daily usage
especially with the note-taking
applications but the ability to use it
like a mouse to click and drag for
selections across the operating system
is in my opinion a game-changer for the
S Pen and that is really one of the
better ways that the S Pen has enhanced
a smartphone life especially for note
users it really comes down in this
particular verses on to whether or not
you need a stylus experience or you need
a very powerful front facing camera when
it comes to the n3 the entry does have a
very nice quirky camera of top but it is
up to the camera quality to really sort
of justify if it is a very good addition
to have or just a novelty luckily though
with the n3 we now have a particular
package that is very accessible so we
can say that the camera up top should
still be able to provide some good
experiences but the phone itself is now
something you could use on the daily
because it is not way too big like the
n1 was in the case of the note 4 though
the note 4 it has a huge following and
it still continues to be a great phone
in its own right so in this case we're
going to see when we get our full review
unit of the n3 how these two really
stack up especially when it comes to
camera quality so keep it tuned to
Andrew authority for our full versus
between these two phones I just wanted
to give you this quick look here at the
launch event in Singapore once again
this is Josh with regards and road
authority bringing you our coverage of
the oppo n3 here at the launch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
