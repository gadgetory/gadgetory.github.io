gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy and welcome back to
Google Play weekly hang out to
reportedly getting SMS support soon
Final Fantasy 6 is being released
sometime this winter and HBO shows are
on the Google Play Store kind of we have
that a lot more so let's get started the
first thing we'll talk about this week
is google hangouts google hangouts is
getting an update sometime in the near
future that's going to bring SMS and mms
support this is a really big deal since
this is a feature most people have
wanted since the service launched
shortly after Google i/o leaked images
show there will be a turn on SMS feature
that you can enable in settings
according to sources you'll easily be
able to tell if a message came from
hangouts or from SMS it's still in the
rumor stages but it's coming from some
pretty reliable sources it's also been
speculated this will be replacing the
messaging app on Nexus devices but that
is also unconfirmed HBO has been making
a bigger push to make their content more
available in the Google Play Store
according to reports HBO has released
Game of Thrones the newsroom Boardwalk
Empire veep true blood and a whole lot
more to the Google Play Store and
they've promised that there is more to
come unfortunately you won't be able to
get every episode reports say that only
select seasons from the TV shows will be
available this can be a bit of a downer
but HBO has said that they'll be rolling
out more content to the Play Store over
the next few weeks and months so keep an
eye out because more is coming if you've
ever wanted to use airplay on Android
than this next door it may make you
happy Koosh member of cyanogenmod inc
and developer of a myriad of great
applications has got an airplay to work
on android devices as you can see from
the demo it works fairly well with only
a little lag it's not available for
download yet but it's exciting to know
the concept does exist and that it does
in fact work push positive that this
could be used on an Android stick
computer and streamed on televisions
which could give functionality similar
to that of the chromecast while we're on
the topic of mirroring Android devices
it turns out that google has added
android screen casting support into
google chrome by that we mean it's there
right now and all you need to use it or
chrome dev tools and the latest chrome
beta browser enabling the feature is
easier said than done you'll need the
chrome devtools the chrome beta browser
and a little bit of patience however
once you figure it out it's
really nifty an easy way to screencast
your android device to your computer as
you can see from this demo it works
fairly well in our last bit of news this
week Final Fantasy 6 has been announced
for iOS and Android considered one of
the best in this series the remake will
have improved graphics and optimized
battle system that will require less
level grinding the game is slated to be
released sometime this winter which is
the perfect time of year to sit in your
house and play rpgs all day aside from
that no exact dates have been set it's
worth noting that at the end of the
Final Fantasy 6 announcement it was
hinted that final fantasy 7 could be
around the corner as well so final
fantasy 7 fans it's official you can get
excited so who wants to see some
trending applications as usual if you

strategy game with online multiplayer
capabilities yeah who has been wildly
busy fixing itself over the last year or
so and while they still have a long way
to go they have improved dramatically

that allows inbox steaming and gives
users of their email platform one
terabyte of storage to do with as they
please this also extends to their Flickr
users we're not saying that you should
leave gmail but if you have a yahoo
account now is a really good time to
open it back up digg has been working
hard to improve their mobile platform a
slew of recent updates have improved
things quite a bit with their last
update allowing only unread items to
show up in feeds it's one of the most
popular news apps out there and if
