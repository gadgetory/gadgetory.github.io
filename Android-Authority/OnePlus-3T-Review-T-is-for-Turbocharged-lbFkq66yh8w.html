have to do this but I'm going to sound a
little bit different in this video
simply because earlier this week I
underwent an oral surgery and I'm still
recovering from it so it's really hard
for me to talk right now
but I wanted to get this review out to
you guys I can't really talk the way I
normally do and I can't talk that loudly
either it's really uncomfortable so I
just want to throw that out there so you
guys are aware and you're not wondering
why I sound a little bit different or
why my speech is a little bit weird so
to speak so that's it anyways let's get
into it I hope you guys enjoy the review
of the 1 plus 3t from a design
standpoint it looks exactly the same as
the original one plus 3 it's a full
metal unibody design with a slightly
curved backside rounded corners and
sides and because the back tapers along
the edges it allows the phone to feel a
lot thinner
despite being made almost entirely of
metal it's surprisingly lightweight
making the phone feel very comfortable
to hold it's also not a very wide or
tall phone so it's pretty manageable to
use in one hand even with this fairly
large 5.5 inch screen size and it's only
slightly larger than Samsung s7 edge
which also has the same screen size
there's no 3t logo or anything on this
phone that will explicitly tell you that
this is the 3t and the only way to know
that it is the 3t is by the color the 3t
comes in two colors you have the same
gold color that was on the original one
plus three but with a 3t you have a
gunmetal version instead of silver the
gunmetal version is going to be the more
expensive model so it comes with 128
gigs of internal storage whereas the
gold version will be slightly less
expensive with 64 gigs of internal
storage so with the phone being made of
a unibody metal design it's obvious that
build quality is not an issue here and
everything feels very high quality
including the buttons and ports you have
the power button on the right side
volume rocker on the left side and one
plus is very useful notification elide
ER right
above that lets you quickly toggle
between silent do-not-disturb and full
volume and all the buttons feel very
tactile and easy to press there's no
headphone jack up top or anything up top
for that matter but there is a headphone
jack on the bottom along with your USB
type-c port and a series of machine
drilled holes for the single bottom
firing speaker on the front is the
fingerprint sensor slash home button
flanked by capacitive keys for back and
recent apps but you do have the option
to switch to on-screen keys if that's
what you prefer
by default the back keys is on the left
and recent apps is on the right but you
can flip it the other way around in the
settings and also add in a variety of
long press or double tap functions to
the home button or capacitive keys while
the fingerprint sensor itself is very
fast to unlock it's not the most
accurate fingerprint sensor that I've
ever used and will often miss read my
fingerprint several times throughout the
day I didn't find it to be that big of
an issue because overall it's still a
fairly reliable fingerprint sensor the
5.5 inch screen remains unchanged from
one plus three it's still 1080p but it's
one of the best 1080p panels on the
market it's AMOLED so colors are rich
and vibrant with tons of contrast and
oxygen os's
optional dark mode looks fantastic with
the AMOLED inky deep blacks if you're
not a fan of the vibrancy oneplus has
made it really easy to switch to the
srgb color mode under the display
settings for a more natural less
saturated look it's pretty bright so
it's easily visible outdoors and the
screen still looks plenty sharp to the
naked eye you most likely won't be able
to see the difference between this and a
quad HD panel unless you're using the
phone for VR oneplus feels that mobile
VR hasn't quite caught on to the
mainstream yet so they opted to keep the
1080p resolution in favor of better
battery life
speaking of battery life this is one
area they got a small spec bump it's now
eight thirty four hundred milli amp hour
battery over the three thousand milliamp
hour battery on the original one plus
three so you're looking at a 13 percent
increase in battery capacity all without
making the phone any thicker or heavier
than the one plus three you get 1 plus
its own - charging technology and the
biggest benefit to this is that
majority of the heat generated during
charging is contained in the wall
adapter instead of reaching your phone
this also means they can use your phone
heavily while it's charging without
worrying about the charging speeds
throttling down in order to control heat
oneplus claims that you can get a full
day's charge in half an hour which
basically translates to a sixty percent
charge from a completely dead phone
which is pretty impressive and should
work out perfectly fine if you just need
to top off for a long night ahead in day
to day use battery life for me has been
extremely good it easily last me all day
even with my heavy usage of a lot of
gaming youtube watching and music
streaming per day and even though they
bump in battery capacity was relatively
minor it seems to be making a very
significant difference for the phones
overall battery life another area that
saw an improvement is in performance it
has a whopping 6 gigabytes of RAM just
like the one plus 3 but the processor
has been upgraded to the Snapdragon 820
1 and this is the 2.3 5 gigahertz
version which is clocked higher than the
one found in Google's own pixel phones
general performance on the 3t has been
really great and again having a 1080p
display helps out a lot here since the
processor isn't having to push as many
pixels even though it's perfectly
capable of doing so it's very fast to
open apps has excellent touch response
and runs all the high-end games without
any choppiness or frame drops and with 6
gigabytes of RAM multitasking isn't an
issue either it can hold a ton of apps
in memory and keeps them there for a
very long time it's one of these
smoothest and quickest Android
experiences out there I wouldn't say
it's Google pixel smooth but it's
definitely up there with the best of
them a lot of the phone's smooth
performance also has to do with the
software in typical oneplus fashion this
is running a newer version of oxygen OS
based on Android marshmallow at the
moment and it has a very stock Android
look and feel but with a ton of
customizations that add to the
experience without getting in the way
you still have shelf one swipe away on
the leftmost home screen for checking
the weather composing memo
viewing your recent contacts or apps and
managing your data storage and battery
life this updated version of oxygen OS
has also introduced some new features to
further refine the experience you can
now swipe down on the screen with three
fingers to take a screenshot lock down
any applications of your choice to
require a password or fingerprint in
order to access them and despite being
on marshmallow oneplus has updated a
notification shade to the nougat style
notification shade with the one swipe
down quick toggles oneplus hasn't given
exact date as to when the three t will
get nougat but it slated to happen
before the end of the year for both the
three and the three T the last area that
saw a significant change on the 1 + 3 to
the 3 T is what the camera but this
change is actually on the front camera
the front camera is now a 16 megapixel
sensor so double the megapixel count
from the 8 megapixels on the 1 + 3 it's
f 2.0 aperture which helps out a lot for
taking low-light selfies and it's pretty
great for taking selfies in general with
the bump in megapixel count you'll have
a lot more room to zoom in crop without
deteriorating the pictures quality and
get much sharper looking front-facing
video the rear camera is the same 16
megapixel Sony sensor with optical image
stabilization and phase detection
autofocus and yes it still has a camera
hump just like before but since the lens
is covered in sapphire glass you
shouldn't have to worry about it getting
scratched up the camera app itself is
pretty similar to Google's with many of
the same modes like time-lapse slow
motion and panorama the only exception
is it has manual controls if you want to
dial in the settings yourself but
otherwise it's a very nicely laid out
and easy to use camera app it's
definitely a good camera when it comes
to picture quality the photos that it
takes are crisp and well detailed and I
really like the color reproduction
they're very nice natural looking colors
and the images are sharp enough without
looking over sharpened if you want some
extra sharpening you can use the cameras
high quality mode which adds a fairly
noticeable amount of sharpening to the
photos but I thought the photos in most
situations look fine as they were so I
rarely ever use this feature in terms of
dynamic range
I do think this camera has a tendency to
overexpose and blow out highlights but
HDR mode fixes this pretty easily and it
does a great job of pulling out extra
detail from the highlights and shadows
while still maintaining a natural look
of the original image low-light shots
can be pretty good but only if you're
using the camera's high quality mode
without it the images are very noisy and
soft but with it enabled the images are
much sharper more detailed and a lot
cleaner with an increase in battery
capacity a faster processor and an
improved front-facing camera this also
results in an increase in price you're
looking at 439 for the 64 gigabyte model
and 479 for the 128 gigabyte model which
is an increase of 40 to 80 dollars over
the 400 price tag of the oneplus 3 it'll
be available starting November 22nd for
the US and November 28th for Europe and
considering the bump in specs on the 3t
the price difference is completely
justifiable it's not that huge of a
price hike and still undercuts a lot of
other flagships so should you get the
one plus 3t and you're currently on the
oneplus 3 should you upgrade if you're
on the oneplus 3 you shouldn't feel
compelled to upgrade to the 3t because
while the improvements are really nice
it doesn't drastically change the
overall experience
from the 3 to the 3t and if you're
concerned about software updates both of
these phones will be receiving their
updates simultaneously in the future on
the other end of spectrum if you're
wanting a one plus three but you've yet
to pull the trigger this would be the
best time to do so because even with the
price increase with all the improvements
that you're getting it still makes this
phone the best deal you can get running
Android flagship as always thank you
