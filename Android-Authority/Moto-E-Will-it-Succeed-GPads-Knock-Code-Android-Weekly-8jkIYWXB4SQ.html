brought to you by Dollar Shave Club
welcome back to Android weekly my name
is Jason in this past week we not only
learned more about the new Samsung
tablet lines and the G pad's from LG but
we got our hands on the entry-level
goodness that is the Moto e so yes let's
start off with the official launch of
the Moto e and although it is no
flagship powered phone at a hundred and
twenty nine bucks are you getting the
best bang for your buck well let's start
with a specification that's under the
hood it is powered by a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 200 with a dual-core running
at one point two gigahertz it has an
Adreno 302 GPU now it only has four
gigabytes of users storage but you can
expand that to the microSD card slot up
to 32 gigabytes of expandable memory the
display is 4.3 inches with 540 x 960 HD
display with 256 PPI now the battery is
a nineteen hundred and eighty million
power battery claiming a standby time of
24 hours the rear facing camera is 5
megapixels notice there is no
front-facing camera and the device will
come equipped with Android 4.4 KitKat
now this has good news written all over
it and by the looks of the first video
that Josh put out it looks like it's a
very comparable user experience it's a
little bit slower than the Moto G but
not too much a little bit thicker
thicker bezels but for the price very
decent Android experience I do have a
concern though for people like me who
have tweens and teenagers we're often
looking for affordable very affordable
Android phones that we can give to our
teams if they lose it or break it it's
not a it's not a deal breaker for us
right but there is a lot of stigma or
social status attached to your phone if
you don't have an iphone or a flagship
Android phone you're not considered
really to have a smartphone I know it's
kind of silly but it is a reality and my
concern is that of a lot of teenagers
will have this phone purchase for them
and it will just end up in the bottom of
their backpack with they're smushed up
bananas I don't know we'll see how it
goes now thanks to the crew at the phone
arena we have some more leaked videos
about the LG g3 can no one keep a secret
these days LG is teasing us with a
little press release and some photos of
upcoming tablets the LG G pad line
appears to be gaining a 7-inch new
8-inch and a 10.1 inch version coming
soon official product announcements are
due later this week LG is on a roll this
week having just released a teaser video
of the upcoming G watch but as teasers
go LG is giving no information at all
about the new g pad tablets they do
promise LG specific user features though
such as NOC code so for those of you who
don't know what NOC code is this is LG's
response to the fingerprint scanner or
any other security features that are
used to lock out unwanted users on your
phone so on the Nexus 5 you know how
they have the pattern I can set up to
unlock my phone and iPhones password and
that kind of thing well this is where
you tap on certain parts of the screen
predetermined parts of the screen and
that would unlock your phone not a big
fan of the idea it requires more work
than a fingerprint scanner more work
than just sliding around on a pattern I
know some of you think I'm lazy I'm not
lazy the average Android user is lazy as
is painfully obvious I am losing hair up
here and it is growing everywhere else
that's why I was grateful for our
beloved sponsor Dollar Shave Club
because shaving this is serious business
butter
it's called Dollar Shave Club and it
couldn't be simpler raiser for a few
bucks a month Dollar Shave Club ships
amazing razors and other bathroom stuff
right to your door but wipe their blades
are just as good as the big shave
companies at a fraction of the price
it's like a personal assistant for your
face thanks for watching edward army my
