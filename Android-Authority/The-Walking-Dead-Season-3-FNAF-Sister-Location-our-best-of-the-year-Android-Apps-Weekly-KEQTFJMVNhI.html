handy the Android 230 app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly it's
also New Year's so happy new years
everybody this is episode number 172 so
let's get started
Square Enix has put a ton of its games
on sale this is great news because their
games aren't usually pretty expensive on
the blocker 7 Dragon Quest games most of
their Final Fantasy titles Chrono
Trigger Adventures of Mana Secret of
Mana Chaos Rings 3 and romancing saga 2
most of these are great games and
faithful ports from their originals
snapchat purchased and Israeli startup
called semakin the price was between 30
and 40 million dollars the popular
opinion is that snapchat plans on
delving further into the augmented
reality space and this company is going
to help them do it for those who don't
know summation is a company that lets
other companies show how their products
look in the real world with virtual
devices where guests gonna have to wait
and see how that turns out we released
our official lists for the best android
apps best android games and most
controversial apps and games our pick
for the best android app was crew maki
board the best game was crash lands and
finally the most controversial app or
game was pokemons go the lists are live
on android authority and on youtube if
you want to see all of the selections
yourself Nintendo has officially put up
Super Mario run on Android for
pre-registration that means the game's
release is fairly imminent it had a good
run in its first week on iOS although
things are cooling off now you'll also
get a notification when the game is out
to the public we're all but certain that
it will be out before the end of January
2017 while we're on the topic it turns
out that Super Mario run is having
problems getting people to pay for the
game a report this week showed that only
about one to two percent of those who
downloaded the game actually bought it
has also been free-falling through the
charts as the game's hot release starts
to cool down at this point let's just
wait and see what happens when it comes
to Android five nights at Freddy's
sister location is the latest game in
the popular horror franchise it brings
back a number of mechanics from previous
games that helped make those games
popular and yes that does include the
classic jump scares there are also some
additional things added into the game to
make it a little more rounded a ton of
people have already been diving in to
find the hidden meanings of the story
behind the game it's pretty good and
relatively inexpensive and there are no
in
purchases pigment is a coloring book
application that's aimed at adults but
thankfully it's also pretty good for
kids the base application includes 300
free pages for you to color and you can
buy more through in-app purchases it
features tap to fill mechanics and you
have access to eight different coloring
tools you'll be able to use your finger
or a stylus if you have one it has some
crashing issues but we didn't experience
them so your mileage may vary it's worth
a shot if you're into these types of
things rollercoaster tycoon classic is a
port of the original roller coaster sim
from PC this version comes with both
roller coaster tycoon 1 and
rollercoaster tycoon 2 so you're
essentially getting two games for the
price of one altogether there are 95
scenarios to play through controls that
have been redone for touchscreens and
tons of nostalgic value it's suffering
through some early release bugs but
overall it's been a positive release
there are also no in-app purchases fast
key launcher is a new launcher that
claims wicked fast app search it
accomplishes this feat by having a
keyboard that's baked right into the
home screen so you can immediately start
searching you can also make phone calls
and perform other tasks directly from
the home screen otherwise it's a simple
and light launcher that seems to work
pretty well some have reported bugs so
do be aware of those but at the very
least the app is entirely free The
Walking Dead Season 3 is the latest game
in Telltale's critically acclaimed The
Walking Dead franchise it continues the
storyline as per the comic books and
there are even throwbacks to characters
and events that happened in the first
two seasons it follows a lot of the same
mechanics as the previous games and it
also has similar graphics it's $4.99 and
you can buy additional seasons as in-app
purchases or you can buy the season pass
and get every episode there are some
early issues that were sure going to be
fixed eventually otherwise it's pretty
good for even more Android apps and
