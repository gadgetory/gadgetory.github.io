developer conference 2018 and they
announced a ton of new stuff today like
the new foldable phone that everyone is
getting really really excited about but
they also announced another really
interesting thing that kind of replaces
the whole Samsung experience user
interface and this is called Samsung one
UI now the whole idea behind one UI is
that our phones are really big but it's
really hard to reach things with one
hand originally our phones were designed
so that we would be able to interact
with things with one hand because they
were like four inches or even smaller
but now phones are getting upwards of
like over six inches tall so it's really
hard to interact with things especially
with your thumb when you have to reach
all the way to the top so effectively
what 1 UI does is it puts the visual
elements at the top of the screen and
the interactive element on the bottom of
the screen so you can almost think of
this like split screen mode in Android
where you've got one app running on the
top and run app running on the bottom
you've basically got the visual elements
of the app in the top of the display and
the interactive elements in the bottom
and they've gone as far as moving a lot
of the icons and UI elements around so
they're easier to reach to so for
example if you're trying to get to the
settings menu you can swipe down from
the top and the settings toggle icon is
actually a little bit lower so it's
easier for your thumb to press if you're
in something like the messaging app or
even the dialer app it's gonna shift all
the UI elements down a little bit so in
the dialer all the numbers from 1 to 9
are in the bottom half of the screen so
you can do everything with one hand
you're not gonna have to use two hands
or hold your phone with one hand and
reach up to just to dial numbers they're
also bringing night mode to one UI
because they said that a lot of people
are really excited about that or you can
have the user interface match the color
of your phone so if you got a pink phone
then it'll be pink if you got a green
phone of the green so that's pretty cool
there's gonna be a beta launching for
this in the next couple of months and
it's supposed to be launching on Galaxy
S 9 Galaxy S 9 plus and Galaxy Note 9 in
the beginning of next year so Samsung's
got a ton of other stuff here at Samsung
developer conference 2018 don't forget
to check that all out our website and
renewed authority calm and I'll see you
in the next video because of course we
are your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
