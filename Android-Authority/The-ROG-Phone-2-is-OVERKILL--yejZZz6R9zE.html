the new asus rog phone - if you thought
that the asus rog phone one wasn't
saying this just takes things to a
completely new level now there's so much
new in this phone that it's probably
gonna take me a while to go over it so
I'm just gonna tell you everything
that's new and then I'll give you my
impressions afterwards cuz I think
that'll just make things go a little bit
smoother so first and foremost this
phone is physically massive the screen
is six point five nine inches which is
just huge and then there's bezels on the
top and bottom so it's even bigger it's
bigger than the 1 + 7 which I already
thought was a pretty big phone but this
screen isn't any normal screen it's a
120 Hertz AMOLED display which is insane
because so far the highest refresh rate
AMOLED that we've seen is the 1 + 7 Pro
with 90 Hertz if you want to get 120
Hertz you're gonna have to get an LCD
screen like you would get on the razor
phone - but this screen is just nuts
it's 120 Hertz it's got a 240 Hertz
touch response time which means that
it's scanning the screen 240 times a
second to see if you actually touched it
and then it's got a 1 millisecond
response time so you would normally only
see those kind of specs on like a gaming
monitor but they've brought it over to
the ROG phone - this is also an HDR 10
panel and it can represent 108 percent
of the DCI p3 color gamut and they tune
these panels out of the factory to make
sure that they have a delta of around 1
and that was just all the display so
you're probably wondering about the
specs
well the RG phone 2 is the first phone
to support the new Snapdragon 850 5 plus
processor and I did a video up here if
you want to check that out but
effectively what that means is that
there's a 4% CPU overclock and a 15% GPU
overclock and this chip was really made
for gaming phones and for people that
want to get the best gaming fidelity out
of their devices so it was pretty
obvious why Asus would use this chip in
their phones other than that there is 12
gigabytes of RAM in 512 gigabytes of
storage and this is also ufs 3.0 storage
which is just the second phone so far to
use this type of storage otherwise you
would have to go to a 1 plus 7 Pro to
get this speed and an overclock like
this means that the phone's gonna get
hotter so asus has gone
and put a 3d vapor chamber in the device
they've put a vent in the device and
there's a physical fan bent on the back
of the phone which actually dispels heat
to cool the chip and they include this
active cooler inside the box which is
basically a fan that mounts into the
dual mounted USBC ports on the side of
the phone to actively cool the phone
while you're gaming so so far it's
already got pretty much the best specs
out of any phone we've seen so far but
it's being powered by a six thousand
milliamp hour battery and if you thought
the Asus zenfone 6 was huge at five
thousand milliamp hours six thousand is
just insane and I know that the 120
Hertz is probably going to drain the
battery faster we saw that and then one
plus seven pro with its ninety Hertz
display the battery life wasn't quite as
good if you left it on 90 Hertz but this
has a six that was a million by
ourselves so it's still probably going
to last a pretty significant amount of
time and you can turn it down to sixty
Hertz if you want or just make it go 120
Hertz on certain apps if you so choose
they've also brought 30 watt quick
charging over this phone which is pretty
nice to see it was 18 watts and the
zenfone 6 and you can use any USB 8
cable to charge it as long as you use
the right adapter and speaking of the
zenfone 6 you've got the same camera
raid that we found in the zenfone 6 so
you've got the sony IMX 586 sensor with
the 48 megapixel camera you've got your
13 megapixel ultra wide camera and then
you have a 24 megapixel selfie camera on
the front of the phone which a CEO says
is optimally positioned for streaming
it's just in the top right of the phone
but that's that you've also got an
optical in display fingerprint reader
you've got stereo speakers you have a
headphone jack and you've got four 802
11 AD Wi-Fi antennas positioned around
the phone aisa says that these are
positioned with landscape mode in mind
so if you're gaming on the phone in
landscape mode your fingers aren't going
to cover up any of the areas with these
Wi-Fi antennas then the original RG
phone had these touch triggers on the
right side of the phone so if you're
playing in landscape mode you could use
it to like fire a gun in pub GE or in
fortnight and they've updated those in
this phone as well now you've got a
bunch of different positions so you
don't have to lift your finger up every
time you fire you can actually hold it
down and it won't continuously fire
they're just updated and they've also
got their own vibration motors in them
too which is
really nice to see so that's pretty much
the basis of the primary specs now last
year Asus introduced a ton of extra
accessories to go along with his phone
and they updated those accessories for
the RG phone too
so you've got this attachment that
pretty much turns your RG phone into a
Nintendo switch they even call them joy
Kahn's up on the stage but of course
there's an official name for them you've
got this thing that basically turns it
into a 3ds it's like a dock that adds a
display up on top you've got this Wi-Fi
antenna that lets you stream to your TV
if you're playing a mobile game there's
a ton of new accessories for the RG
phone too and it seems like they really
care about this accessory ecosystem and
of course you've got that LED
illuminated ROG logo on the back of the
phone and you can set it to cycle colors
you can set it to blink you can set it
to be a static color it's kind of a nice
little addition there if you really want
to show off the ROG branding and last
but not least Asus is allowing you to
use Zen UI 6 on this phone and that's a
big deal for me because nui 6 is a much
slimmer version of Android that I really
really loved on these end phone 6 and I
think that that was a source of a lot of
the praise that us reviewers gave the
zenfone 6 so it's nice that you can use
that UI on this phone as well alright so
those are all the specs and now I'll
give my impressions of the phone overall
I think this is a really nice 2019
update you've got the latest Snapdragon
processor and by latest I mean the
absolute latest it's the only phone
shipping with the a 55 plus right now
you've got 12 gigs of RAM
you've got the ufs 3.0 storage which
owns only the second phone to offer this
kind of storage three USB type-c ports
which was already on the other phone but
you've got a headphone jack dual stereo
speakers the 120 Hertz
AMOLED display is insane it's probably
the fastest refresh rate display on a
smartphone right now and I really feel
like a suit just pulled out all the
stops with this phone they're really not
holding back on pretty much anything and
especially that six thousand milliamp
hour battery is probably going to power
this thing for a long time now they made
a lot of claims like the fact that their
phone can sustain frame rates up to 98%
and there's no throttling where there's
throttling with other phones over
sustained times and they show things
like benchmarks showing that it's just
the highest benchmarked phone right now
and we're gonna do all this testing
ourselves of course because you can't
just
always trust what the companies tell you
immediately we're gonna be doing a bunch
of independent testing to make sure this
is all true but I'm really actually
excited to test it out and then get back
to you guys with the details so I guess
the last thing is pricing and
availability and right now there's a
China launch happening on the 23rd which
is tomorrow as of this video going out
but we still don't know the price of
this phone the RG phone one launched at
around eight hundred and ninety nine
dollars so I'm hoping that they maintain
that price point there's a lot of really
great phones out right now like the
redmi k20 pro which are only four
hundred bucks and have flagship specs
but I feel like issues really pulled out
every single stop here so $900 isn't a
horrible price global launch is gonna be
a little bit later it's technically
coming out September 4th which is quite
a while but I'm really excited to
actually finally get this in four of you
and I'll let you know what I think about
it when I get a review unit so that's
pretty much been it I'm really excited
to get a review unit for this phone and
test it out but what do you guys think
is this completely nuts would you buy
this at all or is that just to game rate
for you let us know in the comments
section below head over to android
authority comm we have a lot of photos
over there detailing all the accessories
and different angles of this device if
you want to see more so until next time
I'll catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
