bombs at Google i/o so much so that they
baked it in the name that's what Google
IO stands for Google infinity and let's
start off with Google Maps which gets a
few upgrades and one real big one and
I'm talking about a camera integration
with Google Maps why would you want
Google Maps in your camera
well Google wants to show you an AR
experience in short if you look through
your camera Google will be able to show
you which way you should be going it's
not just that though there's also
overlays of important information such
as showing you points of interest and
just as significant is the visual
positioning system when GPS is not
enough VPS will use your phone's camera
and Google's extensive back-end data to
analyze your surroundings to identify
where you are with greater accuracy
beyond that Google Maps will also allow
for more personalized recommendations on
places to go place it to eat and all
that let's move on to Google Photos you
see when you take a photo with your
smartphone Google photos already allows
you to edit that photo you can crop it
change the brightness add filters with
relative ease
however in the near future the AI inside
Google Photos will make editing
suggestions for you based on the
information in the picture you'll be
able to edit your photos with just a
quick tap google photos also already has
the ability to scan physical photographs
and digitize them soon it will be able
to tell you who's in the photo and allow
you to share it with the person in
question in an update coming soon though
you'll even be able to colorize black
and white photos once again using the AI
to figure out which of the items in the
picture should be colorized and what
color to give them it's also interesting
to note that Google has decided to open
up Google Photos API to third-party
developers I'm interested and curious to
find out how that's going to be used how
do you think developers are gonna use
the Google Photos API interesting
question let me know in the comments
below Google News is also getting a
major update in his introduction to the
reimagined google news sundar pichai
talked about the responsibilities that
Google has done
millions of people who use Google News
to inform their world view but pachai
also mentioned the responsibility that
Google has to publishers and its
commitment to supporting quality
journalism you see that is actually
really important because it is code
speak a little doublespeak throwback to
the days when mother Google used to take
publishers or journalists headlines and
buy lines and insert them in Google
search results so a searcher who was
looking for a particular news could find
most of what they wanted right in Google
search results and not have to go to the
publishers website not allowing the
website to make money off their work
this would make them not so friendly to
Google
therefore the redesigned Google News
prominently features a briefing with the
top five stories that Google's AI
algorithms thinks are best for you the
entire selection of news is in fact done
using AI algorithms that gets better the
more you use the app the app also pulls
in local events and other local news to
give you the most relevant selection of
news posts and comments just for you I
know what some of you are thinking
you're thinking chase just get to
Android P or Google duplex well those
are bigger topics that have dedicated
shows to them
Joe is already done the Android P you
should watch that it's up in the channel
already and I will be putting out a
dedicated show on Google duplex very
soon
