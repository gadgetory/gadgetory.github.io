Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome to the 150th episode of the
Android apps weekly show just like last
week we have a ton of Pokemon go stuff
to cover so if you don't want to watch
it will have a timestamp linked up in
the video description below so you can
skip all that stuff and get right on to
the rest of the news let's get started
razor has announced that they're making
a chat application specifically for
Pokemon go the application which will be
called razor go is a location-aware chat
application that will be open to anyone
who is in your general vicinity the idea
is to help pokemon go players chat it up
while they're near each other and talk
about various aspects of the game it
should be out before too long the first
sponsored pokey stops were dropped to
this week the winner of being able to
say that they were the first was
mcdonalds the chain will have most of
his 3000 locations in japan become pokey
stops and gyms for players to flock to
and enjoy we don't know when it will
roll out to other companies but it
should be really soon a redditor did a
little bit of research this week and
show that level scaling and pokemon go
is absurdly high getting from level 32
31 requires as much experience points as
going from level 1 to level 25 this has
launched a discussion about whether or
not the game scales too aggressively and
what niantic can do about it will let
you know how that turns out gamestop has
reported that their sales have spiked
one hundred percent since the launch of
pokemon go they've been able to make
their establishments pokey stops or gyms
and have been hosting family events as a
result this has brought tons of people
in which has in turn caused sales to
spike it's a genius strategy really and
gamestop is one of many companies to see
sales go up thanks to Pokemon go it's
been estimated that Pokemon go is
currently making about 2 million dollars
per day the app Institute website has a
real time tracker that shows you a rough
estimate of what the game is making it
piles up wicked fast and the game seems
to be making a ton of money right now
Pokemon go was actually supposed to
release in France earlier this week
however after the tragedy at nice
niantic decided to delay the release
there for a little while in respect to
the events that occurred they're still
going to be a French release but it's
going to be a little bit longer it did
launch in Canada along with Japan and 26
other European countries over the last
week Sprint is jumping onto the pokemon
hype train by giving out eight
of free stuff each of their locations
will become charging stations for
players and they will also offer experts
to help in certain locations along with
lures at locations that have nearby
pokey stops this is after t-mobile
announced free data for a year for
Pokemon go players last week a while ago
it was announced that a conglomeration
of Chinese investors wanted to buy opera
for 1.2 billion however this week it was
announced the deal has fallen through
due to regulatory issues shortly
thereafter a new deal was announced the
new deal which features all of the same
players is for 600 million for a
controlling stake in Opera instead of
for the whole company a court ruling
this week has set a precedent that
uploading videos of people in a bathroom
stall to snapchat without their consent
is now a crime this occurred after a
high school student took a video of
another student in a bathroom stall and
uploaded it to his snapchat the other
student later committed suicide because
of the video as a result the courts have
decided that such behavior is now
illegal why this wasn't a law sooner is
beyond me but it's official now twitter
is making verification a little bit
easier this week for user accounts the
idea is to help people get verified even
if they're not that popular the process
is actually very simple you'll be asked
to make some changes to your profile to
accommodate the requirements after that
you'll need to submit some links to
verify who you are and then submit the
form Twitter will reach out after a few
days if you've been verified everybody
is talking about a new photo application
called prisma this week the application
uses artificial intelligence to apply
some truly unique filters to your photos
this gives them a unique look that you
just don't get with other apps we have a
hands-on video on our YouTube channel if
you want to check that out it was
briefly available as an invite-only beta
but that has since closed down now we're
all waiting for the public release for
even more Android apps and games news
updates and releases don't forget to
check out this week's newsletter which
is linked in the video description below
if you want to sign up for that
newsletter you can check out the written
companion which is also in the video
description below and fill out the very
short form there for even faster updates
don't forget to check out our android
authority app ok folks is take a look at
the apps and games that made a big
splash over the last week as usual if
you want to check out any of these apps
or games for yourself you can find those
links in the video description below
it's been a long time since we saw a
good flight simulator released on
android and Blue Angels seems to fit the
bill the game is based around the
official Blue Angels and you'll be
allowed to
form similar maneuvers stunts and
aerobatic with these that you may have
seen in real life you'll have an air
show mode and additive mode and more
where you'll be able to fly around and
do some really fun stuff it's officially
licensed by the US Navy and it's a free
download google arts and culture is a
free application that lets you view all
kinds of arts landmarks and more it
boasts high quality 360 degree images
from over 850 museums and archives along
with much more this is a great
application for art aficionados and it's
doubly good as an educational app for
youngsters it also comes with sorting
features to help you find what you're
looking for and a collection section
where you can organize your favorites
it's completely free with no in-app
purchases Suicide Squad special ops is a
first-person action game where you play
as members of The Suicide Squad the
mechanics are an unusual mix of
first-person shooter along with a
fighting game that means you'll be
bashing in the faces of opponents in the
first person perspective it has decent
graphics and plenty of gameplay content
for you to enjoy but the only downside
is that it can get repetitive after a
while since most of your time will be
spent mowing down bad guys still it's a
decent game especially for fans of the
series and the comics it's also a free
download a lot of people have been
wondering what swiftkey has been up to
since its Microsoft acquisition earlier
this year the answer is Swift emoji
keyboard this is a new keyboard that
uses Swift Keys prediction system to try
to predict which emoji you want to use
and when you want to use them it worked
all right in our testing but these kinds
of applications usually get better the
longer that you use them we don't know
why this wasn't integrated into swiftkey
directly but at least it's free if you
want to try it out Borderlands 2 yes the
actual Borderlands 2 was released on
android earlier this week well
technically it was released on android
TV devices and on the Nvidia shield
console the game is a port and contains
all of the same story elements graphics
and gameplay mechanics as the console
and PC counterparts along with the
original game you'll have access to new
classes and characters as well as an
online co-op mode if you have an Android
TV or shield console this is probably
worth the 1499 price tag and that about
does it for this one folks if you want
to watch our prisma hands-on video will
have that linked up there on the screen
and in the video description below don't
forget to sign up for that newsletter
