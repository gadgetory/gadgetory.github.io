Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly in
this week's episode we're going to talk
about Google Apps getting updated some
new place to rules and take a guess what
the Play Store makes more money than now
we're going to talk about that and a
whole lot more so let's get started the
first thing we're going to talk about
this week is asphalt 8 airborne the
sequel to asphalt 7 released by gameloft
has already received quite a bit of
attention and praise so far it's
received a higher rating than asphalt 7
ever had on the Google Play Store and
it's already accumulated over a hundred
thousand downloads the game features a
lot of improvements there are better
graphics more cars more levels and the
all-important google play games features
like leaderboards and achievements it
uses the same old tilt controls with the
nitrous being on the right and the
brakes on the left so it won't take too
long to get used to other is a pretty
well-known voice command app that came
out in the days before Android had a
real Siri competitor it even had some
more advanced features like always on
kind of like the Moto X but before the
days of the Moto X it recently got a
huge update that now uses google now
cards and can search a variety of new
sources we won't bore you with all the
details so here are a few of the
highlights it now has Spotify
integration google now integration it
can search sites like amazon and twitter
a fun little add-on that was added is
the ability to wake up the app by saying
okay Google so people without a Moto X
can at least pretend like they have one
among other things that happened this
week both Google+ and Google Hangouts
got an update on the Google+ side of
things that were bug fixes performance
enhancements and notifications now
appear if your old photos get Auto
awesome it's not that big of an update
but it should be pretty nice if you're a
fan of auto awesome on the Hangout side
of things AT&amp;amp;T customers can now use
Google Hangouts over their data
connections this is a pretty big deal
for AT&amp;amp;T customers who previously had to
be on Wi-Fi to use the app aside from
that hangouts got a few bug fixes one of
our favorite news items this week is the
inclusion of a bunch of new rules to the
google play store these new rules are
expected to take effect on September 23
2013 and app coders have until then to
get their applications updated
once it hits expect friendlier
applications and less advertisements
there are a lot of changes so we'll
highlight just a few here apps can no
longer put ads in notification bars they
can also no longer place home screen
shortcuts bookmarks or icons for
advertising also apps can no longer give
incentive for you to remove other
third-party applications there are a lot
more check out the video description for
the links to the stories mentioned to
learn more a couple of weeks ago we
talked about how the google play store
has passed up the apple app store in the
total number of downloaded apps this
last week Google Play has passed up
another competitor this time it's
handheld games a new study shows that
Google Play now makes more money on
games than handheld gaming consoles
according to the IDC people now spend
more money on games in the Google Play
Store than they do on handheld gaming
consoles sources say that this is
because nearly half of all handheld game
console owners actually buy games on
their android devices as well iOS is
still the leader by a whole bunch but
their old nemesis is now nipping at
their heels next up is our trending apps
segment where we talk about five apps
that have been making a splash in the
Play Store this week first on the
trending list is baguette this popular
game has made it to Android and it's a
fun little way to kill a few minutes the
free version is roughly half the game
with the paid version unlocking
everything else it's a little simple in
both graphics and mechanics but it's
still pretty challenging next up is an
app called shareware this nifty little
app shares your exact location with
anyone but without the social media
nonsense like you get from facebook or
foursquare you can share to anyone using
practically any messaging service it can
be useful under a number of
circumstances like when someone asks
where you are to get directions the
transit app is a useful app for anyone
who uses public transportation however
do be aware that it's not for everyone
currently there are 43 cities supported
and they're not all in the US either so
it's a good at to check out even if you
don't live there it's simple it works
and it's free but a little irritating to
use if you don't live in a supported
area we reported on menu on keyboard a
few months ago and it's out now this
ridiculous little keyboard takes your
tapping gibberish and turns it into
words it takes a while to get used to
but it does seem to work pretty well
also there's a regular
keyboard packed in should you ever need
one for faster typing until you get used
to it last on our trending apps list
this week is a kids game called toca
kitchen this popular game originated on
iOS and now you can have it on Android
too in this simple little game kids grab
up ingredients from the left and cook
them in various ways to create a meal on
the right they can then feed that meal
to the character it is important to
remember that this is for small children
because it has almost no entertainment
value for most adults once again I'm Joe
