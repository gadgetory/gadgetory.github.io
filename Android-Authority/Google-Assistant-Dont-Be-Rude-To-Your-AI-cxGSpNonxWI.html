to use even for the less AI inclined you
know how I know that those who lead the
Google AI team were kids of the 80s
because I can see that they're trying to
avoid the Max Headroom hysteria there's
more because you are going to see it as
well yes it yes it yes
namely the max syndrome syndrome story
you see Max Headroom was a fictional AI
character that had a smart witted but
stuttering and distorted electronic
voice here's how it works
ready good during one of my my early
broadcasts in the film I made a little
joke first it was a movie then it was a
television show and it became so popular
that many kids began to copy the way Max
Headroom spoke and there was lots of
talk and fear in the media about raising
a whole generation of stutterers you see
Google knows that we've become
accustomed to speaking to Google
assistant in a certain way and imagine
when AI is just ubiquitous everywhere
and people learn to speak to AI in a
certain way we don't want that to
influence our culture to such an extent
that we begin to speak to our teachers
and our grandparents and our loved ones
that way I understand that how much of
it is a real fear I don't know
but Google is thinking ahead and that's
why they've come up with Google pretty
please
Google actually revealed pretty please
to us in Google i/o 2018 but it's only
now that we're seeing it in the wild the
point of pretty please is simple to
encourage people especially children to
be polite and use proper manners when
speaking with AI hey Google talk to
voice Ron how do you forgot to say
please
okay Google he told me Ettore thanks for
saying please play from dance please
what a nice way to ask me however Google
will not reprimand your child or you if
you are rude to the assistant at least
not yet you can also now use the Google
assistant voice commands to create and
update lists just say hey Google create
a shopping lists then you say things
like hey Google add milk to my shopping
list or hey Google what's on my shopping
list right now the system uses a built
in provider for lists but eventually
third party integration will be possible
with Google keep todoist
and any do the Google assistant will
also allow you to broadcast replies
Google introduced broadcasts as a way to
communicate with your household through
your Google home smart speakers
eventually broadcasts expanded to other
home products as well as smart speakers
and very soon google allow you to easily
reply to broadcasts the cool thing with
broadcast replies is that you can use
your keyboard on your phone if you like
creating a makeshift text messaging
system granted you might find it easier
just to text someone but if you're
working hard in the kitchen and your
hands are full you can send a broadcast
text using your voice which your
recipients can read and reply to with
their own text so what do you guys think
I know that these are just small updates
and improvements but Google wins and
dominates by incremental steps let me
know in the comments below or on Twitter
you know what software starts do things
it's not supposed to do who solves those
problems
it's the unsung heroes our developer
teams in fact it's called incident
management and our beloved sponsor today

critical for our customer experience ops
