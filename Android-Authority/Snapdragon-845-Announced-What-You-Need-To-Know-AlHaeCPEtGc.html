everybody and we're here at the Qualcomm
Tech Summit in Maui in Hawaii now they
did pick a pretty incredible place to do
some really key announcements for the
upcoming year of 2018 but the snapdragon
845 is obviously going to be what powers
a lot of Android smartphones in 2018 so
of course there's gonna be a huge deal
and they brought us a number of
different points that we should keep in
mind about what the 845 will be able to
provide to manufacturers and their
smartphones now there's one thing to
remember here
Qualcomm is not only providing the
chipsets and the actual hardware that
they can use in their smartphones but
also a ton of different resources that
allow them to better tune the hardware
for their devices now it's up to the
manufacturers to take advantage of all
of these features so we're going to see
who like Samsung or any other Android
manufacturer might actually take
advantage of everything that we talked
about here at the keynote but speaking
of the keynote they gave five different
pillars as to what the 845 is going to
be able to provide to smartphone devices
and beyond because they're hoping that
the snapdragon 845 can actually power
even more the first pillar was in
regards to immersion now that involves
not only mixed virtual or augmented
reality putting them all together they
call it XR and a couple of demos
Qualcomm showed off a few new features
in the artificial intelligence area
including eye tracking and also hand
tracking but immersion also deals with
capturing the moment whether it be
through video or photo and to that end
there is a dedicated core in the
snapdragon 845 that will deal with
processing photos and video and there
are a number of enhancements that are
afforded to the cameras on smartphones
if they take advantage of this core for
example having much better color volume
this involves not only having better
color depth going from 8-bit to 10 bit
capture but also widening the color
gamut Qualcomm is also tipping their own
head to computational photography in
that multi frame capture is going to be
used to create cinema graphs for example
this was a specific use case scenario
where the camera is always shooting a
bunch of photos and when you hit the
shutter button it takes something of the
live photo that you might remember from
the pixel too but this time around you
can actually pick the portion of the
photo that remains live while the rest
of it is a still image makes for some
pretty stylistic captures and it's
something that we would love to try out
on future smartphones and we have seen a
lot of depth sensing demos from Qualcomm
in the past when we visited their
offices but here they're using depth
sensing in order to create what they
call deep portraits so not only our
picture is going to be a high quality
because of the wider color volume but
now depth sensing will allow for even
more accurate portrayals of the
portraits or the subjects inside of your
portraits the audrina 630 will bring
even better graphics performance
including 30% more performance that
should be able to make even games like
lineage run even faster than before
security was also a big deal for the Sam
jagan 845 as it now has what is called
an SPU it's a standalone unit that
provides security for the entire device
without having to rely on any other part
of the chipset or even the phone it's a
standalone unit that has its own power
and stores all of the security data
points inside of itself and then the
next pillar was about performance and we
already talked about the fact that a
snapdragon 835 powered laptops can
potentially get something like 20 hours
of video playback time and that is
something that they wanted to highlight
once again however with the snapdragon
845 you're going to get that kind of
power potentially with smartphones as
well the main example that they gave was
in recording time for their new standard
in the immersion category which is
basically 4k 60 frames per second and in
according to their specifications you
would be able to record for up to 4
hours total on one battery charge now
one thing I really enjoyed about this
section of the presentation was that
they announced quick charge 4.0 now
that's something that you are probably
expecting but what you probably did not
expect was the fact that quick charge
4.0 Chargers will be able to charge
power delivery devices as well if you
have a quick charge 4.0 charger in order
to quickly charge your smart phones and
they will be able to get to 50% battery
life in just 15 minutes while you can
use the same charger to fully charge at
full speed let's say your Nintendo
switch it's part of this entire idea
that quick charge
should be the standard that allows you
to use maybe just one cable for all of
your devices now the final pillar was
connectivity and if you search for a
qualcomm pretty much anywhere on the
internet right now you're going to see
one key term and that's five g 5g speeds
are really what Balcombe wants to push
forward and according to them 5g is
going to be a thing in early 2019 so you
can look forward to that at least but
gigabit LTE is something that we can't
experience these days especially in
Wi-Fi networks and wireless networks are
trying to catch up to it so you'll be
able to have superfast internet and the
snapdragon 845 sees a 20% increase in
the kinds of speeds it can provide to
its devices now one other portion of it
is Bluetooth and with Bluetooth five and
enhanced protocols under Bluetooth there
are a couple of things that I wanted to
mention as you probably know by now I'm
a big fan of truly wireless earbuds and
one enhancement that they did give
onstage was the fact that truly wireless
earbuds can actually have better battery
life and the reason why is because
phones that use the Bluetooth radio in
the snapdragon Ford 845 will be able to
broadcast to both earbuds as long as
they are catered to such a signal right
now truly wireless earbuds require one
of them to be the master earbud and then
it tries to route the signal over to the
other earbud for left and right channel
audio but this time the phone will be
able to broadcast to both of them at the
same time basically cutting the power
consumption effectively in half now this
is very similar to the Bluetooth
standard that allows for broadcasting to
multiple Bluetooth devices like let's
say 2 to 5 there's not really a number
there but you can broadcast to multiple
Bluetooth speakers at once and this is a
standard that should be able to help
those of you out there who really do
like your Bluetooth audio so I did my
best to kind of give you a quick
snapshot of all the stuff that you
should know from the keynotes about the
Snapdragon 820 5 today but we also have
an article written by Robert Riggs and
he provided a wonderful very of
information that you can check out at
Andrew authority comm you can also check
out the other coverage we have here at
the tech summit here in Maui
of course run by Qualcomm who just
announced that Snapdragon 845
now keep its Android 34 even more and
you can subscribe to channel if you
haven't already to keep up with all of
that coverage and more don't forget to
like our videos and also to comment on
our videos when you have a chance
because of course we are your source for
all things
