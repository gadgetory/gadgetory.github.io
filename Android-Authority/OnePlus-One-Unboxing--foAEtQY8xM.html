unit when I reviewed the oneplus one but
now that I have my own after buying it
via an invite we can finally unbox the
oneplus one hey it's Josh Pagar from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and here is your unboxing of
the oneplus one alright and here we are
with the oneplus one now it does come in
two different packages but as you can
see right there it's pretty obvious that
this one right here in this pretty nice
white and red packaging is going to be
the charger at least the u.s. compatible
charger because I imagine that there's
going to be international plug available
inside of the actual box itself but as
you can see it's full of the just
plastic that is all around and we have a
small tab up here in the corner that
will allow us to break apart the
cardboard and get started with all the
fun so I'm just going to go ahead and
get started right now now this is
already kind of funny because we have
this tab right here that will have a
rope that will pull all the way through
from the cardboard and be able to remove
this part of the cardboard so we can
take out the actual box itself but if
you've ever opened a bag of rice before
this is actually kind of similar and I
find it a little bit funny but you have
this nice little ceremonial tab right
here at the corner and we're just going
to go ahead and pull it all the way
through there you go nice and easy and
there it is one plus one and this nice
white packaging have it upside down
actually and there you go alright so
let's go ahead and get this portion of
the box out we have this nice red tab
right here and we're just going to go
ahead and pull that out and it's nice
that we have these colored this color
blocking here the white and the red this
is really a premium packaging which is
what everyone has been saying as they've
been unboxing their oneplus ones you
have the logo right here and as we open
it there it is the actual phone itself
this is a pretty pretty standard
packaging it's just a way that the color
blocks and it all does feel really nice
there's a nice texture to everything
that's it just feels really nice this
really is premium packaging I have to
say that those those assessments were
particularly rights
so we're go ahead and pull this tab
right here to take the phone out now
this is the sandstone black version the
64 gigabyte version of the oneplus one
which means that this backing is
different from pretty much what I'm used
to because the $2.99 version of the
phone has the baby skin white on the
back and it's like a soft touch plastic
really really soft but in this case we
have a very limited stone does really
describe what kind of material that says
it's almost grainy almost like sandpaper
but definitely not as painful and it
looks like it's going to provide a
really good grip without really gain to
smudgy on the back and I can already
tell you that in the hand it does feel
like it will provide a little bit better
grip as side from the very slippery feel
of the soft touch on the white version
of this phone pull the tab on here it's
going to lift up the rest of the
packaging and we'll get everything
underneath now what we have down here
are a couple of tools it's nice that we
have the sim tray tool that's down here
easily accessible right there and it's
also in a little keychain so that's
actually kind of cool I don't imagine
anybody would be putting this on their
actual keychains and leaving it near
their keys but at least it is a nice
little tool that comes in a little
sleeve here in case you do want to do
that and then this is actually something
I'm really excited about the the
charging cable actually looks really
attractive this is a red cable it's a
flat cable also it doesn't look like
it's too long it looks like maybe it's
about three four feet but it does come
with a little ribbon for you to be able
to put it together and keep it small and
handy when you need it
definitely something I'll be taking
around with me more often well yeah this
fly cable looks really nice and actually
I was wrong there's no plug in here at
all I should have known because the
packaging was actually very thin so
there's no plug you need to have the
actual adapter on the side and it's
going to be included in your package
when you order the oneplus one but
nonetheless that was your unboxing of
the oneplus one and we'll go ahead and
just take out the the charger over here
just so we can consolidate everything
alright took the tape out brought it out
and there you go
is the actual adapter plug it's a little
thick but it has the branding on there
and it's obvious that oneplus really
wants all of their logos to be
everywhere so you really know where it's
all coming from but nonetheless it's a
pretty standard plug aside from its size
and that should do it
that is the unboxing completely of the
oneplus one and here of course is the
ceremonial peeling of the plastic
very nice and we have a fresh one plus
one in the hand right now still feels
pretty nice in the hand for 5.5 inch
screen and you know with the Sam stone
black as the backing it does provide a
little bit better of a grip it does feel
a little bit safer in my hand as opposed
to the slippery sleeves slipping around
of the baby baby skin white edition that
I use for the review units but when we
go ahead and just power on the device
the buttons feel nice and meaty flat on
the left side pretty flush with the
almost flush rather with the side and on
the power button it does have that nice
click to it powered by Android going
into the operating system and while this
boots up I'm going to go ahead and sign
off here on this unboxing because I am
going to put this phone through its own
paces knowing that this is an updated
hardware package not only on the outside
but also we have the updated software on
the inside so we're probably going to
see a couple changes here after the pre
production units have been put through
their paces as you saw already in my
full review so stay tuned to android
authority for all the best coverage as I
go through the setup right here I will
go ahead and set up my Google account
once the time comes and I will show you
what has changed from the pre-production
oneplus one to this new samstone 64
gigabyte edition coming in at $349 which
is a beautiful price point and I'll let
you know exactly what's been improved
and I'm sure that everything every
little qualms that I was worried about
in the past like the low call volume and
the speaker has been fixed so we're
going to make sure of those things and
then I'll report to you when the time
comes because this is Android Authority
and we are your source for all things
