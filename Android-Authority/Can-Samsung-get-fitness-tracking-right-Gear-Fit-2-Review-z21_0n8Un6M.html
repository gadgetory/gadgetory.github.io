actually Sampson came up with their
version of a fitness tracker that wasn't
quite a watch was more like a band that
could be used to track everything from
steps to your actual workouts it was a
nifty little device and since then there
have been a lot of fitness trackers that
have come out of the woodwork so now
there is a second version of that device
and Samsung hopes that it's going to
replace the ones you might already have
on your wrist but it's a good enough to
do that
well it's Josh freghar from Android
thority what's going on everybody and
this is the Samsung gear fit 2
so now we have a second version of the
gear fit and it looks a lot like the
first one actually but of course there
are a number of enhancements these
straps that are available come in small
and large sizes with the gear fit module
in the middle and you're going to have
to use those kinds of bands if you want
to change the color and those will be
available online but it's a pretty
simple band you just throw it around
your wrist and there's a simple little
nub on one of the bands that goes into
the holes on the other band and it's
really easy to get it onto the wrist
ends especially if you have the right
size of band it's going to fit pretty
much any type of wrist out there the
module itself just sits plainly on the
top of the wrist and you're going to be
looking at a lot like a watch and the
screen is one point eight four inches
with the optical heart rate sensor on
the other side of it so a couple of
buttons and they feel really nice and
meaty but basically the buttons are just
the extra modes of navigation one of
them to go backwards in the interface
and the other one used to go back to the
home screen overall it's a good looking
device and it falls in line with a
number of the other fitness trackers
that you might see out there obviously
this is not going to look like a watch
or any of the smartwatches that are out
there but that's not the point of it
that's why it's called the gear fit it's
supposed to be in line to sort of tackle
the fit bits of the world if you will
but as far as the look and feel go it's
very easy to put onto the wrist like I
said already and it's kind of
inconspicuous
even though it's for in fact already
makes it clear it is made for fitness
it's a pretty nice screen in that it
shows all of the information that you
need on there especially for the fitness
tracking but when it comes to
notifications if you have longer forms
of text on here they are going to end up
getting truncated so you're not going to
see the entire message for short form
messages and emails it's going to be
really easy to read everything on your
just by scrolling up and down on the
message and then after that you'll be
able to hit on to either replying to the
message via some canned responses or you
can open it up on the smart phone itself
yeah pretty much all the hardware you
would need in the gear fit - including
GPS which does take a little bit to lock
on to the subject but once it's logged
on you can track where you're going in
your run or your hike or your walk
there's Bluetooth which is the main way
that it connects to a smartphone and
thankfully the gear manager and the S
health apps are available on the Google
Play Store so you can get this connected
to pretty much any Android device and
also with Bluetooth you can connect a
Bluetooth headset to just the gear fit -
and any local music files that you put
into the four gigabytes of storage on
the gear fit - can be listened to
straight from here so you don't
necessarily need to have your phone on
you at all times for your workout after
that you have all the different sensors
that are used to track the movements and
to register certain movements if you do
certain workouts inside of this device
and finally you have the battery at 200
milliamp hours which works for about
three days if you're using this
regularly but in my case I actually had
the gear fit - not paired to a smart
phone so without having to go through
notifications and anything like that it
actually was able to last for about five
to six days the harvey mater on the back
here is obviously optical which means
that it's not going to necessarily be as
accurate as other heartrate monitors
especially ones that you would strap
onto your chest but it is used for a
number of the workouts just not all of
them so if you're going to be doing
cardio based workouts for the most part
like running or walking then you'll be
able to use the heartrate to more
accurately track how many calories
you're burning this unfortunately was
not ideal when it comes to other
activities that I like to do I'm more of
a weightlifter which means that I prefer
to track my heart rates during
activities like that but when you go
into the activity tracker and you pick
something like other workout it simply
does not use the heart rate monitor at
all so that does kind of suck if you
want to use the heart rate monitor for
more than just jogging running walking
or hiking kind of like what I'm doing
right now there are actually some extra
workouts available lower on the list
including squats crunches and other
bodyweight exercises and the sensors on
the gear fit - will basically be firing
off so that it knows when it goes up or
down and registers that as a movement in
this workout it's kind of nice to have
if you want to be able to track how many
squats you've done but of course it's
not necessarily you know for anyone else
who is morning
to fitness but thankfully the gear fit
to actually is able to automatically
tell when you're doing a certain type of
activity if I did not turn on the gear
fit - to track the workout that I'm
doing right now it would be able to tell
that I'm jogging a certain distance and
I'm jogging in general and be able to
track that and put it towards the
activity that is then put into s health
and as far as the heart rate monitor
goes it is able to track a resting heart
rate every 10 minutes or so so you'll be
able to get a nice snapshot throughout
the day of what your fitness kind of
looks like but the heart rate monitor
unfortunately for workouts like this and
for more intense workouts in general
unfortunately it's not quite as accurate
now that is something that we would
expect from a finished tracker like this
that is wrist mounted but unfortunately
it is one of the less accurate ones when
compared to a chest mounted heartrate
monitor it was more than a dozen beats
per minutes off of the mark when
compared to something like a polar that
is strapped on to the sternum and
speaking of automatic tracking the gear
fit - can track sleep essentially when
there's no movement being registered on
the device it will say that you are
sleeping now these graphs that are in s
health are kind of useful to see what
your sleep cycles are but ultimately
it's just a kind of a glimpse into how
long you slept and according to the gear
fit - how efficient your sleep was but
there's one big feature that's missing
from the gear fit - that I think is
important to have for any SmartWatch and
fitness tracker the ability to have an
alarm using the vibration feedback
oh so it pretty much comes down to this
the gear fit to is a good daily activity
tracker but it's not necessarily a very
good fitness tracking solution for any
fitness enthusiasts out there who
already have wonderful working fitness
trackers for more intense workouts the
gear fit - simply not going to give you
exactly what you need to replace those
but if you just need to check how much
water or caffeine you've been in taking
what kind of sleep you've been getting
and also how much regular activity like
walking and perhaps some more cardio
based workouts you've already been doing
every day if you want to know what that
information is like than the gear fit -
can provide that especially considering
that s-health has actually grown a lot
since the original gear fit thankfully
the price of the gear fit - means that a
lot of users can get started in the
fitness world using this as a daily
activity tracker but again if you're a
fitness enthusiast you probably have
something already that you're using and
this is not going to replace it keep it
in - and row 34 even more and also more
