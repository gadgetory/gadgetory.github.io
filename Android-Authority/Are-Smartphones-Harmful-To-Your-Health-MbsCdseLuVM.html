brought to you by domain.com now there
are those people that believe that using
these things too much is bad for our
health no not that kind of danger I'm
talking about the qualified scientists
that believe that the radiation admitted
from our smartphones is causing
premature deaths a group of 200
biological and health scientists from
around the world are trying to make this
concern public knowledge and they're
calling on the UN to help them out in a
report published by Russian news
organization RT these scientists from
all different parts of the world are
advocating for the United Nations World
Health Organization and various national
governments to help develop strict
regulations concerning cell phones and
other mobile devices that create
electromagnetic fields dr. Martin Blanc
from the department of physiology and
cellular biophysics at Columbia
University warns putting it bluntly
cellphones are damaging the living cells
in our bodies and killing many of us
prematurely we have created something
that is harming us and it's getting out
of control before Edison's light bulb
there was very little electromagnetic
radiation in our environment the levels
today are very many times higher than
natural background levels and are
growing rapidly because of all the new
devices that emit this radiation now
before we move on let's talk about
electromagnetic radiation for starters
your cell phone does produce a certain
amount of radiation you can thank your
Wi-Fi Bluetooth 3G and LTE connections
for all that but radiation can be found
in all other aspects of our lives as
well radios televisions microwaves and
more the real factor here we need to
look at is the difference between
ionizing and non-ionizing radiation and
how the two types affect us differently
you see radiation that produces enough
energy to move around atoms in a
molecule but not enough to remove
electrons completely is known as non
ionizing radiation examples of non
ionizing radiation include microwaves
sound waves and even visible light just
to name a few
in contrast however ionizing radiation
does have enough energy to move around
tightly bound electrons from atoms which
in
turn creates ions this much more
powerful form of radiation encompasses
ultraviolet x-rays and yes even gamma
rays so what about our smartphones
well our smart phones produce non
ionizing radiation but at an extremely
low frequency level all the connections
going to and from your mobile device all
operate at different frequencies whether
a Wi-Fi Bluetooth or a cellular
connection frequencies can range from
700 megahertz up to 5.9 gigahertz now
the thing is even with all these
connections combined they do not even
come close to the same radio frequencies
found in x-rays and ultraviolet rays in
fact the only effects that these types
of radio frequencies have on the human
body don't have anything to do with
cancer or tumors but as everything to do
with how hot your smartphone gets an
increased amount of radio frequency
energy from smartphones can actually
cause some harm to your body by means of
tissue heating but this doesn't take
place as often as you might think
most of the energy produced by
frequencies from mobile phones is
absorbed by the skin and other
superficial tissues which results in a
negligible rise in the temperature in
the brain and throughout other portions
of the body so now is that a cause for
concern
well the w-h-o doesn't think so to date
research does not suggest any consistent
evidence of adverse health effects from
exposure to radiofrequency fields at
levels below those that cause tissue
heating further research has not been
able to provide support for a casual
relationship between exposure to
electromagnetic fields and self-reported
symptoms or quote electromagnetic
hypersensitivity now let's be clear
there may be problems with tissue
heating but below that the World Health
Organization makes very clear that they
see no evidence for short term health
effects but what about the long term
health effects well therein lies the
problem we have not had widespread cell
phone use until the last few years now
some of you are thinking Jace we've had
cell phone since the late 80s yes
but we've not had widespread use like we
do today everyone and their mother quite
literally has a cell phone nowadays so
it will take some time before we can get
comprehensive research on the long-term
effects of these devices now far be it
from me or anyone at Android authority
to question the credibility of these
scientists I am not qualified to do so
but I do have to ask a simple question
it could be interpreted that they are
putting the cell phone as the primary
culprit of this more damaging radiation
and the science as it currently stands
does not support that so why would they
bring that up well if you're talking
about x-rays something that people only
periodically interact with you don't get
much attention but if you say their cell
phone is harming them you get everyone's
attention now I really encourage you to
read the article that today's show is
based on by our own Android authority
staffer Jimmy westenberg he did a great
job he did lots of research thank you
for all the help Jimmy let me know what
you think in the comments below so if
the Android army would be willing to
help me out I'd be grateful you can go
to my website Undivided company.com
that's what I do when I'm not doing
videos like this the site is new it
doesn't have enough content yet but I
want to hear what you think I worked
really hard at trying to find the right
name and making sure that I could get
the dot-com cuz the dot-com matters why
because no domain name extension tells
your story with the same level of trust
as a.com or.net domain name dot-com and
dotnet domain name extensions and Jack
credibility into your online presence
and who doesn't want more credibility
you can save 15% on domain name and web
hosting when you use our coupon code

forget 15% off when you use our coupon
code Android when you think domain names
think domain.com so I noticed that some
of you noticed that in yesterday's show
I went from pale to looking like Rudolph
and that's because I shot the first part
before I went fishing in the last part
after I went fishing hence the little
bit of sunburn well maybe a lot of
sunburn you can see the difference here
for my shirt ended it's done it hurt but
it was okay it was all worth it because
I've got a nice big pike brought it home
and fed my family with it it's great
stuff if you got pics of fish that you
caught love to see them in the comments
below or on Google+ you don't wanna
forget about my brothers in Android
always working hard to be your source
for all things
Android I shall see you later on this
week on Android QA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
