computer motorola Apple and HP have all
tried and failed but Samson thinks the
time is right for another attempt is
near a founder Authority bringing your
Samsung Dex review remember the laptop
what about Apple's AirPlay and how it
was heralded as the future of smartphone
computing then last year came HP's elite
x3 desktop Samsung Dex attempts to fix
the biggest issues of these by baking
Dex more than just a smartphone
mirroring experience Dex works by
docking your Galaxy s8 into the deck
station which then connects to you on at
OVH TMI for You doc your Galaxy s8 for
the first time however you need to
connect to Samsung fast charger and
connect your keyboard and mouse via
bluetooth the top of the deck station
slides down and acts like a fan to
prevent overheating when you're using
Dex
good as it is however Dex isn't perfect
as your smartphone displays disabled
when docked which means you have to rely
on the keyboard and mouse for all inputs
in its current form Dex is a little raw
as there's only a handful of optimized
apps and Microsoft Office is the
highlight of these of course you can
open all of the apps that exist on your
Android phone and access the entire
Google Play catalogue and for the most
part the apps Alworth is expected Dex
adds the ability to resize windows and
while some don't most apps do support it
some apps have been optimized either
directly for decks or natively in the
Android app to offer responsive designs
or desktop experiences but for most
you'll be using the same app that you
find on your phone the browsing
experience is seemingly on par with
Google Chrome with Samsung's own browser
optimized a little better for Dex than
Google's however there's a touchy
latency when scrolling browser windows
and this also persists when typing in
microsoft word when moving away from
your doctor phones Dex follows the same
security preferences you set up on the
phone so if you're using iris
recognition with a finger put an
alternative and pin backup like myself
you'll be able to use any of the three
options to unlock your phone
using the fingerprint sensor can be
awkward as you have to reach around the
back of the phone while using iris
recognition may mean you need to tilt
the phone so it's in the right position
so should you buy Dex honestly for most
people it won't be worth it if you're
someone who prefers a mobility overall
performance then it could be good for
you at a cost of one hundred and fifty
dollars plus all peripherals it's
definitely not cheap and considering the
cost of the galaxy si
most people will be better off buying a
powerful laptop and mid-range smartphone
for the same cost
all that said Dex is a rather cool
accessory and shows just how close we've
come to perfecting the smartphone as a
PC experience it's not perfect and it
remains to be seen whether it will be
widely adopted but it definitely has the
potential to be useful to use Dex you'll
need the galaxy si so check out our full
Galaxy s8 review and let us know if you
think the Dex experience is worth buying
give us a thumbs up if you like this
video don't forget to subscribe and head
over to android authority calm for a lot
more and galaxy si see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
