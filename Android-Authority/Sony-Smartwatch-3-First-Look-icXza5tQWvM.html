authority what's going on everybody and
here we are with the first look at the
new Sony SmartWatch Smart Watch three to
go in line with the z3 line of phones
and tablets now what we're looking at
here is a change in the Sony sort of
architecture when it comes to what
they're thinking of with their Smart
Watch and it's the fact that they've
gone from their operating system and
have adopted Android wear now while we
do have Android wear on the innards of
this particular SmartWatch we do have
the same type of design when it comes to
the rest on the outside and in that case
we have the silicone watch band that's
right here with a pretty simple clasp
that is available here and it's very
similar it's a very similar one to other
smartwatches that we've seen already
easily adjustable and then it just kind
of slashes onto your wrist like that and
also the units of the actual watch
itself is removable from the actual dam
so you can change it pretty easily with
other silicone bands available for this
particular SmartWatch now we do have the
Android wear demo that's available here
but we do get a bit of a look at what it
would look like with the particular
SmartWatch faces that Sony would be
putting into severe swamp watch 3 but
we're going through the actual cards
right here and it's pretty much the same
Android wear that you would remember but
it will come with some extra
applications in particular we're going
to be taking a look at one called the
life log which is Sony's way of showing
you exactly the kind of fitness tracking
that they would have for you on it
it's been available in previous
iterations of so many wearables and will
be available for it this particular
wearable as well even on top of Android
wear now one thing that do see over here
that is interesting is a button but it's
not necessarily a button that is on the
actual unit itself if I remove the band
right here the button goes within we
have a small area right here that has
the actual tiny tiny button that is
pressed by this larger apparatus
but we put the band's back on there and
now we have the actual button available
right here so that is another trait of
the SmartWatch especially the SmartWatch
3 that we have here that it does come
with the button it's a little bit more
unorthodox and it doesn't mean you have
to use this particular band in order to
take advantage audience but as far as
the enhancements go we do have Android
wear here but as we're seeing with other
smartwatches already available by other
companies you're going to get some
enhancements on top of it and I already
told you about life log but we are also
going to be getting a couple of
enhancements including a remote shutter
that is available so you will be able to
trigger the camera on your actual phone
by using the SmartWatch right here but
obviously I won't really be able to show
you that because we have the Android
wear demo still showing on here right
now and finally here as I'm wrapping up
I'll give you a quick rundown on the
actual specifications what we have here
on the screen is a one point six inch
transflective display that comes in at
320 by 321 Durney that all is a
quad-core arm a7 comes in a 1.2
gigahertz and has 512 megabytes of RAM
along with horrid gigabytes
installed inside for storage now from
there we have the usual microphone for
voice inputs for voicing tation using
the answer where software and also this
inspire watchman has the ip68
certification that we will come to
expect already from Sony with all of
their devices anyway so that is just a
look at the Sony SmartWatch 3 it's a new
version of sony smartwatch line that now
takes on Android wear and what do you
think it looks pretty good and it
provides a little bit of a different
feel and Sonia's own particular style
when it comes to the SmartWatch game
here right now so keep it tuned here for
Android the two android authority for
all of the best coverage of Sony's
launches here at IFA in Berlin 2014
we're at the launch of them bringing you
some live coverage and we won't have a
closer look at these devices in about a
day or so when we have a much more
controlled environment to be able to
even more about these devices but for
now we're giving you the best look we
can here on the show floor so remember
to stay tuned to Android authority
because we are your source for all
things IVA 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
