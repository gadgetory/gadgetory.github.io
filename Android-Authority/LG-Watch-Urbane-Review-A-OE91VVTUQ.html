smartwatches were pretty impressive
setting some very high expectations for
what's to come here in 2015
LG is looking to set the tone with their
latest Android wear SmartWatch but is it
good enough to earn a spot on your wrist
this is the LG watch urbane what's going
on guys lon here from Android authority
and LG is no stranger to the SmartWatch
game at this point and judging by the
design of the watch urbane it certainly
shows the urbane is classy elegant and
beautiful and isn't just a good-looking
Android wear SmartWatch but a
good-looking watch in general most
importantly the circular design and
smaller details like the power button
disguised as a winder and thick watch
lugs make the urbane look like a normal
watch the untrained eye the body is
constructed out of polished stainless
steel giving off a luxurious appearance
and it has a nice substantial feel
without being overly heavy it could be
prone to scratches because after all it
is made of stainless steel but so far my
unit has held up just fine the stainless
steel does however collect fingerprints
and smudges fairly easily but that's a
relatively minor gripe and since it's
such a small object it takes no time to
clean at all the band is made of genuine
leather with real stitching along the
sides and the leather that LG likes to
use is very stiff and rigid that feels
similar to a leather strap you may find
on a woman's handbag depending on who
you are you may or may not like this
particular style of leather but I
personally don't mind it because it
holds up better against everyday wear
and tear and it still feels very
comfortable on the wrist the good news
is the urbane takes a standard 22
millimeter band so if you really don't
like the default strap at all or just
want to change things up you can easily
swap it out for something different the
overall size of the watch will be more
or less subjective this is one of the
larger Android wear smartwatches
available but if you're used to large
watches than the urbane will feel pretty
normal if you're used to something
smaller this watch could take some
getting used to but it definitely isn't
a bulky watch by any stretch of the
imagination
the display is a one-point three inch P
OLED screen made of Gorilla Glue
last three so it should hold up well
against scratches and for some added
protection the glass is slightly
recessed into the body of the watch to
help against the accidental bumps just
as you might expect the plastic OLED
screen provides for some very deep
blacks saturated colors high contrast
ratios and it's easy to see outdoors at
maximum brightness on a smartwatch OLED
just makes sense not only due to its
battery saving properties but also
because it really makes the elements of
Android wear pop the deep blacks and
high contrast also make darker colored
watch faces look fantastic
and at 245 PPI graphics look good and
text is reasonably sharp and easy to
read some may find the 1.3 inch screen
size to be a little on the small side
but it's still very easy to use and for
the most part it's a very good-looking
screen performance is also quite good
despite getting a little long in the
tooth the snap during four hundred and
half a gig of ram is more than enough to
power Android wear and day-to-day
performance has been very smooth
animations are nice and clean without
any stutter and swiping between cards
notifications opening up apps and
changing watch faces has all been a
great experience that's on par with
other Android wear watches so there
isn't much to complain about here the
rest of the hardware is pretty standard
for an Android wear watch the urbane
supports Wi-Fi Bluetooth and four
gigabytes of internal storage that can
be found on board along with the usual
sensors like accelerometer and compass
the watch is also ip67 certified so it's
dust and water resistant and the
obligatory heart rate monitor for
monitoring your heart rate obviously
sits squarely along the back at this
point you may have realized that the
urbane shares a lot in common with last
year's G watch are from the display
internals and even the same 410 milliamp
hour battery so you can expect identical
battery life performance of at least two
days even with always screen on enabled
thanks to that P OLED screen two days is
fairly standard expectations for an
Android wear watch so for previous or
current Android wear users the battery
life shouldn't be much of an issue the
watch urbane is the first Android wear
smartwatches shipped with the latest 5.1
and the core Android wear experience is
still pretty much the same as before
with actionable notifications and Google
now cards showing up right on your wrist
along with customizable watch faces but
the update introduces some new key
features always screen on mode is now
available for apps so for example if
you're looking at a checklist or map and
the screen happens to time out you'll
still be able to see in a black and
white format to save battery similar to
how watch faces appear when the screen
is in its dim State one of the best
features this update brings is Wi-Fi
support meaning the watch doesn't always
have to be connected to your phone via
bluetooth in order to receive
notifications as long as the watch is
connected to a Wi-Fi network and your
phone has a data connection
notifications will still sync to the
watch this gives Android wear more
independence and you a little more
freedom away from your smartphone
notifications can also be scrolled
through now with wrist gestures by
simply flicking the wrist it can really
come in handy if your other hand is full
or you just don't want to touch your
watch but it only works if the watch is
upright so don't expect to be able to
scroll through notifications with your
wrist while laying down in bed to
increase the level of security Google
added a new feature called screen lock
which is essentially pattern lock ported
over to Android wear this can be enabled
manually or set to lock automatically
anytime you take your watch off your
wrist
to prevent others from snooping in on
your notifications finally for a little
bit of fun Google has made it very easy
to send emojis just by drawing them on
the screen besides the addition of new
features the UI has undergone some
slight cosmetic changes tapping on the
screen swiping to the left or long
pressing the power button now brings up
a separate column for apps start
contacts and these standards speak now
screen this not only makes it easier and
quicker to find what you need but also
reduces the amount of vertical scrolling
that made previous builds of Android
wear a little more cumbersome to use the
new features and UI enhancements bring
about some very welcome changes to
Android wear and for the time being it
is unique to the watch urbane but if
you're patient enough the 5.1 update
will be making its way to other Android
wear watches very soon
the watch urbane is available now in
stainless steel and rose gold for three
$49.99 on the google store making it one
of the most expensive Android wear
watches to date whether it's worth or
not will depend on how much you value
the luxury appeal and aesthetics of the
urbane because everything else this
watch offers can be found on pretty much
every other Android wear watch for a
lesser price it is an LG fault though
there's very little OMS can do to
differentiate their Android wear
smartwatches outside of the physical
hardware but if we were to judge solely
on the design then LG's got a clear
winner on their hands both as a standard
timepiece and a fashion item as always
