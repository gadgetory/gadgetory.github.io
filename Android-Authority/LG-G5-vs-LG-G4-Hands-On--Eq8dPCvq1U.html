authority and we're taking a quick look
of the LG g5 versus last year's LG g4
and the easiest place to start with
these two devices is obviously the
design because this is a very big design
shift for LG this year so with the g5
you're getting an all-metal phone but
not only is it completely made of metal
it's also modular the bottom of the
phone comes out and you can still remove
and replace the battery just like before
and still maintain microSD card
expansion with the g4 you have a plastic
design or a combination of plastic and
leather if you offer the leather back
and it definitely doesn't feel quite as
premium as the g5 but the design is
definitely a little bit more unique and
stands out a little bit better whereas
the g5 kind of took a step back in terms
of design and focused more on hardware
usability and the uniqueness of this
modular design the screen on the g5 also
went down from a 5.5 inch screen on the
g4 to a 5.3 inch screen but it still
maintains the same quad HD resolution
and the other big difference with this
screen here is that it's an always-on
display whereas with the g4 you didn't
really get that feature so what the
always-on display you're going to be
able to see your notifications and other
useful tidbits of information on this
particular screen another difference
that you're going to notice is on the
back you'll notice that the power button
is still there on the back of the g5 but
the volume rockers have been moved to
the side whereas on the g4 you have
pretty much every single key at the
reach of your index finger on the
backside of the phone the camera is also
a pretty big difference you have a dual
camera set up on the g5 which is very
similar to the v10 but it's on the back
instead of the front and on the g4 you
just have the single 16 megapixel camera
the camera on the g5 is also 16
megapixels as well but you also have the
wide-angle lens at 8 megapixels and this
basically allow
you to switch back and forth between the
two in the UI so you can go from
wide-angle shots or standard angle shots
which is a really cool feature that only
the g5 can do right now but both of
these phones have pretty awesome cameras
built in so you're gonna be able to get
quality photos from either one of these
devices as far as specs go you're
dealing with the very powerful
Snapdragon 820 on the g5 and four
gigabytes of RAM and on the g4 you have
the Snapdragon 808 and three gigabytes
of RAM internally there's 32 gigs of
on-board storage and microSD card
expansion on both and as far as the
battery goes you have a 2800 milliamp
hour battery on the g5 which is slightly
smaller than a 3000 milliamp hour
battery on the g4 but you do have USB
type-c on a g5 whereas the g4 has the
regular standard micro USB the last big
difference that you're going to notice
with these two phones is in the software
so the g5 is running on Android
marshmallow with a much cleaner version
of LG's UI so the first thing you notice
that there's no app drawer but there's
also less features as well so there's no
queue slide or queue memo or anything of
that nature
and they're really focusing on just
making the experience as clean and as
streamlined as possible whereas with the
g4 you're getting a lot more bloatware
and a lot more features which may or may
not be all that useful and other
software is obviously not up to date
with the current Android marshmallow so
the g5 definitely is taking a lot of
steps in the right direction as far as
the software is concerned but that's
going to do it for this quick comparison
of the LG g5 versus the LG g4 hopefully
you guys enjoyed it and stay tuned to
