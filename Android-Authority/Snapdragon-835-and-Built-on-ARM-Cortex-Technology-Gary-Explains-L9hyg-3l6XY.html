authority now the details of the new
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 have recently
been released and we can see that the
nude Snapdragon will be using a semi
custom arm core called the cryo 280 now
it's built using a new license agreement
with arm who built on cortex technology
so what is built on cortex technology
why our qualcomm using it and what does
it mean for arm well let me explain okay
first just a quick refresher up internal
arm of had two types of major license
one is the cortex license which allows a
company like Qualcomm or Samsung or
mediatek to take arms IPD little
property that means a CPU core and use
it unchanged unmodified as is in a
product so they might take the cortex a
72 core and put it inside of a CPU now
they also had a thing called the
architectural license which allows a
company like a cork on Samsung and Apple
to design arm compatible calls using
their own engineers a complete cleanroom
design that has no reference to existing
cortex designs from arm now Qualcomm has
an architectural license and they used
it in the Snapdragon 820 and the a21
over the Snapdragon 835 it's taken a
different route and that's to use a new
license agreement from arm called built
on cortex technology and what that
basically allow someone like Qualcomm to
do is to take an arm core maybe the Kois
a 73 and then modify it slightly change
it tweak it to their own particular
needs and then brand it under their own
branding this case the cryo branding but
just recognize long the way that's built
on cortex ARM Cortex technology now what
is this kind of tweaking that they can
do well a CPU is obviously a very
complicated piece over
and there are lots of things going on on
the inside there are lots of bits that
make up the CPOE including things like a
branch predictor for out of order
instruction execution is a thing called
an instruction window and we take the
instruction window as an example that
basically means how many instructions
ahead the CPU can look to find another
instruction that it can execute in
parallel with which is OK which only
affect other instructions that are going
on and the bigger that instruction
window the more further ahead you can
look to find instructions to execute in
parallel but obviously the bigger that
window the more resources the CPU needs
in terms of internal buffering in terms
of copies of the register banks in terms
of just remembering the state of
everything that's going on it needs more
and more mean more silicon and silicon
is costly and it also means more power
and it also means that actually the
frequency targets might not be met
because it's difficult to juggle all
that stuff going on and still hammer on
at 22.5 2.8 gigahertz so basically when
arm design a CPU they they make a
decision about the frequency about the
silicon size about the things that the
instruction windows the branch
predictors a whole bunch of other things
and say this is our target this is what
we're going to make and this is what
we're going to do now then someone like
Qualcomm Cumberland says that's
brilliant we like that but we want to
tweak it so that maybe the instruction
window is bigger maybe there's some
things we can do is a branch
particularly some things we can do with
other parts of internals but don't break
the design they don't change the design
but they just change it in a subtle way
tweaking kind of adding on bits because
they might say well actually we prepared
to pay for more silicon we've repaired
to spend the time to get that frequency
target just right even though we've made
it a more complicated CPU so the way it
works is that Qualcomm will take a core
design from our minute it to engineers
will then tweak it in partnership with
arm to produce the CPU that they want
and then they can brand it under their
own branding so up until now when a chip
maker took a core from arm
it had three ways in which you kind of
integrate that core one is of course it
could choose how many cores it wanted to
use and in what combination
so maybe they wanted a quad core or a
hexa core an opportunity they wanted to
combine it with some big calls and some
little cores and they had that choice to
make although Tiffany's and Qualcomm
have chips just like that in their 400
series in their 600 series
they've taken arms IP and they've built
six core chips and quad core chips and
they've built them however they wanted
to
the second thing of course the chip
maker can choose is the physical layout
they can choose to have it on 28
nanometers or 10 nanometers or 16
nanometers and that has repercussions in
terms of development course in terms of
manufacturing course in terms of die
size and the third thing they could do
up until now is they can mix and match
which components they added a twin so if
there were an all arm shop maybe like
mediatek then they could take the GPU
from arm them are marley they could take
the interconnect bits of silicon they
can take the display driver they could
take the video chip and they can combine
them all together but in Qualcomm's case
they combined it with their own GPU for
example so and their own modems and
their own DSP so we know that Cole Cobb
are already mix and matching so that's
three different things so they could
choose how many cores they could choose
the physical attributes of it and they
could choose what they combined it with
now there's a fourth dimension our
fourth axes we've built on quality
technology which means they can take the
CPU core and they can also tweak that
they can change it they can fiddle with
some of the parameters to get a
different performance characteristics
according to the needs of that
particular OAM and the great thing is
that those tweaks those changes remain
only for that company they don't get
them passed on to Samsung or to mediatek
they just belong to Qualcomm and it's
its own special variant of that call
they took from arm as what we're seeing
with the Snapdragon 835 is you've got
Qualcomm's own technology like it's a
GPU DSPs and it's image processors and
then they've taken a CPU core from arm
and they've modified it to be their own
special custom variation of that core
which will only be inside of the
Snapdragon chips now that is then called
the cryo 280 and my thinking is its cryo
- second generation cryo and it's got
eight core so it's acro 280 and maybe
we'll see a cryo -
dear crow 240 and maybe next year we
might see the cryo 340 or the cryo 380
this is just speculation on my path but
that seems to be where the naming is
coming from so the reason quorum of
doing this cause it's because it's
cheaper for them armed all the heavy
lifting they get a CPU design up and
running and then Qualcomm the engineers
take that off them and then they can
modify it to bring it up to their
particular set of specifications and it
also means it's quicker because I'm
already developing chips they've just
announced the a 73 that's probably what
this one is based on and they're sure
they've got other chips in the pipeline
they're working on now and they don't
need to call currently to have engineers
doing that am i doing that phone and
they can use their engineers to
concentrate on the DSPs and the ISPs and
the interconnects and the GPU and
tweaking the CPU core and then combining
it all together to be the system on a
chip that is the Snapdragon 835 so the
result should be a higher performance
and highly efficient system on a chip
because you've got core columns GPU
technology which is excellent you've got
their other stuff like their DSPs and
their image processors and then you've
got this custom version of a cortex core
and then that should really be a great
chip for 2017 and I'm really looking
forward to seeing it in some devices and
seeing what this chip can do well my
name is Gary sim from Andrea Ora tea I
hope you enjoyed this video if you did
please do give it a thumbs up I'd also
like to give a big shout out to Robert
