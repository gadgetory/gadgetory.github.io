handy the Android authority app guy and
in this short video we're going to show
you how to install Adobe Flash under
Android 4.4 kitkat device step one on
your KitKat device you'll need to allow
for the installation of apks from
unknown sources to do that enter your
settings navigate to security and then
tick the box that says unknown sources
this will allow you to sideload
applications step two in the Google Play
Store you'll need to install Dolphin
Browser step 3 check and make sure
dolphin jetpack is installed by default
it should be if it isn't you'll need to
grab that you should be able to install
and enable it within the application it
is very important that Dalton Browser be
installed and the dolphin jetpack be
enabled and step 5 go download the
hacked Adobe Flash apk we recommend you
check out the XDA threat to get the
download link but you can also find it
in the written companion in the video
description
step 6 use the notification panel to
install the apk if you manage to lose it
you can always use a file manager to
navigate to your download folder find
the adobe flash APK and install it once
that's done open Dolphin Browser open
the menu and then the settings navigate
to web content and ensure that Flash
content is enabled if not enable it it
should be enabled by default
finally step 8 open up the settings
navigate to security and uncheck the
unknown sources box there's really no
reason to leave this on and it could
present a security risk if you do so so
go ahead and turn it off and that's
really it folks it seems like there are
a lot of steps but it really isn't that
difficult it does not require root
access and users @xd a report that it
works on practically every device that
runs Android 4.4 including devices
running stock roms and custom roms the
only downside is you have to use Dolphin
Browser for now but eventually that
should be fixed once again I'm Joe Andy
