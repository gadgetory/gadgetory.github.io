what's going on everybody and here we
are spending some quality time with the
LG g5 we wanted to bring you a look at
the software because over the years LG
has been trying to streamline what we
used to think was a pretty bloated
operating system but this year they have
taken some really big strides in order
to create this a new version of the LG
UI that is actually probably the leanest
that we have ever seen the first thing
we're going to start out with before we
even get into the elements of the home
screens and any of the menus underneath
is the fact that we have the always-on
display now the first thing I'll show
you there is that if you go into the
settings and you head down to the
display you'll see the always-on display
option right here and you can change it
up so that it shows only that area with
the time and some of the icons for your
notifications or you can actually have
it show a signature now the thing about
the signature however is that it only
takes up so much and it kind of doesn't
really have too many characters on there
so even the default signature has a
couple of letters grayed out and it
doesn't even show up in the actual area
right there so we probably will tend to
leave it at the time so that we can
always see that and ultimately it is a
time display as you can see very lightly
in the sunlight right here and it is
always going to be on this IPS display
does have this area always on equal when
you have the phone unlock and it's
always going to show so you'll have an
easy access to seeing the time of course
you can turn off the always-on display
if it's not something that you want to
have on every time you lock the phone
but now we can talk about the rest of
the interface and the operating system
as we unlock the device and of course
you still have access and the ability to
use the knock-on feature to double tap
the display and turn on the display and
unlock the device from there and of
course you always have the NOC code as
well which we have seen in previous
versions of the LG G line already going
through the menus real quick we do have
all of the different settings right here
everything from the smart cleaning which
is still available so that you can see
what it is that you can remove from the
device of things are starting to get a
little bit too saturated and we already
showed you the always-on display but now
we can take a look at the actual
interface and heading over to the home
screens the first thing you guys are
probably going to notice
and I can hear some of you to get your
pitchforks out already it's that there's
no app drawer that's right LG is taking
a pretty bold stance this year with the
g5 in stating that they wanted to create
the simplest type of interface and make
it as intuitive as possible so there is
no app drawer here
that you need to fiddle with including
the fact that when you're holding an
icon you don't need to have the
uninstall or remove options on the top
which they felt was a little bit
convoluted but you are going to have to
contend with the fact that you put all
of your icons on the home screens and
you're going to have to create folders
as you can see right here that will
house all of your different applications
so you can actually categorize them and
clean up the interface of course we
understand that you would be able to put
a custom launcher on here and that is of
course the power of Android but no a.ab
drawer will not be available on here
anymore but actually it doesn't just
stop at the app drawer there are plenty
of features from previous LG phones that
actually aren't making it onto the g5 if
I bring down the notification drop-down
you'll notice here that there are no
qslide applications and if you don't
remember qslide were those little
applications that overlaid on top of
your current workspace so you have tools
that were small enough to not take up
the whole screen but you are still able
to get some multitasking done that way
if I head over to the extra features on
here they don't show up in this area so
no more qslide applications on the g5
there's also a lack of dual window on
here now if we go into the recent apps
screen like we're seeing right here we
can pin certain applications so they
aren't going to be cleared out but even
then we don't have the dual window
functionality for even better
multitasking like that so things are
really getting much more simplistic on
the LG g5 and if we go through if you go
through the various options in the home
screen for the home screen right now in
these settings we can turn on the smart
bulletin which I'm sure it's familiar
from the LG g4 where we have a number of
these different applications that are
available but other than that a lot of
the things that may have been familiar
from the LG g4 are not on here anymore
we know that for a lot of you guys out
there
the lack of an app drawer is going to be
maybe somewhat of a deal-breaker I know
some people really want their app
drawers on here but after a lot of
market research and whatnot LG did say
that this is a more simplistic interface
that a lot of people were wanting
to have in their smartphones moving
forward so it kind of speaks to what LG
is trying to do with the g5 not only
with this new dual camera setup but also
with the modular design by being able to
remove this bottom portion and actually
add on some new features on the g5 that
LG is really trying to think outside of
the box and do things that are different
compared to everybody else out in the
market right now and we'll see how you
guys respond once we have our hands on a
review unit and we actually put this
phone through its paces and see if all
of these changes are actually for the
better or perhaps maybe for the worse so
keep it tuned to Android thority for
that and even more about the LG g5 and

coverage here at MWC 2016 because we are
