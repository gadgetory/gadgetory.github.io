Hindy from android authority com and yes
it's free stuff day before we begin this
week's contest let's take a quick look
back at last week's contest the winner
of last week's contest is a one lar from
India if you're watching but
congratulations on your brand new Nexus
6 and I'm sincerely sorry if I
mispronounced your name and as you've
likely guessed by now this week we are
giving away another 32 gigabyte Nexus 6
the Nexus 6 has been the subject of
intense debate since it was announced
and will likely continue to be so after
it is released we don't have a review
yet but we do have a plethora of
articles where the team and I talked
about it so if you want to know more
we'll have those videos linked up in the
video description below and on the
contest page I bet you're wondering how
to enter and I promise it's pretty easy
this week the first thing you'll need to
do is head on over to our contest page
there you'll see our rafflecopter widget
using the widget simply ask for your
first entry into this contest there are
no hoops to jump through just ask and
your enter to win if you want a couple
of bonus entries we can help you out
with that if you circle us on google+
you will get one additional bonus entry
simply use the link head to the Google+
site and give us a circle then come back
and tell the rafflecopter widget your
Google+ user name and you'll get an
additional bonus entry the other bonus
entry is if you follow us on Pinterest
just like Google+ head to our Pinterest
page using the link provided give us a
follow and then come back until the
rafflecopter widget your Pinterest
username and you'll get another bonus
entry as usual you can get several more
bonus entries if you so choose once you
enter will give you a unique URL share
that URL with your friends on social
media and for each one of them who
enters using your special link you'll
get an additional bonus entry with a
maximum of 10 bonus entries available
and that's really it folks it takes
about as much time to do as it took me
to explain and you'll be entered to win
a brand new Nexus 6
