android authority in this episode I'm
going to compare two of today's popular
Android phones the Sony Xperia T known
as the bond phone and the LG nexus 4
known as the google phone both are
Android yet each one offers a user
experience that may or may not click
with you as to which one is right for
you hold off your decision until the end
of this comparison these two phones are
very portable and pocketable they're not
exactly small enough to be held firmly
inside a loose fist but they're small
enough to be held firmly in one hand the
first thing I noticed about these two
phones is the simplicity and minimalism
of their front panels there are no
physical buttons or switches on the
front not even capacitive buttons all
navigation control is done through
on-screen buttons consistent with the
aesthetics of the previous nexuses the
nexus 4 keeps the plain and simple
design of its front no logo of no word
mark unlike I'm the Xperia T which has
the Sony and exterior logos up front and
in silver don't get me wrong I find both
designs pleasant and easy on the eyes
abandoning the curved screen design of
the two previous google phones the nexus
4 has an all flat surface for its front
the Xperia T's front is also flat with
edges beveling towards its frame and
sides viewed from the sides big spirity
screen looks raised from its chassis
between the two I find the location of
the Nexus 4's ports and buttons much
friendlier the headphone jack is at the
top side of both phones it's a great
location for users like me who
frequently use headphones to listen to
music while keeping the phone inside the
pocket on the left side of the nexus 4
its volume rocker and sim tray while
that on the Xperia T is its micro USB
port at the bottom side of the Xperia T
is only the hole for the full link on
the Nexus 4 others the microUSB port in
between two screws which I find truly a
distraction to the Nexus 4's beautiful
sides on the right side of the Nexus 4
is just the power button but on the
Xperia T there are ports and several
buttons here compartment from micro SD
and micro sim cards power
button volume rocker and dedicated
shutter button it's a busy side yet the
most disappointing thing about this is
that on the Xperia T the buttons are
located along the lower half of its side
I find it inconvenient since I'm a
right-handed person and this part of my
hand presses on the buttons I find them
hard to reach with my thumb too though
with left-handed use they're easily
accessible but the disappointed story
takes a different course when the phone
is used in landscape mode especially
with the intention of using the camera
these buttons then become conveniently
and excessively located let's now check
the back side of these phones and see
what charms they hold first of all these
back panels are non removable so there's
no way that users can replace the back
plates or the batteries as far as design
is concerned the words of the day are
twinkle and sparkle the Xperia T soft
touch rubber bag is B speckled with
glitter dust these are not visible from
afar but on closer view you can see them
the Nexus 4 in contrast is more
glamorous with its use of twinkle and
sparkle underneath this thin layer of
scratch proof glass or crystal designs
that twinkle and sparkle when viewed
from certain angles these two logos also
appear to float in the air when viewed
from an angle I personally find such
design and necessary but glamorous and
interesting nevertheless like it's front
the back of the Nexus 4 is flat I find
the curved back of the Xperia team much
better because it makes the phone feel
like it's hugging my hand and I hold it
these phones have crisp high-definition
displays and snappy touch screens the
nexus 4 uses a 4.7 inch true HD IPS plus
screen while the Xperia T uses a 4-point
55 inch TFT screen colors are bright and
vibrant on the Xperia T especially with
its use of sony Mobile BRAVIA Engine
technology I find the more realistic
slightly subdued and more natural color
on the Nexus 4 more pleasing to my eyes
powering these bones are qualcomm
chipsets pod core Snapdragon apq8064
with 1.5 gigahertz great CPU on the
Nexus 4 and dual core Snapdragon MSM
8260 a with 1.5
herts crate CPU on the Xperia T it's
easy to figure out which phone offers a
smoother experience the Nexus 4 of
course once a day in the processing
power arena Xperia T lags and stutters a
bit when scrolling home screens and web
pages launching apps are loading HD
photos HD games however run smoothly on
both phones even on the Xperia T the
nexus 4 owes its smooth performance to
its powerful hardware and Android 4.2
jellybean it's pure and unadulterated
Google Android the Xperia T meanwhile is
still on android 4.0 ice cream sandwich
with a sony timescape user interface
sony is reportedly releasing jellybean
for it sometime next year for photo and
video capture the camera differences are
rather huge on the Nexus 4 you get a
measly 8 megapixels compared to 13
megapixels on the Xperia T which also
uses a sony exmor r sensor both cameras
are snappy and responsive to say the
least and bright environments the Xperia
T produces vivid and vibrant photos
while the Nexus 4 outputs more realistic
and subdued colors and low-light
conditions the Xperia T is capable of
brighter and less noisy images
both phones can record 1080p full HD
videos but you'll need to have stable
hands or else your video will turn out
shaky the Xperia T claims to have image
stabilization but in my experience it
certainly is lacking or doesn't work
well if at all media playback though is
quite a joy on these two phones both can
play full HD videos without as much as
poss some quality and both phones is
okay too plus you can adjust the sound
levels through equalizer presets a
multiband equalizer and other sound
enhancement folders and effects just
avoid placing the Nexus 4 on its back
when playing sound because the audio
tends to get muffled amidst all the
power eating activities that can be done
on these two phones the nexus 4 seems to
offer better battery life with its 2100
mah lithium-polymer battery with 15
hours of talktime on 3G the Xperia T has
an 18 50 mah lithium-ion battery with
seven hours of talktime on 3G lastly
storage if you're going to keep a lot of
photo video and music files on your
phone stay clear of the Nexus 4 and it's
8 or 16 gigabyte internal storage it
doesn't have micro SD storage expansion
either the Xperia T offers better
options for storage with 16 gigabytes of
inbuilt storage plus the microSD card
slot for up to thirty two gigabytes more
storage in some I'm all for the nexus 4
especially if I'm more concerned about
processing power than about storage it
doesn't have its 13 megapixel camera
like the Xperia T does but for casual
and occasional photography or video
capture 8 megapixels is actually more
than enough for me the google phone is
also first in line for android upgrades
plus it gives me longer battery life
than the Xperia T does and as a bonus I
got a really fancy and pretty phone back
with sparkling crystals and floating
logos which of these two phones do you
like best and by leave a comment and let
