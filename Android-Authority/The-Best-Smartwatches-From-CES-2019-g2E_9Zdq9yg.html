Android Authority and we're here at
another day at CES 2019 we're starting
to round up all the best technology we
can find and I've talked about
smartwatches and fitness trackers a lot
on this channel so let's round up the
best ones from the show one of the best
smartwatches announced at CES 2019 is
from the fashion company Kate Spade so
this company is owned by fossil and they
make a ton of smartwatches and they just
released a new one called the Kate Spade
scallop SmartWatch - that's kind of a
confusing name but it's a really nice
SmartWatch it's pretty you don't have to
sacrifice aesthetics for features this
time around either it has a built-in GPS
a heart rate sensor and an NFC chip so
you can use it for Google pay so the
next watch is on our list are the
whiffing move and where things move ECG
it's this watch right here it's not
actually that smart but it does have
some really cool health features built
in the more expensive one it's 130 bucks
and it has a built-in electrocardiogram
so if you frequent the doctor for health
issues or something this might be a good
option to save you some more money in
the long run next up on our list is the
matrix power watch - now you may not
have heard of matrix industries before
but they're actually doing some awesome
things in the SmartWatch space their new
power watch - actually runs off your
body heat and solar energy and so it
should never run out of charge it even
has a built-in GPS and heart rate sensor
so you're not really missing out on
anything if you're into Fitness
technology you'll really like this next
option Garmin is launching its
vivoactive 3 music on Verizon's network
this year and it's going to be
compatible with Verizon's 4G LTE network
it also has some really cool built-in
safety features so if you go out on a
run at night or if you know anybody who
frequents night runs it's you can feel a
little bit safer knowing that the watch
will always have you connected to a 4G
network so mahboy also released two new
wear west watches this year at CES the
tick watch e 2 and s 2 they're meant to
be affordable kind of entry-level
smartwatches for people who don't have
you know four hundred dollars to spend
they have built-in GPS and a heart rate
sensor however they don't have NFC which
is pretty disappointing to be honest
next up is a SmartWatch called the cool
pad
I know and if you haven't guessed by now
this one's for kids it's so parents can
keep an eye on their children and know
that they're safe at all times if your
kids are wearing the Smart Watch you can
actually track their location and know
where they are at all times also you can
set up safe zones so if they wander out
of those safe zones you'll get alerted
right away you can also communicate with
them through voice or text if they're
wearing their SmartWatch so to round up
our list we're gonna go back to fossil
and like I said before they release a
ton of smartwatches and there are quite
a few new ones at the show fossil just
released a new Skagen foster two case
with pretty diamonds around the bezel
there's a new Michael Kors watch for the
first time in a couple years and fossil
also released two new updates to its
Carley and nutria hybrid watches so
that's it for our list those are the
best smartwatches we've seen at CES 2019
and I want to know what you think please
leave a comment down below if you loved
or hated any of these watches on the
list and be sure to give this video

you haven't already and be sure to stay
