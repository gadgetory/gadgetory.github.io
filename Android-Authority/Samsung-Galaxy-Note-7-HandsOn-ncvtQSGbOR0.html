skipping the iteration number six and
going straight to seven but is this new
note device really worthy of such a leap
well it's time to find out because it's
Joshua Vergara from Android authority
what's going on everybody
and this is your first look and hands-on
with the Samsung Galaxy Note seven if
you're looking at this device and it
looks incredibly familiar well you're
absolutely right it does retain a lot of
the look and feel the design language
that started with the Samsung Galaxy s6
and has moved on to devices like the s7
the note 5 and the s7 edge but there is
a bit of refinement to this design
language that actually makes a world of
difference first of all the phone is now
water-resistant but not just the phone
but also the s-pen which means that you
can actually take notes
underwater though we may not necessarily
know why you would want to it is a
feature that is available now on the
note 7 the designers of the note 7 made
a big deal about this phones symmetry
you have curves on the front for a
curved display but they're also curves
on the glass of the back and that means
that both sides meet in the middle in
order to meet the metallic skeleton the
result is a very comfortable feel in the
hand as the sides feel really smooth and
that lip actually doesn't protrude out a
whole lot the result also means that you
have a somewhat more narrow device and
it's less bulky than the note 5 that
came before it aside from the very
comfortable handling however a lot of
what makes this a note device or a
galaxy device actually remains the same
plenty of the different elements are
still in the same place that you would
expect including the S Pen on the bottom
that is now accompanied by one of the
main changes which is a USB C charging
port this is a brand new port for Galaxy
phones in general and it means that you
are going to need an adapter in order to
adapt to micro USB cords luckily that
will be included in the box popping out
the SIM tray also reveals a micro SD
card slot now you are able to use up to
2 terabytes in capacity for these cards
but none of those actually exist
Samsung however just recently released a
256 a gigabyte card that you could use
to bolster these 64 gigabytes of base
storage yes you heard it right
64 gigabytes is the main
and there are no other capacities
available from there however a lot of
the internals and specifications remain
largely the same you don't get too many
changes as the phone comes with a 5.7
inch Super AMOLED display in that quad
HD resolution that also boasts the
always-on display underneath the surface
you still have these same processors
from the galaxy s7 and s7 edge whether
it be the Snapdragon 820 or the latest
Exynos processor with 4 gigabytes of RAM
and the only real change besides from
that is 830 500 milliamp hour battery
that is larger definitely more in line
with what a phablet phone like this
should have and it also comes with the
same Fasching that should get the phone
power in no time at all now we are going
to go ahead and mention the cameras here
but we weren't able to get any examples
or samples obviously but the camera
package is still the same as that of the
galaxy s7 12 megapixels on the rear at F
1.7 aperture with dual pixel
construction so that you get very fast
autofocus and better low-light shots the
front-facing camera is still in F 1.7
aperture wide-angle lens with 5
megapixels to boast which brings us to
one of the main features of every note
device the s-pen the s-pen largely looks
the same this year but it has been made
200 millimetres in length the length of
a standard bulb head and it's only 3
grams in weight so it's still incredibly
lightweight and has that button that you
can use for a number of functions and
before you even ask it does not go in
backwards anymore there's not even a
chance for you to break the s-pen this
time around because that very small
portion at the top the clicky top is
just wide enough to stop it from even
going in at all we dive into the S Pen
features a little bit more in a feature
focus video but we can take a look at a
few of them here the main new feature is
that in the screen off memo that you can
create by just popping the S Pen out in
standby mode you can take this memo and
actually pin it to the always-on display
that allows you to have a note always at
the ready even if the phone is not
necessarily being used the Air Command
menu is a good way of seeing a few of
the new features including the ability
to translate from 71 different languages
and also a magnify feature that will
allow for closer looks at certain parts
of the interface
smart select now allows for a 15 second
capture of an easily shareable gif
basically you just put a frame onto any
portion of the screen and it will record
15 seconds of whatever is going on it's
an easy way of sending gifts through the
smart select which already makes sharing
pretty much anything very easy
and finally the Notes app has been
streamlined and it now consolidates a
number of different applications that
used to inundate
the TouchWiz version of Note devices in
the past and for an added bonus any of
you who really love to use notes can
actually use this app on galaxy s
devices to in the future which brings us
to security features and the iris
scanner now essentially you have to take
your glasses off and perhaps even
contacts when first scanning the iris in
order for you to have one set of irises
that can unlock the device after that
you pretty much unlock the device swipe
up and an infrared camera with an
infrared light rather at the top near
the front-facing camera will scan for
that set of irises and then just unlock
the device straight into the interface
it's a pretty nice way of getting
straight into your phone if you're just
going to be looking at it anyway the
same security features that unlock the
device can also be used for a secure
folder and these are also things that we
dive into a little bit more in a future
focus video much of what makes this a
note device is retained so it will feel
very familiar but at least the UI has
been streamlined there's no better place
to look at that than in the settings
menus so you'll see that there are
lighter colors all around a lot of the
menu items and a lot of the TouchWiz
elements are now pretty much white with
the colors to accent them and it just
looks a lot cleaner all around it's also
a little bit easier to navigate but of
course there's a lot here to work with
but speaking of interface changes of
course we have the curved display on the
note 7 which will be a mainstay of it
you won't be getting a different version
of this device anymore because we
already have the s7 edge and you can
look at that as a note 7 without an S
Pen so the curves are here to stay and
with the curves come the edge UX there's
actually not a whole lot to say here as
the edge UX features are pretty much the
same as found on the s7 edge and so
there you have it for this first look
and hands-on with the samsung galaxy
note 7 we have a lot of coverage of this
phone including color comparisons
to feature focus videos I've just
mentioned and of course comparisons with
some of the flagships in the Android
space today you can take a look at even
more about the note 7 at andrew
authority comm but for the most part we
are dealing with a phone that kind of
takes the lead of the s7 line and just
makes it bigger with of course that
little friend in the S Pen pre-orders
will start on August 3rd and then the
phone will be made available all over
the world on August 19 there are 4
different colors and you can take a look
at that comparison in our color
comparison video oh and also there is a
new gear VR that is available as well
and that is something you can find over
at VR source comm so head on over there
watch that video to see the new fourth
iteration of VR and then bring it on
back to Andrew thority because we are
your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
