number coming at you from your number
one source for all things android
android authority calm today we've got
another case review for the samsung
galaxy s3 we got to see do cases we've
got our active combo with holster and
we've got our surface combo with holster
and i'm going to be checking each of
these out put them on each color of the
samsung galaxy s3 and how they look see
how they protect the device and then of
course as always see and if they remain
true to all the accessibility available
on the Samsung Galaxy s3 including the
buttons the hardware the cameras and uh
just everything else so let's get into
the seidio active combo I'm going to go
ahead and read some of the stuff on the
back here it says we have a an active
case and a matching active holster this
provides an excellent shock absorbent
absorption and scratch protection we
have bold color combinations now this is
a two layer case and it's really thin
and has simple installation so let's
just a slide it out of the cardboard
here let's see it already looks really
nice easy to open the box too that's
always a plus let's go ahead and lift up
and we can bring our case right out of
the box like that see here we've got our
case and then here's our holster or
holster has some nice felt backing looks
classy and feels great too let's pull
out our little dummy phone out of there
and now we have the instructions on how
to assemble the innocase active now
that's basic installation instructions
you know it's not going to vary too much
just the same as put in any case on so
anyways this is some nice polymer here
um it's really nice it it feels great
this usually collects a little bit of
dust material like this but it's not
that big of a deal it provides a lot of
shock absorption so as well slide our
white galaxy s3 in there we just move
the corners over the galaxy s3 and then
we can go ahead and put our second part
of the case on there just snap it on
like this starting up the corners so
it's all snapped on feels really great
it looks awesome looks bulky and strong
even we have our kickstand here
our CEO kickstand this is a pretty
strong kickstand there's just one little
hinge in there and it's a plastic so I
wouldn't go too hard on it but we still
have our nice media stand just like that
nice protection on all the corners face
down as well visit the raised beds all
nice protection on the back with this
hard plastic and then of course as
always we do have access to our power
buttons volume buttons our camera LED
and speaker got our headphone even our
small Mike there are other small Mike
and our micro USB so this is a really
awesome case I enjoy the look of the
white on black let's go ahead and throw
it on our pebble blue version just super
quick to show you what that'll look like
and we'll take it off just like this
simply reinstall the exact same way the
black on black will look pretty cool or
at least be dark on black darkness of
the pebble blue and we'll slide that in
make sure we get the nice snug fit there
and all of our corners are matched again
looks really nice going to be the same
amount of protection so let's try the
holster we'll slide this right there in
the holster and then we clip the top
this is a nice easy clip it's not hard
to just saw you know you're not going to
feel bad about slamming your phone in
the holster this comes up really nicely
it's on a hinge and then we have our
other hinge here to clip it to a belt or
to a pocket easy to press the holster is
going to provide extra protection if it
were to fall on its back or even its
front but really cool really heavy duty
and are well built if I must say so
we'll set this one aside for now go
ahead and check out our surface combo by
see do I'll remove the case from the
pebble blue galaxy s3 when that time
comes anyways let's check out the
surface some of the specs on the surface
it is only one millimeter thin and it's
a really hard case that protects with
minimal bulk it's got scratch resistant
material rotating belt clip and a bunch
of other features but we'll just go
ahead and not get
ends on with this anyways nice holster
configuration on this one hinge easy to
open and we simply remove it just like
that this is a two-part case we actually
break the two parts not break we
actually remove both of the parts to fit
the galaxy s3 in there so let's start
with our white one we'll try a wet on
purple scheme and this is really nice
because it slides in there just slides
right in and then we can slide our
bottom piece in an hour bottom piece
meets the top very very nicely the
purple just looks great this is a nice
material this is going to be scratch
resistant and impact resistant I really
like the cutouts on this it does not
leave any bezel around the camera just
simply the lens here looks great we've
got our LED cutouts we're going to cut
out for our speaker headphone small bike
power button is easily accessible same
with the volume keys and then on the
bottom or USB and our other small Mike
got some nice branding right here let
everyone know you're rocking the studio
and we can pop this one in the holster
quickly feels nice in the holster this
one's got a rotating clip and it rotates
almost 360 degrees not quite easy to
press as well let's go ahead and take
this off and pop it on our pebble blue
galaxy s3 just for the heck of it will
take off our active case by the way
really really easy installation on this
active case you saw it just slid right
out of there but it's not going to fall
out under normal circumstance takes a
little bit of pressure on top to relieve
the case of the phone we'll go ahead and
slide this on our pebble blue version
it's already looking nice like I said
I'm a fan of black on black colour
schemes or at least dark color schemes
anyways this is really cool the purple
on the blue here and see it just looks
awesome again raised edges to protect a
facedown impact you have our nice a
durable impact resistant backing and of
course our nice felt case there to slide
this in sending these guys there's a
really great cases if you've got a Sam
galaxy s three outs of just checking
these out if you want some protection
and you just want a nice a sleek-looking
case that will get your looks from the
ladies anyways guys this is clayton
youngberg from android authority com I

android and we'll just keep bringing you
good content later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
