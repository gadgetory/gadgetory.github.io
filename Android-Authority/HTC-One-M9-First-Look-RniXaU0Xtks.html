with their latest flagship smartphone
this is joshua guard from android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the HTC One m9 while there are
quite a few improvements made in this
newest version of the one the most
obvious is noticed when you get the
phone in the hand HTC improved on their
very well-regarded design language by
taking some of the aesthetics from the
one m7 and mixing it with the ergonomics
of the m8 the result is a phone that
basically adopts the two-tone coloration
introduced in their desire line of
mid-range phones but in this case the
metal construction is still the
centrepiece bringing a simultaneously
industrious and elegant look on the
sides the intersection of HTC's previous
to design languages results in a sharper
edge or a taper that brings the somewhat
smoother backing into the sharper front
that con caves down a bit this tactile
feel on the sides is helped by a backing
that isn't quite as slippery as before
making this an HTC One that not only
looks but feels much better dual
anodization creates the two-tone look as
the civil version you're seeing is
covered in a gold rim the gold is
actually subtle enough to keep the phone
from looking too gaudy but there are a
couple of the colors like the returning
gunmetal that also looks incredibly
sleek even the button layer has been
brought to the side where the power
button was once on top up front the
boomsound speakers are easily found in
big grilles on the top and bottom halves
and the upgrade camera optics bring a
very large unit to the backing without
the extra eye of the duo camera there's
no denying that the HTC One design has
been well received and in the metallic
space it is definitely one of the most
recognizable but economically it has
been improved and that's where the
design aspect can easily be the focus of
HTC steps forward the display experience
is actually quite similar to the
previous HTC One a super lcd3 panel that
brings 1080p resolution stays at the 5
in form factor it's still a little tall
especially considering the bezels and
the speakers at the top and bottom but
getting side to side is certainly no
issue and adding a couple elements the
soft key navigation bar can help
alleviate the hand gymnastics the screen
remains pretty easy on the eyes as we
didn't really have any issue seeing
things in broad daylight they'll do
color production on the display is quite
a bit cooler compared to the warmer
tones of the HTC One m8 it's what's
underneath the screen that truly shines
as the Snapdragon 810 makes another
appearance in a flagship handset this
time backed by 3 gigabytes of RAM and
while we might have been a bit skeptical
about it
performance and other devices thus far
the HTC Sense 7 operating system does
well to show how great this processor
can be while some credit has to be given
to how Spartan the OS is it's smooth and
speedy elements cannot be denied going
from the updated lollipop elements of
the interface into applications and then
back out again through the recent apps
screen yields one of the nicest
transitions end of noticeably smooth
experience all around I cannot reiterate
this enough this thing absolutely flies
and speaking of sense a few key
enhancements have been added to bring
the 7th version of this operating system
first noticeable is the sense home a
widget that is basically a contextual
location-based app launcher depending on
where you are based on gps since home
will bring up applications that you use
on a regular basis it's a nice first
iteration that benefits from being a
widget because at least you can remove
it if you want to and it's also nice
that you are able to remove the folders
that it comes with one with all your
downloaded applications and one filled
with suggestions that sometimes might
come off a little spammy provided that
you don't really care about what apps
that appear in it blinkfeed returns but
now adds its own location-based flavors
results from the local Yelp listings for
example become available at certain
times as the one m9 will suggest through
blinkfeed and in an area on the
lockscreen places that you can go for a
bite to eat for example it's in addition
that's better felt over time and in just
a day or so that we had with this phone
it didn't really but into my routine
enough for me to say it was good or bad
to have and aside from the lollipop
enhancements baked into sent seven
changes to the interface can be felt
through the theming engine many aspects
of the interface can be changed to
different colors through themes that are
either pre-installed or downloaded from
a growing list of shared ones from the
interwebs but the most impressive part
of this team is the ability to take any
picture ideally your wallpaper of choice
and plug it into the app it will analyze
the colors and find a combination to use
for all of the interface elements you
can see me here putting my mega man x
wallpaper in and finding the right shade
of blue to easily apply to the OS before
we get to the camera some other hardware
enhancements include micro SD card
expansion that backs that 32 gigabytes
of on-board storage the boobs on
speakers remain a very good part of the
media experience especially when Dolby
is put into the mix for even better
sound the sensor for easily waking
unlocking the phone also returns so when
bringing the phone up from a prone
position a simple double tap or swipe
from the sides can get users to key
parts of
and finally the battery has been brought
to 2840 milliamp hours though testing
for full day usage battery life is going
to have to wait for when we get our
final review units you've probably been
wondering about the large camera optic
on the back yes we get a larger 20
megapixel sensor here that forgoes the
ultrapixels of previous HTC One devices
the result is a much enhanced picture
taking experience though in translation
we have to keep our reservations about
the one m9 before we get to that though
the app interface has been improved for
easier selection of modes and it is
worth noting that a pro mode will be
available after launch which will allow
for raw capturing of images if you are
missing the ultrapixel from the HTC
previous ones however don't worry the
low-light performer has been moved to
the front in order to make
self-portraits easier to capture it's a
very thoughtful move that has translated
to success thus far with selfies getting
the kind of low light performance they
need especially in indoor situations but
now it's in the rear facing camera that
we have to dial back our enthusiasm
because the 20 megapixel optics are
actually pretty uneven pure daylight
shots still bring the kind of quality we
wanted from these shots despite the
dialed back color saturation and details
were quite sharp and we were happy with
those results in broad daylight but even
in somewhat lower light situations the
noise comes back and darker elements are
very blotchy it's quite easily noticed
in photos but it's even more noticeable
in video which is where the lack of
optical image stabilization is probably
most acutely felt it's important to note
that improvements to the camera software
will be made in time before the launch
but we are definitely hoping to see that
those right enhancements are
particularly found in the low light
situations and so there you have it the
HTC One m9 in this first look at their
new flagship HTC seems to have been at
work creating the most refined and
perfected one device yet and in a lot of
ways they seem to be on the right track
in design and especially in the software
enhancements they are back not only by a
powerful processing package but by a
body that is not sacrificing these
simplistic elegance that originally
distinguished the line if there was only
one flaw in otherwise great package and
might be have to be the camera which is
a bit of a bummer because we hope that
the issues we have seen thus far are
remedied in the final review units so
you can wait until then when we get our
full review units that we can bring you
our full review of the HTC One m9 but
until then keep it tuned to android
authority for all of the best coverage
from the Mobile World Congress 2015 in
Barcelona Spain
should keep it tuned here because we are
