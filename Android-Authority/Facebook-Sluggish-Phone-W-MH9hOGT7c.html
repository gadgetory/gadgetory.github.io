out of your device see what I did there
suck you see the main things that
Facebook is accused of doing is taking
up way too much space the official app
is 40 megabytes consuming too much ram
background processes draining batteries
and generally being the root of all evil
there's surprising little factual
evidence around all of these claims but
there is certainly no shortage of
anecdotal evidence that Facebook is the
primary cause of a sluggish Android
experience now if that's true for you
let's talk about the alternatives and it
doesn't mean leaving Facebook altogether
well besides just using Chrome to use
the web version of Facebook you can use
metal for Facebook and Twitter metal is
one of the few Facebook alternative apps
that we'd recommend the best thing is
that it works for both Facebook and
Twitter so you can kill two birds with
one stone metal is a web rapper app
meaning that it isn't so much an app in
and of itself as a skin for the web
version of Facebook like the chrome
solution metal can also send you push
notifications but it improves on the
chrome fix by adding a huge array of
extras including various themes a
floating mini app window for Facebook
updates on the fly and a navigation
drawer Twitter support fingerprint
access interface options like full
screen mode and fixed a toolbar while
scrolling
now if meadow sounds a bit too
complicated there is tinfoil for
Facebook and again tinfoil for Facebook
is just a wrapper app but it's super
fast and has its own handy navigation
drawer and shortcuts it's nowhere near
as feature packed as metal but it's even
smaller and faster tinfoil doesn't sink
in the background and it doesn't use any
more resources than chrome so it's very
battery and system friendly tinfoil
doesn't include push notifications
though but you can simply use chrome
notifications to keep up to date now if
you like the main Facebook app and can't
put up with its battery draining
performance you could also try Facebook
light if you haven't heard about it
Facebook Lite is an official Facebook
app originally designed for markets
where fast flowing internet connections
are not always available but folks
anywhere can use it as a faster leaner
alternative to Facebook that consumes
less data and requires less system
resources to run
Facebook light offers a similar if pared
down experience to the main Facebook app
but it is much much smaller just a half
a megabyte compared to 40 megabytes for
the normal Facebook app Facebook Lite
also has native push notifications and
chat so there's no need to keep
Facebook's messenger app installed if
you take this option now personally all
I did was to turn off notifications for
both Facebook app and Facebook messenger
altogether and boy my life is much
simpler because of it let me know what
you think in the comments below you
don't want to forget about these guys
and gals we're working super hard to be
your source for all things Android
