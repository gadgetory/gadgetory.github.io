announce the ascend mate 7 at Aoife in
Berlin but at the end of the actual
event they also to our surprise gave
everyone one and yours truly was not off
that list so I'm here right now I want
to give a little bit of time before I
did this particular video because you
just saw our first look but I figure
it's time now to take a look at it so
it's Josh freghar from Andhra Authority
what's going on everybody and this is
your unboxing and initial setup at least
for the fingerprint scanner which is one
of our favorite features of this phone
of the huawei ascend mate 7 alright and
here we are with the huawei ascend mate
7 this is the brand new phone by them
and we're just going to go ahead and
jump in I do have an open box right here
but I haven't taken the plastic off of
everything and there it is that glorious
6 inch screen this just might be one of
the largest phones that we've ever had
the pleasure of using but I'm really
excited to be able to use it then there
you go you have the metal construction
very nice slab right here on the front
and it is basically all screen we've
already seen quite a bit of footage and
also had a lot of hands-on time with
this phone I'm going to put that aside
just for a second we do have the sim
tool that is right here along with the
manuals that are underneath actually
there are none in this particular case
right now
I remember now so we have that we also
have underneath here the accessories the
micro USB charging cables some
headphones and of course the plug
adapter we're going to go ahead and just
jump into those right now here's our
plug adapter we have the micro Dell
here's the headphones right here they
seem pretty standard not necessarily the
high quality ones that you would expect
to have to use with a phone like this
but these are the standard ones that
come with it
and then finally of course a nice long
microUSB charging cable and from there
it looks like that's pretty much
everything we have if you look under
here there's nothing over there and that
should pretty much do it
now like it states in the description
below we are looking not just at the
unboxing but also we're going to do a
initial setup on here and what I mean by
initial setup is I'm going to pretty
much go through the the first screens
but also do a fingerprint registration
so we're going to go ahead and just turn
on the device first of all we'll take a
quick look around the device itself like
I said we have this wonderful metal
construction as you can see over here
just looks really nice and it's a very
attractive phone the metal the
fingerprint scanner rather is right
there below the camera we have a fairly
thin device all around but it is a six
inch screen so we do have a lot of real
estate on here and it's not going to be
the easiest phone to use in one hand but
as I hold the power button down we're
going to get our first prompt and here
we go fingerprint ID right here in the
settings and let's see what we got here
I'll do a pin some new generic
alright go ahead and roll please place
your finger on the fingerprint scanner
once you feel a slight vibration the
compress your finger again so here we go
and there's the vibration there's a
vibration it's going to keep going for a
while this particular screen looks a
little bit familiar I'm not going to lie
but that's ok because the fingerprint
scanner is a pretty stellar feature on
the Ascend mate 7 there you go the
fingerprint scanner can be used to
access the save access app blocks or
just unlock the screen from any which
place so here we are you're going to
head back here I'm going to go and turn
off the phone and I will just rest my
finger right there put my finger on
there and it turns right on it's a great
feature on the ascend mate 7 one of the
best implementations of a fingerprint
scanner I think we've ever seen you know
I really don't think that's ever going
to get old but that was the unboxing and
initial setup at least in the case of
the fingerprint scanner of the huawei
ascend mate 7 now as far as my first
impressions of the phone go yes this is
a large display and yes that makes for a
large phone but my impressions are still
pretty much the same as they were in the
first impressions first look that I had
at Aoife in Berlin 2014 the construction
of this one is actually quite great and
it really shows that Huawei has really
been stepping their game up in terms of
just how great their devices not only
look on the outside and inside but also
in terms of their features so keep it
tuned to Android authority for all the
best coverage including my soon to be
review of the huawei ascend mate 7 we're
going to take a look at this phone and
its fingerprint scanner the emotion UI
and a lot of its features especially
that very large battery underneath that
should give it a lot of longevity and to
be able to make this phone go the
distance for a long time so keep it
tuned here and of course we have the
ascend mate 7 along with other videos
you can see our first look right over on
the side and remember to keep it tuned
