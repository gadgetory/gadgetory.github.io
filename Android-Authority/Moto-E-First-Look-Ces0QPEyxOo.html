off of a meeting with Motorola to take a
look at their new budget device hey it's
Josh of agora from Android Authority and
this is the Moto e moto moves on to yet
another part of the alphabet to bring
you a budget device that is not only
accessible to people in the
international market which it is
definitely tackling but it's still able
to be taken advantage of by users in the
West and in North America especially
with its lower price point this is
probably one of the best entry points
available for anybody who has not had
just an Android phone but a smart phone
in general when you have the design of
the phone you take a look at basically a
design language that's very similar to
previous devices like the Moto G and the
Moto X and that gives you the curve on
the back that gives it a bit of a pebble
like design but also with a 4.3 inch
display this phone is very very easy to
maneuver in one hand and you are
actually able to pretty much grip the
entire phone in your hand as well
customization is also available on the
Moto e as the Motorola shells as they're
calling them will be made of applicable
to this device with a number of
different colors available for the back
cover which is quite easily removable
but just because the back cover is
removable it doesn't mean that Moto
compromised on the overall build quality
indeed there's a bit of a heft to the
phone and overall it just feels very
sturdy but there are some aspects that
add to it for example the display is
coated in an anti-smudge coating but is
also made of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and
the entire device has been coated in a
material from p2i that allows it to have
some water resistance as well so you'll
be able to have the phone take a tumble
or even a splash and you'll still come
back wanting more at 4.3 inches the
screen might be one of the smallest that
you end up using especially if you're
used to the larger 5-inch screens out
there but nonetheless the resolution
here comes in at 960 by 540 which is a
qHD display that also has 256 pixels per
inch but that being said what the
smaller size display it still performs
quite well I found text to still be
quite good in terms of its sharpness and
after that I threw on a couple of videos
in this case the Transformers trailer
and I still found that it was enjoyable
even if
I was more used to larger screens that
still was enjoyable to use even if I had
to squint a little bit because the
screen is that much smaller underneath
the hood the Snapdragon 200 is the
dual-core processor that you get in the
Moto e that let's put this way it pretty
much gets the job done it is not going
to be able to handle a lot of the more
advanced tasks that some Android users
are needed out there but moto has told
us that that is not necessarily the
demographic that the Moto e is going for
anyway this is a phone that is made for
anybody who's never had a smartphone
before oranges need something that
pretty much just works and doesn't need
to do anything else above and beyond the
core experience that is found in Android
4.4.2 which is what is installed in here
I did play some of the Angry Birds
racing game on here and yes I did find
slowdown in more intense portions of the
game but that did not stop me from
having fun with it as I was still able
to complete a couple levels with really
not too many hiccups at all while there
might be some stutter and a little bit
of slowdown in some of those portions of
the game it still did not keep me from
enjoying what was happening on the
screen after that you have one gigabyte
of RAM for multitasking as compared to
the 512 megabytes of RAM that's found on
a lot of other devices in the same price
range which is a bit of a feather in the
cap of the Moto e and after that you
also have expandable storage now eight
gigabytes is what you get built into the
phone but a micro SD card slot found
underneath the removable back cover will
allow you expandability of only up to 32
gigabytes as far as the battery life
goes yes having a dual core processor
definitely helps with the overall power
consumption but ultimately having a
nineteen eighty milliamp hour battery
unit inside which is a capacity that you
don't always often see in phones of this
price range and also in this size moto
is claiming basically that that large
battery for this phone will last all day
and with all day battery mode oh really
is trying to create a phone that is
ultimately reliable for pretty much any
user now of course with the lowered spec
sheet all around we're not going to be
seeing the touchless control or the
active display that was originated in
the Moto X but that's perfectly fine
because the Moto e is not really
catering to that kind of demographic
that needs that kind of functionality
after that the camera also sort of keeps
to this core experience ideal in
it's a 5-megapixel shooter that doesn't
have that many bells and whistles but
then again the moto camera on previous
editions also wasn't all that
extravagant and his features as well but
at 5 megapixels moto has reassured us
that the optimizations put into the
camera software will allow the 5
megapixel pictures to still be pretty
good and reliable nonetheless and
finally in software we are seeing the
latest version of Android on here
Android 4.4.2 kitkat now that is the
latest version that is out right now but
moto is guaranteeing that the Moto e
will get the next version of Android in
an upgrade which looks to be Android
4.4.3 but nonetheless the general
experience of the user interface is
pretty much what you would expect from a
moto device and that it is pretty close
to a stock like experience so if you
used the Moto X or Moto G before or even
a Nexus device from the past then you
pretty much know what you're getting
into with this version of Android after
that moto has baked in a few of their
additions including the moto assist and
the Moto migrated applications but after
that it's pretty much the home screens
with a notification drop down the quick
settings recent apps screen and pretty
much the stock like experience pretty
much just cater to Moto's own vision and
so there you have it the Moto e Motorola
really is trying to shake up the lower
price to your market by providing a
device that not only has a build quality
you don't normally see at 2 129 dollars
unlocked and $79 on contract but also
has the promise of the most updated
software available including Android
4.4.2 right now and future versions of
Android after it so keep it tuned to
Android authority for more on the Moto e
we will have a comparison with the Moto
G coming up very soon and then our full
review will be coming as well pretty
soon so keep it tuned to Android
authority for all of that and the best
coverage because we are your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
