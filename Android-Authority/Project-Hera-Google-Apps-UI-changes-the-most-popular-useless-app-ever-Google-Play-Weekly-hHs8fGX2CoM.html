Hindy the android authority app guy and
it's Friday so you know what that means
this week we're going to talk about some
big moves that Facebook is making some
new Google Play Store updates and a top
three paid android app that doesn't do
anything without further ado let's get
started late last week we'll started
rolling out an update to the Google Play
Store on android devices that now shows
a people section this is a simple
feature that's easy to understand in the
Play Store side menu that will now be a
section called people in there you'll
see recommendations based on what your
friends downloaded and even how they
rated whatever Google Play content they
were using it's a little more than a
recommendation system but let's face
facts people are more likely to download
an application based on word of mouth
now Google Play has word of mouth built
right in so i guess 30,000 people bought
and downloaded an application that
doesn't do anything what i say doesn't
do anything I mean that literally it
doesn't do anything and actually
performed no tasks whatsoever according
to android police the app was called
virus shield and it sold for three
dollars and ninety-nine cents in the
Google Play Store which means it made
about a hundred and twenty thousand
dollars before it was finally taken down
earlier this week that's a pretty good
run for a totally useless application a
recent piece in The Guardian exposed
that the developer apparently didn't
intend on releasing that version of the
application and that it was little more
than a UI placeholder the developer
believes that everyone should be
refunded and has stated that he plans on
releasing the actual virus shield free
of charge when it's actually done my
personal thoughts on the matter are
pretty simple if an app that doesn't do
anything can make it into the top three
best selling apps in just a week what
does that really say about our buying
habits speaking of paid app problems
google just patented a new algorithm
that finds and flags pirated
applications in the Google Play Store
even if piracy isn't the huge mammoths
problem that some make it out to be it's
still a pretty significant problem one
particularly damaging issue was seen
with the flappy bird fad where dozens of
flat burg ripoffs appeared practically
overnight google has filed a new patent
to prevent that sort of copycat behavior
from happening at least on such a large
scale the algorithm would work by
comparing the assets and code of an
uploaded application to authorized
applications already in the Google Play
Store so let's say a malware developer
clones Angry Birds and puts malware in
it the
my store would flag this automatically
because it has the same code in assets
as the original Angry Birds the only
thing that is unclear is how precise the
algorithm is and exactly how much code
and assets have to be copied in order to
get flagged of course apps based on
other open source apps would not be
flagged this would also fit right in
with the recent news that Google started
continuously scanning for malware in an
effort to make the Google Play Store a
happier place this last week Facebook
announced two things that they'll be
doing to their facebook Messenger
platform that don't suck how about that
so the first move Facebook made was to
add free and unlimited Wi-Fi calling to
facebook Messenger this means you can
call anyone on messenger using your data
connection or Wi-Fi to chat as long as
you want to frankly this feature was a
long time coming as Facebook has lagged
behind major competitors in this area
for quite some time this was part of an
update that also included groups message
forwarding and conversation shortcuts
the second part of the facebook
Messenger saga includes total separation
from the facebook application the time
being you can access messenger on both
the official app and the proprietary one
however in the near future they're going
to remove that functionality from the
official application so if you want to
continue using it you'll have to
download that second app when you
combine this with the not so recent
what's that back position it's not a
giant leap in logic to assume that
facebook Messenger may be merging with
whatsapp eventually on some symbiotic
level in our last bit of news this week
let's talk a little bit about those new
google app UI changes that we may be
seeing very soon okay so from what we
could find there are three designs that
google apps could be using the first is
what writer andrew grush calls the ich
komm layout that came from writer
Russell Holly who apparently got to
preview a new google calendar the second
is the android police layout as they
apparently got their hands on some
classified renders the third is the wild
card which is a supposed screenshot from
reddit for now no one but Google knows
which one they're going with along with
the new UI layouts word around the
internet grapevine is that they'll also
be introducing project Herod that would
finally begin to build that bridge
between Chrome Android and search this
is probably going to be a huge deal
because it would include a much deeper
integration between chrome and Android
we knew this one was coming when Andy
Rubin stepped down and they put control
of Android in the hands of the same guy
who has control of Chrome it's going to
be a really fun show to watch and it's
apparently
starting soon so who wants to see some
trending applications as usual if you
want to check any of these applications
out you can find the links in the
written companion which is in the video
description below first up this week is
all cast the popular streaming app from
couche has gotten an update which
includes the boilerplate bug fixes and
performance improvements it also
includes Amazon fire TV support so if
you happen to be an early adopter of
bats and need to stream some local
content from your Android device then
this is the app you should be checking
out the app also now includes support
for redeeming codes if you ever end up
with one of those carousel is a new
application from Dropbox that
essentially acts as a gallery app here's
how it works you download it and install
it and it automatically syncs your
photos with Dropbox which is kind of
expected out of any application from
Dropbox at this point some other
features include the ability to share
photos with other carousel users and the
ability to hide photos and videos should
you need that if you use Dropbox to
backup your photos this is an app worth
looking at beware though as there are a
few issues namely with Dropbox business
accounts if you're looking for something
that doesn't take place in the cloud
another gallery replacement option was
released this week called Impala and
Paula is a mix between a gallery app and
a camera app that sorts your photos
based on a number of variables and also
allows you to take pictures the app can
also apply filters automatically once it
learns your preferences so far people
are having a few problems with the app
but the general consensus is a positive
one so if you don't mind a few release
date jitters it's worth taking a look
impossible road is a very minimal game
and the second iOS game to come to
android in the last two weeks that is
really popular despite having really
simple graphics the game is like a super
simplified version of Mario Kart Rainbow
Road race track and that you move along
a track and you can jump off at any time
to try to land on another part of the
track it features flappy bird style
scoring and it's a dollar 99 which is a
bit too rich for my blood for how simple
the game is but a lot of people seem to
be enjoying it and you may be one of
them last up this week is the Walking
Dead Season one game and frankly that's
all i have to say because it's the
walking dead people have been waiting
for this for a while now and frankly
releasing it right after the end of the
current season was a stroke of marketing
brilliance the first episode is free but
you have to pay for the last four
episodes if you want to continue playing
the game so far it has rave reviews
which means the developers have
obviously done something correct if
you're a fan of the show you should at
least try this one out
