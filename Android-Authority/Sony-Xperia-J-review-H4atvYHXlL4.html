watching the Android Authority channel
on YouTube Sony is known for its Android
smartphones with great builds and
designs it is particularly well known
for the multimedia playback quality of
its Xperia phones freshly Unleashed into
the exterior line is a new entry-level
phone the Sony Xperia J does it live up
to the Sony Xperia name let's do a quick
review and find out the Sony Xperia J is
a relatively slim and light phone weight
on its own merit it's an interesting and
portable phone as I'll be showing you in
a little bit this phone feels really
good in the hand but let's check out its
face first here's the phone's four inch
TFT LCD touchscreen surrounded by black
bezels it's covered in Corning Gorilla
Glass so it has protection against
scratches as is the case with 4-inch
phones the entire touchscreen area is
relatively within easy reach of a single
thumb the top and bottom bezels are
thicker than to side bezels at the top
is the 0.3 megapixel front camera the
LED notification light is here to its
left you'll see it light up when you
receive notifications and this one's the
phone's speaker grille down here are the
capacitive buttons accented in white
this is for back home and menu here near
the corner of the screen is a small hole
for the microphone this hole can
potentially collect dust and dirt over
time take a look at this edge here it
bevels towards the phone's frame same
thing for the bottom part I like this
bubble design actually it gives the
phone a unique look at the top side only
the headphone jack is here to me this is
a strong signal that the phone's
intended market is people who would
frequently plug in their headphones to
listen to music at the left side is a
standard microUSB port at the right side
are the small power button and the
volume rocker these buttons are very
accessible to the fingers the volume
rocker is slightly elevated from the
side so it is easy to find the power
button however is a bit too buried it's
flush to the side I sometimes need to
press twice or thrice to get it to work
at the bottom side of the phone there's
nothing here save for the small hole
which is for hanging accessories running
around the side is the silver plated
plastic frame
adds a classy accent to the phone the
bottom of the frame hides something
fascinating when you wake your phone
this part here lights up nice eh it's
called smart lumination the colors
change depending on your theme let's
check out the back
one very noticeable thing about the back
is that it's curved the top and bottom
parts are thicker when I create a lit in
my hand the phone feels as if it is
leaning against my hand I find this
curve very convenient because it helps
me get a good grip here's a five
megapixel back camera and this one's the
loudspeaker grill the back cover itself
is plastic but it looks very nice it has
a pearly off-white shape to it this is a
removable snap-on cover and you have to
be very careful when you're prying it
open
let's see what's underneath the
backplate here's the battery lithium ion
pack rated at 1750 mAh for up to about
eight and a half hours of non-stop video
playback the slot is for a regular sized
SIM and this one's for micro SD card
expansion now it's time to see the phone
in action first we wake the phone from
sleep here's the lockscreen
you don't drag our slide rings here
instead you have a simple slider sliding
this icon to the right will unlock the
phone sliding this icon to the left will
unlock the phone and immediately open
the camera app here's the very beautiful
homescreen this is Android 4.0.4 Ice
Cream Sandwich right here skinned with
Sony's time scape user interface which
is a cool looking UI the display uses
TFT LCD touchscreen technology with
Discipline resolution of 854 by 480
pixels with a four inch diagonal the
effect of display density is 245 PPI
which is rather sharp and crisp
navigation is generally smooth on this
phone but not butter smooth I must say
there are jitter and stuttering in
several places understandable though the
phone only has a one gigahertz single
core Snapdragon MSM 7 2 to 7 a chipset
but 512 mb of ram internal storage is 4
gigabytes and about half of that is used
by the operating system so you can use
only 2 gigabytes internal storage good
thing though is that the phone allows
microSD card expand
the back camera snaps photos relatively
fast but the output is not spectacular
whether indoor or outdoor shots I
frequently had trouble focusing on the
subject there's slight delay after
pressing the shutter as for videos don't
expect high definition the highest you
can record is 480p if you're buying this
phone for its camera I suggest that you
don't video playback is okay the stock
video player can play most video formats
except QuickTime so don't expect video
playback to be always smooth and fluid
more importantly don't expect your 720p
HD videos to play smoothly if they play
at all but for audio this is a wonderful
phone you get so nice Walkman player app
plus extra sound boosts through Excel
technology you can manually adjust sound
levels through a five band equalizer -
if great music is what you're after in
the budget phone this phone does the job
well despite several shortcomings the
Sony Xperia J is a great phone it has a
sharp and crisp screen good battery life
and Sony quality sound I find that it is
better for music playback rather than
video playback in addition to standard
phone use and occasional web browsing
what do you think of the Sony Xperia J
does it have enough appeal to make you
want to experience it yourself let's
talk more about it in the comment furfle
