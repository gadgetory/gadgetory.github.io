original hangout show for android on
google+ I'm dare cross and I'm Scott
Anderson this week we are joined by the
same people that have been here the past
two weeks these new guests not just
kidding oh we love having you damage on
welcome back ah fun times thanks for
being your guys so so Scott well we're
going to talk about this week where I'll
get new iPhones right here right
pre-order is set so we're talking about
the Android ecosystem also when we going
over about four different apps that were
updated that are significant also some
ICS updates and devices new devices
coming out and also devices that are all
right now that might be get updates
we're going to go into our route and
raman section and there were me talking
about the iphone 5 how does it stack up
to current android phones hardware
software things like that there when we
going over some carrier news and android
security and some pet wars oh good
what's uh let's get some general android
awesomeness that we found out a few days
ago on the eve of the iphone 5
announcement Andy Rubin and Hugo Barra
big names and Google and Android decide
to let the world know that Android had
reached 500 million devices activated
across the entire globe if you remember
just two weeks ago or a week ago I think
at the motorola on display event it was
480 million so we got another 20 million
over the past about about a week in
which we know that's happening because
1.3 million are being activated daily so
obviously a little over a week later
we're gonna hit 500 million which is a
massive over 3 million avec what's that
that's a little faster Timon Quinton
well it's growing it's a train that
can't be stopped in this that's 2.8
million well Oh a week
yeah yeah so it's grown it's crazy I
mean I'm sure the numbers you know maybe
they announced were a little lower maybe
was you know maybe they just rounded
down around it up but still this is
probably really hard to track especially
global I am in tears over Rob extremely
hard to track I mean either way that's
insane you know so Android entrance huge
I mean I mean when we saw the iphone 5
announcement following day they didn't
talk about numbers they don't talk about
numbers because they don't want to but
variate a third globally seventeen
percent compared to sixty-eight percent
they're not going to talk about that so
the numbers they like talking about are
the ipad numbers and the tablet numbers
just because they got there first and
that's the one thing they have to grasp
onto yeah they're doing well with that
you know they really are so I'll
incidentally you know you go I think
they announced it the day before the iOS
the end the apple event uh just a little
thorn in the side of Apple that the
millions big dog before the announcement
that's is my pity yeah because they had
that 480 million announcement like a
week before at the motorola vent and
then they were like oh yeah by the way
we just added 20 million devices in a
week yep exactly so uh it's map updates
the street this week a few of them that
people care about actually it's a big
one was google wallet um and another
update to Google odd as a whole they're
discontinuing prepaid cards which i
think is fine um and since the update of
all the major support for all the major
credit cards on usage has doubled which
is pretty coming they didn't say what it
started that no it didn't but used to
just doubled so that's good and then
make sure you guys because of a rooted
device to pick up the new apk
for Google Wallet I know I verizon along
and it stopped working but then I
updated it and now it's fine yeah
there's been a lot of fun we'll say
known around the android blogosphere
today saying oh no verizon and google
blew up Google Wallet doesn't work
anymore especially not true a week ago
in September 5th google wallet was
updated so if you installed that update
from a little over a week ago you
couldn't automatically update it because
you're on verizon you're not even
supposed to have it but if you got the
APK for however you got it you were fine
here you weren't locked out today you
know it's been over a week most people
didn't install the update so all of a
sudden they were locked out no big deal
I mean it's not newsworthy on the why
everybody's making a big deal you know
I'm supposed to have it anyways I'm
verizon head and go out there download
and install it it's gonna work great I
mean I used it today you know it it
works fine um but it is you said Scott
to go back what they talked about
discontinuing the prepaid cards but that
means is you know previously Google
Wallet didn't support adding any credit
card that you had you you could only add
a citibank mastercard so when the a
month ago or so whenever that big update
came out and allowed any card to be
added it kind of put a hindrance on no
why do you need a google prepaid card
whenever you can add your own credit
card or there's no point in having a
prepaid card anymore because you can add
any card want to so they're just going
to do away with it because there's no
need to have it except for that nice
little ten dollars you get for adding a
new google device a new google wallet
device so if you have a phone that
supports it such as a Nexus device nexus
7 galaxy nexus you know whatever nexus s
4g if you've never used your 10 bucks
you want to do so in the next few weeks
come october 17th they're going to
disable it and you can get your money
back its own like that ten dollars or
even if you put money on if you put 50
bucks on it's not like that money's
going away you're going to get a refund
the money
be accessible to you but if it's there
you might as well use it so you know go
go ahead if you have free money there go
ahead and use it and uh mr. real quick
we have another user ask about that
earlier she was curious about her where
she can go to actually use google blog
well if you download the app called i'll
just lost my mom I just escaped from my
head um hey PayPass locator if you
download the app called mastercard
paypass locator it'll show you every
PayPass accessible place in your area
uses it uses google maps shows you nice
little overlay shows you are the rat so
you know if they take paypass and the
day the heck they take NFC payments it's
really you know quick and dirty little
hats going to download that app install
it I'll show you I replace it it does
mastercard paypass which generally means
they accept google wallet still a good
thing to do too because people always
turn heads when they view beam your
phone over there are everywhere that
i've been they'd be like what phone is
head what what space age is this
you're paying with your phone like that
doesn't work here like no you understand
you see this thing here that means a
little really it does work here you just
don't know about it we that doesn't work
here sir what it does like yeah doesn't
watch it in terms of your heads does i'm
still is still pretty useful there like
a sam brain bag pre-k prepay cars like
gift cards yeah she could like a almost
like western union somebody some money
real quick if they're in a tight spot
eventually that'd be pretty cool well so
another hat that was updated her frosh
paypal yeah another app that was updated
was turntable FM I know me and Derek
jumped on this pretty early this app
when it came to Android if you don't
know what it is it's basically a DJ
service that you get to listen to DJ's
play music on it got some bug fixes that
were pretty significant to the app when
it was initially released and had a lot
of
bugs and Derek what else was updated in
that well this week they added jellybean
notifications you know the expandable
notifications that the rich
notifications that so you can awesome or
you know lame ass all right from the
notification your dream songs that's
great yeah yeah it's fun I and you can
expand them such as you you're supposed
to be able to on jellybean actually
released two updates this week i believe
beginning the week the first update ad
added the jellybean notifications
actually took a screenshot posted on
google+ hello my god jellybean
notification and turntable and then I
you know Tabitha a curse cape back to
two turntables on FM and you couldn't
read anything it was all blurry and
Moses like they're you I cracked out the
fonts horrible you can read anything and
they'll update that came out later in
the week yesterday actually fixed that
it hasn't crapped out after taking a
screenshot or or hitting home and go to
the home screen and then you know
tapping back in fair shape of an updated
releasing that both fix like two days
later that's good sir it's not so much
anymore an iOS port that app they've
actually added the ability to share with
Android before you could just share it I
don't know Facebook Twitter it's been so
long you couldn't can maybe email it
actually didn't use the intense and
Android to share now it actually pops up
in a little android share window and you
can pick drafts like you can in android
so it's not just a an iOS port anymore
they're actually doing some stuff to it
that make makes it functionality nice
and I said that a jelly bean
notification so it's it it's a it's a
hybrid app now you know a little bit of
ILs no look you know but it's good I
like it um if you guys remember back we
had the chameleon team on air with us
and we went over some future releases
and just kind of what their overall
outlook is for their app and those you
don't know it started out as a
Kickstarter project it's called
chameleon and
it was updated to zero dot 990 and
basically this iteration of this app
introduces their new widget API so
basically developers can build their own
widgets or chameleon and they basically
noted that their API is still in
development so they're still working out
some bugs but the fact that other
developers can develop or this app is
pretty cool let's God some breaking news
on that if you're watching write down
your fan of chameleon we're actually
having them on next week just found out
about now ago um they have some big news
they have a big update coming out and
we're gonna have him on the air next
week to talk about so since so join us
next week and also ebay official ebay
android app was released um it was
released him that it was recalled on
input yeah but dirt you gots more
information on this because i don't use
ebay that much Oh dad hollow dad did
Santa hello how are you I you know okay
well yep all that that's basically yeah
they had a holo UI overhaul um you know
brought it into you know I Ice Cream
Sandwich era it's not bad i installed if
i used it i like i like Halle laughs I
really did you know that's one of the
most it's always good to see that come
every time i see i have i gotten to the
point where any time I don't see a
Holloway up I kind of get mad about it
near that I try to use just hollow apps
on my phone cuz they look so much better
yeah and it's the fact that the
developer is staying true to these
standards that are set which I like that
you know John look I can do not use
accident hauler you know they just feel
old yeah yeah yeah I hate that ninja
menu button just kills me yeah exactly I
hate looking down below and seeing the
menu button there but you don't do
anything what are you doing there you
know I I don't
kid I hated no no turret the odd the
place forgotten app update right oh not
so much an app update but they they
added something new area rather have
focus area it just it just came out
right before the show so we're just
talking about before the show hey uh
yeah an appt focus area oh and right now
they're using it to focus on blood
fashion we could fashion at fashion and
style yeah right there at the top when
you go yes what's a great release first
first released yeah that's a key that's
a cute little Android icon to social you
open up the Play Store at the top it's
gonna say you know fashion focus or I'm
sorry it's go say at apps focus fashion
and style a little glamour Android there
if you will you open up is it's just a
different way to showcase apps that it
up you know that fashion and style app
that's all yeah and I think it's a neat
addition I don't know that fashion
styles is obviously probably not our
 it but I think if they continue to
expand it and put app focus areas on
more you know more areas i think that's
a good thing mm-hmm because a lot of the
deal days that he used to have four
dollar apps and everything really helped
a lot of developers out of it made some
of a mad because it kind of boosts a lot
of people to the top that maybe you know
had an app that but any recognition is
always nice if you put a lot of good
work in i would like to see more tightly
regulated to applications that meet
android standards in a lot of situation
yeah hard agree with that so we had some
ice cream sandwich updates this week the
verizon samsung galaxy tab got ice cream
sandwich nearly a year after was
released so I don't schedule for verizon
right right on schedule yeah so if you
have a galaxy tab 10.1 on verizon
congratulations for
for getting a better operating system
the honeycomb you know it's a lot faster
but more fluid few bells and whistles
here and there but not jelly bean and I
I remember being in this position he
last year talking about devices finally
getting gingerbread update you know
after a you know a long time months and
months and months after ice cream
sandwich was released I hate it I hate
talking about but progress is progress
hopefully the galaxy tab 10.1 gets a
jelly bean update before the end of the
year that would be nice a lot of Samsung
devices are a few of them are slated at
least rumor to get then so as soon as
October only things are bounded by how
soon you could possibly get it and not
by how scarf off you could possibly get
yeah then the 50k kind of help there a
little bit yeah you know it did Oh since
these since the Android uh yeah I don't
know what it was called what was
announced at i/o 2011 I think it's
called the PDK but it gives hardware
Williams earlier access to them usually
would so 2012 the platform and software
development yet but the the consortium I
don't know wills call because it didn't
do anything you're talking about yeah
yeah yeah the joint agreement that they
all came to be such like that amounted
to nothing yeah critics said we're not
where we're not gonna have fragmentation
and we're going to have updates right
away what and it didn't work so Google
said well we're going to scrap this idea
since a David start and they're gonna do
the PDK I mean hopefully we start seeing
some updates soon I'm guessing we really
won't see it like in until later on
whenever device is actually launched
with jelly bean and then the next verte
you know and key lime pie comes out
we'll be able to judge then if the PDK
is actually doing anything right now I
mean it's too soon yeah yeah
yeah it is too soon as Dan said I don't
know that they'll even help all verizon
please Galaxy Nexus I'm kill an animal
for jelly bean so well we have some
information a little bit later we talk
about routing Roman a little bit about
some verizon devices so let's talk about
device is speaking of devices uh the
verizon samsung galaxy s3 got a little
over the air update and no it's not
jelly bean but it fixed norscot it fix
some sim errors that people were getting
but more importantly chances are if you
watching the show or listening to the
show you may or may not read your device
and it is due through your device and
you do have the galaxy s3 I'm not sure
since the this up they just came out I
don't know but if it was it just you
know an operating system patch it did
anything the bootloader I haven't looked
that far into it but if it did touch
that bootloader uh you don't want to
install because the currently leaked
bootloader that's out that it allows
your device to be unlocked is not
updated to that updated bootloader if
there is an updated look so please
proceed with caution before you flash it
you download it you install you get the
over-the-air update no a double check to
see if there is a bootloader patch in
that over there update and something to
walk into to we're talking about that
prior to the show none of us have the
galaxy s3 so we we haven't looked into
it but be sure to that you know to know
what you're flashing before you actually
flash you I'll walk you want to lock
yourself out of your device turning on
also known as you're breaking your
device the the kindle fire and the fire
HD 7 that we talked about a week ago you
can now buy them there are available
amazon com so yeah we had some ma listen
discussions if you should buy those
devices I think long story short is if
you're on the Amazon ecosystem go for it
if you're not and if there are some
other places you can look at such as
Google's Nexus 7 but if you already own
the Android or
sorry the Amazon ecosystem I mean it's
it's a logical step yeah I mean if
you're very tied into Amazon go for it
but if if you're not or you use Amazon
and other things don't don't bother and
the droid razr m we talked about last
week as well and is now available and
that's how that's a badass little film
if if I didn't know me I'm a root ramen
guy I got a customized my device if a
friend or family member was up for
contract renewal right now and had to
have a phone and couldn't wait another
two months to find out what the next
Nexus does if it comes out on verizon if
I would tell them to get the raise
around so if you're waiting on a device
and you needed fun that's a that's a
great little fun some friends in the
industry some fellow tech bloggers and
technology enthusiast Android busiest
actually uh Russell Holly a previous
show guest said that that's his daily
driver he loves that little guy so when
Russell Holly says he likes it the place
he's using his daily driver I tend to
think of it it's pretty nice you know I
mean it's pretty impressive you know
what the coolest thing about them then
launching this device in my opinion is
but showing the general public how how
cool NFC can be so you unpackage your
new device right there's a piece of
paper and eric says hey tap your phone
here you tap your phone there and it
opens up in actie it's an NFC piece of
paper it activates a tag it opens up a
web browser and takes you to a website
to download an exclusive droid razr and
wallpaper all using a tat see the
average person doesn't know what NFC is
all I know is they touch their phone to
a piece of paper and they get to
download a cool wallpaper but it lets
people know that NFC is easy and cool
and has neat functions no no you know
what no one else has done that that's
pretty darn cool having definitely it's
simple you will just don't recommend the
m / waiting I mean I don't know
how long it's going to be to wait but
waiting for the razr HD or HD max you
know and they all have great battery
life yes I guess it boils down to do you
want a larger phone or not you know I
like you know some some people within
smaller hands women don't want a large
film you know they don't put the phone
in their pocket you know okay I don't
want to put women into that category
anymore just because I know you people
that I work with women that they just
bought the s3 and they love it yeah I
was going I know what person that has a
note so I mean smoke but I don't know
any vote for change and gloves it or is
I have a 1s because i thought what ex
was to the hot ya know there are women
out there that definitely like bigger
phones so i think price has to come into
the equation for the m2 cuz yeah that's
the other thing is it's only it's fifty
dollars on contract 99 names i'm sure
the razr HD max will probably be in the
at least 200 probably three yeah like
the last one was when it came out so if
you like things big wait for the razr
maxx in my opinion but if you can't
handle something big need something a
little bit smaller the droid razr m is
the way to go pony NFC story that we're
talking about IFC in the average person
of my father was saying that his Galaxy
Nexus was making weird noises he had his
NFC enabled and whenever he put it by
his wallet it would make a digit and it
was his credit card and it was pretty
funny they kept doing it and he had no
idea why I have it a little bit imagine
that will head had to go pretty good now
let's talk about device it isn't
announced yet the LG optimus G is
supposed to be announced are rumored at
least we assume it's going to be
announced here in a week on September
19 um as a killer phone that that's a
pretty amazing device mean they're
they're packing a lot of uh a lot of
nice hard to when to it yeah you're our
resident hardware guy you want talk
about that for a second yeah on paper
this is a fantastic device it's LG so
I'm still a little skeptical but it is
going to be probably the first stateside
device with the Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
pro the quad-core krait at 1.5 gigahertz
with the new Audrina 320 GPU paired with
the exact same radio that's in this new
in the new iphone and also in every has
other s4 that's been released said Owen
what was what would you say with
comparison to the Quran quad cores out
there like let's say the top three
nothing compares and what why do you say
that is it just faster the Tegra 3 is
roughly comparable in stats to the
dual-core s2 okay so in terms of
comparison is we roughly double if not
more okay it is vastly better than
anything else currently on the market
that's not to say that it's going to
continue to be vastly better than things
coming from other manufacturers in the
next few months but compared to anything
else currently available it is vastly
better and I wonder how they're going to
work with battery consumption yeah I
mean that is still a question mark yeah
because we know that what words can you
know suck battery life especially when
it's coupled with an LTE um you know so
should be interesting to see if the
battery life stays the same or the
technology that call calm uses should
help keep power in check but there's a
lot of other sort of question marks in
terms of what's using power in your
device beyond just the processor and
this also has a 4.7 inch what they call
true HD IPS plus I don't know why what
makes it more true HD than any other HD
but it's 1280 by 768 so it 317 pixels
per inch so very dense um that's not
quite as pixel dense as the the iphone's
but it is into apples Retina
category of over 300 on the radio that
Senate is the the same mdn 9615 that's
in the iPhone 5 so have msn or excuse me
GSM UMTS WC DNA cdma LTE all over the
world so it's a very good pic chip for
that um and the disability of the ten
FBI PS Plus should be beautiful Fernando
Mong Cheng grow he has where you guys
think about google wallet and Google
removing prepaid cards yeah well we kind
of hit that earlier and I see it as a no
brainer for google there's no need for a
prepaid card anymore because i'll call
your cards are supported the original
reason that you had them was in case you
don't citibank master cuddle well yeah
yeah not all cards were supported so if
you wanted to use your google wallet he
didn't have a citibank mastercard he had
to to add money to a prepaid card now
since all cards are supported you need
to do that anymore so it doesn't affect
me ah what i do i am curious about
though is is you know and that was
always an incentive to use google wall
is why hey i got ten bucks for just
getting this device to you you know you
get your nexus 7 your Galaxy Nexus you
activate it and you get to get 10 bucks
so how they do in the future they gonna
give you maybe a gift card or are they
just doing away with it I don't know I
mean I hope they bring out gift cards I
I feel like that'd be useful and erica's
makes a good point but not everybody has
a regular credit card yeah but then how
if you don't have a regular critic or
how you gonna add money to the prepaid
card think uh I mean that you not the
same way early on whenever we had the
prepaid cards it just got annoying
because you I mean you'd add on even
amounts you'd always end up with an
uneven amount left into your account
you'd have to keep adding keypad you
know I mean you might have
one dollar 67 cents left after you make
a purchase it's just kind of just laying
there with your dad yeah studies like
what am I going to spend this only get a
pack of gum or something like that maybe
that's a better thing to have I mean
maybe eventually they'll tie it into
your you know you might have it where
you can just have your bank account
information baked in the Google Wallet
itself and then and that's directly off
that future so what about the actual
card part of it so Jonathan are you
saying that you can buy a stick of gum
from the Play Store which maybe maybe
I'm in fig just run through your
versions of anything I see if you can
convert that ten dollars of Google
Wallet into play store credit be nice
well if you get the refund well right
but then I've got ten dollars in cash
that I don't necessarily need to spend
at the Play Store in this murder of
googled a lot and spending it there
though yeah you're right that would be
smart on them now that would that would
be smart marketing decision to keep it
in their ecosystem yeah so so let's talk
about on device Iran come at I'm curious
what you guys think about this so
motorola which is you know now Google
announced the cloud BB and that is a
desktop computer running Android and
it's only available in China right now
so it's very much in my opinion
resembles I and imac like an old one you
know a non one device it has an 18 inch
screen toxic smaller than I've act yeah
18 inch screen the resolution that is
1366 x 768 win it it's a touchscreen it
has a 1 gigahertz freescale arm cortex
a8 cpu gig of ram for gigs of internal
storage has a very highly customized
desktop launcher what we would think and
it reacts as a desktop writer since it's
on gingerbread yeah hey you took away my
phone sorry it's running android
gingerbread 2.3 point for
it's a very customized mush so you see
your guarantee that it doesn't have NFC
yeah that's true you can also guarantee
that your evo your original evo can help
perform it and didn't Google nix the
desktop uh with the webtop uh technology
for motorola motorola did it on their
own I was kind of surprised they came
with an initial racer update they wanted
plain stock tablet interface on the web
top aqua and that was how I was shocked
when I self cuz a friend of mine has a
razr maxx and he showed me when he
plotted over hdmi was pretty impressive
yeah I mean they could potentially do
great things with that but i think that
there's a bigger market in a better way
to implied it i think i would rather see
them maybe do like they did with roo bun
too and maybe we do it with chrome OS
once someone's chrome gets better arm
support i think it would be legitimate
to do that so it boils down to is this
is the first device that motorola and
google it is putting out having android
wrong the desktop so what i really call
it a desktop right like it's is it
really geared towards having a keyboard
of mouse yes it has a user it hasn't it
has a keyboard mouse it looks like a a
imac you know keyboard malice not you
know oh god yeah and I really think that
it's more so it was motorola when they
were motorola mobility still a let the
initiative go through obviously yeah i
hate Europe that's what I mean look like
we were talking about last show is kind
of give it some time and we'll see them
through google and motorola devices I'd
so the HTC One X plus we've got some
rumors about that right yeah yeah so
today you have an HTC One S yes okay so
as it HTC one s you know similar to the
one x line what do you think about the
the x plus now and we had some
information leaked that came out on
twitter so you know if you want to
believe he leaked on twitter you know
it's obviously up in the air but that
those rumors put it running the Tegra 3
plus it with a 1.6 gigahertz quad-core
maybe a 1.7 gigahertz single core
processor yeah that's the way the the
Tegra 3 is work when it's running in
single core mode it will clock higher
than once it goes to all four cores it's
slightly lower okay so anything do
anything different does it's a higher
speed processor from from Tegra or from
nvidia it's basically deep sex I'm Tegra
3 that we've been seeing it's just
overclocked we see we see a gig of ram
and a 32 gig rom an 1800 milliamp hour
battery yeah I mean it's a boost over
the original international 1x but it's
only a slight boost it is not yeah it's
a very slight boost the big deal I think
is that it other rumors I've heard or
that it's gonna be coming with jelly
bean and with sense 4.5 so I think
that's the more interesting part about
it I also don't yet know what carriers
it's supposed to be on I've heard AT&amp;amp;T
I've heard t-mobile I I don't know if
it's only a TNT I think that's more
interesting because then it's gonna have
LTE together with a tiger three
manufacturers need to push the all
carrier aspect it works for samsung and
it will work for other companies too
it'll work for the iphone as well yeah i
mean HTC tried and failed yeah i think
that's part of the reason samsung so
successful because this is really a
downer when you see an awesome phone
AT&amp;amp;T or tmobile and you're not with them
and they have to wait six months to see
it come out it's just really just kind
of drops the bottom out from under you
when you haven't wait that long and
stare at it yeah so acer isn't really
know putting out a whole lot of
smartphones right
um acer is coming out with the cloud
mobile s500 yeah it's good you know I'm
interested in this because it's it's an
acer uh you know they're generally not
produced a whole lot of phones I think
only one phone previous this it could be
wrong I've been wrong once my life so
all the chance number two um okay we
don't generally see you a lot to make
sure i mean i have an easter iconia a500
tablet nearly anyone hires a great
tablet it seven hundred mean they make a
lot of nice tablets they're not top at
the end you know must have to die for
tablets but but they're nice tablet so
i'm curious to see what how this is
going to work out and it's all bit
smaller then you know the bigger
five-inch phones that are becoming the
norm it's a 4.3 inch phone has a gig of
ram 8gig of internal memory which is all
a gang that's all small compared to you
know the big guy we're just talking
about 32 gig phone an 8-megapixel
rear-facing camera and if you want to
update the storage well you know you can
slap a microSD card in there but the big
thing about this device is it it is the
resolution of that 4.3 inch HD IPS
display it'sit's 1280 by 720 which
actually turns out to be 342 pixels per
inch and that iphone man that I found
your that awesome magical device it it's
only rock'n say retina one more
sometimes retina it's 326 pixels per
inch so acer is putting out a higher
pixel density screen that's cool same
density has the HTC Rezound that came
out closet I know the Razon was the
first is actually surprised a surprising
those are the two most pixel density
vices on the market not I anything yeah
so a guy of ICS yeah you know and we can
sweep we can argue about that again it
sucks it's horrible but you know bring
your pitchfork to kill the fire we don't
want ICS on devices such as this but
that's what we're getting it's a hgf
hspa+ device so you know its own lives
so with that I said tmobile it is to say
itself so international users uh and
t-mobile users that rejoice and have a
processor it is doesn't uh you know I
didn't see that on the release i I've
been said to see it sounds like a
glaring omission MIT in Tel Dan Intel is
it no no it's gonna be a little upset
there for a second oh you don't get
upset over hardware oh that's true the
Intel is do look impressive and I just
don't expect them to be in high-end
devices right now there's warming I go
on the root and Robin realm and um so
real quick who's gonna see him 1000
things real quick on that region ramen
so cm10 did something we'll meet they
haven't done before they came out with
monthly bills some people call milestone
bills but you know or you know my my
mind as they send our website whatever
you want to call it it can often em
build it all that means is it's an
experimental build and what they did
about a week prior to releasing the M
bill based they did a code freeze on new
features and this worked on you know
plumbing up some of the bugs that they
have it you know state and make it a
little bit more stable than a nightly
built and that's what that's what it is
it's more stable than nightly it's an
experimental those are going to be a bug
yes my camera force closed about two
hours ago taking a picture and I'm
around the M bill so yeah there are
there are still bugs in it it's it's an
experimental build it's a more stable
than nightly yes should you run it what
if you run the nightly it's more stable
than nightly is it is it a release
canutillo types ability no is it awesome
yes and they plan to continue to do this
all the way up until stable if the
response is good so if you're seeing fan
let them know that yes this is cool keep
it up we like it and we'll see more on
the CM in front as well we saw the zoom
LT eating in zoom Wi-Fi get
some gingerbread well our gingerbread
well gazzara jellybean love uh we get
some gingerbread love you guys have to
see gingerbread running are those
devices actually there you go cm 747 on
my Nexus does that be an inside project
and we don't take it up oh I says what I
guarantee nobody has ever worked on no
so the wing ray and the Stingray I got
some jellybeans love from CM and yeah
the Wi-Fi that's nothing new for the
Wi-Fi addition to have jellybeans
because it officially has it we haven't
seen a whole lot of love coming to the
LTE variant which is on everybody's
favorite fast to update carrier verizon
wireless so those of you that have them
such as Scott I've got the thing to know
John has one to regret it so what last
but not least see in the signage modern
announced that they're gonna update some
AOSP acts such as the clock him the
clocks pretty much it's an alarm clock
in a clock if that that's all that it is
would it be nice we can do more such as
be you know a timer or stopwatch yep
those features are coming out thanks to
thanks to see em and and they're in the
midst it hasn't been approved yet but
I'll Garrett there's an actually I think
it's even on the Play Store actually to
demo there's a new calculator as well so
it'll be as long as you know all the
bugs get worked out will see that it in
future iterations of CM too very cool
very cool the CM team is is always
trying to do things to keep us
interested in them and in innovating
yeah it made more than half which we'll
get to right now all right so you guys
know about the iphone release apples
want to learn release um we gotta talk
about it just because it's a big release
and there they always have big releases
not saying that they're a big release
into the future but they are big
releases and people are going to buy a
lot of you know that on this though we
kind of want to do a little bit of a
comparison between the iphone and iOS
somewhat it kind of has to offer versus
the Android ecosystem years ago as well
as today and how it kind of matches up
so uh yeah and what we got for um these
specs for the bird where we really don't
have a whole lot of information on the
specs for the hardware we know it as an
a6 processor they gave us some
performance specs of being twice as fast
as the a5 I also assume that's the
iphone 4s running on iOS 5 compared to
the iphone 5 running on iOS 6 so some of
that's attributable to the operating
system and not the processor um twice as
fast graphics processors usually you
know kind of arbitrary comparison
numbers they don't tell me anything
about the actual chip one of the big is
because i think is the bigger screen i
mean i think a lot of people that have
the lesser rock homes or their previous
gen iphones are going to look at it and
be like oh ok is it has a 4-inch screen
but we all know in the Android world
that we've had less than 4 inch screens
we've had up to 5.3 inch screens and
they've been phones and they come in
every shape color size weight whatever
prices as well so 4 inches adding point
5 inches to it is not that big of a deal
and it still does not i would say on
android 4.3 is this is the standard
lowest screen size there's a few forage
but they're getting hard to find these
days yeah uh so what's the biggest
announcement about what's the most
impressive stat about to scott the most
to you soon i would say that it's a
really impressive but the fact that it
does have LTE which it didn't before
that's a great on upgrade for
particularly find impressive that they
have created to using these are
technologies every other company boards
been using since the first quarter of
this year but
isn't there a little bit of caveat with
that yes for cdma carriers to really
just for Sprint and Verizon um unlike
everybody else using this particular
radio Apple will tell you that the
hardware itself does not allow for you
to do simultaneous cdma at a voice and
data or side-by-side cdma voice and LTE
data um that statement really
demonstrates a lack of understanding
from apple it's the exact same radio
that's used in every Snapdragon s4
device so that's the Samsung Galaxy S on
all four carriers that's the HTC one x
and s and incredible and all three of
them you will enroll us and really any
device that's been released this year
with LTE the exact same radio is all of
these all of those on cdma carriers can
do simultaneous voice and data over CMA
or side by side voiceover CMA and data
over ltp this is an iphone problem in an
apple problem notice that they decided
basically to conserve space and and does
not bother to go out of their way for
cdma carriers basically they needed to
add an extra antenna to allow for that
scenario and they decided not to to
conserve space so it was very much a we
don't this device is looking pretty is
more important to us than it functioning
well yep and I think one of the really
big things especially for users as well
as developers is the fact that they
change the screen size 24 inches now
this is the one of the first iterations
of fragmentation for the iOS ecosystem
just because really the first you know
it really is because all the other
extreme resolutions have been a multiple
of 4 a-4 yeah I mean the only the only
other split that we've seen is the phone
to the pad right they I found rich the
ipad was the first big jump but the
different sizes of the phones or the
different sizes of the ipads of all that
perfect scales of the previous
yeah having this four inches not be a
multiplier of four is an issue because
all apps that are not compatible with
the new resolution are going to have a
basically a letter box of black bars
that take up the screen and you're just
going to see a regular iphone 4 or
iphone 4s look and it's just a black bar
so this is really unfortunate and they
haven't developed a way to automatically
scale your ex like Android has so and an
Android users haven't even made fun of
this at all I haven't seen anybody
making images of long skinny phones like
a hundred stories high or being used as
life savers or anything like that I mean
his right users are basically feeling so
sorry for iOS about make it this at
all like I may have slipped a time or
two I have to only once used by Oh more
than more than one occasion when it
messed up and slip one in one came out
of the iphone 6 7 8 9 10 and each one's
getting longer and longer hager I
haven't seen no no oh I'm sure it's
gonna be coming soon and it wasn't
trying out google plus I mean oh god I
but i need a bus at all day dairy didn't
get flamed for either no i did not visit
there was no trolling there was no
trolling done you were just pointing it
out dude no I'm saying you got troubles
you're raising rails oh I was accused of
being a troll yes because I made a
comment hey look it's trending it's like
oh no look there's such a troll Derek
you know what people tell so insulting
California damn hippies are hippies if
you write they are hippies let me know
it's kind of interesting there because
they're finally kind of suffering the
limitations of their own framework now
yeah because they never ever told
developers to get ready to be able to
scale up
different and they are so mean on the
other hand it's not like this hasn't
been leaked extremely well its last six
months and it is just fun because now
they've I don't know how they're gonna
do they gonna separate the different
types of apps in the App Store to ya
backwards compatibility perhaps so like
if you're getting an iphone if you're
still out iphone 3g or 3gs you have to
download all of the extra crap for those
ridiculously high res ipad these photos
true or it to free her comparatively
very low resolution iphone 3g they lost
like the app spy advice yeah the last
thing I kind of wanted to bring up with
regard to the iphone is the biggest lack
thereof and that little technology
called NFC that's been slowly being
adopted and we kind of need a number
phone or phones as many as we can to
push the push this standard NFC the
iphone does not have NFC um which is
unfortunate because less people are
going to adopt it quicker but if it did
have NFC it would have been great for us
Andrew people as well as iOS people and
everybody would have been happy so I
think it's kind of a bummer and the
remarks made by the Apple CEOs and stuff
about NFC and the importance of it kinda
made me upset so this is a selfish very
specific these most polite way to put it
but the thing is they need to have
features that they don't have in the
next phone in order for people to buy
their next phone so I mean really I
think that it may come out later if it
is adopted things like that yeah they
just don't have a way of monetizing yet
yeah that's the only thing that's on
them back because I you know Microsoft
has their you know Microsoft developed
theirs and they're using NFC with Nokia
and of course Google's got google wallet
i think apple just doesn't have any
ecosystem to tie into to make it a thing
they know that if they hold back longer
and it's kind of that's what makes me
mad is it it's holding us back it's
loading windows phone back it's holding
you know yeah I don't know if blackberry
10 is going to have NFC but it's I mean
they're just screwing over the rest of
the end
straight because of their own so my
largest observation about the iphone was
the wii android users android fans
aren't the only ones that see this as
not that big of a deal upon looking at
various Mac forums people were actually
saying I'm just going to wait for the
iphone 5s you know we know which is
unannounced a year from now I mean that
one that one's that one's gonna kill
Android ha how wanna be the one that
doesn't this next why where have I heard
this before and you imagine i follow
Sprint's gonna kill Android next Nexus
to come out and let's just give it a
name the rumored name was rumored to be
a lot of the the Samsung Galaxy Nexus to
wow that's a shorten it needs to be
longer it's an android phone okay that's
announced everybody look at and say no
away for the god to Nexus three I mean
yes yeah I can't imagine in the Android
will sing now i'm just gonna wait for
next year's model that's pretty bad so
I'm curious I mean they're gonna sell a
lot oh sure they haven't already they
sold out there there appreciate like wow
with then again like you look at it I
think with jimmy kimmel give me come
with an iphone 4 I was really falling
people as an iphone 5 never reveal oh my
god so much that i have an iphone and
this is so much faster oh wait it's
lighter it's a rock that look at that
straight like come on now now if you
haven't seen it yet check out Jimmy
Kimmel's YouTube video he speaking of
trolling what was the public he chose
them a year old device and everybody
thinks it's a mess like that it wasn't
it was a for you know either way what
kind of nice devotes the big question is
ok you can they even right
changed their design because if they you
know abandon their own trade dress then
how are they going to claim somebody's
infringing on it if they just radically
change it up all of a sudden they're not
going to be able to say you know we're
using rectangles of rounded corners too
because there isn't they advised okay
and making a joke that I'm going to
patent something else try notice to sum
up the release kind of lackluster kind
of holding everybody back um catching up
another yeah catching good way to put it
I so let's do it we got some Kirian news
yeah you know LTE all the things right
android users need know where we can get
some LT ease and uh and iPhone users not
to yes well good on either device so no
no watch you soon um so ATT they're
expanding their network and they have to
write they're pretty much know where uh
they're going to be coming to
Philadelphia yeah Pennsylvania oh that's
bird I'm right in the middle so I can't
use it uh Seattle one in the dozens of
other places across the country
basically they're they're planning on
hitting up 44 new markets not in the
minute in the very near future by the
end of the year they're gonna they're
gonna be they said in a total of
forty-four markets by the end of the
wait wait that's a total I thought that
was just 40 more than 40 for more new
markets by thing on no no just oh wow
burning up what made oh yes Pegasus
rider 380 something but resins covering
seventy-five percent of the market of
the closure great Nate me they're going
40 44 cities 18t cog 344 yeah they're
doing it right um now speaking a big guy
big daddy big red verizon also announced
this past week that they're expanding in
areas such as its bird can I love to our
view it doesn't anything for me um
Kansas City Lawrence Kansas City
actually a Kansas and Missouri Tampa
Florida Tallahassee Florida Buffalo New
York whole bunch of places yeah it looks
like eastern Kansas and big chunks of
southern and western Florida State that
are also hitting up to me ya know I mean
their plan is but in 2013 to have their
network as bit their 4g network as big
as a 3g network so get in everywhere ya
know they are moving very quickly now
the little one little guys loyalty
sprint you know that's only in less than
ten areas right now right um which
doesn't sound that bad next to 44 really
i mean that's twenty-five percent i'm as
they started after know well Spring
spreads hit it pretty hard they're
looking to be in a hundred markets in
the coming months so is that money any
more markets yeah hundred more market so
they're definitely going to be larger
than eighteen t if they can bring this
to fruition very quickly well the list
is too large to list here you can check
sir sprint's website can check our
website or authority calm and you can
find out the list they were where we
actually list every place they're going
to be basically it's not bad they're
blanketing a lot of major areas from
coast to coast in many places in between
so I could go ahead and I hit up our
website but it's more than double 18 T's
footprint and in half the time I really
really think that sprint is going to be
a force to be reckoned I think so they
are investing so much money into their
network and the fact that their LTE
network is upgradeable um which that's a
very strong point of good base to start
on yes oh this is your sprint gonna be a
force to be reckoned with yeah verizon
still revision 8mm with sprint starting
with nine yeah easy step 210 yeah yeah
no I mean this is the this is the
benefit of sprint's network vision right
like the fact that they can just flip a
switch and turn on a hundred cities
overnight and AT&amp;amp;T can't do that
verizon's moving fast but even they
can't just boom 100 cities and over the
next couple of months late that's
because sprint went around and upgraded
their network to prep for its now all
they have to do is just flip a switch
and boom you've got LTE and it's
concentric with all of their other
towers so all they have to do is flip a
switch and it covers the exact same as
their 3g footprint not hate to be on the
don't do t whenever they do flip that so
sure yeah because what's the other hand
they don't exactly have a lot of it is
technician for that one yeah all right
well there's no other further questions
