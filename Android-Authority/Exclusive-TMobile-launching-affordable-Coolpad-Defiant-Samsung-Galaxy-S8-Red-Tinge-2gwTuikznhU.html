about a new affordable device launching
called the cool pad defiant launched by
who t-mobile now there are plenty of
options out there for those of you who
want to buy a new device and not break
the bank and we have our list of
favorites but new ones keep showing up
every day and this week we learned of a
new contender on the block coming from
t-mobile a reputable source has given us
intel on what seemed to be magentas next
budget handset the cool pad defiant we
have no details on pricing or
availability but it specs suggest a very
low cost option the de plan comes with
Android 7.0 i 1.4 gigahertz quad-core
processor and Adreno 308 GPU one
gigabyte of RAM 8 gigabytes of internal
storage and a 5-inch 80-54 by 480 screen
a 5 megapixel camera and a 2 megapixel
front shooter and a twenty 450 million
power battery now that is nothing to
write home about but this is a phone
that could get the job done for the
casual user it will also likely be super
cheap is it good enough for your needs
well probably not for all you power
users but for your Android geeks out
there many of you are going to love the
Samsung Galaxy s8
and you may have heard rumblings about a
red tint issue on the display and
Consumer Reports has chimed in about a
week ago we reported that some galaxy s
8 and si plus units have red tints
around the screen consumer reports have
recently tested eight units of Samsung's
flagship smartphones four of each model
and provided some additional information
regarding the topic four of the eight
devices tested apparently have a reddish
screen when compared to other models
Consumer Reports compared two devices
one with a red tint and the other
without side-by-side while displaying
the same image the conclusion is that
the difference between the two is
visible but as the quote red tinge photo
looked appealing and natural it's not
really that big of a deal
Samsung has already released a statement
on the issue saying that it's just a
matter of color collaboration that can
be adjusted manually
to do so just open the settings menu on
your device tap on display and then
screen mode the tech giant added that it
will release a software update as early
as this week that will provide users
with an enhanced ability to adjust the
color setting to their liking well it
turns out that t-mobile is not the only
unlikely new player in the hardware
scene Spotify is trying to launch a new
wearable it looks like the popular
streaming service Spotify wants to get
into the hardware market a recently
posted job listing for the company
confirmed that it's looking to hire a
quote senior project manager of hardware
with the description stating that the
person will leave Spotify Zephyr to
deliver hardware directly from Spotify
to existing and new customers the job
listing ads that Spotify wants to
release quote a category defining
product akin to Pebble watch Amazon echo
and snap spectacles unquote
that's not funny which first reported in
the job listing ads that quote a trusted
source claimed Spotify wants to release
a wearable hardware product but
specifics were not mentioned based on
the job listing it looks like Spotify
wants to jump start a whole new product
category for its first hardware launch
one possibility is that the company
could release headphones that would
directly connect to the music streaming
service without the need for a smart
phone or a smart watch app and if that
wasn't enough when it comes to
unexpected hardware innovations let's
talk about Samsung's effort to create a
truly bezel if display including bezel s
top and bottom according to ET news
samsung Display and LG Display are
looking for ways to create phones that
are truly bezel as' and all screen by
curving all sides and eliminating even
the top and bottom bezels however the
same source reports that there are
technical difficulties in the lamination
process and that's why it's likely we
won't see the displays until next year
the trouble is however even when a
display is curved on all four sides the
four corners are essentially useless the
current lamination process won't let
these corners register your touch
Samsung and LG are both reportedly
looking for ways to solve this issue
with Samsung tentatively aiming to
unveil an edge display with four curves
as early as next year while the Galaxy S
a duo did a remarkable good job in
minimizing
bezels hitting a screen to body ratio of
around 83% the general consensus is that
with the screen that's curved on both
sides as well as the top and bottom that
number could be even higher
each e-news seems to think that it could
be as high as 98% if not higher</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
