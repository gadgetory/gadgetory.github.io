domain.com many of you are hungry for
news regarding the Samsung Galaxy s7 and
s7 edge and we found recent rumors that
suggests that design wise it will be
much more of the same with a bit more
kick under the hood now many people love
the design of the s6 and s6 edge and
that's a good thing because we're
probably going to have it for a long
time at the same time however the lack
of removable battery and micro SD card
support angered long-term users the big
question now especially made mounting
rumors is just what the Galaxy s7 and s7
edge will ultimately shape up to be
according to a new report from the
Korean times the shape itself may not be
much of a surprise a source who spoke to
the news organization via telephone
offered the following as the s6 and s6
edge represented progress the s7 will
have improvements both in picture
quality and performance but because
smartphones have already been
commoditized you don't need to spend
more on surface overhaul you see
although consumers like you and me are
always looking for something new and
interesting design wise from the
manufacturers point of view it's like
pulling teeth for a major change like
that they want to maximize the profit
from that investment on the initial
design and that means usually a two or
three year time span of using the same
basic design before they make a massive
change that's the habit that Samsung has
had I mean look at the galaxy s2 s3 and
s4 they pretty much all look the same
and the s5 was that whole sora excuse
for design called the band-aid apple has
been the master of this i mean they've
changed the design maybe once or twice
from their phones it's something
manufacturers do to this end it is
suggested that the new pair of premium
products to be released early next year
will focus more on increased performance
from the system on a chip new ram and a
brighter and higher-quality AMOLED panel
rumors have also suggested that the s7
and s7 edge may also have micro SD card
support but those who are hoping for a
removable
battery prepare yourself for
disappointment you see Samsung has been
suffering from a recent decline in
mobile revenue and market share due to
no small measure to keen competition
from China once the undisputed leader in
said country domestic OEM such as Xiaomi
huawei Oppo and 1 plus have eroded the
stronghold Samsung once had these
manufacturers many selling exclusively
online and thus eliminating the costs
associated with marketing and
traditional distribution channels are
offering highly competitive products
that costs far below those of the old
guard of Android namely Samsung even the
verge recently declared that quote the
flagship smartphone is dead now that
just means the most popular best selling
smartphones won't always be the premium
most expensive option and Samsung knows
that changes in the air Samsung's top
management is well aware of the
situation and has been taking drastic
action in recent weeks perhaps with the
most notable being this week's replacing
of their head of mobile operations this
came shortly after a powerful call to
arms from the conglomerate vice chairman
who stated that quote if we resist
changes then we won't survive unquote
what do you guys think let me know in
the comments below I will be reading
them I know from our article poll most
of you feel that that micro SD card
support is all important yes for those
