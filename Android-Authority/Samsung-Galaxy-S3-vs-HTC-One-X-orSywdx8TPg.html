today I'm doing a video comparison mitts
with the newly released Samsung Galaxy
s3 and the HTC One X first off how the
phones feel to hold both phones are very
light the HTC One X is a unibody design
which gives it sort of finer finish and
feel and the Samsung Galaxy s3 has a
removable back but still feels very
smooth to hold regardless now I'm going
to turn them both on to give you an idea
for the boot up time the galaxy s3 has a
1.9 megapixel front facing camera the
HTC One X has a 1.3 megapixel front
camera both have eight megapixel rear
facing cameras and both have the new
burst shot feature the screen on the One
X is four point eight inches with 1200
80 by 720 pixels and the Samsung Galaxy
s3 has the same amount of pixels spread
across to four point nine inches as it
says here the One X has Beats Audio
whilst the s3 only has a single speaker
as you can see the s3 boots up using
TouchWiz much faster than sense four
moments ever
okay so an application launched to give
you an idea remember this is a 1.5
gigahertz quad-core this is a 1.4 one of
my favorite apps reddit sync at the same
time as you see there but one excellent
slightly faster but only marginal let's
try another application such as the Play
Store again the One X close a little bit
faster but if you're buying a phone for
the speed then these already the phones
to compare isn't they're both pretty
much the same one thing where the One X
is far better is in the sound quality
using the Beats Audio system on the rear
this speaker here and this one now you
get far finest sound quality than you do
under this three so that's from the Onyx
and this is from the s3 slightly tinea
not quite as clear as is on the Onyx now
a camera test for you they're both eight
megapixel cameras
fizzle oh yeah
here's the old s2 the s3 is little I
wish something to remark upon the HOME
key is much nicer than on the newest so
students confusion
to get this pattern on the table and
remember this when it's per shot so it's
not took about 30 photos in one they're
very useful for any situation we need to
take several home photos at once also
it's the best shot feature where I think
what might be yep detects which was the
best and then saves it for you and
deletes the others doesn't yep till it's
the other ones similarly on the s3 you
have a burst shot feature which isn't
where it doesn't rest under the same
button on screen as the single shot you
have to take select burst shot
separately you can turn on best photo as
you see instead of making the sound it
just takes a photos with a progress bar
on the bottom once it's taken me and you
click ok it doesn't choose an automatic
good for you it recommends it
you don't still have to select the one
which is the theme spaced and click done
to save it then difference in the soft
keys the 1 X uses a soft yeah the s3
uses a hardware key normally I'm in
favor of her becuse however the s3 they
didn't in my opinion a very bad HOME key
it's very plastic he wrote a key and
it's springs back rather poorly on the
s2 the home button of square it was more
prominent and it was much more tactile
responsive the 1x if you switch between
apps a lot has the recent apps button in
place off the menu
because the 1x favors ice cream
sandwiches menu button on screens of my
blog play store up here you'll see the
three dots used on-screen in place of a
soft key on the s3 so instead you get
the recent apps button in its place
which I suppose is nice enough if you
like to switch applications this similar
function to be triggered on the s2 by
double tapping that sorry by holding
down on the HOME key
not quite as nice as the 1x but performs
the same function personally I would buy
the Samsung Galaxy s3 it's slightly
although it is slightly larger Oh
incidentally both phones are exactly the
same width
although the s3 is about a single
millimeter taller person thereby the s3
because it seems to me more responsive
than the HTC One X also
I prefer TouchWiz the user interface
since for for me I've never any like
sense but they claimed to improve things
and sense for and for me they haven't
it's still clunky it's still bloated as
you can see in there there's a lot of
bloatware and as in second digital movie
editor but you just don't need you
should be able to download them
separately the applications on the s3
that on this screen and those two of
them top that's all you get
there's tire and I believe TouchWiz is
programmed by Samsung far better than
sense ever has been by HTC so that
concludes my video comparison and thank
you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
