Authority we're here today at the arm
techcon 2015 in California and I've got
with me mark Dickerson from arm hello
mark nice to have you here hello right
so does little bit about yourself and
what role you have an arm ok so I'm
general manager of the media processing
group that's the group that are
responsible for the development of the
graphics processors video display
processes everything that's in the vid
in the media pipeline in a in the main
markets retargeting our mobile but our
products go into a quite a wide range of
markets mobile being the dominant one
obviously video is a big part of the
mobile experience from the UI all the
way through to gaming so in fact it's a
big part of the silicon as well is it on
top of on the system on a chip at the
GPU is quite a big part absolutely the
only again it depends on the exact
configuration but typically the GPU
could take up to about twenty-five
percent of the silicon area so people
have to think very carefully about
making their choices on the whole of the
GPU and the graphics subsystem if you
like and making sure that that is you
know efficient from an area point of
view and power-efficient really because
it does you know take up quite a lot of
the silicon real estate and you talked
about power obviously when we play games
we can feel the back of our phones
heating up a little bit without 3d
graphics of course arms aim is to keep
that power consumption as low as
possible exactly and another way depends
on the range again but if you look at
the at the high end it's it's it's more
of a how much can I do for the maximum
power I can afford within the power
envelope we continually strive for more
and more capability so if we just reduce
the power people going to put more in
and so really the way you look at it is
is we've got this ceiling we mustn't go
past and what can we do with in that
ceiling and that ceiling is determined
by I would like to be able to play a
game for a few hours without having to
have my phone you know plugged in now
there's also been some new announcements
from arm recently the Molly 470 GPU toy
tell me a bit about that please yes so
one of the areas that's interesting in
graphics is is this migration to small
form factors things like wearable
devices where we want something which is
very
active and got the sort of you I that
you you're used to on a smartphone but
is in a different you know in a wearable
form factor or a different form factor
in fact we've become so accustomed to
smartphones that that we that we really
demand that sort of high quality of user
experience or interaction even if it's
something relatively modest and and the
470 is designed exactly for that it's
designed to be very small and by
extremely power efficient it's fifty
percent less power consumption than
anything we've done before so a really
big step in terms of power efficiency
and and it's designed to be supporting
the types of applications that you would
see for us for a SmartWatch for example
and really good look at it two ways as
two modes if you like predominantly one
is an ambient mode where you just wanted
to tell the time and it's updating
relatively modestly you want it to
absolutely be consumed as little as
possible and then as soon as you're
reacting and interacting with it you
wanted to be just as reactive as your
smartphone so then you've got to be you
know you've got to have a reasonable
graphics performance then to be able to
support a very good interactive display
so that's really where we're targeting
we see we see wearables as one area we
still also a lot of potentially new
areas in sort of the whole of the IOT
area where there will be things that we
didn't use to have displays before that
will now start having displays whether
it be a you know a desk phone for
example a printer you know lots of areas
where you would want to display that you
didn't have one before you want that
good graphics experience so the 470 was
designed specifically for this low-end
IOT and entry smartphone market exactly
for the primary primary focus is on
power and and and secondary focus on on
area because it's also a high-volume
market therefore very very cost
sensitive so those are two sort of main
criteria extra the other end of the
market we've got new GPUs coming down
the line I know you can't talk much
about those but what are some of the
factors are driving the GPU market
forward so yeah the one of the things
that we see in the industry is that we
sort of in some sense is saturated on
the on the number of pixels if you like
on it on a screen we don't need tablets
with any more resolution or smartphones
with any more resolution because we
typically
see it I'll come back to that in a
second because that's not quite true but
so what we're seeing is a much greater
emphasis on the complexity that we can
support in other words they the finest
of the geometry or that or the behavior
of the interaction of the graphics
within a scene a good example of that
would be something like smoke which you
know is sort of in a one-hand quite
trivial but actually making that
realistic in a physics type of way takes
a huge amount of computational power and
and so the focus if you like is on what
I would sort of call quality not
quantity in terms of the pixels that
we're providing but but let me step back
a bit as well because there's one thing
that's driving the pixel density as well
which is actually virtual reality and
there you put huge demands on virtual on
the resolution because now you've got to
have two images not one and you've got
to update them at approximately twice
the rate that you would do in the best
for the best possible smartphone so 120
FPS is sort of what you need to give
your give a low latency experience of
you I again and if you see juddering or
if you see latency in VR it does have
some rather unpleasant side effects on
you so VR is driving I wouldn't say it's
that you know the dominant feature yet
and I think there's still a question
mark exactly where it will it'll pan out
but it is it is something that we're
working very hard on to make sure that
our future high-end GPUs support that
use case you know very well and of
course the gear VR from Samsung of
course uses the samsung phones they've
all got Molly GPUs in them so that's you
actually on the leading edge of that in
terms of consumer products as well I'm
very glad you brought that up yes
absolutely yes though we saw we've been
working very closely with Samsung with
oculus to try and make sure that we so
they've been working with silicon that
exists of course that's in their phones
today but we've also been working very
hard on software to to do some things
which and not should we say the first
thing that you would think of in the
normal graphics case latency I mentioned
is one of the areas where you've really
got to get that latency down to the
minimum for for VR in a game it's less
important
and you can tolerate a little bit more
latency so you have typically in
gratitude have quite a deep pipeline of
things going on it you've really got to
work hard on that with the art ashore
t'en at pipeline to give you a very
reactive because when you plan your head
like this you know you want the world to
move with you you don't want it to move
slightly later and that drives a lot of
the so we don't all work if you like on
the software side as well to to improve
the optimize the VR use case so that
just shows of course that ultimately end
experience is always hardware and
software combined together and arm does
both of course exactly and and it's
interesting I mean just in terms of the
you know the group that I run a half of
the people in it are software engineers
so it's it's there's a lot of software
to to support as well yeah absolutely
that's great mark thanks right well I'm
Gary Sims here from tech comm with
spring to mark Dickinson from arm thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
