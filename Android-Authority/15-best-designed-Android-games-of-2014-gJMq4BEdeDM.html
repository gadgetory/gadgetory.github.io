Hindy the android authority app guy and
in this video we're going to round up
the 15 best design games from 2014
Assassin's Creed pirates was actually
released in mid-december of 2013 but
that's close enough for us the game
features sweeping landscapes and ocean
views that are among the best that
you'll see on mobile the combat system
is elegant and authentic which is a
surprise given that this is mostly a tap
to play sort of game it's one of the
precious few videogame crossovers that
have been successful and it's clear that
a lot of work went into this one the
banner saga looks like it was animated
by Disney circa nineteen ninety and that
gives it an undeniable charm there is
also a soundtrack that is far above
average for a mobile game and that adds
to the ambiance of the title as a whole
the gameplay is simple and elegant and
the story is a twisting and winding path
where gamers choose their stories
through their actions it hits all the
right buttons unless you don't like
strategy RPGs Deus Ex the fall is an
action RPG developed by Square Enix and
released earlier this year on Android it
features very good graphics and music
which are two areas that Square Enix has
historically excelled at the story isn't
amazing but it drives the game forward
the gameplay mechanics are very
interesting because you can play a
stealth based game or go all-out action
if you prefer and we like that you have
that option it's had its problems with
bugs but other than that it's really
good to what is a game that shows that
minimalism can look good too the game
has you spending two balls around an
axis to avoid obstacles that are falling
towards you which get progressively
harder to avoid little things in this
game like seeing the paint splatters on
obstacles you hit during prior attempts
and challenges to complete levels in a
certain amount of moves are a nice touch
and the soundtrack is better than anyone
could reasonably expect from a game like
this it's a great time waster no doubt
about it eelus infinity was originally
an iOS exclusive dating all the way back
to 2009 and was finally released on
android in 2014 the game uses
multi-touch to let you move combined
split and otherwise play with planets
and stars in a little universe the retro
style graphics minimal interface unique
soundtrack and fun animations work
together to bring a game that is
more fun than it looks there is also no
in-app purchases which is always a good
thing five nights at freddy's one and
two is a horror survival game that has
literally stolen the genre all for
itself the premises are working as a
security guard who is overlooking a
pizzeria with some really creepy
animatronics if they catch you without
your Freddy fazbear head on you're a
dead person there is above average
graphics with simple gameplay mechanics
along with some really brilliant
lighting that both illuminates and hides
some genuinely creepy characters it's
actually kind of scary notice is a
simulation game where you play God and
rule a world populated by people the
graphics have a cartoon quality to them
but the world around it is almost
totally customizable by you you can
create lakes or dry them up or build
mountains and tear them down and you can
even throw meteors at people all the
while you control and watch over
humanity it's a fun game but the sandbox
style is something unique and we really
like that Leo's fortune was originally
demoed at Google i/o earlier this year
and that automatically launched this
game into stardom thankfully it's
actually pretty good the controls are
easy to learn and use sides of the
screen rather than some weird gestures
or on-screen keypads and that adds a
level of simplicity that perfectly
augments the difficulty of the levels
the graphics and scenery are very
colorful in eyecatching and this may be
among the most beautiful 2d platformers
ever made it would be blasphemy to not
include Monument Valley on this list so
we included it on this list every level
is an optical illusion built into a
puzzle built into another optical
illusion that is just pleasing the play
the pastel colors and simple but
surprisingly effective storyline and
music all lined up perfectly to create
an unforgettable gaming experience its
charm that shoes off of pretty much
everyone who's ever played it with the
only real complaint being how short it
is at first glance played to cure jeans
in space doesn't look like anything
special but it's all in the details the
game was developed by cancer research UK
what it does is borrow some of your
phone's processing power to crunch
numbers for cancer research in the game
you collect element alpha which you
trade in for upgrades all the while a
small part of your system is crunching
numbers in the name of cancer research
everyone should have this game and play
it at least a little bit every week
republic is an action-adventure game
where you play as a guy who hacked into
the security cameras of a huge complex
and you're using them to help a woman
escaped captivity the graphics are far
above average and the gameplay is
something you need
and enjoyable combine that with the
story that leaves you almost in a
constant state of suspense and you have
a game that really stands apart from the
others it is episodic so new episodes
will be released as in-app purchases the
room too is a puzzle game that relies a
lot on hidden clues and intricate
puzzles that are built into various
objects inside the game it has amazing
graphics and the puzzles carry you on a
story that is arcane and dark to give
you an idea of how much people like this
game and has a 4.9 out of 5 star rating
on the google play store with over
80,000 reviews it's a master piece in
the puzzle game genre and makes other
puzzle games look unpolished an amateur
by comparison the shadow fight 2 was
already a popular facebook game when it
was released on android but that doesn't
take away from how good the game is it's
a 2d fighting game that uses silhouettes
instead of character sprites and the
backgrounds are colorful in art scene
this gives it an oddly relaxing and
calming feeling the contrasts nicely
with the intensity of one on one hand to
hand combat add to that some fun moves
fluid animations and interesting touch
controls and you have a fighting game
worth playing smash hit is an infinite
runner that was released earlier this
year as far as infinite runners go smash
hit is gorgeous instead of avoiding
obstacles you throw metal balls at panes
of glass to avoid getting hit by the
glass if you get hit too many times it's
game over it features smoky dark and
colourful levels that work well with the
simplicity of the game and the glass
objects this gives the game a sort of
sophisticated feeling that is generally
uncommon in infinite runners telltale
games have been on fire this year with
their Walking Dead and Game of Thrones
franchises both games feature
above-average graphics that are set in
the world of their respective TV shows
in a way that lets people experience the
story from a more peripheral perspective
in both cases telltale games manages to
do extremely well conveying the feel of
the TV show in the video game format and
they manage to make the games fun to
play once again I'm Joe Hindy from
