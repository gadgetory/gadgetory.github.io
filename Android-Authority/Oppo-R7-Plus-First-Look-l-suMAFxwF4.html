anniversary with the release of a couple
of new smartphones the one you're seeing
here is the larger of the two hey it's
Josh magar from Android authority what's
going on everybody and here is your
first look at the Oppo r7 plus but first
let's take a look at the design you're
going to notice in this particular video
and in with this particular device that
this phone looks a little bit familiar
there's almost this of an iPhone 6 plus
and a huawei mate7 actually sort of got
together and created this particular
phone nonetheless you have a really nice
design all over this particular phone it
is of a metal construction and you have
a little bit of a punch on the sides
there with a lip that comes out in the
chassis but there are subtle curves on
the screen and also on the back the 2.5
D glass on the front covers up this six
inch panel that comes in 1080p
resolution and is an AMOLED screen so
you get some nice colors coming from the
color OS 2.1 on the back you have what
is called a violin arc where they took
the inspiration from the simplicity but
also the elegance of a violin and really
that curve is very similar to what you
would find and the 2.5 D class that is
up front yes you did hear me right that
this is a 6-inch display and as such
you'll have a little bit of trouble
handling in one hand but that's pretty
much to be expected with larger devices
like this but with a very respectable
bezel especially on the sides you get a
lot of handling help when it comes to
the r7 plus rather you'll be using it
with two hands most of the time but at
least there are certain functions on
here that will help in that regard for
example you do have a fingerprint reader
on the back where your index finger will
pretty simply lay and right above it is
the 13 megapixel optics thankfully the
button layout Falls pretty squarely
where your fingers would with the power
button on the right side just low enough
for easy reaching and then the volume
rocker on the other side might need a
little bit of extra hander in order to
reach but really this is a very elegant
device that comes in silver and also
golden colors and its simplicity really
speaks to just how well this particular
device was designed as we get over to
the screen yes it's 6 inches like we
keep saying but it is also of a 1080p
resolution but an AMOLED construction
really makes the colors pop from here
going through the color OS 2.1
version this time around that is powered
by lollipop you'll see that everything
looks really nice on here and moves very
smoothly thanks to the Snapdragon 615
that is underneath the surface three
gigabytes of RAM will help with all of
the multitasking that you might be doing
on this device and in our short testing
with the device we did find that its
speed was actually really smooth very
snappy and the 615 is proving itself as
a nice processing package even for an
affordable yet reliable and pretty
speedy device here in the r7 plus 32
gigabytes of built-in storage can be
bolstered by a micro SD card slot in the
tray that can actually work as a dual
nano SIM tray as well so you'll get a
lot of connectivity here and also the
expandable storage if you so need it but
with the battery of course it's not
going to be removable here but you get a
4100 milliamp hour battery that can be
charged to up to 75% in just half an
hour using the VUCA fast charging which
in previous versions of Oppo phones we
already had a great time with N is a
very reliable and speedy way of getting
power into your phone when you're losing
it for a phone that is actually quite
thin despite its larger screen the 7.75
millimeter thickness here is actually
not quite that heavy on the hand and
really getting from side to side is not
that difficult despite the fact that ham
Gymnastics are going to be needed for
the top portion of the device but really
it's just a very nice cool feeling phone
and it continues that particular feeling
as you get into the software everything
really it just moves along really
smoothly as you can see here with color
OS 2.1 really powering what you're going
to have in a app drawer less interface
but nonetheless color OS despite some of
the flag game I've gotten in the past
seems to have gotten the speed boost
that it's needed despite still having a
lot of the features that might have
let's say bloated it in the past the
notification drop-down with its quick
settings is very lollipop esque but
still looks a lot like what color OS
would make it look like with a lot of
that real estate on the top taken up by
the quick settings you can change among
the different applications in the recent
apps screen by holding down the home
soft key which is at the bottom there
are no capacitive keys here like in the
r7 proper and going through the
interface without the app drawer it's a
little bit of a bummer but you still get
a lot of nice
Media pages as you can see over on the
side all the way to the left and finally
in camera we're obviously going to have
to save our testing for when we get our
own unit of the r7 plus but the camera
interface already looks quite nice and
is really easy to use with very few
elements on the viewfinder you can just
hit this one button over on the side and
you'll get to all of the different
features that you may already be
familiar with from phones like the n1
the N 3 in the Oppo find 7 the biggest
addition when it comes to the camera on
the r7 plus is that it now comes with
laser guided autofocus something that
you may have already seen in the LG g3
and g4 after it but when it comes to
focusing in these photos it should be
really easy with the r7 plus and finally
the sensor which is basically a ISO cell
sensor is able to capture the colors of
RGB n:w basically what this means is
that the photos will have a little bit
less noise as they claim but also the
color production should be a little bit
more accurate in these photos and all of
the fixings that you would expect from a
high-end Android camera despite the fact
that this is considered more of a
mid-range device pictures looked pretty
nice but that's also because there's a
bit of a punch in the photos and then it
also benefits from the view of the
AMOLED screen that it's given despite
it's more mid-range tendencies the
larger screen for even more real estate
for work and play what looks to be a
pretty good camera experience and a
faster color OS underneath really makes
this sub $500 phone feel like a bit of a
steal especially how sturdy and how nice
it feels and looks so really the r7 plus
is something we're looking forward to
reviewing once we get our hands on it
but this was your first look at the
larger of the two Oppo phones in their
celebration of their 10 year anniversary
