brought to you by go daddy welcome back
to Android Weekly my name is Jason this
past week was filled with news about a
new Samsung Galaxy s5 mini a new Samsung
tablet line with the tab fours and
perhaps most interestingly is the fact
that Mother Google may be up for a major
design overhaul first up let's talk
about the s5s mini me Sam mobile
reported a leak from a source that has
been reliable in the past that says
Samsung is gearing up to release a
Samsung Galaxy s5 mini and the specs are
a little bit better than expected the
mini is said to have a 720p Super AMOLED
display at 4.5 inches with a quad-core
processor rumored to be a Snapdragon 400
clocked at 1.5 gigahertz 16 gigabytes of
RAM with a micro SD card slot 8
megapixel rear camera 2 megapixel
front-facing camera and with a
respectable 2,100 milliamp hour battery
now it's best for us not to expect any
advanced features in the mini like a
fingerprint scanner but the mini is said
to be running 4.4 kitkat now this my
friends is good news for all you tablet
lovers because the reality is I use my
tablet for almost everything and when
tablets become more affordable that's a
good thing for all of us without much
fanfare Samsung introduced last week the
latest addition to its already sizeable
roster of Android tablets the Galaxy Tab
4 line the new Galaxy Tab 4 is comprised
of three models with almost identical
specs but different sizes a 7 inch 8
inch and a 10.1 inch all three tablets
feature mid-range specifications you'll
be happy to know all three devices
feature a microSD slot and the battery
sizes for the tab for eight inch is 4450
milliamp hour batteries and for the 10.1
inch it's a 6800 milliamp hour battery
although Samsung did not provide the
battery capacity for the tab 4 7 inch
now though Samsung didn't give details
on the pricing of these three tablets it
is expected that Samsung will price them
to impress the budget-conscious so what
do you think would happen if one day
YouTube or Twitter just suddenly went
the way of FriendFeed you know it's not
like it couldn't happen and it's not
like you couldn't possibly be banned
from your favorite social media site
that is also happy
the way to prevent that is to own your
own name under a domain with a.com
extension that's why I got Jace
bro dot-com under godaddy.com because
they gave us a great deal here that we
can pass on to you if you use the coop
coupon code Android 295 you can get any
domain or com domain for 295 it's a
fantastic deal I don't think you can get
anywhere else now if you want to go
crazy you can use the coupon code and
write 3-0 and get 30% off any of your
GoDaddy products there are some
limitations you want to check out the
website for details but just for fun I
thought I'd check out who had the best
name out of all my Android viewers and
it's got to go to the man who has the
best seventies porn named Vito libido
Vito you can go get Vito libido calm
it's free now we've been hearing some
interesting rumors about a major Google
design overhaul while we still can't say
with any certainty whether these images
are legit a new report from 9 to 5
google claims their sources suggest
google will be bringing redesigned you
eyes and more colorful looks to all of
its core apps and not just on Android
but will permeate throughout all of
Google's web apps iOS apps and beyond
now it is said the purpose of this
redesign is to focus on full page
content while removing clutter out of
the way now we all know that Google is
engineering at heart they love to tweak
tweak tweak every week we got a tweak
and you change but most of the time
they've left Gmail alone if they were
tweaking my Gmail every week I would
lead a march on Mountain View myself but
it turns out change is a-comin starting
with the new features hinted at in the
screenshots Google is apparently
preparing more types of email categories
finance travel purchases and according
to geek they seem to be very useful for
Auto sorting email coming from online
retailers your bank or your airline
these new categories will show up both
in the side menu and at the top of the
inbox but perhaps even more interesting
is a snooze button for your email a
snooze mode for email will presumably
let you mark a message as read for a
predetermined time ranging from a few
minutes to a few weeks have a message
from Grandma that you can't answer right
just snooze it off for the rest of the
workday and when you get home it will
show up as an unread in your timeline
thanks for watching Edward army my name
is Jace and I would like you to help me
with a little problem I would like to
send out one t-shirt per week and the
questions we put out in the past for the
t-shirts have sort of been well kind of
too easy people are getting them really
really quickly and we don't always have
you know a really compelling topic to
talk about each week some of the
questions we posed in the past where
people had to research and and put their
answers and comments below worked really
well but there's not always a topic
that's so compelling to do that so any
suggestions on what we should do for a
weekly kind of t-shirt contest I would
love to hear input in the comments below
or on Twitter or Google+ I read them all
I shall talk to you next week on Android
