android authority comm and today we'll
be taking a look at the new Swift key
it's gotten some major updates with some
new features and the prices dropped from
3.99 cents to a dollar ninety-nine if
you haven't used Swift key before its
claim to fame it's it's great text
prediction and auto correction the goal
of the keyboard is to let you type whole
sentences without actually typing
anything which is actually very possible
late last year SwiftKey announced that
they were going to add a swipe mechanism
to Swift key and would eventually
release a beta of that called Swift key
flow beta a lot of people enjoyed it and
it seemed to work pretty well it was
integrated directly into Swift key 3
giving it the fun of swiping with the
text prediction that Swift key 3 was
already known for thus the new Swift key
was born known as swift key 4 it's the
first official release with swift key
flow swiping built-in it also boasts
better text prediction and auto
correction than ever lastly and perhaps
its most daring feature the ability to
use flow to swipe whole sentences well
show you how that works in this video
well text prediction has been revamped
using it is still about the same as it
ever was after you type or swipe a word
some choices will appear above the
keyboard to try to guess the next word
in the sentence if it happens to be
there just hit it instead of having to
type it Swift key still checks your
Twitter Facebook text messages RSS feeds
if you happen to be a writer or have an
RSS feed for yourself and Gmail to learn
your style of typing swift key flow is
the hallmark new feature to use it
simply spell out the word you want by
swiping your finger over the letters
it's important to note that unlike swipe
keyboard you just spell out the word so
for the word let's Ellie T apostrophe s
with swipe you would spell le t swipe
down to the apostrophe then back to the
S in Swift key you just swipe le t s and
the keyboard knows where to put the
punctuation most of the time the funnest
new feature is the ability to use swift
key flow to swipe full sentences in one
go how this works is you swipe the first
word swipe down to the spacebar swipe
the second word and then back down to
the spacebar wash rinse and repeat until
you have a full sentence however of all
the new features this one is by far the
most buggy sometimes words are spelled
in such a way that the last letter is on
its way down to the spacebar and may be
ignored
for instance swiping the word sentences
puts the S below the E and can cause
Swift key to ignore it thinking that you
just slid past the S to get to the
spacebar also words that aren't swiped
perfectly will
something completely different and you
can't fix it until you complete the
swiping motion it's definitely a feature
that needs work but it's still fun to
use when you're goofing around overall
the new update should make Swift keep
fans a lot happier even if they don't
use flow the improved text prediction is
still mostly better than SwiftKey 3 but
for people looking for keyboards with
the full range of features SwiftKey now
has pretty much all of them that said
there is always room for improvement so
expect the swiping functionality to get
more stable as the app gets updated once
