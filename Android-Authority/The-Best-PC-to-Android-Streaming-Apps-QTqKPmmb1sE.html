Joe handy the Android authority app guy
after the intro will show you some of
the best PC to Android streaming apps
for Android first on our list is two
player do note that the graphical issues
here are actually an issue with the app
and not a result of our screen capture
method it doesn't happen with all
devices and it doesn't affect video
playback other than the graphic issues
the app works pretty well
it recognizes dnl a servers and that's
what we use to test the application it
recognized my plex server and it was
able to play videos from there since
that is a big requirement for being on
the list that was good news for 2-player
it's a simple app and doesn't have a lot
of features but it more or less works
mobile UPnP is a pretty popular pc to
android streaming app and there's a
reason for that
because it works not only does it work
on tablets and phones but there is also
a Google TV app that works pretty well
too the only real bad part is that the
free version is a little crippled during
testing we had no problem getting videos
to play from the old plex server which
is what I use for my DML a server it
does require a secondary player like
mobile player or MX player to play the
videos but these are free so it's no big
deal
next on our list is Amit it's a very
nice app that looks pretty good and
works pretty well unlike some of the
others on this list Amit does not work
very well with DM la servers instead
relying on its own PC app to stream
media to your Android device you can add
servers via IP address or pen as
required but for newbies and people who
don't know a whole lot about servers
this may be beyond their expertise the
app does work well but for the best
results you'll have to get the PC app
that goes with it flex is kind of the
Pandora radio of PC to Android streaming
it features a solid and easy to use
interface and it's among the most
popular streaming apps for any operating
system it's also packed tight with
features and Plex servers are DML a
compliant and can be seen by other PC to
Android streaming apps like you met you
have to get plexus proprietary app to
get plex to work thankfully Plex servers
are pretty easy to setup so this isn't a
big deal once it's set up videos stream
pretty well with only the occasional
hiccup you can get it for tablets phones
and Google TV while tonight Oh can
stream video for Android devices from
the PC that is actually not the point of
the app it's meant as a file sharing app
between your PC and Android so you can
also share documents music video and
picture
so if you want something with more than
one use this could be it video streaming
was pretty good although like Amit and
Plex you have to download his
proprietary app on the PC for it to work
on your Android device so if you employ
a generic D&amp;amp;L a server you'll want to
look elsewhere as you cannot even get
into the application until you sign into
your tenido account if you take a look
at our leaderboard you can see how all
these apps stack up against one another
again these are based on their Google
Play Store ratings and there is no bias
on our part if you want to try one of
these apps out the links are in the
video description computer to Android
video streaming is a pretty niche market
but there are still a fair amount of
honorable mentions these include a via T
versity and media house UPnP PC to
Android streaming is one of the rare
markets where app performance matters
more than how it looks for most finding
an app capable of streaming stable and
quality video is simply more important
of course because this is a niche market
there may have been a hidden gem that we
missed if your favorite PC to Android
streaming app isn't on here feel free to
leave a comment and let us know once
again i'm jo hindi the android authority
app guy feel free to subscribe to our
youtube channel and check out our social
media links in the video description</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
