name is Kevin the tech ninja and this is
tips and tricks for the Moto X
all right let's begin the very first tip
that I have for you is how to keep your
Moto X unlock to and connected a
bluetooth if you use a pattern lock or
pin then there is a feature that can
speed up the unlocking of the devices go
into settings security and choose
trusted devices and from here you can
pick and choose which Bluetooth devices
are trusted so now the Moto X won't lock
when you are in your car that has
Bluetooth or if you're using wireless
headphones the next tip is how to
control the active notifications one of
my favorite features of the Moto X is
the active notification control this
feature only lights up the needed pixels
to show the notification when the screen
is lit press and hold on the middle icon
it could be a lock or could be your
notification we have an active alert you
slide your finger up to view the details
slide your finger to the right or to the
left to dismiss it or slide down to do a
simple unlock alright let's talk about
the battery for a moment the screen is
the AMOLED screen which means the black
pixels are actually off so uses less
power so if you find darker wallpapers
or dark apps you will see a small boost
in battery life also let's not forget
the Moto X has a built-in battery saver
feature as well go into settings battery
and you'll see battery saver on the top
when you're better jobs to 15% the saver
launches to disable background data and
reduce the screen brightness and timeout
keep these two tips in your back pocket
when you're out and about and you don't
have a charger nearby I already spoke
about one of the main features of the
Moto X well this is the second feature
of the Moto X this is the touchless
control we're gonna talk about how to
fine-tune it to ensure it always works
when programming touches control it
requires you to say okay Google now
three times some users have been
reporting issues understanding their
voices and resolution is when you're
programming your okay Google now
statements move the phone different
distances from your face what I did was
I recorded one about four inches from my
mouth one at six inches and lastly as
crazy as it sounds one about two feet
away
that way when I had the form of my
coffee table I can shout okay Google now
and a response this tip can also apply
if you're frequently in areas with high
background noise you can record each
okay Google now in a different location
if you're setting up ok Google now and
you back out it remains in your
notification bar so you can return to it
we're in a different location the Moto X
camera is a disappointment but there are
a few things you can do to improve the
quality it's a big chance that HDR is
turned off let's understand what HDR is
for a moment
HDR takes multiple shots at different
exposure levels and uses software to
combine pictures into one image however
any shots that has motion HDR is not a
proper method of shooting so make sure
you turn off HDR with any action shots
and after speaking with a few other
motox users using post-processing
filters and also the tools that come in
the gallery can make the image look a
whole lot better you are also able to
try out different camera applications on
the Play Store and you may have a better
chance of capturing images that way
the last tip that I have for you today
is the moto assist moto assist is a
software suite that is included with the
Moto X it is designed to automatically
change your phone settings depending on
different conditions like driving
meeting and sleeping to turn it on head
into the application and select the
system when setting up the driving
profile it uses the phone's GPS to check
you are driving
if you confirm you are driving then the
profile kicks into play you can set it
to read bag SMS and a kick back a
message to the sender same goes with the
meeting it looks at your calendar and if
you have the option to make your phone
silent it kicks back a message also
there is an additional setting that if
the person calls back twice and that
call becomes urgent and it will bus
through sleep modes simply puts the
phone in silent between certain times
with the meeting and sleeping options
you can also set up VIPs and these are
starred context that you have set up in
your Google account and this concludes
