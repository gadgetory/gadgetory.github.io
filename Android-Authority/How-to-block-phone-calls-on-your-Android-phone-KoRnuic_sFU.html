convenience of being contacted at
anytime or anywhere by people who matter
to you family friends loved ones or
things but you can also be contacted by
people you don't want enemies stalkers
spammers pesky telemarketers and other
unwanted callers when the latter happens
what to do why block those annoying
callers of course hi I'm mark and
welcome to Android Authority in this
video I'll teach you how to block phone
calls on your Android phone generally
you should be able to bar calls on your
Android phone but the method for
achieving it could differ from phone to
phone on the Nexus 4 for example I
cannot find a way to block a contact or
to bar calls but there's a workaround
redirecting calls to voicemail to do
this for any contact just open the
contact in the People app tap menu and
tap on all calls to voicemail you'll
know that the contact has been blocked
so speak because you'll see this
checkmark here and most other handsets
such as the Xperia T and HTC One you can
block calls through call barring which
you can enable by going to settings and
then accessing call settings here you
can block certain types of calls such as
outgoing calls outgoing international
calls or all incoming calls call barring
is a network service and you will
usually need a network provided passcode
to enable or disable it on certain
phones like the HTC One you can also
block contacts through the phone app
open the phone app tap the Menu button
and select blocked contacts tap this
button to add a contact to the list you
can either select a contact from your
contacts or manually enter a number a
similar feature exists on the lg optimus
g it's known as called reject it's also
on the galaxy s4 and is called the auto
reject list on the Galaxy s4 you can add
the contact to the auto reject list by
opening a contacts page
tapping menu and tapping Add to reject
list you can also manually add to the
list by opening the phone app then going
to call settings called rejection also
reject lists here you can specify an
exact number or numbers matching a
search string that you specify
for example you can add contact numbers
that start or end with the digits that
you provide or includes the digits
specified on the lg optimus G you can
add numbers to the black list by going
to the system settings page then opening
the call page from here you can select a
reject mode as well as manage the
rejection list if you own the galaxy s4
and you want to block calls at certain
hours of the day you can use blocking
mode available in some of Samsung's
high-end phones including the Galaxy S 2
free this feature lets you block
incoming calls disable notifications and
silence alarms just enable blocking mode
and set the time you want it to kick in
you can also add contacts to a whitelist
so that calls from them can get through
even if you've enabled blocking mode if
your Android phone doesn't have a
built-in call blocking feature don't
fret you can still block calls through
third-party Android apps there are a lot
of such apps on the Google Play Store
but here I'll feature just three mr.
number call blocker and calls blacklist
mr. number allows you to block calls and
text on your mobile phone this app is
easy to use doesn't have ads and can be
used for free here's how you can block
phone calls with a mr. number app right
after installing and launching the app
for the first time
verify your country select your country
and area code from the drop down list
and type in your mobile number tap ok to
confirm this is the apps main interface
tap this button to begin blocking calls
on the next screen you will see three
tabs hang-up voicemail and exceptions
contacts this the other hang-up
won't be able to contact you those under
the voicemail tab will be redirected to
your phone's voicemail box and contacts
saved under the exceptions tab will not
be blocked on your phone let's say you
want to block all incoming calls but
want to allow calls from some of your
important contacts here's how to do it
in mr. number tap this button on the
hang-up tab and select all numbers go to
the exceptions tab and add the contact
numbers you don't want to block and
you're done the unwanted contacts are
now blocked it can also block a number
right on the apps main screen just to
have the Menu button beside each log
entry under the recent tab and select
block number a pop-up menu will appear
asking whether to block the number
or direct a call to voicemail you may
also mark the number as a spam number
and add a comment about the blocked
contact number Call Blocker is another
app to try this is a free app and has
ads but the paid version removes ads and
unlocks the private space feature for
storing your private SMS messages and
call logs this app is easy to use to
other call blockers main screen tap this
button to begin blocking phone calls
afterwards
tap this button to add a contact you
will find two tabs on the next screen
one for blacklist and another one for
whitelist contacts saved under the
blacklist tab will be blocked while
contacts listed under whitelist will not
be blocked tap this button to add a
contact you can select a contact from
your contacts call logs or SMS messages
or you can also manually enter the
number last but certainly not least is
the calls blacklist app this is a simple
app that lets you block calls from
certain contacts it's a free but
ad-supported app that can be upgraded to
an ad-free premium version the apps main
screen is very intuitive and easy under
the blacklist tab tap this button to add
a contact to block calls and SMS
messages from a contact listed via app
will now be blocked you can check the
log tab on the main menu to check the
block to SMS messages and calls mobile
phones make us easily accessible to our
family and friends as well as pampers
prank callers annoying telemarketers and
the lake but thanks to call blocking
features on your phone and call blocking
apps from the Google Play Store you
won't have to waste your time answering
