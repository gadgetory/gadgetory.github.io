brought to you by Atlassian build what's
next
did you know that Motorola was the first
radio company to land on the moon and
that's just the beginning for this
innovative company we'll heard Neil
Armstrong's famous words when he became
the first human being to stepped foot on
the moon and said one small step for man
one giant leap for mankind
while Motorola was there to provide the
radio transponder that was used to send
those words to planet Earth Motorola was
founded in 1928 and it's not easy to
stay alive in this industry for that
long needless to say Motorola is a
historic tech company by now you think
Motorola is just following the crowd
well think again because they don't only
make great phones they are also one of
the most important companies in mobile
communications Motorola invented the
very first car radio in 1930
a device that was initially only meant
for the police in the USA at least and
later involved in two two-way
communication systems and now we're
talking walkie talkies fast-forward ten
years and two-way radios no longer had
to be attached to a vehicle in order to
operate mobile communications became
untethered with the introduction of the
SCR 300 the very first walkie talkie
you've seen those huge backpack soldiers
from World War two were carrying right
well that's it that's the SDR 300 and by
today's standards it's not really a
mobile device but imagine the impact it
had on the battlefield in the 1940s
continuing its mobile innovation role
Motorola was the first to release a
pager in 1956 they called it the Handy
talkie radio pager and it was mostly
used in hospitals to send messages
within a range of 40 kilometers and cell
phones while Motorola invented that as
well
Samsung and Apple may currently rule the
market but when we think about
innovation its Motorola right at the top
the company invented the very first cell
phone it was called the DynaTAC 8
and acts and was launched in 1983 and
what about the first cell phone call
that was made and there's a curious
story to this this was a call made by
Motorola employee Martin Cooper in New
York he contacted you guessed it AT&amp;amp;T
z-- Joel Engel you know just a little
know that the first cell phone call was
being made and it was an AT&amp;amp;T what about
the name Motorola how did that come to
be well as we previously mentioned
Motorola's business began with car
radios and this is actually where the
name came from moto obviously stands for
its vehicular links why Ola was simply a
popular ending for names during that
time before this Motorola was known as
the de lijn manufacturing corporation do
you remember this phone it's the
Motorola StarTAC your mom probably had
one and it was all the craze when it
launched back in 1996 it was the
lightest phone to hit the market at only
88 grams and it also happens to be the
very first clamshell cell phone to the
market I still kind of like it you can
also thank Motorola for mobile web
browsing the Motorola I den I 1000 plus
was the very first smartphone to
incorporate mobile web browsing as well
as email and alphanumeric characters of
course it could only make calls send
messages and send faxes but arguably
Motorola's crowning achievement is that
it produced one of the best selling
phones of all time Motorola falls behind
manufacturers like nokia and Samsung
when it comes to top-selling handsets
but it sure beats Apple's popular iPhone
6 and 6-plus
the Motorola RAZR was the King of the US
market and continues to be the
best-selling clamshell handset to date
with over a hundred and thirty units
sold in comparison the iPhone 6 and
6-plus only managed to hit a hundred
million altogether unleash your team's
potential with Atlassian's collaboration
software so you can work and communicate
better together a sign track and manage
tasks for any project no matter how
complex
that's the clarity of JIRA creating
share content organize results and bring
team members up to speed
that's the flexibility of confluence now
what I like about Atlassian the most is
that it doesn't constrict me to
communicating with my team in one way if
I don't want to chat it out in the chat
box I can go to video chat
that is a good thing that's Atlassian
calm unleash the potential of your team
build what's next
