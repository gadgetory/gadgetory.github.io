Clayton Youngberg coming at you from
Android authority calm your number one
source for all things Android see
they're gonna be taking a look at a few
of these segment cases for the Samsung
Galaxy s3 we've got three here all three
are of a different variety we've got our
tube map official licensed product of
the Transport for London case now this
is a really cool one this is my favorite
just by looks
so far we've also got our forum slim
hi-gloss case for the Samsung Galaxy s3
and we have our frost matte slim case
for the Samsung Galaxy s3 now a cool
thing that a signet did was send us a
nice little pamphlet their product
catalog issue number five I have not
gotten the product catalogue from all
the other cases that we have reviewed
but it's just a nice little bonus I
thought I'd throw in the video just
because uh gives us a nice look at all
of their different products if you guys
want to actually browse through this go
ahead and go to their website so anyways
this is our Samsung Galaxy s3 let's
start with our frost matte slim case as
you can see here it does have a few of
these specs we've got our screen
protector included this is slim fit and
has our handy scratch and I left a
little diamond logo on there so we're
just going to go ahead and open this one
up just work from the bottom here and
pop it open really cool packaging as
well open this up see here we've got all
of our contents including our screen
protector our nice little electronics
cleaning cloth and in our case I'm not
going to install the screen protector
just because I do have one on my galaxy
s3 this is a general screen protector
just like most of the ones you'll find
anyways this is our nice case it's a
little bit transparent as you can see
and kind of see through it there go
ahead and pop this on our samsung galaxy
s3 fits awesome it feels really nice
this is actually one of the best feeling
cases that I've ever had on the samsung
galaxy s3 I love the matte feel we have
our nice cutouts for LED or camera and
our speaker on
our power buttons and our volume rocker
are extremely easily accessible just
feels great it's not raised too much it
has a nice thin profile so you can
actually get in there and not press the
power buttons with ease no protection on
top but we do have a nice little cutout
for the headphone jack and we have a
nice cutout for the micro USB feels
great you can actually still see Samsung
right through there awesome case we'll
pop our next one on um I do really like
this one check this one out guys
we'll just remove our screen protector
and stuff so we don't see that the whole
time and we'll move on to our next one
which is the forum slim hi-gloss case
for the Samsung Galaxy s3 this one has a
screen protector as well this one's also
slim fit and has a high gloss finish so
it slides right out I guess I could have
done that with the last one what caveman
style on it again we're not going to
install the screen protector we'll save
those to give away to you guys we're
doing a giveaway of all of our cases and
all of our screen protectors anyways
we'll just pull this out protects the
gloss in there this one is a little bit
malleable feels really nice though pop
it in our galaxy s3 awesome got a nice
hot branding right here that our cutouts
for the camera the LED and the speaker
power buttons easily accessible as
always nice volume rockers as well it
feels great
a little bit of a raised edge to to
protect have any facedown damage and it
just feels awesome on the back as well
so it's a great case we'll try the next
one
next one is looking to be my favorite
just cuz I love the design on it this
one is the London map I've never been to
London but it's just really cool you can
see we have our nice coming to square
Holborn Chancery Lane don't know where
any of those places are we do have team
members from AAA in London though I'm
sure you guys can drop a comment then of
your questions regarding London and our
team members we'll be glad to answer
there's this comes with a screen
protector as well again I'm gonna save
this one for you guys into our contest
that are coming up now on the inside
this has the Signet plus underground
official licensed product of Transport
for London really cool and has our
registered user number eleven out of
four thousand nine hundred twenty seven
that's cool it's a limited edition now
this one has a nice little piece of
plastic going over the volume so anyways
we'll pop our Galaxy s3 in it's a nice
white on white feel looks really awesome
got our map on back now this has
different cutouts they're not there's no
pillars in between all the different LED
and speaker and camera but it is still
pretty nice you can still hit our power
button just fine as well as our volume
rockers proton provides a little bit of
protection here on the front and then of
course we have our micro USB and
headphone jack exposed it's an awesome
case now all of these signet cases are
great we do have our matte or high gloss
and then our map of London so pick these
up guys in fact we'll be given these
away as well as all of our other galaxy
s3 cases but if you can't wait that long
