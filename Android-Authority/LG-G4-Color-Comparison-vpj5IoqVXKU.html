authority what's going on everybody and
Here I am at the launch event at the top
of the World Trade Center bringing you a
further look at the LG g4 we already
looking at a first look that you're
probably already seeing on the YouTube
channel already so hope you guys enjoyed
that but what I wanted to bring you was
a color comparison now in our first look
we did get a look at the titanium
finished gray edition but this time I
have these ceramic finish here in my
hands and I'm gonna go through one by
one and get as many of them as possible
so you can get a look at what all of
these particular colors will look like
not only in the finished plastic
editions but also in the leather
backings what we have here is this white
edition and you've probably already
noticed just very subtly in the titanium
one during our first look that there's
this little grid pattern right here that
you can see reflecting in the light
right now and it actually looks pretty
nice provides a little bit of a grip
that we have a bit of a textured feel on
that bottom right there but this is just
a look at the ceramic Edition let's go
ahead and move on to the gold edition of
the phone alright and here is the gold
edition you'll see that the gold is a
little bit subtler in this particular
version of it while the white obviously
has that flow on white in the titanium
is more of a gray rather than a full-on
black this is the gold edition right
here again that little grid pattern
design there on the actual backing
itself and of course the fact that all
of them are removable so you're going to
have that as well putting a quick
comparison with the white one here is
the white one it was actually right next
to me and here is a look at the other
two colors available for the plastic
Edition with these very finished designs
titanium in the gray one ceramic which
is a very light feel right here and then
the gold which is somewhere in the
middle alright so here we are with now
the leather editions of the phone we
obviously got a look at this brown
edition in my left hand here during our
first look and what I said in the first
look was that it did feel a little bit
better than the plastic editions and
that still happens to be the case but in
my right hand is the black edition of
the phone which i think is the one
I would like the most while it does seem
to blend in with a lot of the other
devices that are out there the stitching
in the middle gives it a unique look and
feel and it still stands out even if
you're dealing with a lot of other black
devices that are out there it's really a
nice leather feel on there there are a
few other colors and you're going to see
them right now in closer looks but it
definitely just comes down to what color
you want the leather backing to be one
thing I will say is you're going to see
in a close-up here is that the pattern
design on the Black Edition seems a
little bit more pronounced when compared
to the brown one that's gonna be
something that you're gonna have to take
a look at a little bit on your own to
see which one is better while the brown
leather designer examples a little bit
more like a bell - the black leather
design has a little bit more of that
alligator skin type feel to it so those
are just a couple of differences between
these particular editions and you'll see
even more as I end this video with just
some looks at the other colors of the
leather backing of the LG g4 and here
comes you look at a beige color of the
leather backing this has the texture of
the back a little bit more alligator
skin rather than looking like a smooth
belt but really they all look pretty
nice and finally we're gonna take a look
at the yellow and the blue ones both a
voyage seem like they have this type of
texture rather than the smooth belt like
of the brown edition and finally the
blue edition I was just informed that
there aren't any yellow editions
available on the show floor right now
but like I said before the texture on
the blue and the yellow this is sky blue
genuine leather right here has the same
type of texture as the black one
ultimately out of all of the leather
options I would definitely like the
black edition in terms of the plastic
editions the titanium and the ceramic
white finishes do seem pretty nice but
if you're gonna go for something a
little bit different these other
backings are certainly the fashion
statement you might be looking for so
keep it tuned to Android Authority for
even more this is your color comparison
of the various LG g4 backings the
leather and the plastic editions and
remember to keep it tuned here for even
more about the LG g4 here at the launch
event at the top of the World Trade
Center in New York City</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
