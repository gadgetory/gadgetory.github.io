domain.com now why would Google make its
own phone not a nexus phone per se
that's made with a hardware partner but
a Google manufactured smartphone a
gphone Google is discussing internally
about building its own smartphone
according to the information which sites
people working at Google now I know what
you're thinking you're thinking Jace
these are just ideas that are bounced
around the halls of Google and never get
out of the idea stage and I would agree
with you normally except for the fact
that Google in the past week has worked
hard in trying to standardize hardware
components giving us a clue that this is
perhaps more than just talk now why why
would Google want to make its own
smartphone you might guess that they
want to exert more control over a
sprawling occasionally unruly ecosystem
to address the biggest issues holding
and write back fragmentation or update
support and security vulnerabilities but
Google already has deep control if not
complete over the nexus smartphones so
how would a true google phone help
advance these goals according to the
informations report from last week
Google is looking at improving camera
capabilities so phones can capture
information from the environment that
Google can use to create new valuable
features adding more memory to
processors to improve performance
improving sensor hubs that can survey
the world at all times without draining
a lot of power and adding new sensors
yes Google could work with chip makers
like Qualcomm and Media Tech to put
these features on their road maps and
just hope that android oems will pick
them up the alternative is to create a
compelling smartphone that really
showcases Google's advanced features and
sell it directly to consumers back in
pressure Android manufacturers into
adopting Google's standardized hardware
smart move if you can do it but
Chromebook pixel and the pixel see
Android tablet have set a precedent for
this google used the former to lead the
adoption of USB type-c while the pixel
see appears to be designed with a more
PC friendly version of Android in mind
the real problem for Google is that
they've hit a plateau in terms of what
features android could offer based on
software alone for more advanced
features like that our voice control and
machine vision specialized hardware is
needed Google needs to make sure its
wish list of components and features is
adopted by chip makers and OEMs so that
most new phones and tablets can support
these advanced features the risk if
Google fails is to have a divided
Android ecosystem with an elite tier of
devices with advanced functionality and
then everyone else now to say that
Google just wants to copy Apple is
oversimplifying it Google wants the best
of both worlds they need to demonstrate
to manufacturers what is possible and
what hardware components are necessary
to show off the yet unseen advanced
features of our beloved Android what do
you guys think let me know in the
comments below Krishna Bala I'm sending
you a t-shirt for vanilla android com
great choice I'm surprised someone
doesn't own it already thank you for
showing us the power of a dot-com now

degree of trust as a dot-com or dotnet
domain name dot com and.net domain name
extensions and Jack credibility in to
your online presence save fifteen
percent on domain names and web hosting
when you use our coupon code android at
domain.com check out when you think
domain names think domain.com so Krishna
hit me up on Twitter or Google+ and give
me your address and I'll send you out
that t-shirt straight away you don't
want forget about my brothers and sister
and work we're working super hard to be
your source for all things and
