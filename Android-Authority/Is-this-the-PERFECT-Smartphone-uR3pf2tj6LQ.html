the ultimate phone and I'm talking about
a phone that even the Apple sheep would
gush over and they heard my prayers too
small too small
definitely not five point seven inches
yeah yep not doing over there oh yeah
this is what I'm talking about you know
I always wanted a smartphone that was
big enough to cramp my hands and five
point five inches five point seven
inches and six inches just wasn't doing
it for me so this nine-inch behemoth is
absolutely perfect I mean I can see
everything I can read everything and it
will cramp my hand and break my hand
just like I want it to so this is the
perfect screen size I mean look at this
one-handed usability my hand is hurting
right now just talking to you now one of
the things we all want is better
performance for our mobile phones
however there is a limiting factor and
that is that phones youth passive
cooling now how would it be if we could
add a fan a fan from a PC onto a mobile
phone I wonder what that would do to the
performance
and so to test this modified phone with
the extra fan I fired up my custom
benchmark that I use for many of my
system-on-a-chip tests and look here
look at the performance improvements
this is doing 237 frames per second 236
now 237 frames a second is absolutely
amazing let's just see what the final
benchmark score is and there we have it
the final score for my benchmark 231
point 4 9 frames a second and this is a
special version I'm running version o
4.0 1 and that gives us over 200 frames
a second as only one thing left to do I
need to get this design over to Josh
okay so for this phone I wanted some
serious battery life because I use a lot
of applications every day and watching
my battery drain like Kanye West's bank
account is irritating
I keep hearing tech companies say that
the next big thing is here but it's all
being powered by the same crappy
batteries as the last big thing
innovation my ass so I decided to find a
real battery for real smartphone owners
and I think I know just where to look
yeah yeah get some power mother that's
right with a car battery rated at 50 amp
hours that's 50,000 milliamp hours of
power you can charge like frickin once
and it'll last forever we're talking
about days of screen on time weeks of
battery life plus its heft and weight
make it an ideal tool for crushing your
enemies so when it comes to the camera
you need to have the best possible one
and the one that I'm thinking of is
something like this a DSLR so it pretty
much comes down to getting the kind of
quality you will get from something like
this and putting it onto the back of
what would be our perfect smartphone
with everything that we have in place I
think I know what to do here
I think we've done it behold Android
authorities perfect smartphone it's got
everything that you would want from a
big smartphone the large screen the
large size even this computer fan
designed brilliantly by Gary and of
course the camera on the back to get you
all of the perfect shots than all of the
smart phones right now cannot do and of
course in order to be the perfect
smartphone it has to do a really good
job at taking calls and that's why we
got the best thing for the job a
cordless phone on a landline it doesn't
get any better than this ladies and
gentlemen we think we finally cracked
the code with this bad boy right here
and created the perfect smartphone as
the large screen the ability to make
perfect calls and the computer fan on
the back for the high performance and of
course you have this camera right here
that does a great job just like that and
of course you can have the perfect
smartphone if it doesn't have stock

perfect smartphone and of course happy
