the official announcement of the s nine
we're still getting new leaks and rumors
so we needed an update just like I need
a new mango lassi now if there is
reasonable truth of these following
rumors
I think Samsung is making a smart play
by trying to please both the geeks and
the sheep according to Koreans et News
the leak claims that the galaxy s 9 will
have the ability to make 3d emoticons
using the front facing camera the an
emoji feature of the iPhone X was one of
the most talked about features of the
phone so it's no surprise that this has
made its way over to Samsung's upcoming
flagship it's basically a feature that
creates 3d emojis using the facial
expressions of the user the name of
Samsung's version of the feature is
currently unknown but that's for the
Sheep for geeks there are rumored dual
stereo speakers now let's talk pricing
and it's gonna hurt according to a
leaked from phone arena the s9 should
start at approximately 884 dollars to
920 dollars u.s. by comparison the
galaxy s 8 began at eight hundred and
twenty five dollars so it looks like we
might see anywhere between a fifty to a
hundred dollar increase from last year's
model and for those of you who are new
to this leaks and rumor game let's
review what we think is under the hood
the Samsung Galaxy S 9 and s 9 plus
won't have any major upgrades over their
predecessors according to a report from
VentureBeat they'll come with the same
curved displays as the s8 series this
means we'll see a five point eight inch
and 6.2 inch Super AMOLED panels with
qhd+ resolution and an 1859 aspect ratio
ET news reports that both the s 9 and s
9 plus will use Y octa display
technology which integrates the touch
layer in the encapsulation layer of the
OLED display rather than using a
distinct film type layer like older
generations of Samsung displays why octa
was only used on the samsung galaxy s 8
but with the new generation both the s 9
and s 9 plus will take advantage of it
y octa displays our thinner have better
optical properties and a reportedly 30%
cheaper to manufacture the galaxy s 9
plus is said to have 2 gigabytes of RAM
more
than its smaller brother will have six
gigabytes versus four gigabytes
it might also feature a dual camera
setup while the s9 should only have a
single shooter on the back but let's
talk about the variable aperture shall
we an image of an alleged to Galaxy S
nine retail box which you can see here
gives us additional info regarding the
specs of the s9 it suggests that the
camera could have a 12 megapixel sensor
with oh is and variable aperture that's
an f-stop of 1.5 for low-light shots and
2.4 when there's more light available
we've already seen this technology on
Samsung's high-end flip phone called the
W 2018 which launched back in December
you can check out what the variable
aperture looks like here so what do you
guys think
good great not so much well I think you
can expect huge leaps of innovation
every year they really want to take
advantage of the tech that they already
have
unless of course Apple really pushes
them and paints them into a corner but
the camera is a different thing that
camera is making changes in every
flagship every year right I mean pretty
much every manufacturer really wants to
push that camera technology the design
may stay the same the specs may stay
relatively the same but that camera has
got to keep marching forward let me know
