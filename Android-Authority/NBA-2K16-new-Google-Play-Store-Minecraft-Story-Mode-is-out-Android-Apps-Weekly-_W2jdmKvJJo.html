show is brought to you by daegu cloud
backup hello again ladies and gentlemen
I'm Joe Hindy the android authority app
guy and welcome back to android apps
weekly this is episode 112 let's get
right into those headlines and don't
forget to stick around after the outro
for a special announcements a new report
out of avg shows which applications take
up the most battery storage and data
usage unsurprisingly most of them are
audio and video streaming applications
with a smattering of social media and
messaging applications such as Facebook
Tumblr and snapchat Google is now giving
people the opportunity to become a beta
tester for the official google
application for the time being there's
nothing new quite yet but it's only a
matter of time before the beta testers
start seeing new features ahead of
everyone else the latest humble bundle
is now live and includes games from
kemco for those who don't know kemco
makes JRPG style games so pretty much
all of these have a ton of content
you'll get three games for paying
whatever you want and for more if you
beat the average you'll also be helping
charity which is always a good thing
Samsung pay is reportedly making its way
out to verizon samsung devices as the
company's slow rollout of the app
continues of course finding the app in
the Play Store is like playing a game of
hide-and-seek right now but we're sure
these kinks will be worked out
eventually the google play store is on
the verge of a total redesign that
separates entertainment stuff from the
applications the new design is set to go
live sooner or later so keep an eye out
for that it looks nice it looks well
organised and it'll be mostly a welcome
change for even more Android apps and
games news don't forget to check out
this week's newsletter which is linked
in the video description below there
you'll find all the stuff we didn't have
time or space for here today if you're
so inclined you can head on over to the
written companion and sign up with your
email address so we can send this to you
every single week while you're at it
don't forget to subscribe to our twitch
channel we have a lot of fun playing
games on there and while we are swamped
with stuff right now we have every
intention of getting back there to play
again sometime soon follow us now and
don't miss out when that happens okay
folks let's take a look at the absent
games that made a big splash this week
as usual if you want to check any of
these apps or games out we'll have those
links provided for you in the video
description below rad boarding is a new
game out of noodle cake studios it's an
endless runner style gamer you must bore
down a mountain while being pursued by
tons and
lava you can collect various items to
purchase upgrades and power-ups all
while performing all kinds of stunts and
tricks for a grizzly bear that keeps
asking you to do it the graphics look
pretty good in the game is easy enough
to play there are also some early
release issues so do beware of those
Sega has released a sequel to sonic dash
simply called sonic dash to sonic boom
this one revolves around the new sonic
cartoon show that's been out so you can
expect to see references and characters
from that the game itself is not all
that different from the first as it is
an infinite runner where you run around
trying to collect coins it also features
team mode where you can play with up to
three players total new powers new
obstacles and some more newer content it
is free to download but there are in app
purchases NBA 2k16 is an interesting
release because it's actually a
basketball game in contrast to last
year's offering which was just a card
collector game in this title you
actually play basketball which is also
the game's biggest feature it comes with
a revamp soundtrack all of the teams and
players and the on-screen controls
actually aren't half bad there are also
various modes including my career mode
season mode and blacktop modes to play
through with some other content to enjoy
there are in app purchases which sucks
given the price but otherwise it doesn't
seem like a half bad game HTC restore
was released this last week during the
announcements and discussions about the
19 this is a simple application that
doesn't do all that much really it
simply allows you to restore
applications data and more that you may
have backed up using HTC's backup
function built into their OEM skin it's
totally free and only for HTC devices
running marshmallow which means
literally no one can download this yet
but it is there if you ever need it
after months of waiting the day finally
arrived when minecraft story mode was
released the highly anticipated title by
Telltale Games given us minecraft but
with a story with an all-star cast that
includes Patton Oswalt Brian Posehn
Martha Plimpton Corey Feldman and others
so far it's received plenty of positive
reviews and we anticipate that this will
be one of the best paid games of the
year the game is classic telltale games
which means your decisions will have
implications on the story and there will
be a total of five episodes released
this week's episode of the android apps
weekly show is sponsored by d goo cloud
backup this well-designed application
gives you 100 gigabytes of free space to
backup your device with whatever files
you feel like storing there it employs
military-grade encryption to keep your
files safe and you can restore anytime
want to the application uses material
design and it definitely looks really
good you can also choose which folders
to back up when to upload backups and
several other settings to make sure your
backups are always up to date you can
pick up an additional two hundred and
fifty gigabytes of storage for two
dollars and ninety-nine cents per month
