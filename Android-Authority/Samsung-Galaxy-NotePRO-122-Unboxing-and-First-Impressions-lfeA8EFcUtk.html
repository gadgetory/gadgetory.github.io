but today we are going to answer the
age-old question what is it like
unboxing and having a first look at a
twelve point two inch tablets well
that's exactly what we're about to find
out because it's Java guard from Android
thority what's going on everybody
and this is the unboxing and my first
impressions on the brand new Samsung
Galaxy Note pro alright so as you can
see I already have a pretty wide lens
here on this camera but it's already
tough to put this entire box in frame
obviously because we're dealing with a
twelve point two inch screen and once I
take the lid off of this you're going to
see the tablet in all of its glory let's
go ahead and open it up so and sliding
out the box you can see already boom
there is the huge canvas of the twelve
point two inch screen of the note Pro
and it looks like Samsung still left it
with a small tab right here at the top
even though you have this huge canvas
and it is quite heavy you only have this
one tab to go ahead and separate it from
everything but since this already is a
tough tablet to put into the entire
frame I'm just gonna focus for now on
the contents that are in the rest of the
box
lift up the tab right here and we will
find what else is included and it looks
like the tablet even at its price point
we saw it at eight hundred and fifty
dollars on Amazon you get the tablet
that's pretty much what you're going to
be working with because on this um aside
from it you get the pins for the s-pen
if it happens to break you have the
instruction manual the micro looks like
USB 3.0 charging cable just like from
the note 3 and of course the adapter
plug and after that you don't really
have it looks like yeah you don't really
get anything else so it really is just
the tablet with the charging cable and
some pins for the or some replacement
tips for the s-pen and that's about it
to get a little bit better handling on
things I've moved over a little bit and
I've backed up from the confirm the
camera so that you can see the slate in
all of its glory here is the Note pro
12.2 some of my fingerprints are already
on there but that's okay and we have
just the full screen on here with a
pretty sizable bezel just under one inch
of the bezel going all the way around
the screen but else but after that we
have the typical layout and I like that
it's the black version it's really nice
we do have the button layouts are pretty
typical for a tablet of this size if you
have or if you've ever had a 10-inch
tablet this is pretty similar where you
have the volume rockers and the power
button here at the top and in terms of
holding this thing you will have to have
it in both hands this is not a one hand
device at all and it should be pretty
obvious considering its size so I'm
gonna go ahead and just turn it on over
here so we can go ahead and get some of
those reflections out of the way for one
thing all right there we go so we have
we are greeted with the original
TouchWiz that we see here with all of
thee
it does look a little bit more it looks
larger obviously because it's on this
big 12-point 2 inch screen but then if
we go over to the side here we are we
have the magazine UX so it is indeed on
here and it is obviously a part of the
TouchWiz operating system that we're
going to get used to from here on out I
will be doing a feature focus on the
magazine UX in order to show you really
what it can do and what all of the
widgets down here will be shown as and
what functionality they'll have when put
into this very large grid like style
there's a lot like the magazine UI the
my magazine rather it was called with
that you saw on the Galaxy Note 3 but
like I said already 12.2 inches in a
tablet is definitely a little bit
tougher to use than really anything else
I just took out the s-pen right now and
I'm trying to get a nice grip on the
tablet right now this is definitely
something you're probably gonna have on
a tabletop more often than not but I did
take out the S Pen and Here I am I'm
gonna start using it just for the usual
the usual functions that you probably
know from the Galaxy Note 3 there's the
air command menu right there but all in
all we still have the rather blah
touchwiz look in the home screens that
we have here but that's why the magazine
UX is so interesting and that's what
we're gonna look at in a future focus
video coming up after my full review so

tablet in a safe manner keep it tuned to
