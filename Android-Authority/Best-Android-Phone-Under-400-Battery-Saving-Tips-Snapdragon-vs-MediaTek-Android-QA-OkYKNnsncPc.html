back to Android QA my name is Jason this
is where we try and answer your most
pressing Android questions like what is
the best Andrew phone under 400 bucks
and which is the faster chip Snapdragon
or mediatek and my question is after
posting last week's question about how
to translate German using Android
Germans are coming out of the woodwork I
mean everyone love to point out that yes
they knew how to translate what I said
but because they were a native speaker
they didn't need to use Android leave me
to believe that many of you are secretly
lederhosen obsessed polka dancers hmm
could be fun just not shaving legs
alrighty i know many of your going to
want to know who won the homework test i
gave last week and i will get to that at
the end but let's start off with the
best android phone under 400 bucks mr.
Garchomp 123 asks I'm on a three to four
hundred dollar budget which phone should
i get next the best phones under 400
bucks are the Nexus 5 and the Moto X bar
none there are also a plethora of
options if you don't mind going to use
sites like sois pas and ebay you also
want to consider the zenfone series that
when our best of CES award as well as
the Moto G if you're looking to save a
little bit more money sir jargon one
asks battery saving is always a hot
topic for Android users and many apps
like battery doctor recommend a full
cycle charge at least once a month how
much merit is there to this I have come
across mixed opinions keep up the good
work yes you're right sir jogging one
there are people who have had many
heated debates on the subject of battery
optimization but there are some cold
hard facts we can rely on we know that a
lithium ion battery has a limited number
of charges to it right so eventually
your battery is going to fail now to
optimize and extend the life of your
battery you want to keep the charge
between ten percent and ninety percent
or twenty and eighty percent whatever is
easiest for you you don't want to
totally drain the battery and you don't
want to totally charge the battery if
you can avoid it now you don't have to
be fanatical about it I'm certainly not
I fully charged my phone on a regular
basis what I don't do is leave it in the
charger for hours after it's fully
charged but again if you want to extend
the life of your battery and you really
want this phone for two or three years
try and keep it between ten and ninety
percent now I do have another show in
this in the Android Q&amp;amp;A if you search
our channel with the keyword battery you
can find another show their thanks a lot
jace your ears move when you talk no
it's worse than that Andrew asks hey
Jace which processor is actually better
and faster for phones Snapdragon or
mediatek well Andrew the short answer is
that the Snapdragon is clearly the
better performing chipset in both
real-world testing and benchmarks the
Snapdragon comes out on top the thing is
however the Snapdragon processor is also
much more expensive and it's included in
vices like the HTC One the s4
xperia c series and those costs five
hundred dollars plus mediatek however is
the slower processor but is also much
more cost effective it allows for OEMs
to build budget devices that still have
sought after features like a quad-core
processor Android for more research you
can check out the links below and it
goes into more detail about those two
chipsets so guys after last week's show
I posed a question about how best to
translate a language using Android in
this case it was German and boy it
exploded we had over a thousand comments
on that video thank you so much but it
was clear that there are a lot more
native German speakers than I thought
and perhaps the question was a little
too easy but the first person i found
that i think is not a native speaker and
that did use android as instructed was
back her al Tikriti and sir if I am
mispronouncing your name please forgive
me but I'm going to contact you and find
out what your address is and ship you
one of whom those in fact I will not
make the same mistake and I'm going to
make sure that this week's question is
much harder thanks for watching android
army my name is jason i would love to
connect with you here on google+ or
twitter i read all your responses but
this week's Android Q&amp;amp;A question is the
following here we go why would Google
sell motorola mobility's hardware
division to lenovo for only 2.9 billion
dollars they bought motorola for more
than 12 billion two years ago what is
going on now most of you will already
know that they wanted the hardware
patents to defend themselves against
apple but there is more to it than that
I'm looking for well articulated
researched answers below for the best
answer you will win one of those i will
ship it to you anywhere in the world
good luck i will see you on android
weekly where I give my own take on that
same question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
