Rubin and he's not only famous for
wearing funky shirts but he is the
father of Android and he left Google to
create his own device rumored to be
called essential and it may have leaked
the sexist Andy Rubin upcoming essential
smartphone may have leaked online by the
benchmarking tool GFX bench the
benchmark was spotted by Russian website
mobile telephone with the moniker
essential fi HP m1 the sih part
indicates that the device could be
produced by Foxconn
International Holdings as has been
previously speculated now the results
suggest that the device would feature a
5.5 inch 2560 by 13 12 resolution with a
weird aspect ratio of 80 41 similar to
2:1 like the LG G 6 it's said to have an
octa-core Snapdragon 835 processor at
2.2 gigahertz with an adrenal 540 GPU
and 4 gigabytes of RAM the rear camera
meanwhile is said to come with a 12
megapixel camera and may lack autofocus
with a 7 megapixel camera is expected on
the front both are said to be capable of
shooting 4k the essential phone would
also support NFC and run Android nougat
right out of the box now you may be
thinking what I'm thinking why would
Andy Rubin who is an exceedingly smart
guy leave Google to start a company
that's making yet another smart phone I
mean for that to make sense he would
have to make something that is
fundamentally different and
revolutionary because that's the kind of
guy he is
he created Android remember that 9 to 5
Google hints that they might know what
that is
well 9 to 5 Google suggests that the
device will have some sort of magnetic
connector that serves some sort of
modular functionality if that's all it
is I'm not very hopeful they also
suggest that it will have some sort of
3d touch technology similar to Apple's
3d touch and will go on sale later this
year for 650 dollars a US or there
abouts I am not hope
I know some of you will be very hopeful
and some sort of modular technology but
you know I warned you about project ara
I warned you about the g5 it's all a
modular stuff that is cool for us geeks
but for the average uber average you
average uber average user they could
give a bunch of shiz nuts why because
they just doesn't matter to them it's
another level of complexity that just
doesn't move the needle for the average
user and therefore will not be sold at
scale and therefore will not be
something that you and I get to use I
got to see some sort of fundamental
shift I don't know what that's going to
be I don't know what you can do with a
smartphone that's another regular you
know chocolate bar form factor I'm
waiting for a breakthrough and wearables
or something I mean come on if anyone
can do it it can be Andy Rubin the man
had vision he saw mobile operating
system being a massive game-changer for
the whole world seven eight years before
anyone else did let's hope let's hope
what do you think let me know in the
comments below
Josh wait wait before I go I have to
give up a caveat set these are leaks and
rumors
these are speculation the spec list is
confusing it gives you a whole bunch of
weird things like 10 gigabytes of
internal storage you know a display
that's 18 inches or something like that
I mean what does that even mean it's
very cryptic and maybe these are red
herrings just throw people like me off
the scent from what Andy rivet is really
doing I don't know take it with a big
grain of salt but I want to know what
you think what could this be and better
yet what wouldn't matter I mean what
could be done in a smartphone that would
really change the game like the iPhone
did in 2007 let me know I want to hear
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
