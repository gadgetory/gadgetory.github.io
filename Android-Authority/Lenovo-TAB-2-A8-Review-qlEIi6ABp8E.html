device makers often focus only on key
components of the overall experience
with a quickly met budget audio quality
is often one of the many afterthoughts
Lenovo took a different approach though
with our affordable a tablet series this
is Bailey Stein with Android authority
and this is my floor view of the Lenovo
Tab 2 a 8 the sides and rear of the
tablet are made of a single piece of
matte plastic which meets with the
display frame the rear cover is navy
blue which is a nice change from the
usually default black the tablet itself
is 8.9 millimeters thick and weighs 390
grams it feels nice in the hand and you
probably wouldn't expect it to cost 130
dollars if you were to just pick it up
in the store it's a little too wide for
comfortable one-handed use but you
shouldn't really expect to handle a
device this large with a single hand
anyway there is a small flap on the back
which allows you to insert a microSD
card and presumably a SIM card if you
purchase the LTE model in addition to
that the two speakers on the device are
both on the front to the sides of the
display the one complaint that I do have
regarding the design is that the power
and volume buttons do feel a bit mushy
they're close to flush with the side of
the tablet and the feedback just isn't
that good
otherwise I think lenovo did a great job
with the design of the tablet the 8 inch
720p display looks decent and colors
look good viewing angles aren't the best
however and the relatively low
resolution leaves for a low pixel
density this is a budget tablet though
so I'm not going to complain as basic
users most likely won't notice the
difference when compared to with another
device equipped with a mediatek mt6752
a8 does perform well
the MTA 161 is one of media Tech's lower
end offerings but I didn't have any
performance issues sure it is a tad slow
at times but you really won't notice any
slowness when watching a video or
listening to music it does unfortunately
include just one gigabyte of RAM
I think is more of the bottleneck when
it comes to speed it works fine when
using a single app but if you leave that
app and go do something else you'll
likely run into problems with the Molly
T 7 20 G PU the little tab to a 8 is
able to handle most games just fine
including popular titles like Need for
Speed Most Wanted the gaming experience
is excellent when combined with the
audio quality which I think makes gaming
much more immersive my model of the tab
- aah the Wi-Fi model supports 802 11
and Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth 4.0 there is
also an LTE model but it's unknown when
that model will become available I was
happy to find support for GPS on the tab
2 a8 as some budget tablets exclude this
to save on cost being able to take the
tablet and use it for offline navigation
is very nice to have and I think that a
lot of users will benefit from this the
front-facing stereo speakers on the
device are really really good lenovo
says that the tablet includes dolby
atmos cinematic moving audio exclusively
and the quality is very apparent when
playing audio when watching a movie it
feels like you're actually sitting in a
theater just with a slightly smaller
screen you really have to experience the
sound for yourself to get the full
effect but believe me you will not be
disappointed
the tab to 8/8 five megapixel rear
camera is quite candidly awful images it
took black sharpness and just weren't
good I have no idea why they even
bothered with adding a rear camera but
it's there if you're really desperate
then again if you're buying a tablet for
its camera you're doing it wrong
battery life on the tab to a8 was fairly
good with very little standby usage
lenovo claims that the four thousand two
hundred and ninety milliamp battery will
last for up to eight hours and my
testing ended with similar results
although i wasn't able to make the
eight-hour mark i did manage to use the
tablet from 11:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. with
over five hours of screen on time
that was well connected to Wi-Fi with
brightness set to 100% i did leave it on
standby for about an hour but the rest
of the time was spent watching youtube
videos and writing reviews battery life
is good and most users will be able to
get the tablet to last through a full
day of use lenovo has shipped the tab to
a8 with a very lightly skinned version
of android 5.0 lollipop the only
noticeable UI changes are the custom
icons a few status bar changes changes
to the quick toggles and an actual home
button instead of just a circle the
custom icons are far from my cup of tea
but i think the status bar looks fine
i'm not sure if the blue accents added
to the quick toggles are irrelevant
addition to the experience but i'm ok
with them
the only other changed lenovo made to
the experience was that they disabled
animations out of the box which makes
android feel a bit edgy
no worries however is you can always
reenable the animations with androids
developer options another addition is
the notification log which lets you see
a log of dismissed notifications I can
see all could be useful for some users
although I personally didn't check it
outside of my normal testing and that's
pretty much it lenovo has kept
everything else stock which is a very
nice change from their heavy vibe UI
skin the setup lockscreen launcher
multitasking menu and settings are all
very lightly modified if at all lenovo
is offering the tab to a 8
navy blue with 16 gigabytes of internal
storage starting at $130 for the Wi-Fi
model unlike some mediatek devices that
16 gigabytes is a single partition so
you don't have to worry about having
internal storage and phone storage
separate if 16 gigabytes isn't enough
lenovo has you covered with a microSD
card expansion slot up to 32 gigabytes
lenovo has undoubtedly built a very
solid tablet at a competitive price
point the strong points include a classy
design and excellent audio setup and a
close to stock Android 5.0 experience on
the other hand the tab to a8 falls a bit
behind with just one gigabyte of RAM a
slower processor and a mediocre display
yes there are better options available
for almost twice the cost but for a
hundred and thirty dollars
the Lenovo Tab 2 a 8 delivers an
entertainment experience that has yet to
be rivaled at this price point if you're
on a tight budget and just want a brand
new tablet you should really give it
