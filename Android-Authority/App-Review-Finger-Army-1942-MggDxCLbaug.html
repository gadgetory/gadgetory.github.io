from android authority calm and today
we'll be talking about finger army 1942
it's a fast finger flying frenzy
available in the Google Play Store for
99 cents for this game what you see is
mostly what you get along the right side
of the screen there are only four menu
buttons play starts the game resume
resume the game and then there are high
scores and help the help menu is a mini
slideshow that helps explain what
everything is what it does and how the
game works this includes the various
gauges the various characters how
playing works and much more when you did
play to start the game you'll be taken
to a small pregame menu this menu also
appears postgame to show your score
gameplay and finger army 1942 is
dreadfully simple in fact it's nothing
you haven't seen in a whack-a-mole game
bad guys come popping up out of the
holes and you must tap on them to make
them go away the point is to keep
bending them off until the timer
whittles down if time runs out and
you're above the halfway mark in the
target meter you win the round and
proceed to the next one if you aren't
then you must play the round over again
and nearly each new level a new bad guys
introduced most of them give you more
points and require additional taps to
get rid of if you like the medic or the
white flag guy will actually reduce your
points also if you miss entirely it
lowers your score and your target meter
this means it is only mostly senseless
tapping you do have to pay attention
sometimes ron's take less than a minute
and gradually get longer the short
gameplay makes getting really far in
this game a quick endeavor but the
plethora of bad guys that can both
improve and reduce your score helps keep
it challenging getting to round 10 isn't
that bad but getting to round 20 is much
harder when we added it all up gameplay
got a 3 out of 5 star rating when we saw
the graphics and finger army 1942 we
thought that it wasn't bad but that it
wasn't great either however considering
that this is a game where you're playing
whack-a-mole against fingers dressed
like soldiers we suppose the graphics
couldn't be much better that said the
design of the game does make sense the
various characters can be easily
differentiated but looks similar enough
to make you stop and look at them before
tapping things like Target meter and
other stats at the top stand out well
and are easily read the overall design
isn't bad and the graphics aren't
horrible so we gave them a 3 out of 5
star rating like most android games this
game depends on players wanting to come
back and play more if you're on a long
run and need to stop you could hit the
pause button in the top left and select
quit you can then resume from the main
menu when you return to the game so if
you're strapped for time there is a
rudimentary saving mechanism in place
even when you do lose the game replaying
from the beginning isn't so bad
progressing through the first 10 levels
literally takes a few minutes so gamers
won't get stuck playing the slow boring
beginner levels to get back to the part
of the game that's actually fun due to
the levels being really short and the
fact that the boring parts can be
completed very quickly we gave replay
value of 4 out of 5 stars when you look
at this game overall it's definitely not
bad while wacom will stop being cool
like 20 years ago it's only because
going to places where whack Amole exists
stop being cool like 20 years ago the
game mechanics are still very enjoyable
even if it's just in short bursts to
waste a few minutes the rapid fire
gameplay mixed with the various enemies
make this a perfect game to waste five
minutes while waiting in line somewhere
however we wouldn't recommend it for
players looking for a more serious game
they can spend hours on that isn't to
say it isn't worth the buck you paid for
it we're simply saying that given the
premise of the game it won't be for
everyone when we put everything together
we gave an overall value of 3 out of 5
stars once again I'm Joe Hindy from
