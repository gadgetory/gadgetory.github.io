didn't just give us two versions they
gave us three we now have three Moto G
phones for 2016 the Moto G 4 plus the
Moto G 4 and the Moto G for play the G 4
plus is definitely the highest and
device out of the three while the g4
proper is still a great option but
features slightly lesser specs and while
the g4 play is the lowest end device of
all three it still comes with specs and
features that seem to be mostly in line
with last year's Moto G starting out
with the display it's clear that Lenovo
is focusing on bringing solid specs to
the Moto G line this time around both
the g4 and the g4 plus sport 5.5 inch
full HD panels while the 2015 Moto G has
only a 5-inch 720 screen in our full
Moto G 2015 review we noted that the
screen was one of the least favorite
parts of the device so we're happy
lenovo decided to include bigger and
better displays this year round last
year's Moto G sported a 1.4 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 410 CPU with either
one or two gigabytes of RAM the g4 and
g4 plus now both come with 1.5 gigahertz
octa core snapdragon 617 processors with
at least two gigabytes ram there's also
a 4 gigabyte option variant with the g4
plus if you need something with a little
bit more power now in terms of on-board
storage the Moto G 2015 only came with
eight or 16 gigabytes it did have
expandable storage up to 32 gigabytes
they'll compared to other low to mid to
your devices on the market these storage
options could have been better the Moto
G for and g4 plus now both come with 16
or 32 gigabytes of on-board storage why
the plus also sports a 64 gigabyte
Varian both new devices come with a
microSD expansion slot up to 128
gigabytes more space is always a good
thing now if the images are correct the
new one plus three ditches it's
sandstone black finish in favor of an
all metal design overall the design is
more than a little bit different than
its predecessor though the front-facing
fingerprint scanner can clearly be seen
in the images here and it's really no
surprise to see this feature making a
return that's about all we can glean
from the one plus three leaks though we
can turn to the room
for a few other alleged specs rumors
claim will be seeing two versions of the
one plus three one with four gigabytes
of RAM and 32 gigabytes of on-board
storage and the other with six gigabytes
of RAM and 64 gigs of on-board storage
pricing is expected to be aggressive as
seen with its predecessor there aren't
too many solid rumors about the rest of
specs though a snapdragon 820 is pretty
luckily so what do you think about the
one plus 3s design provided these images
are accurate do you think it's too early
to talk about Samsung's next big thing
well like it or not rumors about the
Galaxy Note six are already coming in
and we have a doozy from Evan blass
universally known to the tech world as
evleaks the leaker claimed Samsung will
unveil the note 6 in mid-august just
like it did with the note 5 last year
now if Blass is correct a Samsung is
about to repeat history with the note 6
presumably launching ahead of FIFA and
the all-important fall iphone release it
would give the device room to shine in a
market where large screens have become
the norm so what else do we know about
the note 6 well fortunately for those of
you who like your product launches
unspoiled the device is largely shrouded
in mystery but we do a few clues a
couple reports point to the obvious a
similar design to the galaxy s7
waterproofing USB type-c support and a
blackberry hub like new app called focus
which will reportedly consolidate
messages from multiple apps so who's
excited for the note 6
