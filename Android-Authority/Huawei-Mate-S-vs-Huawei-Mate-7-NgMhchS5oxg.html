first all-metal big-screen smartphone in
the form of the mate 7 which brought a
stylish design and a unique single touch
fingerprint sensor fast forward a year
and while I introduced the maitre sir
Aoife bring in an updated design and the
second generation of its fingerprint
sensor but how do these two devices
compare hey what's up everybody is near
of here friend rarity bringing you a
quick look at the huawei mate s versus
the ascend mate 7 although it has a
frameless display the mate 7 is
definitely one of the largest
smartphones on the market and even
though I've got large hands I find it
quite difficult to use in one hand with
the mate s Huawei's made its latest
flagship smaller and more manageable
which results in a much improved in hand
experience Huawei says both smartphones
have frameless displays and while this
is somewhat true both devices also come
with an on screen bezel where the active
pixels actually stop and the screen
continues the back of the mate 7 is
slightly curved and a key change in the
mate s is the depth of the curb with new
flagship curving a lot more this results
in the mate s feeling a lot better in
the hand and it's also allowed Huawei to
make the handset just two point six five
millimeters thick at its thinnest point
although it's worth noting is 7.2
millimeters thick in the middle both
devices have the power and volume keys
on the right along with the SIM tray on
the left on the mate 7 the sim and
microSD card trays are separate while on
the mate s they've been combined into
one tray just like on the honor 7
beneath the camera on the back while is
also at the fingerprint Center and while
some people may not like the fact that
it's located on the back the center is
position so it sits where your finger
naturally does when you're holding the
phone in your hand up top we put the
headphone jack and microphone while at
the bottom both devices have the micro
USB 2.0 port
neither smartphone has an IR blaster
which is unfortunate but all smartphones
seem to be dropping this quite useful
feature another key changes in the
display technology with the mate 7
sporting a 6 inch IPS display and the
mate s a smaller and more vibrant 5.5
inch AMOLED panel both screen sport Full
HD resolution and while there are better
quad HD and 4k displays on the market
Full HD is more
good enough for most users while the
mate7 screen is certainly no slouch the
switch to AMOLED means the may test is a
lot more immersive and offers more
vibrant and set saturated colors and
deeper blacks while we've also made a
luxury version of the mate s which comes
through the world's first force touch
smartphone display but this will only be
available in certain markets and has a
limited feature set overall while the
mate s screen certainly isn't the best
on the market it does offer an
impressive experience and is likely to
be enough to satisfy most users like
most flagship devices both the mate s
and the mate 7 equipped with a range of
features that we've come to expect from
the very best devices on the market both
hands are powered by wires own optical
Kirin processor and while the mate7 uses
the older Kirin 95 clocked at 1.8
gigahertz the mate s uses the newer
Kiran 935 with a higher clock speed of
2.2 gigahertz the mate 7 comes into
storage versions the entry-level which
we have has 2 gigabytes RAM and 16
gigabyte storage while the premium
version comes with 32 gigabytes of
storage and 3 gigabytes of RAM the mate
s comes with 3 gigabytes of RAM as
standard and either 32 gigabyte 64
gigabytes or 128 gigabyte storage if
you're after the forced touch display
this is limited to just 128 gigabyte
model but whichever model you do buy you
can expand it using a micro SD card on
the back
both have Huawei's trademark OneTouch
square fingerprint sensor and this is
where a year has made a really big
difference that mate 7 just lets you
unlock your phone by tapping sensor but
in the mate s while have not only made
this feature faster but also added
gesture support as far as phablets go
battery is a big part of the experience
and while the original phablets bought
large batteries we've noticed companies
making smartphone batteries smaller in
general Huawei is no different and the
mate7 has a 4100 milliamp hour battery
that is simply outstanding while the may
s burns are much smaller 2,700 milliamp
hour the big battery on the make 7 means
it takes a long time to charge to full
but Huawei has improved this and quit
charging on the mate s means that you
can charge an entire battery from empty
in under two hours both handsets offer
expandable storage and while we says the
microSD card slot
also doubles up as a secondary SIM card
slot on the mate7 however our version
doesn't have dual sim support but this
is available in selected markets on the
mate s dual SIM is included in all
variants by default and this lets you
use two SIM cards at once each with
their own 4G LTE connection while ways
using a quite clever dual antenna system
to get around its metal build and this
means the handset can intelligently
switch between antenna depending on
which is offering the best reception as
a result high data speeds a reliable
connection and great cell coverage all
come as standard on the huawei mate s if
there's any area where Huawei does
itself no favors it is the software and
it's also where these two devices differ
quite considerably a key criticism of
Huawei is a lack of future platform
upgrades and a year after launch the
mate7 is still using KitKat with the
lollipop update absolutely nowhere to be
seen the mate s runs the lollipop update
with emotion UI version 3.1
out-of-the-box and while this is the
same version of the EMU I found in this
years without a p8 the bugs and glitches
found in the PA are no more and while we
is also tweaked and added a few new
features emotion UI also comes with new
themes that change accents and UI colors
to match the color of the handset you
have yes while way is particularly
slower updating its devices and you're
probably going to be waiting a while for
the marshmallow update on the mate s but
the software experience is a lot better
than on past Huawei devices it's a
smooth interface and aside from a
missing app drawer and a fair amount of
pre-loaded bloatware it's actually
pretty usable the camera on the mate 7
was something of a letdown as the lack
of stabilization meant you had to keep
the handset completely still to ensure
the final image wasn't blurry both of
these devices offer 13 megapixel sensors
but the addition of oh is in the mate s
means this is a smartphone camera that
mostly keeps up with some very good
competition
they say that cameras are about more
than just megapixel and this is
certainly true with the mate S which
shows just what Oh is can do to overall
images produced now most if not all the
images you capture are sharp and vibrant
and effective stabilisation means you
can now leave the shutter open for as
long as a quarter of a second and still
have Kris photos the front of the mate 7
sports a 5-megapixel selfie camera
that can take 720p video while the may
test brings a much better 8 megapixel
sensor that can shoot Full HD video and
has a soft light to help lighten the
scene while a selfie flash certainly
isn't new it does make a massive
difference to the selfies you take and
any you do take can also be tweaked
using huawei's Beauty level modes the 32
gigabyte mate s has a price of 649 euros
in Europe or 469 pounds in the UK while
the mate 7 has dropped in price
significantly and can be picked up for
around 280 pounds for the 16 gigabyte
version the 32 gigabyte version of the
mate s comes in either titanium gray or
the mystic champagne silver version
we've got while the 64 big version comes
in either luxurious gold or cobalt pink
almost half the price of the mate s the
mate 7 is certainly an interesting
smartphone but the mate s does have
enough improvements to warrant the
additional cost if you can afford it so
there you have it a quick look at the
huawei mate s and the ascend mate 7 and
what a difference a year makes what do
you think the changes that Huawei is
made in the year that's passed let us
