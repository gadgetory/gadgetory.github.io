name is kevin the tech ninja and today
we're going to talk about wirelessly
charging your Galaxy s5 what is the best
way to do it how to do it and how much
it cost first up is the $70 s view cover
case this is a leather flip cover case
with a square cut out and the front flap
this case is one of the better design
cases that I've used the leather feels
genuine and the stitching feels deep
into the case the window is made out of
very tough scratch resistant plastic the
cutouts are precise and actually look
really good overall the case looks
elegant and it feels very good in your
hand the case to me screams high quality
and it's almost justifying the steep
price tag of $70 the main reason I'm
talking about this case is because it
has a built in wireless charging to
install the case remove the backplate of
your s5 place the metal contacts on the
back of your phone and then press the
case down when the phone screen is
powered on in the case is closed you
have a shortened version of your lock
screen with a quick access to a few
things like clock and weather when you
have notifications like media invites
phone calls or also the music player you
can interact with it right through the
phone's case and that's really all there
is to do overall I really like the flip
style of case it looks elegant and it
feels great in my hand and also being
able to access the phone while it's
being closed is very cool but I do find
myself going to my notification bar to
actually see what notifications I do
have which I actually can't do you're
only allowed to flip between the screens
and access the widgets that are actually
already on the lockscreen
now I've been using this case for a few
weeks and it's still not broken in all
the way so I'm not sure if the flap will
ever break in at this point but what
happens is the flap automatically comes
open sometimes even when you're not
interacting with it but only time will
tell on this also it seems like Samsung
software does not fully recognize the
case since I get a message about
checking the back casing even though my
case is fully secured so the flip cover
case is not your thing Samsung also
provides the S charger cover inductive
type case and this can be purchased on
Samsung's website for 30
this case snaps on the back ear device
just like the standard s5 back it's a
few millimeters thicker and
aesthetically it looks like the same
material but it's actually more plastic
than it is that rubbery feeling that'
bulkiness at first glance is apparent
but after using it for some times you
quickly get adjusted to it something
else I feel the need to mention is that
when you're adding the new back slim
case is no longer fit on the device so
that's something to be mindful of and
just like the flip cover case you secure
the back on and put on the wireless
charger and it just charges now the
cutouts are just like what you expect on
the standard case but it does give you
that stock like a parents which is
important and now we come to the
charging pads these pads are starting to
become more and more popular over the
last few years now these are small metal
prongs that connect to the metal
connectors on the backside of your phone
to achieve wireless charging I've used a
few of these and to be honest they don't
work as well as you'd expect but I did
find one company that actually made them
correctly and this is the tilt view mate
the view may may be more expensive than
the ones for five dollars on eBay but
this is truly a case of you get what you
pay for
to install it just stick it on the
battery and connect the connectors then
when closing the case be sure to apply
downward pressure to be sure the pads
have a solid connection for less than
$25 adding wireless functionality
without any extra bulk or case it's
pretty awesome in my opinion and in my
experiences since it does not add any
extra bulk other cases work and it
actually does wireless charging through
the case
and there you have it folks
hopefully you have a better
understanding on how to wirelessly
charge a galaxy s5 it is quite
interesting that Samsung does not
included in the phone but they do have
these accessories that you can purchase
anyways guys the wireless the charging
mat the one from tilt actually works on
your Note 3 and the Galaxy S 4 as well

get out of those devices too if you like
