plus a pretty unique propositions from
hmd global it's the first time I
remember seeing a flagship device there
isn't a hundred percent superior to its
mid-range counterpart thus the decision
as to which device to go for is not
simply a matter of budget in this case
let's break it down then and see what
the difference is that matter really are
take the design for instance don't get
me wrong
the Nokia eight Sirocco is a flagship
device in many regards it's just that a
lot of its and most compelling features
also come with caveats this device has a
beautiful design an incredibly tough
build quality it's crafted from a single
stainless steel block encoded entirely
in curved glass it's also incredibly
slim at 7.5 millimeters it has a
beautiful 1/4 40 by 2 560 P P OLED
display the cascades over the sides of
the device like the Samsung s9 it's a
5.5 inch panel with a 16 by 9 aspect
ratio
there's also ip67 certification but no
headphone jack that we can trust that in
this case the omission really wasn't
service of the slimmer form factor I
said in my review that I loved with the
design it feels weighty and has a really
unique look to it you really have to see
in person I personally really liked
using it but those tapered edges are
also pretty sharp and some people find
it uncomfortable to hold as a result
likewise the glass looks a bit
discolored where it curves and the metal
body can get hot during charging and
gaming so how does the considerably
cheaper Nokia 7 plus stack up in terms
of design really well actually is
crafted from a single block of 6000
series aluminium and coated in multiple
layers of ceramic paint it also feels
hefty and premium in the hand and has an
attractive copper accent around the
sides the screen isn't as crisp at 1080p
by - 160 P and nor is it as punchy as as
an LCD but it's also much larger at 6
inches and with a more modern 18 by 9
aspect ratio that extra real estate is
great for watching movies reading
webpages and more and while it doesn't
look quite as stunning as the Sirocco it
also doesn't bring any of the big
compromises there's even a headphone
jack here but you do lose the water and
dust resistance in terms of performance
you're basically looking at snapdragon
85 with 6 gigabytes of RAM in this rock
versus the 660 and 4 gigabytes of RAM in
these seven plus that means that you
should see significantly greater
performance in gaming and multitasking
on the Sirocco and that's exactly what I
found in my own reviews I even played
some emulated GameCube games on the
Sirocco
but this discrepancy comes with
disclaimers two for one the Snapdragon
660 is likely to be more than sufficient
for pretty much all your gaming and
productivity needs even if this isn't a
flagship chipset at the same time the
Snapdragon 85 is not a current gen
flagship processor either the 835 is no
slouch at all don't get me wrong but if
your reasoning for choosing the Sirocco
if the seven plus was that you wanted
the very best well then it doesn't quite
add up both devices are running Android
8.1 and a part of the Android one
program - they're nippy and stocky in
that regard the nokia 8 Sirocco has more
storage at one to eight two gigabytes
versus 64 but the seven-plus has the
bigger battery at 3800 million powers
versus 3260 milliamp hours and this is
very noticeable when it comes to the
idle times which fantastic on the
seven-plus and finally the camera setups
are also interesting both devices have
dual cameras with the exact same specs
on the back but around the front the
Nokia 7 plus actually has a slightly
higher megapixel count it's only 5
megapixels on the eight Scirocco versus
16 megapixels on the 7 plus so in theory
the 7 plus actually has the superior
suite of cameras all things considered
there strangely I did find that the
Sirocco actually delivered slightly
better pictures from the rear shooter
this might have something to do with the
more powerful processor which may be
allowed for better post-processing or it
might be my imagination it's a slight
thing at any rate so to conclude while
the Sirocco is ostensibly the flagship
here it has a smaller battery no
headphone jack smaller screen worst
selfie camera and a divisive though
impressive design the 7 Plus on the
other hand might have middle-of-the-road
internals Allura res LCD screen and an
absent IP rating those are its only real
crimes
what nokia is done here is to create an
incredibly compelling mid-range
smartphone and a somewhat ho-hum premium
smartphone and for that reason the
seven-plus is definitely the better
device in terms of value for money now
let's hope hmd blows all our socks off
soon by sticking some killer internals
into a set
plus a body sometimes seen preferably
thanks time for watching guys I hope you
found this video useful and interesting
comment down below and let us know which
your favorite Nokia devices may be it's
neither of these share it around if you
liked it hit like that helps out
