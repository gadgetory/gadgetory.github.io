s6 edge was Diego s from Venezuela if
you happen to be watching diego
congratulations on your brand-new
samsung galaxy s6 edge and will be
getting a hold of you shortly to find
out how we can get it to you this week
we are partnering with oper max to bring
you not one but three smartphones for
this week's giveaway they are the
samsung galaxy s6 the galaxy s6 edge and
the LG g4 all of them features 64-bit
CPUs amazing camera experiences and
above-average designs that help them
stand out from the competition if you
want to check out any of these devices
will have links to the reviews for all
three devices posted in the video
description below okay let's get you
folks entered to win this contest the
first thing you'll need to do is head on
over to the contest page and scroll down
to the gleam giveaway widgets of course
you'll need to sign into the widget
before we can begin the first step is
downloading opera max don't worry
everybody it's a free application that
helps you monitor and save data and it
can even block applications from
accessing data on your device download
the application and you will get to
contest entries if you want another
contest entry you can watch my review of
opera max which is linked in the gleam
widget this will net you one contest
entry and I think I did pretty good with
the review it'll also help show you more
about what opera max is really about for
a quick contest entry you can follow
opera on Twitter once you're logged into
the gleam widget you should just have to
click the plus one button and it should
do it automatically assuming you've
logged in with twitter for another quick
entry you can also subscribe to Opera's
youtube channel nothing fancy there just
head to the page subscribe come back and
nab that entry okay the next two parts
are the most important parts we want to
see what applications use up the most
data on your smartphone to do this
you'll need to install opera max and use
it for a few days opera max will keep
track of what applications use your data
how much data they use and how much data
opera max has saved you once you've got
a few days of that take a screenshot and
then post that screenshot to Twitter
Instagram or both with the data eaters
hashtag then come back to the giveaway
widget and enter those screenshots into
the give
way guys this is worth a whopping 10
contest entries so don't forget that
hashtag and finally as always once
you've entered to win using any of the
ways I just described head to the refer
friends section at the bottom of the
widget to pick up your custom link share
that link with your friends any way you
want to and for each one of your friends
that enters this giveaway using your
link you will earn two additional
contest entries and that about does it
for this week ladies and gentlemen it's
a little bit more complicated than usual
but we are giving away three phones here
and also even if you don't win keep
opera max around for a little bit and
use it it's actually a really good
application that's it for this one folks
best of luck to everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
