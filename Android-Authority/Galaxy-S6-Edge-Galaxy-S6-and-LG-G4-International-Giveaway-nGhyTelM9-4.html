entry and I think I did pretty good with
the review it'll also help show you more
about what opera max is really about for
a quick contest entry you can follow
opera on Twitter once you're logged into
the gleam widget you should just have to
click the plus one button and it should
do it automatically assuming you've
logged in with twitter for another quick
entry you can also subscribe to Opera's
youtube channel nothing fancy there just
head to the page subscribe come back and
nab that entry okay the next two parts
are the most important parts we want to
see what applications use up the most
data on your smartphone to do this
you'll need to install opera max and use
it for a few days opera max will keep
track of what applications use your data
how much data they use and how much data
opera max has saved you once you've got
a few days of that take a screenshot and
then post that screenshot to Twitter
Instagram or both with the data eaters
hashtag then come back to the giveaway
widget and enter those screenshots into
the give
way guys this is worth a whopping 10
contest entries so don't forget that
hashtag and finally as always once
you've entered to win using any of the
ways I just described head to the refer
friends section at the bottom of the
widget to pick up your custom link share
that link with your friends any way you
want to and for each one of your friends
that enters this giveaway using your
link you will earn two additional
contest entries and that about does it
for this week ladies and gentlemen it's
a little bit more complicated than usual
but we are giving away three phones here

opera max around for a little bit and
use it it's actually a really good
application that's it for this one folks
