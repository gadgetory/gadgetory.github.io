typically make it new year's resolutions
trying to better themselves um and
litter your social networking feeds
about how hard it is to lose weight oh
yeah yeah we need to do that yeah I need
to make a star to lose my grinding my
legs are hurting so bad right now all
right so on the Android news front we're
going to talk about some CES information
some CES devices that are most likely
going to be announced next week or once
a we at least would hope and think are
gonna be announced next week we're
either i am going to be there a whole
bunch of the android authority crew is

gonna be a lot of us there we're gonna
blanket CES with with our awesomeness
arm we're gonna bring as much Android
news and videos and articles and
comments as we can to the Android
universe to be a lot of fun we're gonna
decal we're going to learn a lot we're
gonna do a lot of interviews actually
Darcy's been hard at work setting up
interviews of the past couple days um
then uh then we're gonna party in Vegas
in the Ignite I've never been there
before so you know I hear uh here you
know what happens in Vegas stays in
Vegas oh I'm looking for I'm kidding I'm
kidding honey CES I'm excited you know
every year we have a CES and we have
something to look forward to um
hopefully not that droid phone that was
released like six months after which one
with the Bionic all the bad one yeah all
right so CES yes we're gonna talk about
ces stuff in the next week we're gonna
have a CES recap but this week we're in
hit up some ecosystem news as always
we're gonna talk about some apps if you
device updates and vulnerability patches
talk about a boot why from Canada we're
gonna talk about ubuntu phone uh and uh
yeah a few of the things in the root in
ramen world I'd so and next show is
gonna be on a different day on a
different time yeah yeah so CES is a all
week long so instead of having the
Thursday show and you know missing all
the good stuff from from thursday and
then plus i'm traveling thursday so i
won't be able to tell you about all cool
stuff i saw so we're gonna actually do
the show on friday night next friday so
those you that watch us live check us
out on friday and those you the follow
us after the show I'll need of YouTube
or SoundCloud or wherever you find us on
the interwebs will probably be a day
late there as well so we probably reach
those places
to maybe saturday which hi saturday if
you're listening to us now anyways wayne
like that alright so let's get start
with some Android ecosystem stuff so
gingerbread is finally below fifty
percent it's been on the decline for a
while it's finally below fifty percent
as of the end of last month the end of
the year which it which is nice you know
it's a two year old operating system
it's about damn time jellybean is
finally in the double digits at ten
percent whoo uh-uh only one percents
rock the only one percent rockin 4.2
though but which isn't bad i mean the
only thing on 4.2 is nexus device
there's nothing else or you know if
maybe if your law custom roms I guess do
the factor that in yeah yeah it's your
access in the API you're accessing the
play store with oh there's a those
versions I'd so uh credit dilly beans
growing fast on ICS was it was it there
is it yeah because ICS was my thing the
benefit is a lot bigger with roots to
performance and butteriness wild ginger
bread ICS is more drastic than us yes to
jelly bean if it is gaining traction
faster I would say that's compared to
the success of the Nexus 7 you know
those things that you know tons of
people have those uh maybe that helps
out a little bit yeah donate release
some numbers like 4000 some like that
what sold Nexus force vectors for ya
we'll talk about that a little bit I
love it that's a number yet you love
numbers all right so so dan murrell he's
a big badass in the Android world if you
don't who he is should check him out he
build Android for a very long time um
and he long enough that back in Oh was a
2000 the I'm not even gonna say the year
cuz I don't want to get it wrong so many
a year ago before the bugdroid was the
official mascot dan
was doing some doodles and he came up
with four different dan droids as people
called them a red blue green and yellow
dumb robot and they all had potential to
you know possibly become the bugdroid
mascot apparently um but but uh
obviously they did not he posted images
of those on his Google+ account the
other day and it's pretty neat one
interesting fact that he he talked about
later in the comments was these robots
uh well he said that the initial
internal developer launch was called
r2d2 which stood for release to
developers to it was the second release
and developers so right around the time
that he put these robots out now as the
r2d2 internal version so that's kind of
neat um but as you know Android decided
to go with sweets and desserts for a
naming scheme because they couldn't use
robots as the Android versions because
well those names are trademarked so yeah
we can't have a data you know we can't
have an r2d2 we can't have a how a
bishop um any other robot named that you
can think of from sci-fi movies and
shows and whatnot anyways um moving on
so let's talk about Android communities
Scott how many Nexus or Android
communities you part of on google+ Oh a
couple oh good thing about communities
is unknowable they haven't really ever
find it yet so I'm in limited amount of
communities right now how about you John
are you and a lot of communities for
Android or nexus devices Oh Nexus not
some not as much as I used to man I do
follow or Nexus community by Muslim
tolerant and no two communities now but
not correct well I'm in way too many
communities um I was in over 60 beauty
well I was in over 60 now I'm thankfully
in 40 I'm gonna hopefully get that down
to like 10
maybe but uh I left a whole bunch this
past week because the Nexus now has an
official supported community well what
does that mean who knows but it's an
official nexus community like likewise
this an official android community now
so i was in a bunch of we know i was in
the nexus 4 owners but you know i'm not
odor anymore i gave it away i saw with
it I was in the galaxy nexus one when I
was in a nexus 7 1 I was in the nexus
one and then our good friend Randy Kelly
actually started a private invite-only
Nexus owners 1 i'm going to stay in that
but all the other unofficial nexus
communities I left because I yeah I
think eventually people will flock to to
that Nexus community so if you weren't
aware it's out there it started about a
week ago less than that um that it's the
official nexus community so it looks so
far you know there a lot of people are
posting their it's so pretty popular so
you can want to check it out now not so
much Android ecosystem related or Google
related but it is noble related so we're
going to talk about this just for a
second um an honorable mention as we
know next week is CES well the ctia and
mobile con are other shows a little bit
smaller a lot smaller than CES but
they're the you know they're popular
shows that you have mobile technology
android devices in and so forth they
decided to join forces to create a super
mobile show and oddly enough Scott guess
what the name of the show is called
super mobile shell my goodness no way
yeah so um you know uh quirky
uninteresting names aside it's a super
mobile show called super mobile shell
and we'll see it a thick in there to try
to spice it up alone yeah Emma Virgin
Mary I mean maybe they could call SMS
you know super mobile show but people
get that confused with text messages
yeah but uh yeah so we have to wait a
year to see
the first super marble shell but well
when I don't know when the data is but
will happen in 2014 so uh let's talk
about some apps a couple weeks ago on
google+ I said tell me the apps that you
can't live without and sorry about that
sneezed um we had a bunch of people
comment listing their top apps that they
use it to top apps they couldn't live
without and that's a little different
than what Google's best of 2012 apps
were so just as a recap I'll ask what
you guys think and then viewers and
listeners that are watching right now
let me know you know if you think this
is on on the money these are the apps
that you can't live without to or if
there's something that should be added
to this list so anyways we asked people
in Google+ and they responded on letting
us know their apps that they can't live
without and oddly enough Google+ was the
number one app because you know we all
asked on google+ I'm sure if I asked on
facebook facebook would have been the
number one I guess uh they suppose F is
horrible I don't use facebook i don't
know right so now the number two most
popular apples google now which we know
is actually just google search but
everyone was typed in you know a google
now which that's great to see a lot of
people actually you know using google
now in love and loving google now it's
great i use it every day um you know i
mean it i find a new use you know for it
all the time traveling with it is
amazing it said if you just use it
locally when you get wait to go out of
state you know vacation or to see yes
next week i mean is it's awesome i love
it especially for traveling so a
swiftkey swiftkey is still extremely
popular but only one percent of people
have the new keyboard in android 4.2 I
don't use swiftkey anymore I haven't
since ICS when ICS came out I stopped
using swiftkey and I didn't think I
needed anymore you guys are you swifty
still oh I have it on my own I have the
floor beta how do you like the flow beta
mean we presume yeah I group the tablet
version flow everything all together and
just swiftkey well you know it's was
it's the third most popular
according to our users when I have a
stylist out it makes it just works
better because i'm gonna use gestures
and stuff interesting so just happening
so Android users use gmail obviously it
was number four that people can't live
without then Evernote Evernote also made
Google's list of the best apps of 2012
so it's nice to see that in there so
they're on the money with that and the I
mean staying up with the Google
ecosystem we saw google play music is
the number six most popular then chrome
which a lot of people don't like chrome
because it's they think of lags you know
it does sometimes i guess a little
jittery from time to time but the
coolest thing about it is the tab
sinking so but people love it for that
then they list that is the number seven
actually it was the only browser
actually listed and all the people that
responded to that little survey and
spotify was on there for people that
were mainly people that can google music
a lot of people said that you spotify
because they can you know there are
international users uh and dropbox was
on there as number 9 and number ten was
Flipboard um i don't use a lot of those
actually i mean most of them actually I
mean the Google ones that use I
personally uh I use chrome I use music
gmail you will now google plus i got use
all the google apps but all the other
ones i don't use anymore i have used
evernote I don't don't use Dropbox
anymore don't use Flipboard don't I've
never used 55 you know I modifier
there's a good so like I said let us
know in the comments if you agree with
that list we see if you think there's
anything else that should be out of
there and then and y Moi react about it
here in a minute what they worth noting
with well both lists but especially
Google's list is probably the Holy
curated list they put together where
every single application on there
follows the design guidelines yeah
because all the rest of them they'll
just sling something that's you know I
mean it's good to see that the users are
valuing not just core functionality but
the experience to agreed yeah and I
think they can they can definitely tell
that you know they're not gonna unless
it's an app that does a lot
and is very very good yeah like tasker
yeah cuz tesco just and do well overdue
for some yeah and I I see some people
commenting a drop box with me it's more
of a used as an add-on service um with a
file manager I just have you know cloud
storage so i don't use the app at all
but i do use the services through
another app which is nice so you know
it's got mad at you what did you say
that we were gonna do last week that
we're not doing right now yeah yeah I
know what you're gonna say and it
involves yeah all right I love them
they're in the IRC channel right now
it's me it's dan Dan's idol and mumbler
it whoever mumbler it is he's been
idling there with us for four long since
we created the channel actually in so
thank you smuggler and Dan for curvy and
they don't we didn't tell anybody else
we're gonna do it so maybe you it and
next week with CES maybe that will do a
CES show next weekend and we'll finally
you know activate the IRC channel if I
had it now for six months we can use
away these days or what all right so can
do it moving on with apps when then
we'll start talking about some fun stuff
uh who uses nova launcher i use nova
launcher i have a cake tin to know KP
give it up in John launching users never
launched to receive the huge update this
week I'm not gonna get into all the
details a massive massive feature so if
you're not using that you know check it
out it if it's great I I love it it's my
favorite launcher um yeah if you want to
see the change log good you know check
it out i'm not gonna go in all the
detail that I was born let's give this
some cool stuff like all right so Scott
let's see oh let's see Scott 13 years
ago so when you were like four years old
um did you play starcraft heavy
Starcraft player I how are you John did
you play starcraft um no I'm all
computer i played it kind about proxy
with a bunch of friend
tough yeah well I want big stars come on
craft enough to know yeah I was a big
star craft fan and this past week due to
some awesome when you later is the name
of the app that allows you to do this do
some awesome android hackery you can
install the x86 in the windows you know
pc version of starcraft as well as other
old apps but starcraft is definitely
working and it it doesn't look that bad
i mean yeah it's a thirteen-year-old
gain but people still play it every day
it's still popular and the fact that you
can play on your tablet i haven't tried
it but I I really want to and and I
would do it for a couple days and then i
would probably quit playing it cuz i
just don't game anymore but it looks
pretty badass i mean it it looks like
it's actually playable like that you can
see the guy like clicking in with her
tapping and dragging around all his scvs
and telling them to go gather minerals
in the Abbey it's really cool proof of
concept you know I mean for things no
porting and very cool yeah I'm a fan I'm
not gonna lie I will test that one of
these days um any other APSA don't talk
about Scott any any big apps that you
normally the app guy you know what I was
actually sad over the holiday there have
been other one law app to app updates
everybody will spend time doing holiday
stuff like it ever owned him you
probably woke up with a frown every day
I did but you know I i think that uh i
think they did it well i don't know why
they did it but um big one for kind of
going to the future of facebook
Messenger added a little voice function
to send voice like little messages um
moving towards the sending messages via
IP so I think it's kind of cool Google
doesn't do it so yeah well yeah they do
other stuff um alright so this is an app
related topic if you're on verizon and
you have a phone that has NFC on it
most likely you want to use Google
Wallet arm and only one phone without
root actually allows you to do that
that's the Galaxy Nexus ah the galaxy s3
the razr m the note to the droid DNA all
these phones that have NFC some work
with rude and a whole bunch of craziness
to get google wall to work others don't
work at all and that's because Google
Wallet uses a you know secure element
and that isn't allowed on verizon unless
it's Isis which use a secure element
then it's allowed ah but that's a whole
other topic we talked about I'm just
kind of being a little harsh on verizon
but but they needed everyone solana keep
them in their place so anyways my point
is is my point is is it a few hours ago
they posted all reading exact words yeah
they posted on Google+ saying you'll be
seeing a lot of innovative uses for NFC
in the coming year this update to the
medical ID bracelet like this update to
the medical ID bracelet which apparently
the medical ID bracelet uses NFC that's
pretty awesome so android users the
being the pitchfork torch burning people
that we are we took to that verizon post
and said huh i know some other
innovative uses for NFC such as Google
Wallet and nearly every single comment
is basically saying the same thing about
Google wall hey I know another
innovative you sir and just slamming
them so they're they're little marketing
campaign for innovative uses of NFC
pretty much backfired on them and it's
it's making the rounds right now it's
it's hilarious oh if you haven't seen it
yet go to verizon wireless's google+
page and i'm sure you'll see it it's uh
it's the last post they made as of this
time so yeah I think it's pretty funny
uh I may have been instigator on that
telling drivers comment actually I was
the first Panther first birth of
the share it
all i said was let them know what
innovative uses of NFC you'd like to see
you know and I just want to see the
sequence of whatever you know person is
representing them on any cost social
network and see how that goes because
it's probably post shut my desktop down
and then turn notifications off on my
mobile device I is it famously because
the ensuing comments are I've never seen
them positive yeah I know you know what
I'll tell you care I've never been a
couple times i've mentioned AT&amp;amp;T a
couple times i've mentioned sprint and a
few times i've mentioned verizon
wireless every single time i think or
near every single time that I've
mentioned t-mobile they answer or
comment on the thread every single time
on google+ i mean their guy that you
have were in charge of social media for
t-mo there they're active I've never
seen any other carrier personally I mean
maybe you guys had different experiences
but I've never gotten no response at all
right that's great cordless relative to
me because that's all the gear I've been
on but yeah yeah well anyway so yeah so
check and check that out of you haven't
seen it uh if I haven't deleted the
proposed by now well I screenshotted at
UH few hours ago because i wanted i
wanted to just the case they went
through and deleted stuff i had i had to
have it uh i'm an instigator that's okay
so so let's talk about some devices here
so the nexus 4 you know is sold out or
it's damn hard to get um it's gonna be
actually available in t-mobile stores
here in the near future but it's really
hard to get and if you've ordered one or
tried to order one you don't I'm talking
about uh some some guys over at XDA
developers decided to try to figure out
the serial number scheme by looking at
the letters and numbers and try to
devise a way to figure out what divided
what devices were in the first batch in
the second batch third batch and so
forth like that to try to determine you
know if the first batch maybe has this
issue though fixed in the second batch
and so forth you know things like that
and through there through their findings
of trying to figure that out they guess
they kind of figured out how many
devices were roughly available for
launch in November how many were
available in the second big run in
November and how many devices were sold
available to be sold at least in in
December and altogether that number is
about 375,000 I mean this could be
completely way off or it could be a
rough gasps um who knows um I would say
it's probably least a minimum no but but
either honestly is what Nexus devices of
sold traditionally it's probably pretty
close so you look at it then as two
things you LG has never in my opinion
had an extremely successful phone so
they're not used to they're not used to
having a massive onslaught of orders and
their production lines arm the first
month it was like what seventy seventy
thousand then you know and then ramped
up a little bit i think the last in
december it was like 210,000 these
findings say and to whom subi supposed
to be mad at we met at google for not
getting these devices out still or now
do we turn our anger at LG saying why
the hell out weren't you producing
enough is that because google didn't
tell you to produce a lot or that's
because it took a long time to get
production ramped up or you know who's
who's to blame here you know uh I don't
know you know numbers and numbers they
don't tell us anything that besides that
besides numbers little bit of both
something when your when your google and
your that I mean you're so adaptive what
the web does I mean I would think that a
pre-order at least some kind of that
mean they could anticipate it in so far
away without you know completely missing
the Marga no I'm going to look at it
touchpad or something that never fire
sale well I'm going to look at it is
it's always been like an enthusiast
device a Nexus device has been an
enthusiast of us you have to know
technology to hear about a Nexus device
google doesn't you know until recently i
start you know you don't want to see a
whole lot of nexus commercials on
v you don't see you know billboards that
often you know you just don't it's not
heavily marketed the same way that the
song does or horizon markets droids or
they Apple markets iPhones so you have
to know about it or you're on there
certain right tech websites to see the
advertisements there you know it so
maybe they didn't you know it's an
enthusiast device maybe they didn't know
that how high the demand was going to be
I don't know either way if you didn't
get your nexus 4 yet fingers crossed
confidence hi hopefully you'll get it
soon if not our buddy Trevor vas he just
he's on his second one right now so feel
free to turn your rage towards him as
he's on device number two because he
just he broke his first one so uh go
ahead and be mad him it's people like
him that are taking your device away
from you is these developers that are
breaking their devices sending them back
for replacement exactly that are just
ruining for the for the average consumer
so what so John not what do you know
about the Exynos for vulnerability patch
we'll talk about that for a little bit
oh I didn't really look at the patch in
depth i'm not some basically just a
permissions issue pretty simple fix it's
just a question of how quickly they can
get it out to carriers um it does apply
to the note 2 as well as the s3 well
actually it only applies to the
international history because that's
only one with the exit no sperm yeah oh
and by something I get the galaxy s3 and
every single note to write you know ever
ever note 2 and uh so rate right until I
users in the UK I guess it really
depends like a special in the US whether
they want to just roll the security
exploit itself out or where they just
want to take it into whatever software
version they've got coming out because
they got you know even with the galaxy
s3 they get they've been advertising
that premium suite that's coming up and
really the vulnerabilities night
that big of a deal anyway I mean if you
want to be exploited it is but I mean
the timeframe as far as someone writing
malware specifically for that device and
hoping for I mean basically the holes
patched yeah it's a really simple page
and okay so Bob people across the pond
in the UK for the galaxy camera that new
little device I can't really said it's a
phone or if it's a camera but they're
getting for dot ramrod one starting
today so that's awesome quick updates
and they're right on track good job
Samsung and awesome Wi-Fi only devices
get their updates click and for ATT and
Verizon they might have to test their
radios a little bit more yeah um Elias
will see it eventually well I mean it's
just that it's just that eventually word
you know who knows how long it's going
to take with whatever if you have a
device on those now those networks and
it's you know that's just how it goes um
so those of you that own the Hisense
pulse google TV if you bought it a few
weeks back you may have noticed that and
over the air update was available a few
days ago ah not a whole lot to say about
it it improved user experience um what
exactly does that mean who knows I
didn't notice any changes but the big
change the most important change about
that it was a security fix I'm sure it
probably did actually improve some type
of user experience who knows but it was
it it was a security fix it actually
patched the ability to root the device
the device shipped with a unlocked or an
open I guess is the correct word and
open bootloader
um so all you had to do to root it was
copy the super user files over and you
were rooted and you could run relapse it
was literally that it was actually
easier to root the nexus device like
it's like a Nexus device you have to
look at it and it routes itself hisense
pulse like like you wanted to look in
the other room yeah well it was like
peripheral vision route you know like
her telepathic yeah it was stupid easy
to root but that was most likely an
oversight we-we-we people that like to
root and rom we kind of hoped that i was
like a something that was gonna start to
happen you know maybe leaving the things
open for developers to have fun with but
it seems it was an oversight and oops
and it was patched arm those of you that
are saddened by that I'll say watch GTV
hacker they have some news coming in the
foreseeable future for that device and
most likely others moving on let's talk
about some some fun stuff let's talk
about ubuntu phone so what what's that
Scott I'm excited about it another
player um it may come too late um but
yeah well I give us you update on what
what is this gonna be like a you've on
24 my phone is this going to be a phone
develops version or well it's I mean
it's gonna be a bunt too but it's a
completely new UI actually it's a
knuckle I it's an awesome-looking UI and
that's because it's new it's fresh and
it's completely gesture-based that's
awesome um you don't have to worry about
supporting legacy applications on older
design standards yeah so start subscribe
this way so it's very cool because it's
you know it's completely open which you
know so is a bunch of other open-source
operating systems
um the most interesting thing about this
though is there's no planned phone
release for another year at least 2014
so right now the only device that it is
most likely going to run on in the near
future is the Galaxy Nexus they're going
to release images for it soon now i'm
sure people in the android and Linux
community will do what they do best and
no hack and they'll port the hell out of
it to as many devices as possible um but
to actually have a phone you can bind
your hand so that won't happen for a
year that sucks I mean that that's going
to actually hurt I think the operating
system more than help it out I mean
initially launched with hardware
partners not saying hey we'll have one
in a year did they did the same thing
with the bundhi for Android a year ago
where is it yeah exactly yeah yeah last
year at CES we saw a bump to for Android
and we saw a bun to TV yeah but I think
like a lot of this is kind of like a
precursor to get developers excited
about it and like you say ported to
other devices and and get them going on
it because once they have the community
developed and bad they write well onan
it sported if you're watching right now
let us know what you think of a bunch of
phone you excited for it are you gonna
try to run it would you run it do you
want to know more about it um just let
us know we'll check the comments here in
a few minutes um i would run it for a
week i would think it would be awesome I
would look fall in love with the UI and
then after a week I would say well you
know what I'm tired of viewing web pages
I would like to view an app that I'm
used to for example during the demo
video it shows shows facebook shows
gmail you know and shows you google apps
they're all just web pages which is fine
i guess but you know some mobile apps on
as good as the actual application to
know the software app so if you're if
you're your game or your app your
utility has a very nice HTM
l5 web app right now yeah it's going to
look okay under ubuntu but if not
they're going to have to start
developing for it and then put something
out for it I mean a lot of people argue
saying that that's good after with
future you know Firefox OS webos tizon
you know you just develop an html5 app
and it works on every OS Chrome OS and
then you know another one you know if
it's html5 it's going to work on all
these cross-platform years away from
yeah but I mean that's it's very cool
it's very innovative I I I think it's
awesome like I said I would run it for a
week and then I would miss my content I
would miss my ecosystem and and I would
have to go back you know I think even is
flashing a completely new wrong you know
what I mean I I gave my full thoughts
and a post a day but I think like okay
when html5 s did rule and not the
exception than these alternate operating
systems have more of a chance than they
do now but the type of user that's gonna
honestly be able to put up with this
right now is the one that primarily uses
their phone as a phone and uses the web
services is kind of like a secondary
thing and that user is pretty much go on
right now I mean there's nobody that I
can think of that uses a smartphone just
for phone things anymore and just say
well my tip email twice a day you know
said man you know maybe four people
they're heavily in business stay on the
phone all day but most people are
playing on games and doing you know kind
of quirky applications and stuff that
really requires a lot of native
functionality right now agric kind of
need to be a hybrid to be useful now the
other thing I don't get is with on
ubuntu for android and google help them
with kind of that emulator to actually
run android applications on a full
desktop environment on ubuntu you I
don't see why they couldn't roll that
into the ubuntu phone OS
they were at it and let the manufacturer
cover the cost the place don't you no
license for Google applications if they
feel like putting them on there i mean
just kind of makes sense for getting
your adoption up a little bit yeah and
the speaking of open source operating
systems samsung followed up on tues news
announcement and said hey us too we
we've planned this for a while and they
told the world that they're planning on
releasing multiple tizon devices this
year I'm bettin we'll see some at CES
next week and in yeah I'm curious on
Samsung's play on this I I like Samsung
devices I mean they're the most popular
Android manufacturer OEM there they're
all over the place a blanket everything
from every every size available I mean
they're they're all over the place and a
lot of people think that they're you
know they don't want to be tied to
google they're working or maybe on their
own their own cloud their own ecosystem
you know which they are with the whole s
branding you know s music &amp;amp; S Cloud and
all that you know all the s stuff um I
mean yeah it's neat to see another OS
you know competition is good I'm curious
what devices will run it i'm really
curious if we'll see like for lack of
better words we see like an android s4
and then we see like it is an s4 you
know i mean like a robbery it'll be very
interesting how they you know market it
and how they tried to pull people on to
that and even if they tried to pull
people onto it because i don't know it
could go either way i'm very curious to
see what they do with releasing it and
how they want to market it and there's a
new model number that was leaked this
past week the GT q1000 is that gonna be
the first tizon device the q1000 you
know and who knows where's it going to
be just a new line of devices with
flexible displays me I'm sure we'll find
all that out here at CES next week
speaking of model numbers are the LG
optimus
g2 we could see at CES 2013 um 1080p
screens all around right yeah you know
what's interesting about that is I think
that's really going to take off me right
now we only see very limited number of
devices with 1080p screens now we got
the all the fun I love to hate we got
the HTC droid DNA yeah I'll do what the
oh poo 50 pou OU pou when I say that the
yeah so it has a 1080p screen that you
know on there's a whole lot of a lot of
players in that um and it's a good
number for people to relate because
people know TV resolutions and they know
you know they will know smartphone
resolutions and they can base it off
that to the average consumer so when we
see the LG optimus g2 at CES maybe mom
what's interesting about that is I mean
that I know smartphone manufacturers are
constantly you know in production cycles
you know from development to you know to
beta 2 yeah actually producing it in an
end to the consumers hand that you know
it's a constant non-stop cycle so the LG
optimus you just came out a couple
months ago the nexus 4 just came out two
months ago and which is me i made by LG
which is in those two are basically the
exact same phone except for the michelle
and now we're hearing about you know the
successor to that phone and for lack of
better words those two phones at the
same thing I mean the same hardware so
some have an LTE radio though no but
anyway so is very very similar hardware
almost near exact and now we're seeing a
successor to that already going to be
announced with it 1080p phone in a in a
prime a Snapdragon Prime a new processor
I think that's the one that can hit two
to two-and-a-half giga hertz per core
really that's not things screaming for a
mobile chip so will we see that you know
what i'll let you guys know in a few
days if i get to play with that device
i'm excited to see it you know i'm i'm
curious how many 1080p devices are we
gonna see it see yes you know because
sharp
announced this past week that they're
having a hell of a time keeping those
1080p screens available like they're
they're running out konsa they're going
through their stock so you can't tell me
that your standard well you can't tell
me that that you know the DNA is point
you know or the 25 or whoever's making
another we know I mean you can't tell me
that just those few devices are
completely depleting all sharp stocks so
other manufacturers have to have
pre-production models right now making
them and burning them up so there's also
Samsung when the LED screens can they
get them down to that type of resolution
could I be interesting yeah well I'm
sure we're gonna find out a lot of
information there's tons of CES
technologies yes rumors yeah screen
technology is gonna be a big showcase of
pixels pixels pixels and power power
writing those pixels can be very very
interesting now another a 1080p screen
and we're talking about another another
CES rumor the seven dun dun dun dun um
it's basically supposed to be the
successor to the HTC One X and the one
x+ basically rumors put it at a 4.7 inch
display with a 1080p resolution 1.7
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
2 gigs of ram 32 gigabytes of storage 13
megapixel camera 2-megapixel
front-facing camera 2300 milliamp hour
battery and running Android jelly bean
good specs well I mean it's a successor
to the One X and the the one x+ so yeah
I mean it's not I mean yet what I mean
does that excite you to the point where
you want to go out and you want to buy
it as opposed to you know just kind of
it's another phone because you know you
get these large amounts of phones
getting released all the time and it
could just be a you know sweep it under
the rug you know and that's when people
arguing are we past the age of the spec
I mean things really i mean phones are
really very similar in terms of speed so
and you start looking at all well
what bells and whistles does it have but
once they all star coming with roughly
the same specs you look at software and
that and that's where then Samsung and
LG and and who else snow starts bloating
the hell out of these devices you know
with all sorts of extra software that we
well I don't want some someone you don't
want some you don't care that it makes
one yeah I mean that's I I love that
sauce I keep saying i love to hate this
phone right here the DNA i love this
film but I hate since I can't stand it
uh I can't wait for an AOSP rom on this
phone I I just sense is ok but since
it's just not for me and that's how
these guys are going to differentiate
themselves you know one thing that I
like this I don't know if you guys went
over this yet but uh you know hardware
buttons yeah that's a nice rumor I i
love that rumor I was hard going from
the nexus 4 or the gout in the end the
Galaxy Nexus to the the DNA I I don't
like hardware by
better tell the difference sure who
would Sam song without physical home
button yeah all right so let's move on
to something a little bit smaller that
you don't carry in your hand all the
time ah samsung's new white chromebox
I'm sure that'll probably be at CES to
swill file it under CES rumors you it's
a chromebox like the one that was
released this past last year um actually
the specs are pretty much exactly the
same except for its little sexy you're a
little whiter you know not a complete
it's completely white it has rounded
edges ooh so apples got apples gonna be
pissed about that um it looks uh looks
all right i mean i'd rather have a
Chromebook but you know if you need a
desktop yeah I'm curiously what they do
with the price since the specs are uh
you know basically the same when they
drop the price yeah yeah hey we'll find
out see yes I mean that's pretty much
the answer to every device we keep
talking about you know next week on the
show we're gonna have all these answers
I swear and if we don't it is Darcy's
fault you hear that Darcy I'm the
routing in ramen for all you guys that
do a whole bunch of rutin in ramen Derek
there's an alternative in the works for
free f er for backups yeah I'll talk
about that alright so those of you that
route a lot of you that route when I I
asked him so Hayley so what do you read
your device for one of the most popular
responses and besides getting rid of
carrier bloat OEM blow anyways uh say
well I want to backup my devices I'm
sorry I own about yeah I want to backup
my apps my app data and so forth and you
know so there needs to be an easy way to
do that arm right now people route and
they use titanium backup which titanium
backup works great if you're on ice
cream sandwich android 4.2 or higher you
can actually use adb commands to to back
up without root and most people you know
aren't familiar with the command line so
how does the average guy average joe or
the average scott back
his data from command line or how does
he use titanium backup if he isn't
rooted or he doesn't know what he's
doing and can use command lines though
Koosh came up with a idea of a tiny
little web server that runs on your
android device and you connect to it
it's a beautiful you I it's very easy to
use it's intuitive and you can backup
your apps and your app data and right
now you have to be routed to use it
eventually he's going to release a app
that is installed on your PC and then
you don't have to be routed then anymore
so you can backup all your apps and all
your app data and that's great for the
average person because people constantly
complain about you know wanting to back
up their data but they don't want to
route or or or that's the main reason
that they route and instill titanium
backup is a great app don't get me wrong
I love it I use it all the time but its
UI is kind of hard to use um if you're
new to titanium backup it's might be
kind of overwhelming because there's so
many options it's this guy he's got a
new discs us hey I need a button it says
backup now go you know like I want
people want something easy so this is
awesome it's an alternative um I'll use
it I guarantee it um you know uh I'm
excited to use it I have it I have it on
mine my DNA right now it's now it's neat
um more you know it's only like a beta
right now our alpha whatever kaku she
was calling it's gonna get better as
time goes on them I'm excited I'm gonna
follow that project very closely yeah
I'm excited um some cm news before I
talk talk about cm I've been talking a
lot don't you have some aokp news and
your big aokp fan yeah um aokp basically
released their their jelly bean version
um like the 4.2 version of the akp great
yeah Mr one um yeah it's for the Galaxy
Nexus gsm verizon
seven Wi-Fi and the nexus 4 basically
it's a KP in its back with 4.2 good eNOS
you can some of the new things that they
added um basically this version was
about giving all the features of the old
one and that re read a lot of stuff but
allow any kind of widget on the lock
screen and you can have an unlimited
amount of widgets now take into
consideration how much RAM your phone
has because it can be a hog and then
also what I found really interesting was
there's menu-aire arrow keys while
typing so let's say you're filling out a
an online form and you don't have
autofill on and you want to go to the
next box there's a simple thing at the
bottom of your keyboard you just click
it there's an arrow on the right and on
the left and you can go to the next
field or go back to the field before um
and it's not just websites that you can
use this on if let's say you're editing
a folder with all which apps in it and
let's say you want to rename all the
apps that are in the folder well you
rename one of them and then you use the
keyboard on the bottom on the right or
the left the arrow key to go to the next
app to rename it so you don't have to
like click on everything it's kind of
cool if you're working with lists and
want to rename a legit stuff and working
with forms I found it pretty nice and
then also status bar transparency that's
controllable and nice um the
customizable status bar toggles I don't
like at all not a fan of them on the new
jelly bean not a fan of them on a okay p
and for some odd reason i cannot get the
brightness toggle bar on the top to work
and that may not be in it but that was
one of the things that I loved and then
yeah pretty cool stuff
it's fast really fast to running it on
my dog Texas present because my nexus 4
is in the nail and it's going to get
replaced sad face um Derek cyanogenmod
yeah so those of you rocking cm 10.1
most likely garden know what I'm talking
about if you flash Knightley's oh yeah
every other day or so if he flashed a
nightly a couple days ago you may have
noticed some new widgets the clock
weather and calendar widget that we all
came to know and love on cm10 was
completely rewritten and got some
android 4.2 awesomeness it's a lock
screen widget as well as a homescreen
widget um but said it it was reformatted
to work on the android 4.2 lock screen
and it looks awesome and i want it badly
and i can't have it yet and it makes me
a sad panda it's called Chronos um once
again it's just a revamping yeah looks
pretty cool I I can't wait to someday be
able to flash that I'm gonna have to put
it on my Nexus 7 you know what I'm gonna
have to yeah you should you know cuz
don't see the point of running a custom
rom on my Nexus 7 it I mean I the only
time I ever eaten my nexus 7 was to put
a bun to on it you know I'm ruining mine
tonight and I'm gonna flash something on
it to issue another an exercise event oh
my god Wow let's not do that that's as
you're typing commands you know why
don't i don't know right I flash a new
rom model and if it when there's a lot
of roms available for my device i flash
them constantly you know i like doing
that but I know hey I have two rooms
available for my dealing and one in the
one rom is a carrot juice wrong that is
a lot to choose from ok wait a second
there's ultimate can bang there's
someone em looks like milk milk rom
there's some other rom there's there's
genome and genome is basically uh what
was our enemy flash close
and then I know what it is there's some
with an H to it and two of those have
you use all the mods from altamik
gangbang so it's the same damn wrong so
there's only two wrong like you send me
if you so room like them all yeah I know
they don't want to cook one together for
you and I didn't you know there's
there's a couple guys working on an AOSP
port right now and as far as I can tell
there's actually two device trees but
there's four different device trees
listed on github and two of them just
fork the other dudes and then really and
then said it was theirs up but yeah
there's there's two guys working on it
right now um the one guy actually I'm
talking to him on IRC right now he uh
he's a good guy he has a colonel out
there for the DNA and I'm i switched
between my colonel and in his colonel
just uh just as you know make sure that
what dan and I did was right and it
doesn't it doesn't suck I'm just kidding
dan is what they always talking about
that guy has like 70 some kernels out
there that he's done in the past anyway
so yeah that's really for reading Rama
not a whole bunch of information this
