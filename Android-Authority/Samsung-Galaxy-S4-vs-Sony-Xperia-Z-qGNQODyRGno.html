authority what's going on everybody now
here's the one that I really wanted to
get into the Sony Xperia Z is definitely
one of my favorite phones but it just
might be eclipsed by the newly announced
Samsung Galaxy s4 which you see over
there on the left so we're gonna be
taking a look at a couple of the let's
start off with the benchmarks because
those are always a great way to start so
ever benchmarks over on the side I saw
it over here now the Sony Xperia Z you
can already see it right here there's a
difference here
the Samsung Xperia Z was the first one
that I have ever personally used that
broke the twenty-thousand barrier in
antutu benchmark but look at the samsung
galaxy s4 you got twenty five thousand
nine hundred on there that is an
incredible score and it's the highest
one that I've ever seen happened right
before my eyes
earlier when we were looking at a geek
bench benchmark we saw that there was a
Qualcomm arm v7 in there which we were
not told what the processor was going to
be in here none of the presentations
talked about it a Qualcomm arm view
seven at one point eight nine gigahertz
that's a pretty powerful chip indeed and
it is really powering what is shaping up
to be one of the most powerful Android
phones on the market and it's going to
be Sam the Sony Xperia Z on the other
hand does support the Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 pro processor that is
powered a lot of great phones in the
past like the Nexus 4 but now they have
all been eclipsed by whatever is inside
of the Samsung Galaxy s4 aside from that
however you do have some similarities
here with the 5-inch 1080p screen that
is found on the Xperia Z and is also
found here however the screen that we
saw they had a little bit of color
problems in the Xperia Z probably is
going to get blown away because these
two for AMOLED technology that Samsung
is well known for it is found inside of
the galaxy s4 and as you can see the
colors really pop out of that screen
like I said before about the s3 is that
the colors pop out and pretty much punch
you in the face that is basically what's
going on here with the samsung galaxy s4
with its Super AMOLED 1080p five inch
display aside from that however you're
going to see that the form factor is a
little bit different on the Xperia Z you
do have
a more angular rectangular design on
here versus the usual pebble rounded
design of the Samsung phones the
thickness is actually quite comparable
as the Xperia Z and the galaxy s4 have
Verte are very very close but I won't
say that have 130 grams the s4 is
definitely a lot light well not a lot
but it definitely is noticeable how much
lighter it is it's very easy to use it's
very easy to have in the hand because
it's very light it's very nimble I
should say of course you're seeing one
of the accessories that's available for
it is a replaceable cover that has a
flap ons
over over on the top that allows you to
close it and you'll still see some
information on the top so that's a nice
accessory to have and of course it's a
smart cover so you open it up and it
wakes up the screen so a couple last
things about this I will say that the
2330 battery that's found in the sony
xperia z does do a decent job but you
get 2600 inside of the samsung galaxy s4
one other thing that you should know is
that the back of the samsung galaxy s4
as you can tell because there's a new
cover on it it's removable which means
that the battery is removable which
means the battery is replaceable that's
something that the Samsung that that's
something that the Sony Xperia Z cannot
say because of course it is a unibody
design you cannot take the battery out
and you're kind of stuck with what you
got so once again Samsung gets a lot of
things right with the Samsung Galaxy S
or I've been saying Samsung a lot in
this comparison but that is because
that's what we're all about here at the
event the launch party for the galaxy s4
at the Radio City Music Hall in the
heart of Manhattan in New York City so
we're going to bring you even more
comparisons we're going to keep getting
all the coverage that we possibly can
for you because this is Android
