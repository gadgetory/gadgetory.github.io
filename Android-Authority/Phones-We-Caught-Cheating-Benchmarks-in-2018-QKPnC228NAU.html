benchmarking system because their
devices can detect when the app is
testing the device and we'll talk about
how they do that that's why we partnered
up with Geekbench who created a stealth
app that allows us to get a more
authentic more genuine take on the
devices capabilities and let's talk
about what we found now for those of you
who are not familiar with this we just
got to get real basic and talk about
what a benchmarking app actually does
and in the crudest simplest of terms a
benchmarking app measures a device's
capabilities it's going to push its
power its CPU and its RAM capabilities
give it a score to measure that devices
capability it doesn't necessarily
correlate though to your everyday
regular use of that device that's what
hands-on reviews are for you see
manufacturers can not only design their
devices to detect when bench wearing
apps are running but they can make sure
that their device is seen in the best
light better than it normally would in
everyday usage and light of the fact
that the Canadian junior team is killing
it in hockey right now let's use a
hockey analogy
you see for example if I am a hockey
coach I have the option of pulling my
goalie and replacing him with an
additional offensive player greatly
enhancing my team's offensive capability
and if you were watching my team at that
moment you'd be saying chase your team
is great on offense but is that a
accurate and fair take on my team's
overall general offensive capability no
because I've given it an artificial
temporary boost that I cannot sustain
and that's precisely what devices or
device manufacturers can do when they
detect a benchmarking app testing or
giving a take on their devices
capabilities but in our best of 2018
testing we were able to work with our
friends at Geekbench to configure a
stealth Geekbench app this app at least
in theory was able to reduce the chances
that devices were able to detect the
benchmarking app in progress not all
devices on this list showed cheating
behavior during both single core and
multi core tests for example the HTC u12
plus and xiaomi me8 only show
significant decreases during the multi
core test the lowest device's identified
beyond single noise was a three percent
jump in scores but we found an up to 21
percent leap in two devices the huawei P
20 pro and the honor play the graphs
here show regular Geekbench scores
versus the stealth Geekbench scores from
the phones that detected the app and
then modified their behavior these
results are the averages of five
benchmarking runs all of which had
slight percentage differences as you see
in the mate 20 detail cheaters do best
in the regular score in yellow and drop
back when they don't recognize the
benchmarking blue is the stealth result
now this graph here demonstrates how
much better these devices performed
while cheating but to be fair we should
know that not everyone cheats during the
best of Android 2018 we tested 30 of the
most powerful and modern Android devices
the devices we talked about above
cheated but that still leaves 24 devices
that fought fair and square
besides our reference device the mate 20
and the mate 20 Pro the list includes
the samsung galaxy note 9 sony xperia x
- the vivo x21 the LGG seven thin queue
the google pixel 3xl the oneplus 60 and
the xiaomi me a - to name a few
now I want to bring up the fact that
people will say look Jase is this really
cheating because this kind of thing is
done in many other industries if we go
back to the car analogy and you're
talking about mileage when you want to
buy a car there's the mileage right on
the sticker on the car and you buy that
car and you don't get quite the the same
mileage in real-world usage and that's
because that number that they came to is
under ideal conditions under almost no
wind on a flat surface a smooth surface
you know all that kind of stuff but of
course in the real world it doesn't work
that way I I would submit to you that
the idea or the spirit of the
benchmarking system is that we get some
sort of hint or indicator about
real-world usage and I think that's
implied and when you gain that system
and you don't make it known that you're
gaming that system that that is
inherently dishonest that bothers me but
what about you
what do you think about it let me know
in the comments below or on Twitter I
would like to hear it you know what
software starts do things it's not
supposed to do who solves those problems
it's the unsung heroes our developer
teams in fact it's called incident
management and our beloved sponsor today
ops genie is just for them opportunity
helps us minimize downtime which is
critical for our customer experience ops
genie empowers devs and ops teams to
plan for service disruptions and stay in
control during incidents it helps notify
all the right people through a smart
combination of scheduling an escalation
paths that take into account things like
time zones and holidays it allows for
deep flexibility and how and when and
where alerts are deployed and supported
by over 200 integrations with ops genie
your next incident doesn't stand a
chance go to ops genie comm and sign up
to get a free company account and add up
to five team members that's ops genie
comm never miss a critical alert again
with ops genie
sounds like wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
