we're at the core corn booth here at
Mobile World Congress have come to speak
to Sherif Hannah about 4G LTE the latest
improvements and 5g Shareef nice to see
you nice to see you thank you for coming
by now I know that Qualcomm have got
some 4G LTE announcements you want to
tell me a bit about that sure yeah we're
very excited because two of our
customers Sony as well CC announced the
first phones that have gigabit LTE
capabilities so up to 1 gigabit per
second over 4G LTE which is absolutely
astonishing we announced the modem last
year but now we integrated into
snapdragon a 35 and now it's in phone so
it's very exciting that it's coming to
the smartphone form factor
those are old enough remember telephone
modems you know 33k and now we're
talking one gigabit I mean that's just
amazing yeah I know absolutely and yet
to see it working in a smartphone you
know getting up to 1 gigabit per second
suite is absolutely astonishing but I
think the important thing to remember is
it's not so much about the peak speed
and that's one of the things that we
need to get across very carefully that
yes we can show we know up to 1 gigabit
per second Idealab conditions but
actually the most substantial
improvement is in the average data rates
that people experience on a day to day
basis in the network once the networks
are actually deployed well absolutely I
mean peak is one thing but you know my
movie starts downloading
really quick at the beginning and then
and then dives that doesn't help me so
these new things have got sustained
performance correct
so there's actually kind of a byproduct
of the technologies that we're using to
get two gigabit LTE for example they use
the 4 by 4 MIMO technology which means
that we actually put four antennas
inside the phone and the phone can
receive on the four antennas
simultaneously so one of the side
effects of that for example is now the
phone essentially has additional
ears that it can listen to the tower
with when you're far away from the tower
okay it will actually give you faster
speed even when you're far away in
addition to giving you insanely fast
speeds on your clothes so again it's not
just like I said it's not just with the
peak rates but actually the average user
experience gets a lot better with a
gigabit LTE phone than it would
otherwise now earlier on I said to you
that 5g hasn't been turned into a stand
and I think people talking about it too
early and you said no that's not true so
tell me about loud so the actual final
specification for 5g which is by the way
called 5 g NR 5 g new radio that's going
to be the global standard for 5g so the
specification is not finalized yet
however that the work in the
organization that makes the standard
proceeds in phases and in the current
phase that where a lot of decisions have
already been made about what the new
radio interface looks like for example
the way it can scale to accommodate
insanely high bandwidth but also have
capacity for hundreds of thousands of
IOT devices or give the ability for
autonomous cars to communicate to each
other with very low latency to avoid an
impending crash so a lot of those
decisions for the error interface have
already been done ok
and we're demonstrating it in the booth
today which actually makes that demo
quite a bit different than a lot of the
other 5g demos that are at the show so
5g isn't just about speed 4g LTE could
grow quite significantly
but 5g you've got as you said iot
devices local devices cars other things
talking to each other at low latency and
that's going to be the real game-changer
I think the 5g what do you think I agree
100% and by the way even from mobile
broadband perspective so even with the
faster speeds come also much lower
latency so on LC networks today you're
looking at a network latency of between
20 to 30 milliseconds let's say in the
demo over there we're showing one
millisecond latency with very very high
speed hundreds of megabits a second and
so even that would be a game-changer for
example for something like motivated
rendering of 360-degree video where if
you have a VR headset on and you're
looking at a portion of video
the network can sends you just a portion
you're looking at a super high
resolution and as you turn your head it
can then the network can respond quickly
and Center then you feel the view that
you're looking at and give you a high
resolution there that is not possible
with 4G today but it will be possible
with with 5g so this is the new exterior
xD premium which is the first smartphone
with snapdragon a 35 and one of the
unique things about it is that it
integrates gigabit LTE so up to 1
gigabit per second download speed over
an LTE connection which is absolutely
astonishing so not only do we have the
unit on this way we actually have a real
speed test you know these are the seeds
that are actually
from the device right now up to 979
megabits per second but of course this
is a peak rate you know it's the only
device that's connected to the tower
that we have in the background the
question that we always get is what are
the real-world speeds that I can expect
from these network improvements and
device improvements and so we have this
simulation that we ran basically
simulating about 8,000 users in a
Gigabit LC network and the users have
devices of different LC capability from
category four which is kind of the
lowest most basic LC capability all the
way up to cat 16 which is gigabit LTE
and so what I can do is I can go into
comparison modes and see how the real
expected real world speeds the devices
of different capabilities will get so
I'll select one of the cell sectors
let's say for FTP traffic types so
imagine you're downloading a file from
cloud storage for example let's look at
the 50th percentile user the average
user or median user and then let's
compare cat 6 which is kind of the
current you know most common you eat LTE
capability in phones and networks vs cat
16 the new stuff okay so here we see
that the average speed for the cat 16
user is 93 megabits per second compared
to 50 megabits per second for a cat 6
users so again not gigabit speed but
this is again simulating a real network
with real conditions and this is on
average and what the other graphs are
showing here is also the fact that the
cat 16 device is used to network more
efficiently so we can cram more users in
the network and there's another way to
show this which is if I change the mix
of devices in the network so that more
of them more of the users in the network
have gigabit LTE devices watch what
happens to the throughput as I change
the mix of the devices in the network so
okay so the speeds actually went up for
both users for the Catholics user as
well as the cat 16 user and the reason
for this is when you have a higher
percentage of gigabit LTE devices they
use the network much more efficiently
which opens up the capacity of the
network so that even users who don't
have capable devices to get faster
speeds as well this is before the median
user but I also want to illustrate kind
of the best-case users what kind of
speeds they can get so let me go here
and select the 90th percentile users
I look at that over 200 megabits per
second you know in in a real network
this is the kind of performance that we
expect once the network start rolling
out in the u.s. in Europe in Asia and
starting in 2017 very exciting tell me a
bit about roadmaps I know nothing set in
concrete but we took now in 2017 what's
the kind of plan that people have got
for the standard for hardware for
network what was the plan so actually
that's a great question it comes at the
perfect timing because just yesterday
Qualcomm along with 21 other leaders in
the mobile industry committed publicly
to accelerating the 5g and our global
standard and pulling in the date so we
can see the first 5g mobile devices and
networks in 2019 instead of 2020 so we
pulled in the schedule by quite a bit
pulling it in to 2019 and also folsome
we announced our first 5g new radio
modem so supporting the global standard
for 5g it says 2g 3G 4G and 5g all in a
single chip Wow and so that you can
expect the part of the x50 family of
modems from Qualcomm so you can expect
mobile devices with those new modems in
time for 2019 so the first 5g
smartphones will be available in 2019
very very exciting well these are
exciting times in terms of 5g in terms
of mobile communication I wish you all
the best
