make a phone available in every single
size but as the Galaxy mega 5.8 worth a
look find out in our review hey
everybody I'm Chris look now size-wise
the Galaxy mega 5.8 is sandwiched in
between the note 2 and the mega 6.3 but
its specs are decidedly lower how much
lower well let's take a look the Galaxy
mega 5.8 gets its name from its 5.8 inch
qHD display inside we're looking at a
1.4 gigahertz dual-core Broadcom CPU 1.5
gigs of ram and 8 gigs of internal
storage expandable via microSD the
primary rear facing camera is 8
megapixels and capable of 1080p video
capture while the front facing camera is
1.9 megapixel providing the power we're
looking at a 2600 milliamp hour battery
the model we're reviewing is the duo's
model which has slots for two sims but
otherwise it's identical to the single
sim model the design of the mega 5.8 is
similar to its big brother the 6.3
except it's well smaller
not too small though as it's still
noticeably larger than the venerable
galaxy note 2 like pretty much any other
modern galaxy model the general setup
and button layout are the same power
button on the right volume rocker on the
left headphone jack on top and USB port
on the bottom even with the one-handed
operation options this is still a tricky
device to use with one hand generally
you'll want to stick with two while you
aren't happy that the mega 6.3 only had
a 720p display the q HD resolution of
960 by 540 on the 5.8 is even less
promising providing a pixel density of
just 190 pixels per inch luckily things
do look fairly good for the most part
pixelation and lack of sharpness are
definitely apparent if you look closely
but most of the time you'll be holding
the mega 5.8 far away enough that it
shouldn't matter as this is a TFT
display colors are well represented
without being overly saturated though
some buyers might be disappointed that
this isn't one of Samsung's Super AMOLED
displays the screen is generally pretty
bright though it's glossy surface does
make it somewhat hard to see
in bright sunlight we usually don't see
Broadcom CPUs and Samsung devices so we
were interested to see how the mega 5.8
would hold up in benchmarks as usual we
started with antutu benchmark we run the
test ten times and while sometimes
scores are nearly identical every time
this time they varied quite a bit
we saw scores ranging from the high 7000
to the low 10000 our final average score
was 9000 419 next we turn to Epic
Citadel the ultra high quality setting
wasn't available so first we try high
quality mode reaching an average frame
rate of 50 6.1 frames per second high
performance mode barely made a
difference with an average frame rate of
56 point 7 frames per second the
hardware is powerful enough to keep the
UI responsive and apps running smoothly
but you might want to look elsewhere if
you're planning on heavy gaming the
galaxy mega 5.8 runs Android 4.2.2 with
the latest version of Samsung's TouchWiz
UI like the mega 6.3 the 5.8 includes a
landscape or tablet mode though you
probably won't want to use this for
simple things like making a call if
you're using the device for
entertainment it's definitely handy
since no carrier had got their hands on
our review unit there's thankfully very
little bloatware included Samsung has
its usual suite of apps included S Memo
s planner s translator s voice and its
own app store but even apps we usually
see like Flipboard aren't included which
is nice given a smaller amount of
internal storage the mega 5.8 has an 8
megapixel rear-facing camera just like
the 6.3 like that phone photos are
pretty much what you would expect from a
mid-range device the camera UI includes
quite a few shooting modes like auto
beauty face best photo continuous shot
best face sound &amp;amp; shot panorama and
sports I took my test photos in auto
mode with everything set to default
except the resolution which I set to max
colors are well represented though just
like the 6.3 I thought that photos could
have been a little sharper the 1080p
video capture is solid and colors are as
vivid here as they are with still photos
my only real disappointment with the
video is that no fun options like slow
or fast motion are included
though that really shouldn't be a
surprise since they weren't available on
the mega 6.3 either the 2600 milliamp
hour battery and relatively modest
hardware mean that you can expect a good
deal of battery life out of the mega 5.8
after 16 hours of benchmarking testing
and downloading a few apps the battery
still had 68 percent capacity
although the screen brightness was set
fairly low and no Sims were installed
even with fairly heavy use the mega 5.8
should hold up to a full day no matter
how long we're talking if you find
yourself running out of juice a power
saving mode is available in settings the
Galaxy mega 5.8 is one of those phones
words kind of hard to figure out who
it's for now if you want a big phone
with mid-range specs the Galaxy mega 6.3
is the better choice and it can be found
for about the same price which is around
five hundred and fifty dollars right now
now the note 2 is similar in size and
better in pretty much every way if you
need dual Sims however the Galaxy mega
5.8 isn't a bad choice if you want to
