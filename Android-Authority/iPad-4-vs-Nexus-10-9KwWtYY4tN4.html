authority 10-inch tablets are light and
portable enough to carry around and have
screens large enough for pleasurable
viewing such as the case of the Apple
iPad with Retina display and a freshly
released google nexus 10 made by samsung
let's know more about these tablets the
two tablets look just like most other
tablets in the market big wide and
relatively heavy slabs though the google
nexus 10 stands taller than the ipad for
the Google tablet also has its smaller
width is slightly thinner and waste less
the front sides on the two tablets are
simple and clean on the iPad for you see
only the iconic home button and the
front camera on the Nexus 10 you'll see
only the front camera you won't see any
physical buttons all navigation controls
are virtual both tablets have Bessel's
wide enough to prevent accidental screen
touches the Nexus 10 however has its
loudspeakers on the front both at the
left and right edges of the frame the
speaker grill almost fills the entire
edge I find this design quite handy
because a sound is not locked entirely
when I hold the tablet on its sides or
when placing it on its back the
notification light on the Nexus 10 is at
the center of the bottom bezel it lights
up only when there are notifications the
ipad 4 doesn't have a notification light
the iPad forest front panel is
surrounded by a very thin frame joined
to its aluminum back the Nexus 10
doesn't have a separate frame rather its
frame is one with a back cover as usual
the control buttons are on the sides on
the iPad for the power button mic and
headphone jack are at the top the
Lightning port is at the bottom and the
lock rotation switch and volume rocker
are on the right side on the Nexus 10
the power button and volume rocker are
on the top side micro HDMI port on the
right micro USB port and headphone jack
on the left and dock connectors at the
bottom as for the back it appears that
the ipad 4 is made of durable and
stronger material the ipad force back is
made of slightly textured aluminum which
provides the ipad for its sleek and
sophisticated look it is also less prone
to fin
prints and smudges on the Nexus 10 the
back plate is hard plastic typical
Samsung this one though has a somewhat
rubbery feel to it which makes it less
prone to sliding and makes it easier to
grip downside though is that it catches
fingerprints more easily than the iPads
back Apple has been proudly marketing
the ipad 4 and it's red in a display and
rightly so because the display on this
tablet does look amazing the screen is
protected by scratch and oil resistant
glass meanwhile the Nexus tents display
also looks awesome it is protected by
Corning Gorilla Glass to the displace on
both tablets look crisp and sharp thanks
to 264 PPI on the iPad 4 and 299 PPI on
the Nexus 10 I observed however that the
display on the iPad 4 is more colorful
than that on Nexus 10 these two tablets
are powered by dual-core chip sets which
by today's standards seem rather modest
and a little behind though powered by
dual-core processors both the Nexus 10
and ipad 4 perform very smoothly with no
choking stuttering lagging or jittering
whether you're browsing or playing HD
games the ipad 4 has a dual core 1.4
gigahertz apple a6x chip set power vr
sgx 554 mp4 GPU one gigabyte of RAM and
up to 64 gigabytes of internal storage
on the other hand the Nexus 10 has a
dual-core 1.7 gigahertz samsung exynos
5250 chipset cortex a15 cpu Molly t 60
for GPU 2 gigabytes of ram and up to 32
gigabytes of internal storage neither
tablet allows microSD memory expansion
the two tablets are powered by the
latest in most recent versions of their
respective operating systems Android 4.2
point one jellybean are the Nexus 10 and
Apple iOS 6.0 point 1 on the iPad for
each of which provides not only smooth
experience for the user but also useful
and convenient software features of
particular note is the nexus tense
multi-user feature which lets you set up
several user accounts each one having
its own settings and configurations plus
security features to prevent unwanted
users from using an account
another noteworthy new feature is the
nexus tense dual pulldown menu there
used to be only one for the
notifications but with the Nexus 10
again not just the notifications menu
but also a toggles and shortcuts menu
both tablets are capable of connecting
via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth yet the ipad 4's
bluetooth behavior remains consistent
with that of the ipad mini's it is not
very friendly when pairing with other
devices the nexus 10 in contrast pairs
with other Bluetooth devices very easily
the ipad 4 though one-ups the nexus 10
with an LTE variant the Nexus 10 is
capable only of Wi-Fi but the Nexus 10
also allows data connections using a
standards-compliant micro USB port
whereas the ipad for uses apples non
standards compliant and proprietary
lightning port moreover the Nexus 10
supports near field communication or NFC
allowing two devices to share data just
by touching each other the ipad 4
doesn't have such feature as for the
camera both tablets come with 5
megapixel rear cameras the ipad also has
a 1.2 megapixel front camera and the
nexus 10 has a 1.9 megapixel front
camera in general both tablets can
capture good and crisp photos under
bright conditions the ipad 4 however
seems to produce washed out colors and
foggy photos under sunlight and low
light settings the nexus tense flash can
add more light helping the camera
produce clearer and brighter photos the
ipad forest rear camera doesn't have
such feature both tablets can also
record 1080p full HD videos the nexus 10
though lets you choose lower resolutions
such as 720p or 480p the ipad 4 doesn't
let you make such adjustments multimedia
playback is very pleasurable on these
two tablets hardly any dropped frames or
freezes on either tablet playing full HD
videos sound quality is also great on
the two tablets although I favor the
loudness on the Nexus 10 because of the
location of its loudspeakers on the
front both tablets use lithium polymer
battery packs the one on the Nexus 10 is
rated at 9000mah and can provide up to
about 9 hours of video playback or seven
hours of web browsing the iPad force
battery had
eleven thousand five hundred sixty mah
that can last for about 10 hours of
reading movies gaming and writing in
some both tablets offer visual pleasure
for viewing photos reading or web
browsing the ipad 4 provides a solid and
sturdier build although the nexus tense
bags seem to provide better grip both
tablets are undoubtedly well designed
performance wise both are powerful
enough and capable enough to give you
seamless navigation and a smooth
experience software-wise the Nexus 10
has several new features catered to a
multi-user environment the Nexus 10 also
has a bigger screen and is lighter than
the ipad 4 are you getting one of these
two soon which one let us know in the
