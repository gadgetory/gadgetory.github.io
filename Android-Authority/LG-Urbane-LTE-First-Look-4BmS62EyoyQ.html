brought us a look at a SmartWatch that
is looking to break the tethers between
it and a smartphone this is Joshua car
from Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is a look at the LG
urbane LTE I'm sure one of the first
things that you're noticing about this
particular SmartWatch is the fact that
it's actually quite large yes it does
feel like I was putting on a cuff on my
wrist
and there was definitely a quite a bit
of heft to it but that's because there's
a lot of stuff happening underneath the
surface especially when you think about
the band which is not removable because
it holds all of the different antennas
for you to be able to access your Wi-Fi
bluetooth and LTE or call networks yes
you will be able to use this watch
without the need of a smart phone it's
meant to stand alone with its own SIM
card in order to receive calls and
messages and be able to connect to all
connectivity options and you can see
those settings in the operating system
but first let's go through some parts of
the design this is very much like the LG
G watch are except it is of course like
I said bulkier especially in the body on
the table quite large screen on there
allows for going through the elements
the webOS inspired elements however so
many changes have been made to this
particular interface that LG is now
calling it the LG SmartWatch platform or
the LG wearable platform the operating
system does go through quite nicely and
you do have some buttons on the side in
order to bring up these settings easily
with a top button and to go through a
couple extra elements with the bottom
button but the middle one will allow you
to get back to home and then when you
press it again you'll be able to go
through all the different apps the
operating system takes on a circular
design with a bunch of circles going in
a circular motion of course and there
are quite a few apps already installed
on here and even in the messaging you'll
be able to get your text messages and
whatnot in order to respond to them you
will use a keyboard and that actually
wasn't too hard to use on here with
touch typing those swiping would
definitely be very beneficial for those
of you using this particular device a
heart rate monitor is still found on the
back of the unit and Fitness is still a
bit of a focus when it comes to the LG
urbane LTE which isn't that big of a
surprise because all of the antennas and
the fact that you can do GPS and Wi-Fi
and bluetooth on here will allow you to
go out and hit the pavement for a run
without the need of your SmartWatch to
be tethered to it
which is not too bad and four gigabytes
of on-board storage on this particular
SmartWatch will allow you to have a
little bit of music when you're on the
go with all that is going on in the
urbane LTE it's not a surprise that the
battery in here is also quite a bit
larger than those available in
conventional smartwatches today but
longevity will have to be tested when we
actually get this SmartWatch and put it
on our own wrists this is just a really
quick look at the LG urbane LTE a pretty
interesting development that is not
quite Android wear obviously but you can
connect to some Android devices or all
of them for some connectivity rather and
we're kind of interested to see what
segments of the market this particular
SmartWatch will get it's one of those
devices that you really only get if you
truly wanted it you want it specifically
for the capabilities it has but that
being said its capabilities are actually
quite vast and wide it's supposed to be
basically like a smart watch on your
wrist with the microphone on the bottom
and the speaker up top you will be able
to take calls you'll be able to respond
some messages and then there are a bunch
of apps that extend its functionality
further until we get our own review unit
however you can keep it tuned to android
authority for even more coverage from
the Mobile World Congress here at
Barcelona Spain this is a judge of a car
from Android Authority keep it tuned
here for even more from LG</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
