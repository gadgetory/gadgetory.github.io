we've done these weekly news things but
things that have been newsworthy have
sort of needed its own dedicated show
but this week we have lots of little
news nuggets so let's make like woody
and do a news roundup we report from
gizmo China claims to have details on
one pluses next flagship phone according
to the leak the 1 + 5 t release date is
set for sometime in November 2017 that
would certainly make sense as 2016 s 1 +
3 T was also unveiled in November
now we're also expecting that the 1 + 5
t will sport most of the same under the
hood specs as the 1 + 5 which was just
unveiled earlier this summer the report
states that the 1 + 5 t will supposedly
feature a 6-inch 2160 by 1080 resolution
with an 18 9 aspect ratio if you can
recall the 1 + 5 came with a 5.5 inch
1080p display with a 16:9 aspect ratio
this means instead of only upgrading a
few key under the hood specs from the 1
+ 5 the company will use an entirely
different design and display in the 5 t
we'd expect the change to come with the
1 + 6 but definitely not in the 5 T hmm
what do you guys think - little
resolution for too big a screen let me
know in the comments below also more
good news for those of you who are
hoping to get your fingerprint sensor
back on the front of your phone
according to a note sent to clients by
respected analyst Ming Chang Co of KGI
securities Samsung may put an under
display fingerprint reader on the Galaxy
Note 9 do in fall of 2018 business
insiders Keith the swing who saw the
note reports that Samsung has already
received samples of this novel
technology several specialized suppliers
are said to be vying for Samsung's
business including synaptics which also
supplies Apple beyond eyes a Korean
biometrics company and Samsung Group
member Samsung LCI
and Aegis a Taiwanese based company that
currently supplies conventional sensors
to Samsung out of those competing Co
gives beyond eyes and Samsung LCI the
best shot of winning the contract
because their technology would allow the
OLED screen to act as a light source for
the sensor
saving battery life in the process now I
know that at least some of you are
hoping that that feature will be
included on the galaxy s 9 which will be
released sooner and it turns out that
from that research note that that's a
no-go yeah kind of hurts I need a puppy
break don't you feel better I know I do
now we can talk about the teaser
surrounding the honor 7x honor posted a
teaser for the new handset on its
official Weibo page back in September
revealing that the device would launch
on October 11th when the device will
actually ship isn't yet known but it's
unlikely to be more than a few weeks
after its unveiling pricing is also
still unknown though previous
speculation suggests it will be
available for around 270 US dollars a
recent update from October 9th reveals
that the 7x will apparently feature a
6-inch 18:9 display with a 2160 by 1080
resolution a cure in 659 processor with
4 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of
internal storage space as well as
microSD expansion the cameras meanwhile
are said to be comprised of a 12
megapixel and 2 megapixel dual rear
sensor set up with an 8 megapixel
front-facing camera the device's battery
capacity was also noted at 30 to 40 and
the presence of a rear fingerprint
scanner was also confirmed
now the tenha website leaked also
indicated that this is going to be a
thin unibody metal design that will be
reminiscent of the original iPhone 6 but
at a price tag of 250 to $300 u.s.
dang-son kind of sweet now my audience
is smart so smart that sometimes you're
inspired by a business idea and then you
try and get the name of that business in
a domain name and your next prospective
customer is searching your business name
and they assume you have the dot-com and
if you don't you're giving your business
away to the one who does that's the
power of a.com
now why is that exactly well no domain
name extension tells your story with the
same degree of trust as a dot-com or
dotnet domain
dot-com and dotnet domain name
extensions inject credibility and your
online presence and who doesn't want to
be credible and don't forget you get 15%
off when you use our coupon code Android
when you think domain names think
domain.com
this is packs my new puppy yes I still
have Kenta for those of you who watch a
long time we still have the reindeer dog
she's old now she's like eight and a
half almost nine
this is pack C's 11 weeks old and he is
a Deutsche draught R or a German
Wirehaired Pointer he's bred to hunt
yeah and he's already been doing that
and he's doing a very good job but he's
just a baby he's learning ouch and he is
a ball of like cocaine crack and
caffeine all in one yeah it's obviously
beautiful for those of you who follow me
