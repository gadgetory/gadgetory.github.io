Hindy the android authority app guy it's
the end of may which means it's time to
check out the best android applications
that were released in May of 2014 first
up this month is a nifty application
called a DAP this happens what I always
envision the future of managing contacts
to be here's how it works you add
someone on adaptive whenever they update
their contact information their
information is automatically updated on
your contacts list the only problem is
getting everyone you know to use it but
it is free on iOS and Android so that
may help our cast receiver is an
application that allows people to use
all cast to stream their Android devices
to other Android devices previously all
cast can only stream to things like Roku
Apple TV and the chromecast all you need
to do is install this application on the
phone or tablet you wish to stream to
and it will begin appearing on the all
cast list of supported devices it's free
to use so if you use all cast you should
also use this Boulder skate is a mammoth
RPG with dozens of hours of gameplay it
was originally released in 1998 and some
say this helped pave the way for the RPG
genre on PCs it's a little expensive at
ten dollars and there are some add-ons
that you can pay more to get but this is
the biggest longest game available on
Android right now to see more check out
a review link below our next up is a fun
little brain teaser with over 200 free
levels colorful graphics and tablets of
boards you essentially connect the
blocks to one another but you can only
connect each block so many times as
denoted by the number inside of the
block it starts out easy and gets
progressively harder and there are
additional levels available for purchase
if you really like it the core game is
free to play in the Google Play Store
faces in is a new social network
aggregator that uses your GPS location
and the GPS check-ins of your friends to
alert you when a friend is nearby if you
use Facebook Foursquare or other
check-in services you should definitely
give faces in a shot it's free to use
and supports a number of popular social
networks with more to come and feature
updates and it also has a really nice
design frequency can only be described
as an RSS feed for videos using this
application you can subscribe to a
number of video channels from a number
of sites this includes proprietary video
feeds that don't show up on places like
YouTube or Vimeo it has a nice somewhat
cluttered design it's free and if you
like internet
you should definitely check this one out
next up is an application that works
with google camera it's called lens blur
live wallpaper and what it does is take
the blur photos you took with Google
camera and turn them into a sort of
pseudo parallax live wallpaper for your
home screen it's suffering from a pretty
bad bug right now but we expect it to be
fixed pretty soon and it is free to use
so if you use Google camera you should
definitely check this one out Monument
Valley is a puzzle game with some
astounding design and gameplay you play
as a princess who must find her way
through levels that are all based
heavily on optical illusions you can
bend move twist or otherwise manipulate
levels to get through them and it is
really quite impressive it's 399 which
is a tad expensive for only ten levels
but it rocks a 4.7 rating in the Google
Play Store which is also quite
impressive peak is a feature that is
usually baked into paranoid android but
it is now a standalone application that
anyone can download and it does not need
roots what it does is allow you to view
notifications without pressing any
buttons is the closest you can get to
the Moto X lock screen without actually
buying a Moto X and if that's what
you're looking for you should give Pete
a try quick click as a nifty application
it allows you to program your hardware
buttons to perform actions for instance
you can tap your volume button twice and
have it turn on your LED flash to use as
a flashlight it's free to use and comes
with a number of functions so if you've
always wanted more out of your hardware
buttons give this one a look sunrise
calendar is a brand new application with
a gorgeous design in terms of
functionality it does pretty much
everything you'd expect a calendar
application to do and it adds some other
fun things like the ability to invite
people to events it isn't compatible
with exchange or tablets yet but it will
be soon it's free to use and worth a
look if you want something a little bit
different out of your calendar whistle
camera came out this last month and it's
a camera application which means it does
camera application things the key
feature is that it uses the microphone
to listen for your whistle when you
whistle the app counts down and then
takes a picture this is a great tool to
use when your hands or otherwise engage
or if you don't want to move for a
selfie I cannot believe I just said
selfie anyway it's free in the google
play store right now last and certainly
not least this month is XCOM this
award-winning pc game was originally
released in 2012 and it's now available
for android it comes
they ten dollar price tag but it's as
good of a game as I've ever seen on
Android you commanded seeing of troops
as you strategically move and fire on
alien enemies hell-bent on your
destruction and it also includes an
in-depth upgrades feature this is as
good as it gets folks check it out once
