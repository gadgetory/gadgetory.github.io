interview with samsung mobile we're
speaking with Ryan Biden I believe that
you're still the project manager of a
samsung mobile yeah still text director
of product marketing my bad mobile okay
he didn't get a promotion he's just a
higher up on the pay grade than I
thought it was actually so I wanted to
take a look back at 2012 it was a really
great year for samsung he solidified
your position of top of the podium
mobile really really diverse product
lines and accelerated rollout schedule
really really good to see
internationally released galaxy s3 only
a few weeks after we saw it on US
carriers and 18 carriers so can you talk
a little bit about what 2012 was like
for samsung yeah I mean 2012 for us was
a pretty pivotal year I mean a year
before that we've launched the galaxy s2
was kind of our first opportunity to say
hey we can be serious about this we can
deliver a world-class smartphone and
then for 2012 it was about like
solidifying that position as you said
right so right out of the gate it was
like galaxy note and then it was Galaxy
Nexus and then it was galaxy s3 and then
note 2 so it's been a year where it's
really been about let's take all of
those things that we've learned continue
to refine them and continue to liver
them in new devices the great thing
about being Samsung is we've got this
huge depth in engineering and because
we're such a big organization is that we
can deliver those devices really really
fast very quickly to market so it's like
we don't really have to like deliver a
device today and then okay we finished a
vice one let's now start device to we
can work on all these things
simultaneously making sure we're taking
care of all of those different markets
and doing all that really really cool
stuff really quickly is it a lot to
handle what's that is it a lot to handle
I mean it is very very let's call it
challenging and just the pace of
innovation all right so it's this kind
of interesting thing between how quickly
can we deliver a product to market and
how much work is it from an engineering
standpoint to deliver right so what it
is we don't want to have innovations in
the pipeline that we're not delivering
to consumers so it's how quickly can we
do this stuff and bring it out versus we
got all these teams on the sales side on
the marketing side folks that I work
with on a daily basis who have to go and
actually deliver this stuff to the
retail channel to work with people to
train and sell it so it's this really
balance of wanting to bring the best
possible devices to consumers as quickly
as possible versus us all working
ourselves like crazy to get it done and
so for us we've skewed on the side of
the consumer you have and that's a good
thing because the consumer is the one
who dictates how profitable your
businesses yeah but forgetting about all
F for a second at what point okay so
first of all how many smartphones to
samsung cell in 2012 a lot is the answer
over 50 million I can't actually be
specific about it a ballpark um no okay
I don't know the number what I do know
is that i think in q4 2012 we were q3
we're definitely the number one
smartphone vendor in the world everybody
knows that though so the answer is a ton
okay a phones and more than that what
more than anyone else yes is actually
the answer and the reality is I don't
know the numbers off top my head I don't
know what we've released publicly so you
don't released anything publicly
actually okay so a lot of people are
really excited obviously about the
future everyone's looking towards the
incumbent a lot of people like AMOLED
technology has some songs been able to
perfect a 1080p you know 5-inch 24.8 is
emily display non pentile matrix okay so
here's what i will say about that so I'm
see some good in so here's what i will
say about that I'm ready and this is
where I skirt the question and read
around it just come know so if you think
about what we've done on display
technology right so we've continued
deliver Super AMOLED displays in a
variety of resolutions so we started
with if you think back to galaxy s2 it
was our first super amoled plus I've
probably wvga at the time it was huge
huge innovation and then you get to the
Galaxy Nexus and we delivered
720p a super amoled and then if you look
at the note 2 we delivered 720p super
amoled not necessarily stripe but non
pentile that was like big so these
things continue to evolve and as you
know we continue to remain at the
forefront of display technology and
there are a number of devices being
delivered today with 1080p and all of
that kind of stuff i would expect us to
continue to be successful and
competitive in the market there will be
a 1080p AMOLED display in the galaxy s4
and the Galaxy Note 3 ok big other
question it just so we're clear I didn't
say that you said I'm saying that will
remain competitive they will remain
competitive and in order for them to do
that they have to release the least
equivalent resolution thereby through
reductive analysis one can interpret
anyway I'll stop ok another question is
what can samsung do to make a better
phone than the galaxy s3 or the Galaxy
Note 2 honestly what can they do I mean
the question would have been like you
could have asked me the question after
the galaxy s2 what can we do to make it
better after galaxy s3 what can we make
it better there's lots of places to
innovate there's lots of stuff that the
vices can do that that we can make them
do now that they couldn't do six months
ago a quarter ago whenever we've got
additional processing power and all
those great things so the reality is
galaxy s4 or whatever our next flagship
device is will be an absolute leap
forward opens you have new innovations
include will the new new features what
those are specifically you'll have to
wait and see that's really exciting and
what kind of phone to you currently rock
right now right now I'm actually rocking
two devices in my pocket they were in my
pocket man to get rid of about a windows
phone right actually I have a windows
phone so in fact in general i use i have
three phones that i use right now i'm
using for so right now I've got a galaxy
s3 that i'm using i have a galaxy note 2
that i'm using i have a Galaxy Nexus
that i'm using and i have the recently
announced at teva odyssey that i'm using
is all very nice devices well i mean
there's a lot of information there is
there any chance that samsung will ever
release a device without TouchWiz
well I think if you look at the Galaxy
Nexus that is a device with our TouchWiz
so working with our partners at Google
to deliver Google Experience devices and
kind of that stripped-down experience I
think for samsung it's really important
that deliver for us what is a samsung
user experience so if you're going to
pick up one of our devices or any of our
devices I want you to have a similar
experience so I mean take that for what
it is I think we're trying to go out and
define with TouchWiz what is the Samsung
device experience well I really want to
thank you for your time I mean all I
know is that there is so much interest
behind what Samsung is doing and because
it's such a huge company was such
diverse you know industries I mean you
guys manufacturer associés you may
display you have plastics you have
concrete you do major construction there
really is in the business line that
Samsung saw Dana it's around 210,000
people that work for samsung now it's a
great question that I don't know the
answer to but it is a very large company
yeah and how what about Windows 8 phones
how would the sales going are you
pleased so far I mean obviously so for
us in the US the achieve Odyssey is our
first Windows 8 Phone here it's
launching and Verizon soon so it's too
early for us to tell with the sales I
think we're very committed to the
platform love windows 8 think it's great
we've got this device launching and I'm
sure there will be more in the future so
okay well I think we've grilled him
enough for now well we're going to be
seeing him he can't escape nor will we
stop pestering him I want to thank you
very much for time Ryan really really
big fan I appreciate it very much sir
all right darksteel cuvee law here with
android authority where pep calm digital
experience CES 2013 giving you the scoop
on all things android thank you very
much sir a new promise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
