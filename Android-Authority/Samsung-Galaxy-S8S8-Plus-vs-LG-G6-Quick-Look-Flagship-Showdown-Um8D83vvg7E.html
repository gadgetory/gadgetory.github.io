Authority and with the s8 being
officially announced and the g6 getting
ready to hit store shelves we now see
what both of these companies visions
towards a bezel as future looks like but
you're probably curious how these two
stack up so let's find out what the
Galaxy s8 versus the LG G six usually
when comparing LG flagship to Samsung's
they're radically pretty different in
terms of design and features but this
time around they actually share a lot of
similarities and it all starts with the
design you've got two phones that
feature metal frames with glass bodies
that are ip68 certified and they both
feel incredible in the hand but the s8
definitely has a much sleeker appeal
with its curved edge front and rear
panels and rounded body there's not a
single sharp edge on the SI at all
whereas with the LG G six they've gone
with more traditional flat sides and
chamfered edges in terms of sheer size
the s8 plus is significantly wider and
taller than G six due to its massive 6.2
inch screen but it doesn't feel as big
in the hand as you would expect you to
the curved edge glass and practically
non-existent bezels but if you're
looking for a more comparable size to
the g6
the regular s8 would be the way to go
with its slightly smaller 5.8 inch
screen with both Samsung and LG going
with super thin bezels this really makes
the screens on the g6 and s8 /si plus
the star of the show
and we're inching closer and closer to
the reality of having purely a screen in
the palm of our hands the g6 features a
5.7 inch LCD screen with quad HD
resolution HDR support and an always-on
display the 5.8 and 6.2 inch screens of
the Si and si plus featured the typical
AMOLED screens from Samsung that seemed
to continually get better year in year
out
they also feature HDR support and
always-on display
and quad HD resolution but you're
getting slightly more pixels on the long
side of the display due to Samsung going
with 18 and a half by 9 aspect ratio
versus LG's 18 by 9 screen something
that LG has been doing for as long as we
can remember is the use of on-screen
keys and this year Samsung has maybe
switch in order to give way for these
smaller bezels and more screen this
means no more physical home button on
the front and just like LG Samsung
fingerprint sensor is now on the back
but instead of being centered below the
camera Samsung chose to put it next to
the camera and it's just as awkward
it looks so it's definitely going to
take some getting used to or another
option would be to use the Irish scanner
to unlock the device instead
although dual cameras is another
smartphone trend that is starting to
become more popular Samsung is sticking
to their guns with a single 12 megapixel
sensor at F 1.7 aperture and dual pixel
autofocus while on the g6 you have two
13 megapixel sensors with one wide angle
and telephoto lens they're both running
Android nuga out of the box with their
own respective skins but the real
highlight on both of these phones is the
AI assistant LG chose to incorporate
Google assistant and while the SA and s
8 plus also have Google assistant it
also comes with Samsung's own AI called
Bixby and this wouldn't be a Samsung
device if it didn't have software that
competed directly with Google's I can do
a lot of the same things as Google
assistant but it's very heavily
integrated into the s8 software like the
camera web browser and other core
functions to change the way you interact
with your phone there's even a dedicated
hardware key on the side to make the
service even easier to get to the specs
of the g6 are pretty well known at this
point would be Snapdragon 820 1/4
gigabytes of ram a 3300 milliamp hour
battery wireless charging and expandable
storage over on the SI and s 8 plus you
also have wireless charging and
expandable storage with a 3,000 and
3,500 milliamp hour battery on the SI
and that's 8 plus respectively aside
from mentioning that the s8 will come
with a 10 nanometer octa-core chipset
Samsung was pretty hush on the processor
during the making of this video
but if history is any indication we most
likely can expect the latest Snapdragon
in the US and X notes for the rest of
the world the g6 and si are shaping up
to be two of the hottest phones of 2017
and it's going to be interesting to see
how these two truly stack up when
they're both widely available for more
on samsung's new SAS 8 plus or even the
LG g 6 keep it tuned here to the YouTube
channel and Android thorny calm because
