Loura tea we're here at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona where Huawei has
just announced its new flagship the p10
so let's start with an unboxing I like
the way the Box opens here to the left
on the right then inside you're going to
find your normal set of accessories
including a USB type-c cable some
headphones and the charging block now
while we're releasing the p10 in a
variety of different colors including
ceramic white graphite black several
different goals including rose gold and
prestige gold green dazzling blue and
mystic silver as with the p9 before it
here we have that dual sensor setup Co
engineered with Leica and my very
initial look at the software it seems
very similar to what you get with the p9
similar set of functionality but I'm
sure there's been lots of improvements
and we'll get to those when we do our
full review looking around the device on
the bottom we've got the USB type-c port
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and a
single speaker grille and on the
right-hand side you have the volume
rocker and the power button now while we
are making a big deal about the finish
on the back of this phone and it really
is quite nice they're calling a hyper
diamond-cut finishing it is very tactile
its fingerprints don't stick to it it
anti scratch and it certainly helps the
phone to not slip when it's in your hand
now one of the big changes from the p9
is now on the p10 the fingerprint reader
is on the front in the place of the
traditional home button now by default
you get on-screen controls however this
fingerprint reader can also be used to
do all your navigation a single touch on
the fingerprint reader is the same as
going back a touch in a hole is the same
as pressing the HOME key and a swipe on
it brings up recent tasks so as you can
see here I'm inside of the theme library
if I just tap the phone goes back if I
long and hold it goes to the home screen
you also have the option to enable a
floating dock which puts a bubble on the
screen which when you
Hachette brings out the different
control that you would normally find
including back and home and the recent
tasks so let's quickly run through the
specification here in a 5.1 inch full HD
display which is protected by Corning
Gorilla Glass 5 you've got a 64-bit
octa-core processor in the quirian 960
which uses the mali g71 GPU you've got 4
gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of
internal storage a 3200 milliamp hour
battery in terms of software this device
is running and with 7.0 with emui 5.1
layered on the top well my name is Gary
Sims from and/or authority do stay tuned
to an authority calm because we are here
at MWC bring you all the latest news and
launches as they happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
