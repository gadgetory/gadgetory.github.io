to fundamentals makes up what might be a
surprisingly great device in the Galaxy
S line its josh'll freghar from android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the Samsung Galaxy s6 the latest
in the Galaxy S line has quite a few
issues to address and it all starts in
design ok let's get it out of the way
before we move on yes there are some
obvious design influences here but there
is just enough in the galaxy s6 to
reassure the user that it is still a
Samsung device through and through
Samsung learned from the Galaxy Note 4
and the Alpha phones after its that a
metal construction is definitely the way
to go they'll do dual glass panels still
feel quite like the departure from what
we expect it to be a pretty plastic
device in previous iterations the metal
rim has a subtle taper to its edges
influenced by the frame of the galaxy
note 4 and the various colors of this
phone benefit from a translucent that
gives the colors a bit more character
than just being plainly on the device
Samsung's iconic button layout returns
as well bringing the tactile home button
up front flanked by the recent apps and
back capacitive keys and the fingerprint
scanner and the power button is now a
pressed version rather than the swipe
additions from before the charging port
and the headphone jack on the bottom
together now with the speaker grille
that has been brought away from the back
this time move around to the back and
you'll notice that there is nothing to
remove all you really get is a camera
optic package that protrudes out quite a
bit which might not be great for people
who slide their phones on tables for
example but no there is definitely no
removable backing as this unibody design
also makes expandable storage and
replaceable batteries no longer an
option what is most striking about the
phone's design is noticed once you get
it into your hand the 5.1 inch display
keeps the phone from being too big but a
very noticeable thinness and lightness
greatly helps as well what results is
one of the most comfortable fueling
experiences in a galaxy s flagship since
perhaps the s3 or the s4 the metallic
frame is of course a very welcome change
that shows how Samsung is looking to
improve their design for many users this
might be the first great looking Samsung
device since they're older pebble design
was first introduced in the s3 and I'm
inclined to agree as the design choices
in the s6 are not only striking but
organ amelie sound in a way that has
come as a bit of a surprise the 5.1 inch
screen on the galaxy s6 is a very
powerful one at this size we are now
getting a quad HD Super AMOLED display
that rocks 577 pixels per inch all that
pixel density is sure to make meeting
quite great backed by the highly
colorful AMOLED display that we've come
to expect from Samsung handling the
screen is still the highlight here as
the minimalistic body of the s6 helps
alleviate hand gymnastics on the already
pretty accessible 5.1 inch panel thus
far we're happy with what we see in the
galaxy s6 display but the benefits of
the quad HD resolution on a display that
is less than even six inches is still up
for debate of course in hardware I
already mentioned that there is no
removable backing and thus no access to
the battery or expandable storage these
are choices that are going to be hotly
debated in this new flagship and though
the unibody design makes these choices
unavoidable we feel the lack of these
two features will be sorely missed
and the 2550 million power battery
despite benefiting from fast charging
capabilities might be a little small for
people's tastes and in performance we
start with a bit of precedence by
Samsung globally now the Galaxy s6 will
now only support their in-house made
Exynos processors Samsung has proved
their prowess before in the processor
department but enhancements to the
64-bit processing package hope to bring
the s6 into the next generation and thus
far we definitely feel the power at work
in a time when scrutiny in user
interface experience is at its all-time
highest paying acute attention to the
update TouchWiz is something we could
not help doing and in this somewhat
dialed back lollipop version of TouchWiz
we're quite surprised at how well it was
able to get through its elements despite
all of the features that may have
returned or were added to the experience
TouchWiz is still future packed but what
struck me about my short time with the
Galaxy s6 is that I actually don't
really remember either accidentally
triggering certain features like multi
window or getting annoyed by the sheer
amount of elements trying to get me to
notice them I dialed back TouchWiz
though it is still a bit too colourful
like before actually seems to be what
we're getting here transitions in and
out of applications messing with the
recent apps screen and especially the
ability to bring up the camera in
fractions of a second with just a
DoubleTap of the home button all showed
just how fast this version of TouchWiz
is and it's yet another little surprise
in our time with the galaxy s6 speaking
of the camera we can now get to it and
its enhancements will really be put to
task once we get our hands on a review
unit but the spec sheet is pretty
compelling a 16 megapixel rear facing
camera is now backed by a five megapixel
front facing camera and both benefit
from quite low f 1.9 aperture for a good
low-light performance auto live HDR is
also found on both camera so getting
compelling pictures from the smart
powered rear camera or the occasional
self-portrait from the front should
yield some high-quality shots we don't
have any picture examples to show you
just yet but we will definitely be
looking at picture quality when we have
a chance to that said the interface is
pretty simple to get around this time
with a mode selector easily showing you
different ways you can use the optics my
personal favorite and what I will be
using quite often is the full manual
mode that includes manual focus a much
better alternative to the selective
focus mode in my opinion but a bit like
the TouchWiz interface in general this
time around the camera interface shows
buttons for what is essential for easy
access and then gets out of the way
until the user activates the extras and
that's a step in the right direction and
so there you have it the first look at
the Samsung Galaxy s6 we came to Samsung
not knowing quite what to expect and
left honestly a bit surprised that what
we held and experienced and you know
what that's a pretty good thing it seems
Samsung is making the main steps in the
right direction in design performance
and in the camera but it remains a
bummer that crucial parts of the
hardware experience had to be sacrificed
in order to make those enhancements
happen we won't know if the full
experience is all cracked up to be until
we get our hands on a for review unit
and the surprising part is that we can't
wait to get to do that in the coming
weeks keep it into Android for all the
best coverage here as we report to you
