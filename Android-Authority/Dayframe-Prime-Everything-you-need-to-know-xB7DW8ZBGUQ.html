Hindy the android authority app guy and
in this review we're going to take a
look at de frame prime from the same
developers who brought HD widgets so
let's get started a couple of weeks ago
we took a look at the base app called
Dave frame and we have a link in the
video description if you want to see
what the app itself is all about in this
video we're just going to take a look at
the features you get when you purchase
de frame Prime the first thing you'll
notice is the ability to create a
playlist with as many photo streams as
you want this includes facebook family
photos Instagram pictures single streams
and a lot more it adds to the depth of
the app and lets you customize your
photo streams more accordingly the next
thing we'll talk about are the various
new timers that you can add you can set
a more advanced timer that will start
specific play lists at specific times so
if you have a playlist you like at work
and when you like at home you can set
the timers accordingly so that each of
those photostream show up when they're
supposed to clog TV also added two more
timers one allows you to set your
brightness at appointed times so if you
want to turn your brightness down at
night or up during the day automatically
that can be done you can also set the
app to open other applications at
appointed times so if you want to set
alarms or do whatever it is you need to
do you can also do that our favorite
feature of day frame prime is the
automatic addition of weather along with
things like photos data and the time
it'll also pop a small weather overlay
on there for you in my short time
testing the app i found this genuinely
useful and it really adds to the overall
experience there are also more features
coming the most important of which is
device sink and a feature update coming
soon you'll be able to sync playlists
and accounts across devices so you only
ever have to set it up once the app is
499 regularly but cloud TV has lowered
the price to 299 until the device sink
is available if you're a current day
frame user we recommend you check it out
and give it some consideration because
it really does add that extra level of
functionality that makes this app really
great once again I'm Joe Hindy the
android authority app guy feel free to
subscribe to our YouTube channel and
check out our social media links below
if you're going to be hanging out for a
minute we have a couple of Awesome
videos for you to watch right over there

briton companion in the video
description thank you again for watching
and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
