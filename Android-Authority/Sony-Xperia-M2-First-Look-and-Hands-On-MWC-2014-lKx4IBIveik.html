by bitdefender mobile security while
most of the excitement for Sony might
have centered around their flagship
release and tablet update there was also
a mid-range offering that deserves as
much attention hey it's Josh ragaar from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is the sony xperia m2
the Xperia m2 takes on the general
design language that permeates
throughout the Xperia Line especially
taking inspiration from the recent crop
of Z devices it bares quite a bit of
resemblance to the Xperia z1 for example
with its more rigid sides and corners
that do have some subtle angles to them
for a more comfortable experience in the
hand it is a little smaller than the
flagship devices however with the screen
coming in at 4.8 inches while on one
side of the phone you see a cover for
the microSD card and SIM slot the
microUSB charging port is uncovered on
the other side know this phone does not
have the IP certification thus that is a
general Edition for other flagship
devices in the Sony Line being a more
mid-range offering the screen comes with
a 960 by 540 resolution and it might not
be a particularly high-end display but
it does get the job done one thing we
didn't like is the return of the large
bezels like in the original Xperia z1 as
far as performance goes we get a
Snapdragon 400 quad-core processor here
clocked in at 1.2 gigahertz and backed
by 1 gigabyte of RAM while especially
the less than standard Ram capacity is a
little disappointing it is worth
remembering that Timescape or the Xperia
UI rather is pretty minimalistic and
thus should run pretty smoothly still
and as far as hardware goes the eight
gigabytes of on-board storage is able to
be expanded with a microSD card slots
2,300 milliamp hours is the capacity of
the battery unit found inside and power
saving features could mean the
difference in longevity this is a 4G LTE
compatible phone and for added mobile
capability the m2 does have dual SIM
support when we look at the camera it is
an 8 megapixel version of the Exmor RS
sensor that comes with HDR and the
superior auto that we've come to expect
from Sony Xperia cameras and finally
when it comes to the software the Xperia
UI continues its tradition of keeping
things pretty simplistic and almost very
stock like while adding in certain
additions like the small apps and the
Sony's specific apps like the Walkman
and Unlimited services
it might not be a powerhouse but the
Xperia m2 still exhibits some of the
best that Sony has to offer and it
should come in at a very competitive
price points we're trucking along here
in Barcelona Spain for the Mobile World
Congress so stay tuned
