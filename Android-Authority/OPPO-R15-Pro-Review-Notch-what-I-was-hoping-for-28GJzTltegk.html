look at it from an outside perspective
you'd probably think it was flagship and
it is in a way hobo's essentially taken
all the bits and pieces that consumers
care about and left out the things it
thought was less important let's take
the screen as an example it's huge
six point two eight inches huge but it's
also 1080p with a pixel density of 401
pixels per inch
now it's also using an OLED panel which
helps the colors look quite good on this
phone but the quality just seems lacking
when you've got a phone six inches from
your face the quality of a screen
becomes much more important than it is
on something like a TV where you view
from a much further distance it's not a
terrible display about any means
especially if you really love bright
punchy colors but the screen seems
almost matte in a way and I don't get
that immersive feeling I get from a
really great display like the one on the
iPhone 10 another compromise Oppo has
made here has to do with legacy ports
the still using micro USB in this thing
and they're trying to make up for it by
including luke fast charging now again
if most people aren't really going to
care if it's USB C or not all they're
really gonna care about is whether or
not their phone can charge quickly while
to get ready to go out for the night and
of course this phone can do that it
desperately needs this capability though
because the battery life on my end was
not very good I got about 10 hours of
use in this thing in a day but that
includes the screen being on and off for
some reason oboes color OS launcher
doesn't report screen on time but I
think real-world use is more important
anyway I should probably notes that
Google Play services was the culprit
sucking the battery dry the week or so I
used it so it's probably likely that
using the phone in China with Chinese
apps would result in better
every life legacy ports aren't all bad
though we've got a headphone jack in
this phone so at least you'll be able to
listen to music and podcast through a
physical connection if oboe can fit the
headphone jack in here with a screen
this big I'm even less likely to believe
companies that say that they need that
space rounding out the body we've got an
oblong a fingerprint reader in the back
though you can also use face detection
to unlock this thing when it works it's
really really fast when it doesn't well
let's just say you're gonna want to have
both unlock options enabled above that
fingerprint reader we've got dual
cameras and they're all right images
were a little washed out and sharpness
and detail weren't quite where I would
have liked these are 16 and 20 megapixel
sensors - so I really think oboe should
have worked to make image quality better
dual cameras also mean portrait mode and
while it's nice to have oboes version is
just not near the quality of the pixel -
or the wall-e p20 sure these are more
expensive phones but this effect is
based on software and not as much on
hardware so I really think that opah
ought to invest some more R&amp;amp;D money into
this feature one aspect of this phone I
was actually really impressed by was the
front-facing camera the color rendition
is much better on this lens and the
images come out very sharp unless you
leave the beauty mode turned on
we're seeing selfie cameras get better
every single year and the ar-15 is a
good example of that Oppo has added some
interesting AR stickers built right into
the camera and they track your face
surprisingly well sure their novelty
will probably wear off after you send a
snapchat or two but they're quirky and
fun and I enjoy them quite a lot another
trade off Oppo made in this phone has to
do with the internals the ar-15 is
running qualcomm snapdragon 660 and
before I tell you about performance know
that they've also stepped in 128
gigabytes of internal storage with micro
SD card support and 6 gigabytes of RAM
you see what I'm talking about a lot of
people don't really care what the latest
flagship chip is they just want
something that has enough storage for
all the selfies and something that will
multitask well so they can jump between
Facebook and Instagram the chip worked
fine for general navigation but I had a
lot of issues actually loading into apps
the phone would freeze a lot while
trying to launch most of the apps I use
every day though I suspect that may have
more to do with the fact that they were
downloaded from the Google Play Store
which is not included on this Chinese
version my default phone also has a lot
of security checks to make sure you are
really you and I wasn't able to use a
different texting app without signing in
to an oppo ID
I imagine the overall usability of this
thing would be much better with Chinese
apps but this is what I had to work with
so there it is the default launcher is
called color OS and it looks like iOS at
first glance you would probably think
that this thing was running some
jailbroken version of that OS there
isn't an app drawer so apps just hang
out on multiple screens you'll have to
swipe through and swiping left gives you
a search bar and some other quick
toggles seems familiar right of course
you could just always throw Nova or some
other launcher on top to solve all of
your problems but if you like iOS just
stick with the stock option the one
feature of this launcher I actually
really liked is the gesture controls
that mirror the iPhone 10 you can select
four different navigation options with
these gestures and I chose to mimic
traditional Android
vacation by swiping up on the left side
to go back the center to go home and the
right to enable multitasking this saves
a lot of real estate on the screen and
that makes a huge display feel even
bigger than it already is
the Oppo r15 is a phone all about
compromises it's got an old charging
port but it adds fast charging it has
mediocre rear cameras but a great selfie
camera a mid-range
SOC but specked out RAM and storage the
problem here is that it costs five
hundred and twenty dollars for the
gradient red and around five hundred and
fifty five dollars for the black and at
that price range there are quite a few
phones that will do you much better for
your money if you really want a great
selfie camera and one of the biggest
screens you can get in a compact body
this is a decent option I would
personally hold out to see what oneplus
does before you pick up its reference
design so that's been it the Opel ar-15
pro if there's anything you guys want to
know that I didn't cover you can leave
your thoughts in the comment section
below or tweet me at the handle I'm
gonna throw up on the screen now make
sure you stay tuned to our site and
social networks for all the latest info
