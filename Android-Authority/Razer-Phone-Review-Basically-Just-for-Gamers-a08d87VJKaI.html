valley well it's a term used in video
games to describe characters and avatars
that don't quite make it all the way to
being truly realistic there's just a few
things about them that you can't unsee
and thus it kind of breaks the illusion
well for a phone that's supposed to be
made for gamers I thought that this was
a poignant term to use to describe it
it's Josh of Agora what's going on
everybody
and this is our full review of the razor
phone comparisons to the next bit Robin
are going to be pretty obvious here
after all the company was acquired by
Razer and what you have now is a phone
made for gamers now that's different
from being a gaming phone but that also
means that razor's influences are
clearly seen here nonetheless you have a
phone that is actually a bit unique in
design compared to other competitors and
it's also a bit reminiscent of the
original next bit Robin you have the
angular corners and also flat sides all
around making for a blocky device which
is a design aspect we don't really see a
whole lot these days
but one thing I want to tip my hat off
to is the symmetry of this phone the
speaker grilles on top and below the 5.7
inch screen take up the exact amount of
space in those particular areas the
power button on the right has a
fingerprint reader embedded into it much
like the original next bit Robin and it
was actually pretty easy to use even
when using my middle finger on my left
hand in order to quickly unlock the
device after pressing the button the USB
type-c port on the bottom is centered as
it should be but there is no headphone
jack here instead you get an adapter
that you plug into here or a headphone
jack but it does come with a 24 bit DAC
installed and we'll talk about the audio
experience in a little bit and finally
on the back there is the camera optic
package dual lens is over in the corner
on top of the razer logo that is
prominently displayed on this black
slate design it's actually a very
handsome device but the main problem we
have with it is just the handling with a
16 by 9 aspect ratio screen it's a
little bit wider than it probably should
be and mix left to right or right to
left handling in one hand a bit
difficult this is certainly going to be
a two-hander especially when you're
trying to type but that screen is one of
the main draws of this phone and it is a
quad HD IPS display that includes ultra
motion technology now that means that
this display can get up to a 120 Hertz
refresh rate but it is also synced up
with the GPU in order to give the best
possible experience no matter what kind
content you are using I've played a lot
of games on this device and there are
quite a few triple-a titles I take
advantage of everything the razor phone
provides there are some games that don't
quite take advantage of the full spec
list but they still look great because
of that ultra motion technology so if
you're playing a game that runs at 30 60
or 90 frames per second it's going to
look great on this display still because
the refresh rate adjusts accordingly but
the great motion in this display which
is derived from razor's own laptop
displays is really apparent even in
simple tasks like scrolling through
Google now or through websites like
Andrew Authority comm or going through
apps like Reddit it's really easy to see
how high quality this display is and
razor might just have unlocked a new
trend and smartphones moving forward the
only problem that I really had with the
display was its brightness this is an
IPS display but it's somehow doesn't get
as bright as other IPS screens in the
market this is mostly noticeable in
broad daylight situations where we pump
to the brightness to full but still kind
of had to squint or move the phone
around in order to see certain elements
but it is a small price to pay for a
phone that is overall of beast and the
specification list shows that the
Snapdragon 835 is backed up by eight
gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of
on-board storage that does include a
micro SD card slot you have the very
best specifications here that is only
really matched by the one plus 5t
currently thus work in place speed along
swimmingly so that gamers aren't the
only ones who are going to enjoy using
this phone on the daily you also have a
lot of power for multitasking as we use
multi-window for YouTube and other
applications but of course when Android
Oriol finally makes it to the razor
phone you'll also be able to enjoy
picture-in-picture we've already
mentioned that gaming is great on here
no matter what game you're playing but
the Triple A titles that are supposed to
come out that take advantage of the
razor phone specifications are still a
little bit limited
for example Final Fantasy 15 is still
not out on this phone and it was one of
those games that they really hyped for
when it came to using this phone to its
fullest potential but that's not to say
that the razor phone isn't finding
itself in the best possible position
when it comes to mobile gaming because
it truly is publishers like Sega and
Nintendo are getting into the mobile
space putting not only games from their
previous library but also putting in new
games like Nintendo's newest offering in
Animal Crossing it's a great time to be
a gamer and it's great to see Razer
getting into the mobile space at this
time
of course those games are not just a
visual aspect there's also an audio
aspect involved and razor put a lot of
thought into it in a partnership with
Dolby and their Atmos app you have dual
front-facing speakers that provide a
great amount of sound
seriously this is some of the best sound
that we've had from a smart phone ever
it's enough to actually replace cheap
Bluetooth speakers so you don't have to
have it in your arsenal all the time it
certainly past the shower test but it
still has to be outside of the shower
doors because there is no IP
certification but there is a little bit
of a compromise in the audio experience
when you talk about the headphone jack
now this is a contentious point for
pretty much anybody but what I do adore
about razors approach to it is that they
finally did something I've been saying
everyone should do the USB type-c port
on the bottom also powers a 24-bit DAC
that is built into the adapter which
provides a great sound especially if
you're using high quality headphones
this is another instance where Razer
might be setting an example that we
might see more of from other
manufacturers moving forward call
quality for the most part was good on
the razor phone at least in my
experience and I was using it on the
t-mobile network but I do have to
mention something about the microphone
when it's right next to my mouth for
more conventional calling everything
sounded fine but when the phone is
farther away from me for video calls and
also for speaker phone calls the people
on the other line said that I was
noticeably quieter that tells me that
the microphone needs a little bit more
sensitivity but you know mileage might
vary on this we've heard differing
reports from multiple sources about what
the call quality is like on the razor
phone so things might be a little bit
different with different units so maybe
your experience is gonna be different
and finally we have a large 4000
milliamp hour battery which razer claims
was possible because of the exclusion of
the headphone jack i was never really
able to get more than 5 hours of screen
on time at least on average which is not
great but I was doing a lot of gaming on
this device if you turn down the
settings in the game booster you might
get a little bit more out of it or if
you're just using it as a Productivity
device then you might get more screen on
time but of course your experience might
be different speaking of which that game
booster app is one of the only additions
that Razer put into the software suite
here the game booster allows for
tweaking of everything from the display
refresh rate to the clock speed of the
sesor and you can also change it for
full performance or for full power
saving modes and you can go into each
game in the application in order to
change the different settings this
allows for a little bit more control and
it also shows that razer was really
trying to put its best foot forward in
providing performance and customization
and personalization into the razer phone
experience and that continues with the
software suite that has been out sourced
to a great third party in the Nova
Launcher now the best part about the
Nova Launcher here is that you get all
of the great benefits of it including a
pro license that gives you access to all
of the different features that Nova
provides if you pay a little bit of
extra money which you don't have to
because it's included with this phone
you have all of the customization
options like animations on the home
screen icon packs even gestures that you
can do on the home screen itself and you
have a lot of different options to
really tweak this operating system to
make it look like your own so overall
we've had some really good things to say
about the Razer phone and it looks like
the company has done a great job in the
wake of next bits acquisition in order
to bring a great first attempt into the
smartphone space but then we have to
talk about that uncanny valley and we're
gonna talk about the camera now you have
dual 12 megapixel cameras on here that
have F 1.8 aperture in the regular lens
and F 2.6 aperture in the telephoto lens
and unfortunately we already had some
qualms with the camera in our hands on
when we noticed that there weren't that
many modes and there wasn't even an
indicator to show you which lens you
were using and how far you were zoomed
in for how much time the razor phone has
had up until market release it's a
little bit of a bummer to see that razor
hasn't really added a whole lot to the
experience and even then the camera app
is one of the slowest that we've used
especially if you use HDR and it does
not have an auto setting you're going to
have to hold the phone very steady
especially in lower than ideal lighting
situations and if you move even just a
little bit you're going to get some blur
in the photo now in broad daylight
situations you could get a pretty good
photo but those are the only times that
you can really do so and that's kind of
the mark of a subpar camera the fact
that it can only work in the brightest
of conditions unfortunately for the
razor phone it's just not a phone that
we can mention in a list of good cameras
in the Android space especially
considering in the last year or so we've
been having a continual rise in
photographic quality
and so there you have it the razor phone
this is a powerhouse powerhouse is a
great term to describe this device
because it does so many things right but
it just falters in one very key aspect
after all the razor phone looks and
feels like a flagship device it even
looks like a beloved phone from days
past an expert Robin there are certain
things that you can easily look past
even the lack of a headphone jack
considering that great adapter they have
in there and the size of the device is
something that you could for the most
part get used to but the biggest issue
with the phone might be described best
by the uncanny valley it's just the one
thing that you can't unsee and
unfortunately it's one of the most
important parts of a smart phone and
it's the camera experience so that makes
the camera this phone's uncanny valley
as always thank you guys very much for
watching I hope you enjoyed this review
of the razor phone razor claims that
they're going to put a lot of updates
out for the camera and hopefully they're
going to change the experience at least
a little bit but as smartphone history
has shown us updates don't really change
too much about the camera experience
even further down the line but from
there without the camera you have one of
the best phones that we've used this
year and that display technology is
something we hope to see in a lot more
smart phones moving forward keep it
tuned to Android authority for even more
about the razor phone and maybe a couple
of comparisons after all one of its main
competitors in the spec sheet is the 1 +
5 T so you can look forward to that and
