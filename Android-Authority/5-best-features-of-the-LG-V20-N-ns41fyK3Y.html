Authority here to talk about my five
favorite features about the LGV 20 just
announced and soon to hit shelves if
you're thinking about picking one of
these bad boys up then stick with me and
I will take you through what I think are
the very best features to be found on
LG's new b20 now anyone who ever saw the
LG v10 last year would be familiar with
this secondary screen up top of the main
screen it can display lockscreen
notifications you can have shortcuts to
your recent apps or favorites and your
music playback controls or even a
signature while I was already impressive
in the v10 things have only been
improved in the V 20 this year text n
notifications on the V 20 second screen
are now larger and have higher contrast
than the v10 the brightness is also been
bumped up almost doubled from 35 minutes
on the v10 to 68 nets on the V 20 you'll
also have support from much longer
character signature now 24 digits up
from 14 on the v10 and the addition of a
marquee effect for longer signatures
secondary screen is a little bit weird
at first but once you get used to it it
is indispensable and you'll wonder why
no one else ever fought to use that dead
space at the top of the screen yes a
button is actually my second favorite
feature on the LGB 20 but not with the
familiar LG power button on the back
actually this one down here now if you
saw the renders we leaked a while back
you would be forgiven for thinking as we
did at the time that it was a modular
button like we saw on the g5 fortunately
that has not happened with V 20 it is a
phone all by itself with no removable
parts inside that button on the slide
simply releases the catch mechanism for
the removable battery cover revealing a
replaceable battery that apparently last
20% longer than the v10 and access to
the micro SD card slot both of these
features are great enough in their own
right but the palpable relief I felt
when I first press that button and
didn't run into a module is probably one
of my favorite things about the LG v 20
now LG has a pretty decent reputation
for not having exactly the best
interface of all the Android bunch but
just as Samsung has really stepped up
their game with the Galaxy Note 7
interface so too has LG with the v20 not
only is it the first smartphone out of
the box to be running Android 7.0 nuga
but LG's implementation of nuga is
really really good the quick settings
and the settings menu generally are
crisp and clean notifications are
straight from stock Android and of
course there's quick app switching split
screen mode and everything generally
just feels really right I mean the icons
still suck but hey you can't win them
all in number four we have the quad DAC
naturally enough the v20 is the smart
phone for audiophiles
the v10 last year held that honor as
well but the V 20 has stepped things up
quite considerably even against the
impressive camera enhancements like
focus peaking stabilized video and
tracking focus the audio side of the V
20 still manages to be the centerpiece
the V 20 supports lossless audio when
recording in video as well as HD audio
when recording sound alone but the quad
DAC is the real showstopper here
reducing harmonic distortion by more
than half and almost doubling the
dynamic range of competitors phones
unfortunately for some the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen audio tuning is only headed to
Asia with other regions getting audio
tuned by LG which also means you won't
be getting the vno earbuds in the box
flood screen smartphones are a slippery
Bunch and metal smartphones are the
slipperiest of them all so anything a
manufacturer can do to help with the
occasional bump and scrape is going to
be appreciated the V 20 like its
predecessor boasts military standard
810g impact resistance based around an
advanced silicon polycarbonate and
aircraft grade aluminum while our V 20
drop tests did eventually manage to
crack the glass it took a pretty
unlikely height of over 7 feet flat onto
its face on a hard surface to take the
display out while there may not be much
that LG can do about the strength of the
gorilla glass display the phone
underneath it all was still working
perfectly fine even after the display
was cracked and right up to the point
that the display did finally crack on
the V 20 we were really impressed with
how little damage it actually sustained
on the out
slide even in a metal case smartphone LG
has done a great job protecting the
insides of the v20 and it should be able
to withstand any bumps and scratches you
can put it through in normal daily usage
so there you have it guys that is my
five favorite features of the LG v 20 if
you think I've missed something or you
disagree please hit the comments and let
me know what you think are the best
features of the b20 and whether you
think you'll be picking up one later in
