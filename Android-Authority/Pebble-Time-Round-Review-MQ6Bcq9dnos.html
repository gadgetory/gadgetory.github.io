smartwatches to actually look like
watches and even though this year we had
some great offerings from Android wear
that seemed to be quite
indistinguishable from timepieces analog
users definitely have one big advantage
against the SmartWatch crowd the
thickness of their watches a typical
SmartWatch will always be really thick
and pebble is hoping to buck that trend
by creating one that is not only sleek
but incredibly fashionable and since
getting this watch it honestly hasn't
left my wrist unless I have to charge it
of course it starts with agar from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is the pebble time
round it's really obvious what the
difference is about this pebble time
after all it's in the name the fact that
there's a round design to it now it's
the main draw with pebble now trying to
bring their time devices into the
growing group of round smartwatches that
we've seen this year lugs are on the top
and the bottom so you can put on the
twenty millimeter or thinner 14
millimeter bands or replace them and
then the metal constructed round body is
made splash resistant rather than fully
water resistant that means that it can
take a few drops but you're not supposed
to be diving or really submerging this
watch into water and then you see it how
thin the pebble time round is seriously
just compare this to really any Android
wear iteration right now and the round
comes out looking sleeker and certainly
more accessible for anyone with smaller
wrists especially just enough thickness
is available to put on some buttons and
as this is pebble you're not going to
get a touchscreen here you get a back
button on the left and then up down and
select buttons on the right and there is
also a microphone underneath the buttons
on the right now the buttons do kind of
make for a bit of a weird back design
but no one will see that when it's on
your wrist anyway and the buttons really
feel solid in the press there's a tiny
bit of movement that can be felt as
you're starting to press it down and
then there's a very reassuring click
when you press all the way the time
round is simply one of the best-looking
smartwatches available right now not
because of what it packs in but because
it prioritizes minimalism while there
are quite a few features that had to go
in order to make this thin body work
we'll get to those in a little bit but
if you're looking for a watch that is as
easy on the eyes as it is easy to wear
the pebble time round design is worthy
of your attention a change to a round
display means kind of changing
how information is displayed on this
color capable a paper display but pebble
has managed to really handle the round
design beautifully in broad daylight the
round has the same issue as the original
pebble time it can get tough to really
see elements in the display the
backlight is also a bit strong in
low-light situations but the intensity
can be lowered in the settings the only
real issue we had with the display is
that it's kind of hard to trigger the
backlight easily sometimes we had to be
overly aggressive in order to turn on
the backlight when we really needed it
and the 2.5 D Gorilla Glass gives it a
nice Sheen but there's a bit of a peeve
as we found with the bezel not so much
how thick it is but with how it's used
silver editions have minutes all around
while you can get the black edition with
either our designations or really
nothing at all this meant I was torn
between getting a digital face or an
analogue face because I felt like I had
to properly use those minutes markings
thankfully the pebble star has really
good Smart Watch faces already for both
of those applications but of course I
can always just cover up the bezel with
the skin of some sort but then again it
isn't that big a deal it's just
something that we noticed performance
with the pebble doesn't require too much
and in the time round we see this trend
continue their snappy and smooth
transitions and hardly any issues with
apps absent watch faces are installed
from the smartphone app which in and of
itself is a little bit slow but does get
the job done and then after that the
apps are either standalone on the watch
or require a companion application on
the phone but in either instance we've
had a good time
for example using applications like a
Pomodoro timer or even a sleep tracking
app and none of them really gave us any
issues so for what the time operating
system is able to do the SmartWatch is
able to perform without any issues and
provides a smooth experience overall
now hardware on the pebble time round is
actually rather simplistic this is a
SmartWatch that requires pairing to a
smartphone via bluetooth so Wi-Fi and
mobile networks are not a focus and for
that matter there are no extras like a
heart rate monitor but supposedly there
will be smart straps made available
sometime in the future that will address
these functions what you do get is the
standard Bluetooth connection with the
microphone that is underneath the
buttons on the right for voice inputs
now voice input is quite good on the
pebble time round with only the loudest
of environments making it tough to
perform proper dictation but for most
purposes like replying to messages we
actually didn't have much trouble with
it
now battery life on the pebble time
round is a big deal because it is the
first SmartWatch by the company that
can't boast really long life whereas the
time and original pebbles go for close
to a week or even more the round is only
able to get about two days but still
even though there are only two days in
the battery life it is really easy to
charge and because you have the leather
strap already on there you shouldn't be
wearing this in the shower anyway so we
find that during the day when we're
going to get ready to go out or anything
like that
plugging it in for maybe just even 20
minutes is enough to get the pebble all
of the power that it needs it takes only
about half an hour for it to go from
zero to 100 which is really great and
finally in software we have the round
version of the pebble time OS and the
transition has been mostly smooth but we
do love about the time OS is it's nice
transitions and sometimes cute and
quirky animations it makes for a fun
experience that is still very functional
going through the app list requires
hitting the up and down buttons a lot
and then this is the same method of
inputs for any and all applications and
even the animations that were made
specifically for the time round are
really nice eye candy like an iris
animation when going backwards in the
interface but the timeline is the main
thing here where from the watch face you
can hit up and down to see future and
past events or reminders if you're not
much of a calendar user already then
this might not strike you as a killer
app but install one of the few
applications in the store that can
convert voice input into reminders and
the timeline can actually become a
pretty powerful tool in to that end
applications are the crux of the pebble
experience a layer on top of what is
primarily a Notification Center and a
good one at that but in the transition
to a round body applications had to
change in order to utilize the space
better and the conversion is not quite
yet complete apps like Yelp and
Evernote's have yet to make their
applications available for the round
which is a bummer but hopefully we'll be
rectified soon certain other
applications already make around their
home and do so very well like solanum a
Pomodoro style application and note to
self which takes the voice input I
mentioned earlier and uses key phrases
to insert what is said into the timeline
it's pretty easy to find uses for the
pebble time software even past the main
function as a method to see
notifications from your phone and even
then if you have never used a SmartWatch
as a way to keep your phone in your
pocket you should definitely try it
customization is still pretty alive and
well in the pebble and even with a
better-looking body to surround
all a little due diligence can make the
time round a very worthy companion to
stay on your wrist but you might be
paying quite a bit for all that goodness
on the pebble website $249 is the price
for the leather strap editions and some
extra money allows for metal bands the
time round is definitely being
considered a more premium device after
all its design and well performing
functions are what it offers and users
will look to the time round as the watch
they wants when simplistic elegance is
what they desire and that's exactly what
the pebble time round manages to achieve
elegance and a confidence in what
features it does offer rather than
trying way too hard to be everything to
everybody after all for most users being
able to see notifications and then in
most cases respond to them is the core
of a SmartWatch and pebble has been able
to do that for quite a while now but
where other smartwatches fail is what
they provide in the extras not because
the features aren't good but because the
design generally has to suffer in order
to make room for them the time round is
the antithesis of this trend in
smartwatches and by prioritizing
simplicity it is probably the first
SmartWatch that paradoxically can
actually be recommended to literally
anybody if you do really need a heart
rate monitor the ability to make calls
from your wrist or even just autonomous
usage via mobile connectivity then you
probably won't be buying this watch but
you will be missing out on one of the
best-looking pebbles No one of the
best-looking smartwatches that we have
seen all year as always thank you guys
