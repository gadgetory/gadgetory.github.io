brought to you by full sail university
whoa a lot happen this week we got Hugo
Barra from xiaomi telling us about
chemise future we also found out that
ZTE is behind the mysterious axon phone
and what I think will likely be the best
bang for your buck phone 2015 has leaked
the Moto G 2015 edition alright so let's
start off with the Moto G the device at
hand looks like your average motorola
handset the design is streamlined and
very basic the textured back makes it
look a little more unique it also seems
to have a new metal looking stripe right
below the camera which is something new
the rumored specs include android 5.1
point 1 the 5-inch screen a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 410 processor 1 gigabytes of
ram 8 gigabytes of internal storage a
microSD card slot LTE and an 8 megapixel
rear camera and a 5-megapixel
front-facing shooter all these snacks
make total sense and they're just what
you'd expect from the Moto G the best
improvements are probably the processor
and cameras please do keep in mind that
these are still rumors and leaks nothing
is for certain until the manufacturer
makes an official announcement so take
this information with a healthy dose of
salt the images were taken from a
Chinese digital forum so we can't
exactly give them our stamp of approval
just yet did you know that LG is
breaking Guinness World Records oh yeah
the LG g4 is one of the best smartphones
around but did you know it's also good
enough to break guinness world records
they did so on june thirteenth when they
beat the world record for the quote
world's longest selfie real a
chain-smoking passed a record that was
previously set in the u.s. LG was able
to accomplish this with the help of
2,500 people from mexico city the event
took place at a historic castle which
currently serves as the National Museum
of History 746 selfies were taken in a
period of two hours whereas the last
record was 531 with the galaxy a3 and a5
it is calculated that LG's phone took a
photo every 10 seconds during this
period of time now this may seem like a
meaningless event for some of you but it
is great marketing on lg's part and it
does demonstrate the power of LG g4 s
camera now this past week there's been a
lot of chatter about a supposed
mysterious phone called the axon that
was going to be released next month but
we didn't know who or what manufacturer
was associated with the axon well we can
confirm it is ZTE axon is indeed
connected to ZTE we have now turned up a
trademark for the axon which belongs to
the chinese manufacturer it's still
unclear if this is a whole new sub-brand
or merely a new naming convention that
is aimed at the US market we'll know
soon enough as the axon is slated to
launch July fourteenth of this year
available on chromium silver ion gold
and blue color options the axon phone
touts 4 gigabytes of ram dual rear
facing cameras that can shoot 4k HD
videos and supposedly amazing audio
experience there aren't many other specs
listed on the website unfortunately
Google services and features a quote
designed in the US stamp on its back
side since ZTE is a Chinese based
manufacturer this makes the whole ordeal
quite interesting ZTE has previously
stated that it plans to sell inexpensive
high-quality smartphones in the United
States axon or ZTE is giving away one of
these devices along with a
ten-thousand-dollar check and you can
sign up for the contest here if you wish
now this is interesting because we just
talked about this earlier in the week
Hugo Barra the vp global of xiaomi has
talked about Shamis plans in the US
market the online me store has now
launched and this is the first part of
the plan Xiaomi is looking to build
brand awareness by introducing its ultra
competitively priced products like the
15-dollar me band and its headphone
range to the US customers first speaking
of the me band in the interview Barra
says that it does not have a heart
monitor yet which is a big hint that the
me ban refresh maybe on the way very
soon so I'm really interested to hear
what you think about shamis launching
the West they're just going to really
tick off all the US carriers how they
going to sidestep that our US consumers
are going to flock to their phones
because they're cheaper wonder wonder
wonder let me know when you think in the
comments below now many of you will have
known me from
how to become TV and XDA developer TV
days where basically I was interviewing
software developers for living many of
the best developers on the planet and
the thing that became painfully clear
was that there was a serious gap between
the theory and the practical knowledge
that new graduates new developers had
and that made it really difficult for
them to actually make good products and
this is what our sponsor full sail
university is trying to address the
mobile development bachelor's degree
program offered on campus and online
teaches students how to develop apps and
utilities through courses that cover
both iOS and Android development all
students graduate with multiple
completed software products and the web
design and development bachelor's degree
program also offered on campus and
online teaches front and design and
back-end development along with coding
formats programming languages and more
all students have hands-on access to
technology from day one they receive a
laptop computer at an institutional
discount along with relevant software
and tools to learn more about full sales
