Hindy the android authority app guy
summer is coming to a close and that
means August is also coming to a close
so let's look back at the best
applications and games that were
released this month fallout shelter
turned a lot of heads when it was
released on iOS back at e3 2015 and it
turned even more once it was released on
android it's a sim builder where you
must create a vault for survivors and
help coax the new community into
thriving it comes packed with things to
do including building rooms exploring
the wasteland and even making babies
there's even plenty of that classic
Fallout quirkiness to make it feel
authentic fans of the final fantasy
series got a new application this last
month that lets them stay up to date on
the latest Final Fantasy news on top of
that the application also includes the
triple triad game out of final fantasy
eight with an updated deck that allows
you to collect characters from most of
the games in the series you can also
play the original Final Fantasy right
from the application it's about as good
as it gets for a portal app fish print
is an application developed specifically
for those who like to go fishing it's a
crowdsourced application which means
other people using the application of
the ones that are providing the data and
you can see what fish are biting where
they're being cut and there's even a
built-in competition where you can climb
leaderboards in your favorite fishing
spots it's a fun little application for
anglers and it's free to download the
focus is a new gallery application with
a lot of fun features and includes an
extensive tagging system that allows you
to organize and easily find your photos
you can also sort by dates and it comes
with gifs support along with support for
plenty of other image types if you go
premium you'll have more organization
and security features a dark much more
it's a powerful application with a light
touch and it's easy to use framed is a
new puzzle game out of noodle cake
studios and it is actually really fun
the premises you have a bunch of movie
panels that play short video clips your
job is to arrange them in their logical
order so that the right actions happen
if you do you can advance and if not you
fail the level it also comes with a
decent soundtrack plenty of gameplay and
a cheap price tag is definitely a
different kind of puzzle game Laura
Croft go is a new puzzle game out of
Square Enix for you raid abandoned ruins
as the famous Laura Croft it's a board
game style puzzler where you must move
around solve puzzles and find hidden
items along with killing bad guys to
continue on to the next level it's
beautifully designed easy to play and it
does feel a bit like a tomb raider game
it's a bit expensive for how short it is
but it is a very well-executed game
meerut
is a brand new application that allows
you to broadcast pretty much anything on
your device to the world before there
are ways to do it with games and
broadcasting with your camera like
periscope this allows you to stream
anything on your phone and allows people
to watch in comments its unique premise
but it's also in beta so do expect some
bugs it's only usable by devices running
Android 5.0 or higher pac-man 256 is an
infinite runner version of the classic
pac-man game however unlike most
bastardizations where the infinite
runner aspect makes the game for you
hollow pac-man 256 actually still feels
like pac-man you still deal with ghosts
and you must eat pellets to increase
your score but now you have to do it
fast enough to not die it's a pressingly
good for a freemium game and it's
definitely worth checking out Mozilla
quietly released an application earlier
this month called webmaker this nifty
little application allows you to create
web pages right from your device you
don't need a lot of web design
experience although from what I've seen
a little HTML and CSS knowledge
certainly didn't hurt anybody the
application is also open source which is
always a good thing and comes with a
variety of tits also totally free last
and certainly not least this month is
YouTube gaming Google's competitor to
twitch is now in the wild and the
accompanying application is made to help
people find the channels and games they
want to watch it's a totally free
application and it's easy enough to use
it also comes with notifications to let
you know when live streams are starting
chat rooms and a whole lot more it's
going to be fun and we'll be there very
soon once again I'm Joe Hindy the
android authority app guidewire here you
might as well subscribe to the Android
a30 youtube channel because we have a
lot of awesome stuff coming up for you

awesome videos linked up right over
