Android authority now the whole debate
about whether Android smartphone should
have expandable storage has been raging
for a number of years and it seems that
the manufacturers can't make up their
mind one year Samsung's flagship have
expandable storage the next year they
don't do that they do again the Nexus
line never has expandable storage but
the OEMs that make the Nexus line have
expandable storage in their own phones
it's a real roller coaster of a ride
but if you do have microSD card support
in your phone the question is is what is
the largest capacity card that you can
put in your phone now you might think
it's a straightforward question but it
actually isn't let me explain the SD
card specification is defined by the SD
Association and it's made up of a group
of manufacturers both who make devices
and those who make the memory card now
the SD Association of currently defined
three different types of SD card now
when I say SD card I mean micro SD card
and normal SD card because it's actually
just a physical difference in the form
factor but all the things about the
specifications is exactly the same for
both
now the original SD card was up to two
gigabytes and that was just called an SD
card but we went past a two gigabyte
limit a long time ago
so therefore the Association brought out
SD H see now SDHC has capacity limits up
to 32 gigabytes and that might be a
number you've seen somewhere for example
a lot of smartphone manufacturers say
expandable storage up to 32 gigabytes
and that gives us a clue that they
support SD HC now after SDHC came the
next level which was SD XC now SDXC
supports capacities up to 2 terabytes
so technically any smartphone that
supports SD XE can support card up to 2
terabytes of course 2 terabyte cards
don't exist today and that's why
sometimes when people read that 2
terabytes they say wow 2 terabytes
blacks you can't buy a 2 terabyte card
so therefore to keep consumer
expectations at a reality level some
smartphone manufacturers
just say sdcard support up to 64
gigabytes or up to 128 gigabytes which
are really the current cards that are
available at the time and next year they
might say up to 256 gigabytes or
whatever the cards that are most
commonly available then
now while the SD Association defines the
physical characteristics the pins are on
the back of the card how the device is
interact with each other the capacities
they also define how the files are
stored on the card now when a computer
or when a phone wants to access a file
it needs to know where in that block of
32 gigabytes or 64 gigabytes where the
file is is it at the beginning is it at
the end is it split over several
different parts until you do that it
needs what's called a file system now a
file system on your Windows PC will
probably something like NTFS or Linux
may be using a ext for now one of the
very most popular file systems dates
back to the late 1970s and it's called
fat file allocation table file system
now fat was originally developed by
Microsoft as I said back in the late 70s
and it was used in Windows it was used
in Windows 3.1 it was used in Windows 95
it was used in Windows 98 in fact you
could even use it in Windows XP and
actually turns out that the preferred
type of file system for USB flash drives
and for SD cards is fat there are
different types of fat that's fat16 as
fat32 there's even fat12 and fat16 over
at the android authority comm website
but the bottom line is this fat32 is the
file system that is basically read by
every type of computer in the world
including linux including Mac's
including windows including cameras
including smartphones including media
players it pretty is much universal
however there's a small problem the
first problem is that actually it's
owned by Microsoft and actually some of
the patents and the design rights the
copyright of that falta to Martin by
Microsoft and therefore you actually
find out that a lot of the big OEMs have
to pay Microsoft royalties for some of
these things including for fat support
and that's why actually Microsoft do
we make quite a lot of money out of
Android not because they particularly
produce anything around although that's
changing but because they actually get
royalties from some of the big OMS now
once we hit that 32 gigabyte limit with
SD HC what happened then is that people
start to look around at how good fat32
was for bigger and bigger file system
there one of the limitations for fat32
is you can't have a file bigger than
four gigabytes now I'm recording this
video on a canon camera and my camera
when it gets to a file size actually 2
gigabytes on this case but it could be 4
gigabytes on other cameras it has to
stop the video recording and start
recording in a new file because the
files just too big for fat32 now of
course really in the days of HD video 4k
video 8k video these file sizes it can
get really big very quickly so the SD
Association decided they needed a new
file system to replace fat32 for the SD
XC standard and so they chose X fat
extended fat but guess who extended fat
belongs to you got it it belongs to
Microsoft so here's another problem even
the new standard that they come up with
belongs to Microsoft and Android OEMs
and camera manufacturers and all these
people have to pay royalties to
Microsoft 4x fat and because of that
there's actually no X fat support
officially in Linux if you were to boot
up this a Ubuntu distribution you won't
find X fat there because it is owned by
Microsoft and they don't have the right
to use it now of course there are open
source implementations but having the
code is one thing but having the legal
right to use it is a whole different
thing so here's an interesting thing if
you are to format a micro SD card on a
Windows machine if it's 32 gigabytes or
less Windows will format it as fat32 but
if it's bigger than 32 gigabytes it will
format it as X fat now actually that
also applies to for example USB thumb
drives flash drives you put a USB flash
drive a hundred twenty eight gigabyte
one for example into your Windows
desktop and you try to format it you
cannot format it as fat32 it will only
be formatted
as ear X fat or as NTFS now it's
actually during my testing which we'll
get to in a moment I found out is
actually the difference between the
support for fat32 and the support for X
fat which seems to be the biggest
stumbling block in getting any
particular smartphone to support a micro
SD card bigger than 32 gigabytes all
that theory is very nice but what does
it mean practice what does it mean in
the real world well what I've done is
I've done a number of tests so that we
can see first of all I took a hundred
and twenty eight gigabyte USB flash
drive and connected it to a variety of
Android smartphones using a micro USB to
USB OTG converter cable I also took a
hundred and twenty eight gigabyte micro
SD card and use that in a variety of
devices and see whether that was
recognized now here's the interesting
thing my USB Drive came pre formatted as
fat32 even though it's a 128 gigabyte
but the micro SD card came pre formatted
as exFAT and in fact I reformatted both
cards in the opposite file systems to
see whether that had any effect so let's
start with the my USB 128 gigabyte might
be USB flash drive well the first thing
I did was I plugged it into a Raspberry
Pi and guess what it was not recognized
when it was formatted as X fact but it
was recognized when it was formatted as
fat32 I then took the same USB Drive and
kicked it to my Ubuntu laptop and guess
what again when it was formatted as X
fact it wasn't recognized but it was
formatted as fat32 it was so here we can
see from the start that the Linux
support for exFAT is limited whereas for
fat32 it seems to be okay I then took
the mic this USB flash driver cutting
into my sony televisions got a USB port
on it and it can show photos and things
like that and again when it was in fat32
mode it was read by the Sony television
but when it was formatted as X fact it
was not read by the Sony television I
know what about Android phones will
actually I can't fit to a variety of
Android phone and when it was formatted
as fat32 it all worked finally I can't
get to a note 4 to an oppo f1 plus to a
zenfone
even to an Amazon Kindle Fire and it
worked absolutely fine but when it was
in exFAT mode some of those devices
weren't able to read it now more
interestingly I took the micro SD card
which is 128 gigabytes and starting with
it formatted as X fact I put it into a
variety of devices now actually it
worked in most of the phones I've
actually quite surprised how well it
worked
in fact it worked on the note 4 it
worked on the Oppo f1 plus it worked on
the galaxy s7 it worked on the note 5 it
worked on the Kindle Fire it worked on
just about anything I could throw it at
but there were a few devices that it
didn't work on and let me tell you about
those this exFAT formatted 128 gigabyte
microSD card did not work on the xiaomi
redmi note 2 on the ZTE star 2 or on the
le phone piece Ickx thousand now what
hackney happened is when I put them in
those phones the phone just didn't even
recognize there was an SD card there
however on the redmi note 2 it did
actually say do you want to format this
card because it didn't recognize the
exFAT format and then when I reformatted
it actually reformatted it as fat32 and
guess what then it worked and in fact
when I took that fat32 formatted micro
sd card and put it into the ZT star -
and when I put it into the elephone
p2000 it worked then as well so
basically the pattern built up like this
even though the cards are 128 gigabytes
even though they're bigger than that 32
gigabyte that's defined by the SD HD
standard most phones will actually read
them because they have support for exFAT
and the phones that don't read them
because I don't have support for exFAT
will read them if you format them as
fat32 so what does all this mean well
basically actually means that if you do
buy a card that's bigger than 32
gigabytes you've got a high chance and
all work in your phone even phones that
say they only support 32 gigabytes but
the trick will be to reformat the card
as fat32 well my name is Gary Sims from
