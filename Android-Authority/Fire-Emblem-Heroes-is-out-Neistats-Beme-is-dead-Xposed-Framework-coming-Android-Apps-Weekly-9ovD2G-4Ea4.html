Hindy the android authority app guy
welcome back to Android apps weekly this

intro and get right into those headlines
xposed framework is eventually coming to
android nougat developer Robo 89
announced this week that it was in the
works during the announcement rovol 89
explains how different the challenges
have been from updating marshmallow to
nougat as opposed to lollipop to
marshmallow the big obstacle seems to be
how nougat installs new applications
because it did change quite a bit there
isn't an ETA on the release yet but it's
good to know that it's coming
caseyneistat beam application is
officially dead and gone as most of you
know Casey sold the company to CNN in
late 2016 the apps fate was decided by
CNN shortly afterward the app itself was
ok but nothing special you just covered
the proximity sensor on your device and
it recorded a short clip that clip then
went directly to beam we don't know cNN
has any future plans for the app or his
team at this time it was announced this
week that animal crossings mobile debut
will be delayed nintendo stated that the
release would happen in the next fiscal
year and since the next fiscal year
begins in april that's the earliest of
the game could see a release we're not
sure yet if nintendo is going to make it
a pay once game like super mario run or
a freemium game like pokemon go or Fire
Emblem heroes frankly at this point it
could go either way Super Bowl Sunday is
fast approaching and as it turns out you
have some options if you want to stream
the game Fox Sports is going to stream
the game for free without authentication
and that is likely your best bet AT&amp;amp;T
and verizon also have offerings for
their users although verizon's is much
better finally you can use the fox
sports be our application to stream the
entire thing through VR the choice is
yours and there are plenty of options
available Google Play announced their
top trending apps and games for January
2017 on the App side of things that were
apps like CNN learned Chinese dubsmash
and a lot of others CNN only really got
there because at live streamed Obama's
goodbye speech and Donald Trump's
inauguration speech for games Star Wars
for Serena my talking Hank and WWE
champions rule the day it also listed
some fun apps and games it'll be coming
up this month and that will be sure to
talk about when they're really
strange telephone is a retro adventure
game with a lot going for it the basic
premise is that you are in a strange
world and your goal is to find items and
explore other strange world you get
there by making phone calls ultimately
you have to escape the world that you're
trapped in and it also features charming
retro graphics and sound effects it's a
pay once game with no in-app purchases
easy web video cast as a browser with
the ability to cast your video to your
TV it works when you go to the site and
then you play a video the Apple
intercept the request and asks if you
want to watch it on your television
during our testing it works fairly well
although there are plenty of sites that
aren't supported just yet it has a lot
of potential and the developers seems
fairly responsive to bad reviews it's
totally free to download and use if you
want to try it out for yourself book of
unwritten tales 2 is an adventure game
with a fantasy team it features decent
colorful graphics good mechanics and a
pretty good sense of humor you'll also
get about 20 hours of gameplay and
all-star voiceover cast and four
different characters to play as it's
surprisingly good and you can pick it up
for four dollars and ninety-nine cents
with no in-app purchases ingots is an
e-book reader that helps you find free
stuff to read it's a platform where ND
writers can upload all of their stuff
and consequently you can download it
everything is also free and in English
the application features a decent clean
interface along with a few basic reading
options to make your experience a little
more enjoyable we don't think it will
trump Amazon anytime soon but it's a
good spot to find some decent stuff for
free the app itself is also free to
download Fire Emblem heroes is the
latest game from Nintendo this one is a
freemium adventure that takes place in
the Fire Emblem universe it's
reminiscent of Final Fantasy brave

various Fire Emblem games there is a
campaign mode along with several other
modes that you can play through early
