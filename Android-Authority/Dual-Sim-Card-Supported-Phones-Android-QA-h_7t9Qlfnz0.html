big knock on your geek cred if you don't
know exactly what a SIM card is and what
it does a SIM card or a subscriber
identity module is a small removable
card that is inserted into the back of a
mobile device the main function of the
SIM card is to recognize you as your
carrier's subscriber and gives you
access to the carrier's network all
carriers require a SIM card but what if
your phone could have two SIM cards mmm
all right so now that I have your
interest piqued why oh why would you
want a phone with dual SIM card support
well number one reason is that you could
have one SIM card for a data and another
SIM card for voice and text allowing you
to take advantage of the best plan
possible there's also a second reason so
as an Android geek I was pretty proud of
the fact that I got a great plan for my
carrier where I could use almost as much
data voice and text that I want without
incurring unreasonable charges until I
flew to San Francisco I called my wife
as soon as I landed spoke to her for 30
seconds just to tell her I was safe and
I got walloped with a beast of a bill
just for that 30-second call now if I'd
had a dual SIM card and supported phone
I could have had one SIM card for my
carrier's data plan and another SIM card
for an international data plan that took
advantages of better roaming deals
that's why you want a dual SIM card of
support phone one of the other great
features of having a dual SIM card
supported phone is that you can have two
phone numbers for one phone now along
this same vein one of the phones you
want to consider is the Moto G but not
just any Moto G more specifically I'm
referring to the Moto G XT 10:33 dual
SIM card supported phone now the Moto G
is one heck of a phone released back in
January 2014 the Moto G made quite a
buzz since its release why because it
packs unbelievable solid specs
considering its small price tag boasting
a quad-core Snapdragon processor and 4.5
inch display this phone provides a fast
and fluid Android experience that is
extremely impressive
at any price point but absolutely
astounding when you consider the Moto
G's aggressive price tag we were able to
review the non dual SIM card version of
the Moto G and we gave it our thumbs up
the dual SIM version of the Moto G was
released in May 2014 now I can read the
comments already remember we are talking
about a specific model the XT 1033 dual
SIM card supported Moto G now next up on
this list is the htc desire 816 dual SIM
unlocked the htc desire 816 is the HTC's
entry into the mid-range market it's a
phone that packs a lot of high-end specs
into a mid-range price the 816 is a
photo lover's dream with its 13
megapixel camera and a 5 megapixel front
facing camera selfies anyone the phone
is big measuring at 5.5 inches we're
nearing tablet territory with this one
now we all know that Samsung loves to
give us lots and lots of options and
they did so with the Samsung Galaxy s5
now we're specifically talking about the
Samsung Galaxy s5 SMG 900 FD dual SIM
card supported phone now the s5 supports
a 5.1 inch Super AMOLED capacitive
multi-touch screen with protective
Corning Gorilla Glass 3 it comes loaded
with Android 4.4.2 but would likely get
lollipop very soon with a quad-core 2.5
gigahertz Krait 400 processor chip set
with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 Adreno
330 graphics it has 16 megapixel camera
and comes with 16 gigabytes of internal
memory with the possibility to expand to
128 gigabytes via the micro SD card slot
now Samsung also offers an option for
those of you who want something a little
bit smaller the Samsung Galaxy s5 mini
duos is a mid-range variant of the
full-featured Samsung Galaxy s5 it
brings a decent set of specs with a
wallet friendly price range the phone's
design and build are identical to its
bigger siblings including the perforated
soft touch back cover and the ip67
certification for dust and waterproofing
small and lightweight the Samsung Galaxy
s5 mini
is a very portable phone featuring a 4.5
inch 720p high definition Super AMOLED
display a 1.4 gigahertz quad-core
processor 1.5 gigabytes of RAM 16
gigabytes of internal storage and a slot
for a micro SD card slot to expand the
memory up to 64 gigabytes
now HTC has also got into the dual sim
game with the HTC One e8 the 5-inch HTC
One EA dual SIM version has a Qualcomm
801 2.5 gigahertz quad-core CPU loaded
with 2 gigabytes of RAM a 13 megapixel
camera and a 2600 milliamp hour battery
now if you're a lover of sony's sleek
design sony came out with a sony xperia
m2 dual SIM the sony xperia m2 dual SIM
card Android phone was released in May
of 2014 and is likely to be one more
popular dual SIM Android phones the
Xperia m2 is an upgrade from last year's
experience M the 4.8 inch phone comes
loaded with a powerful 1.2 gigahertz
Snapdragon 400 quad-core processor
giving you enough power to take the
phone to most limits the phone also
features a generous sized 8 megapixel
camera that will allow you to take
beautiful shots thanks for watching and
