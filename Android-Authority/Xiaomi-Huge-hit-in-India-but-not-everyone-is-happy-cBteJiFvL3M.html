xiaomi is killing it in india to the
tune of selling 500,000 devices in less
than three days Wow
but it turns out that from a customer
service perspective all is not well you
see if you're a numbers person Xiaomi is
just slaying it in India last month the
company announced it had sold more than
five hundred thousand smartphones in
less than three days later that month
xiaomi CEO published a note on Xiaomi's
india Facebook page announcing the
company's latest milestone having sold 1
million smartphones in just 18 days as
the online retailers in the country went
on overdrive in the festive season you
see our social media feed timelines are
filled with rants against what are
otherwise great devices but poor after
sales support experienced non
availability of spare parts and long
wait times for getting devices serviced
have hurt customer service experience
and brand reputation in an informal poll
we did on Twitter asking about issues
with Xiaomi in India quote after sales
service garnered over 40 percent of the
votes so what does Xiaomi doing about it
well they said this according to a
Xiaomi spokesperson the company is
transitioning the most critical parts of
their after sales operations in-house
aiming for a significant improvement in
service as part of the transition Xiaomi
is updating its process further to
ensure the quick resolution of
complaints and has already initiated a
dedicated spare parts warehouse in
Bangalore quote we believe this will
result in a significant increase in
customer satisfaction we have invested
hundreds of millions of dollars in our
India business and we have never been
shy and acknowledging that a significant
portion has been dedicated to after
sales within two years of operation the
company has more than a hundred service
centres in the country of which 70 plus
our exclusive service centers now
another legitimate gripe that many
Indians haves that Xiaomi doesn't
deliver a variety of devices even
devices that are very popular and
generate a lot of buzz aren't actually
available in India and that's a problem
the Xiaomi spokesperson clarified that
the company has a strategy of launch
one flagship per year and this year it's
me five and next year they will have
another flagship phone the flagship
phone market in India is still very
small they said and then tend to keep
flagship portfolios very tight in India
but the availability issue isn't just
limited to devices being launched in the
country it's actually hard to get your
hands on one after you decide to buy one
Xiaomi entered the Indian market in July
2014 with a flash sale model with
Flipkart and while the stocks sold out
in just seconds and the company set out
gloating press releases about it it
became increasingly hard to actually buy
a me phone because they just didn't have
enough in stock there was a serious lack
of availability now there are also some
issues with the UI you see a lot of
users aren't too happy with the
company's proprietary Android
customization it's a well thought out UI
and packs a lot of neat utility features
and advanced capabilities but the
Android layer underneath isn't updated
as quickly as users would like I think
Xiaomi has an opportunity to be huge
massive but they're really going to iron
out these kinks what do you guys think
what's your experience with Xiaomi
devices let me know in the comments
