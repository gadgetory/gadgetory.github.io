we've spending a few days with arm in
London I'm speaking to Mike Filippo the
lead architect of the cortex a 72
processor Mike arm recently released the
information at the cortex a 72 and I
know you spent a couple of days of
explaining some of the features tell us
a bit about the new processor so with
the with the cortex a 72 we really had
there were three major major themes that
we were looking for in that design so
one was pushing the performance to the
next generation that people expect in
you know in the next the next series of
phones and mobile products the other one
was pulling the power down significantly
so that we can enable you know really
sustained maximum frequency performance
on those products and finally did a lot
of work to pull the area out of the
design again contributing to reduction
in power but also making it enabling
lower lower cost designs as well so
really it was a it was a it was an
iteration of the a57 reducing the die
size increasing the performance it was
it was I agree I don't want to
oversimplify you know oversimplify what
we actually did there you're right it
wasn't it was a pretty reasonably
large-scale derivative of the a 57 again
you know looking at power improvements
are performance improvements ranging
from upwards to 60% down to approaching
20% on the perf side power reductions
ranging from anywhere from you know
approaching 20 percent to 45 percent
depending on the workloads and then area
reduction pretty large scale area
reduction as well so you're right it was
a a there was the baseline was was a 57
but it's a pretty reasonably sized
derivative project and all that IP is
now with your partners and I know we've
seen some silicon and so 2016 we can
expect to see some some chips with this
processors with this kind of technology
yes that's correct day 72 you'll be
seeing parts in 16 if not earlier yeah
and maybe some flagship devices we hope
we'll pick that up in 2016 yeah I expect
that there will be that's all we're
looking for yes certainly you know the
the part being really a generational
leap or generational movement from a57
will enable those types of devices
that's great well thanks for much for
your time Mike
I'm Gary Stevens reporting from London
have a nice day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
