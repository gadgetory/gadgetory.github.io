situation of late but they open it to
its latest smartphones will help move
the company forward now at Mobile
Congress 2017 Sony introduced a solution
devices so in expanding its XE line we
now have the Xperia x3 premium and the
XPS I'm this difference between the two
right from the get-go is their size in a
way most people would assume that the
XDS is the mini smartphone due to its
smaller figure it features a 5.2 inch
1080p triluminos display resting the
equity premium garnish attention thanks
to its 5.5 inch 4k HDR display they both
employ the same familiar design language
that Sony has been known for
however the shiny mirror esque finish of
the XE premium is just a magnet for
fingerprints and smudges that's not much
of an issue with the x's yes just
because it has a matte finish another
reason why we point out that the X is
the mini smartphone is that because it
features the Snapdragon 820 trip with 4
gigabytes of RAM and also has a smaller
footprint in contrast though the equity
premium leverages cual comes the latest
Snapdragon 835 chip with 4 gigabytes of
RAM and also has a better water
resistance with its construction and
speaking of its 4k HDR screen it's still
a rarity in the space which adjusts
things like the contrast color and
cloudy to match whatever you're doing on
the phone and it looks pretty nice so
they paid extra attention to the cameras
on these phones which is wonderful
they've also been slapped with 19
megapixel Exmor RS sensors with triple
image sensing technology you have 5 axis
stabilization and ridiculously slow 960
frames per second slow motion at HD not
full HD beyond the camera somebody has
highlighted the phone smart battery
optimizations which will do things like
preventing them from continuously
charging when they're left plugged in
overnight so depending what you're doing
power research will also be adjusted
accordingly and speaking of power the XV
frame is one the first to leverage the
snapdragon 835 processor right now we
have definitive pricing in a release
date for the
xzs it arrived on April 5th with the
price of $700 now that's a lot of money
when you think about it knowing that
though it begs the question of where
we'll see the exit premium so it
shouldn't be a shocker to see the exit
premium north of $700 and that's at the
very least but we'll see how it all
plays out wanted to reveal later in the
spring and these are your new premium
flagship phones from Sony so if you guys
won learn more about them you could
