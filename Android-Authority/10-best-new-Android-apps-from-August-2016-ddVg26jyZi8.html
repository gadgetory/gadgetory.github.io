handy the Android authority app guy and
we're nearing the end of August of 2016
which means it's time to round up the
best Android apps that were released
this month if you want to check any of
them out for yourself you can find those
download links in the video description
below
blackberry hub plus services is a basic
framework for BlackBerry security
services it's also the software that's
featured on the Prive and the D Tech 50
there isn't much to the application when
you first open it because most of what
it does is kind of in the background
you'll also find links there to download
the rest of the BlackBerry apps which
all work with hub plus along with its
primary security features it also
features android for work compatibility
and a news link to show you what's new
in the world of blackberry it's free to
try out if you're interested
google duo came out to mixed reactions
but it's actually a pretty decent app it
allows you to make one-on-one video
calls with other people there's a
feature called knock knock that allows
you to see who's calling you and their
video feed before you pick it up which
is kind of nice perhaps it's best
feature is how easy it is to use you
don't have to sign up for an account or
anything special all you have to do is
verify your phone number once and you
can immediately start making video calls
with other people who use duo it's also
completely free isotope is an
educational application that shows you
the periodic table of elements
it features 118 elements in total and
most of them have corresponding images
so you can see what the element looks
like isotope is draped and material
design which makes it look gorgeous and
also makes it easier to use you can pick
up the application for free and pay for
the pro version as an in-app purchase
the pro version comes with additional
information about each elements along
with some extra themes Microsoft Flo is
a new application that aims to compete
with the likes of IFTTT for those who
don't know IFTTT and apps like it allow
you to schedule tasks on your device
that are carried out automatically for
instance you can have your phone
uploading photo to dropbox automatically
after you share it on Instagram Flo is
currently in public beta which means you
can try it out right now if you want to
just beware that there are bugs and
other issues that haven't been worked
out just yet IFTTT is still better but a
little competition never hurt anyone one
view calendar is a calendar application
that does a lot of things a little bit
differently instead of giving you a
variety of ways to view your information
one
as the name implies has only one view
it's in chronological order and you can
open up the application to the current
day you can then zoom in or out to get
more details if you need it and scroll
up or down to navigate the various dates
it comes with some gesture controls and
drag-and-drop functionality to create
new events on your calendar it's
surprisingly fun to use and it's
completely free with no in-app purchases
offer a free VPN is exactly what the
name suggests it's a free VPN service
that's run by surf easy which is a
subsidiary of opera using the
application is pretty simple you
essentially just open up the app turn it
on pick your region and then you go it
also includes a feature that blocks ad
tracking which can be switched on
independently operas VPN isn't a
full-featured VPN like some out there
but it's not a bad package considering
that it's free to use Prisma is a
photofiltre application that's fairly
unique compared to other apps it uses
server-side neural networks to break
down and rebuild a photograph from the
ground up using whichever filter that
you want there are well over a dozen
filters that mimic a variety of styles
which means that you should be able to
find one that looks pretty awesome it's
completely free and it has already
spawned a host of clones that boast
similar features this one is completely
free and worth checking out traffic cam
is a unique application that can help
you catch sex traffickers the idea for
this one is that you use it whenever you
stay in a hotel you pop open the
application take four images of the
hotel room and then upload them to the
database according to the apps
developers many criminals use hotel
rooms for photoshoots and having a
database can help authorities find out
where these people are it's a small
thing it's completely unobtrusive and
you really only need to take it with you
when you're staying in a hotel keep it
in mind and give it a shot it is
completely free to use fern the
Himalayas is a tour application that's
designed to help you learn more about
the Himalayan mountains it does this by
placing you in control of Vern who is a
Yeti as you traverse the terrain select
parts will pop up and you can hear fun
facts and various other trivia about the
mountain you can also slide hang glide
fly and move around in a variety of ways
to get some excellent views of the
mountains we definitely hope that Google
does more of these because they're
pretty fun Wolff ray is a new wallpaper
application that specializes in high-res
images unlike many we can find anything
from 2k to 480p resolution most of the
images in wall ray are massive
crisp and they look great there are a
variety of categories including nature
people food objects and technology the
only bummer is that there aren't any
abstract style wallpapers which would
have been awesome otherwise it's free to
download and check out or you can buy
the pro version as an in-app purchase
for a dollar ninety-nine and that about
does it for this one folks if you want
