and it comes with quite a few different
features that really make a stand out
from the rest like the fast charging but
also it has an operating system that you
really will only find on Oppo devices
and is called color OS hey charge regard
from Android authority of what's going
on everybody and here is your future
focus a look at the color OS alright and
as you can see here we have the color OS
and it's on the Oppo find 7 a which is
the version that I have currently right
now we're still waiting on the Oppo find
7 which is the quad HD or the 2k version
if you want to call it that but let's go
ahead and jump into the operating system
essentially in a snapshot color OS is
very much like plenty of other
iterations of Android that basically
have a lot of the classical elements but
it just kind of shows them in a
different light and then add some
functionality on top that do actually
prove to be pretty useful but here we
are this is the color OS I do have a
weather a type of effect that's going on
as it is kind of cloudy right now in my
part of southern California and there
are also some pages here that I'll show
you in a second but as far as the
general homescreen experience goes you
do have basically just the canvas to be
able to put all of your icons your
folders and also your widgets on there
if you wish so we'll go ahead and add a
widget on there hold on to the screen in
order to do that or you can hit the menu
button right there and you'll be able to
change the wallpapers there are quite a
few right here here are all of the
widgets that are available now the
widgets that color OS typically uses
usually have a bit of an outer shape to
them they're definitely not rigid or
they're not there's always a bit of a
curve to it but I'd set over to the
photo page right here and if we click
the icon right there it will actually
open up the camera and it's just kind of
a neat way of getting a quick photo one
thing that I will tell you though is if
I were to take a photo and then I
clicked on here it would actually have
that border on there so it's not just a
straight photo it will actually put the
date and the time on there and you'll be
able to sort of kind of capture a moment
on there it's almost a little bit like a
Polaroid alright and it's at this point
that we'll bring down the notification
drop down you saw me swiping down from
the
right side and one of the reasons why
they don't have the quick toggles and
likes a notification shade is because if
you swipe down from the left you get the
gestures area so let's go ahead and talk
about the gestures a little bit we jump
into this gesture area and we have just
the ability to draw a bunch of different
pretty much anything really you can set
pretty much any gesture to open any
particular function or application in
the Oppo find 7 a and if we go to
settings we get a look at some of the
ones that are available now the ones
that we have are camera and flashlight
already and those are ones that are
usually available already but if we
added a new one let's say if I wanted to
open an application it's down here at
the bottom so it'll show all of these
applications let's say I wanted to open
Chrome so let's just make it a C well
hit OK and there you go you have a C so
if I head back and bring down that
notification or rather that gesture area
a type of C and chrome comes right up
and just a really easy way of getting to
Chrome in that way of course you have a
lot of other ones that the typical ones
are to open the camera and then here's
the camera interface and then of course
the flashlight after that so that's just
a quick look at that gesture area but
speaking of gestures there are a lot
more that they have inside of the Oppo
find 7 a ok and as we return to here I
wanted to show you the actual gestures
that are available on here so let's just
go to the settings and you'll see the
settings menu is swipeable everything
under display is pretty simple
everything under sound is actually
pretty simple you have all these toggles
down here for the various types of
sounds that you can have an under
display you are actually able to change
even there's a the daydream on here
which is nice given that this is a
version the based on KitKat after that
you can change the styles and that is
where the themes are and I'll show you
that in a second but let's look at the
gesture and motions so here are the
various gestures that you can make and
there are some come some typical ones
that are down here like if the phone was
ringing you would be able to flip the
phone in order to silence it and then
you even have a gesture answer where you
can bring the phone up to your face if
it's a if it's a call is coming in and
they'll be able to answer the phone but
the ones that are obviously a little bit
more
useful are the ones when the screen is
off so if I turn this on right now it's
called the blank screen gesture here are
a bunch of different ones and you can't
add anymore these are the ones that are
only available you will be able to have
let's say over here you can double tap
to wake the screen which is one that we
always use you can draw a circle in
order to turn on the camera and you can
even have the volume go up and down or
create arrows in order to change the
song that you are listening to so if we
just turn off the screen right now I'll
just double tap on the screen and there
is the double tap to wake so do that and
then just to will have a circle there
you go you have the circle and you go
straight to the camera so it's an easy
way of getting to various portions of
the phone and then finally there's
another one right here where we have in
application gestures now given that the
translation of color OS sometimes it's a
little bit wonky you kind of wouldn't
really know what to expect when you read
that description in the application you
can use gestures instead of touching
well it took a while for me to figure
out what exactly that was and I will
show you what it is right now
actually I don't even have to go to the
gallery app I could just show you using
the home screens see that sensor at the
top well it's very much like a Galaxy S
4 or 5 in terms of you're able to use
air gestures for there so it is only
available for the home screens and for
the gallery app but that is basically
what you have there and finally we will
look at the themes now this would be
pretty quick primarily because we're
just gonna be changing the style so
right here we have the wallpaper and
lockscreen style but the only reason why
I'm going here is because I want to
change the screen lock or the lockscreen
style now here are a bunch of the ones
that are available you have the online
the ones that are found online and you
can just download all of them the one
that you would probably know already is
this one the original unlock so if we
turn off the phone and turn it on there
it is and you can always swipe over from
the sides in order to get to various
widgets but aside from that there's
another one on here that's pretty cool
which is this one the weather style
and we'll be able to show you the
weather via right there and then have
the effect on there but also it is an
easy way another easy way of game to the
camera if you swipe down but I just kind
of liked that the airplane one was kind
of quirky and I did enjoy it so I kept
it at that so the final thing that I'll
show you aren't actually the themes now
the list of themes that are available is
actually a lot more extensive you'll be
able to scroll for quite a little bit in
order to find a theme that you like but
the ones that are already installed
already are pretty cool so the one that
I'm using is the default theme and like
I always say about color OS it does have
a bit of an ethereal look to it because
the colors always a little bit more
pastel I suppose is the term and
everything just kind of has this sort of
airy feel to it but and that is also
true for the for the icons but if I were
to head back hold the menu button to
open the recent apps screen you go back
to the theme there is actually a jelly
bean theme right here
so if I apply it all of a sudden my Oppo
find 7 looks a little bit more like a
stock Android mostly in terms of the
icons but there are plenty of like I
could say the Oppo installed icons and
also the folders still have that opal
look that color OS look but at least it
changes a little bit to kind of make it
feel a little bit more familiar so keep
it tuned to Android Authority for all of

coverage and my full review of the Oppo
find 7 a which is coming very very soon
