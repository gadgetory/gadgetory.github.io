Authority and we're here at Computex
2016 taking a look at the Moto G 4 and G
4 plus these devices were actually
announced a few weeks ago but we haven't
had the opportunity to check them out
until now so we wanted to bring you guys
a quick hands-on and go over what's
similar and different between these two
devices so starting off with the design
they're completely identical they're the
same size the same dimensions and
they're made of the same plastic
materials with the faux metallic trim
going around the sides the back cover is
removable but the battery however is not
this basically just gives you the option
to swap out the backplate with different
color shells and like the previous Moto
G you can also customize G 4 and G 4
plus to your heart's content with moto
maker the build quality isn't going to
blow you away but the plastic design
still feels pretty sturdy and it's
really comfortable and easy to hold
thanks to the textured back it's also
not that big of a phone so one-handed
use shouldn't be much of a problem for
most people they both also feature the
same 5.5 inch 1080p IPS LCD display
protected by Gorilla Glass 3 again
nothing amazing but definitely a pretty
solid looking display overall with good
colors brightness and viewing angles and
it's by far the best screen we've ever
seen on a Moto G in terms of resolution
and quality where you'll find the first
major difference is right below the
display the g4 plus is the only one out
of the g4 lineup that has a fingerprint
sensor but unlike other phones that have
a front-mounted fingerprint sensor the
g4 pluses does not double as a home
button simply due to the fact that the
g4 Plus and the rest of the g4 lineup
for that matter use on-screen keys
internally they're both packing the same
snapdragon 617 processor but where they
differ is in the RAM the standard moto
g4 comes with two gigs of RAM with
either 16 or 32 gigs of storage whereas
the g4 Plus will come with either 2 3 or
4 gigs of ram depending on whether you
opt for 16 32 or 64 gigs of storage
respectively other specs include micro
SD card expansion ipx7 water resistance
a nicely sized 3000 milliamp hour
battery
especially for a mid-range device and
to role as turbocharging capabilities
they both also share the same five
megapixel front facing shooter but the
rear cameras are actually quite
different the Moto G 4 has a 13
megapixel F 2.0 aperture lens with phase
detection autofocus and dual tone LED
flash while the G 4 plus has a higher
resolution 16 megapixel sensor also at F
2.0 with both phase detection and laser
autofocus along with the same dual tone
LED flash the software is pretty much
what you would expect from a Motorola
phone the g4 and g4 plus are running a
pretty close to stock build of Android
marshmallow and it's a really clean and
bloatware free experience you do still
have the very useful Motorola additions
like motor display for those battery
saving notifications and moto actions to
do various different gestures like
chopping twice to turn on the camera
flash or twisting your wrist to launch
the camera you'll also find a few other
extras like this Motorola clock widget
but otherwise motor oil hasn't done much
else to alter the Android experience
which is awesome because it helps keep
the experience very snappy and
responsive if you want to know more
about the Moto G 4 and g4 Plus including
pricing and availability check out the
