Authority and here at CES 2019 LG showed
off a lot of really cool products that
are coming out sometime this year but
some of the best stuff was really the
TVs so there's a couple of new 8k TVs
one of them is an 88 inch OLED TV that's
super bright contrast II and it just
looks amazing it's also extremely thin
and looks really sleek the other 8k TV
is 75 inches but it uses LG's nano cell
technology which basically just means
it's an LCD it doesn't look quite as
impressive in terms of color
reproduction and vibrancy and the
viewing angles aren't nearly as good as
the OLED but overall it still looks
pretty good it's also not as razor thin
as the OLED TV so it doesn't look quite
as cool or futuristic the biggest star
of LG's announcements is the new
rollable TV this is a 4k 65 inch OLED TV
that rolls and Rises out of a sound bar
when you're not watching TV you're left
with this really clean looking sound bar
and the TV just gets out of the way and
when you do want to watch TV it rolls
and slowly rises up it kind of just
feels like a magic trick happening in
front of your eyes there's also a mode
that LG calls horizon line view where
just a quarter of the screen sticks out
of the sound bar and this shows you some
basic stuff like your music clock or the
weather and there's different moods that
you can set like a fireplace rain snow
ocean waves and a bunch more which is
pretty neat there are wires and cables
of course because it has to draw its
power somehow but LG's marketing and
advertisements aren't going to show you
that the stand does have some built-in
cable management though so it should be
pretty easy to keep this set up looking
pretty clean all of these TVs come with
Dolby Atmos support built in AI and
these are the first TVs from LG that
have support for both Google assistant
and Amazon Alexa you'll be able to buy
these TVs including the new rollable TV
later this year as for how much they're
going to cost LG hasn't released
any info on that yet but I think it's
pretty safe to assume that they're not
gonna be very cheap anyways what do you
guys think about these new TVs or any of
the other products that LG has showed
off at CES let me know down in the
comments below and keep it tuned too and
your authority for more CES 20:19
