brought to you by full sail university
welcome back to android weekly my name
is Jace and this past week saw some
confusing news surrounding the samsung
galaxy s5 and its cousin the samsung
galaxy s5 active you see they're almost
the same phone with almost the same
specs kind of you see Samsung's trying
to make a rugged version of the s5 by
making the active have a rubber material
around the edge of the phone I can think
of some better uses for that rubber like
strapping it on and using it to pick off
the herds of I sheep yeah now you may
laugh at that but don't forget that the
original s5 was made to look like this
yeah a flexible band-aid so it's not
much of a stretch to think that Samsung
is going to rely on the rubber to
differentiate you know we make fun of
Apple for making the iphone 5 and then
the iphone 5s was just a little speck
bump what is this Samsung a rubber bump
a rubber does not a new phone make from
the looks of things in various leagues
we've gathered thus far the s5 active
will support a 5.2 inch 1080p display
and a 2.5 gigahertz quad-core processor
with 2 gigabytes of RAM and Android 4.4
KitKat with a 2800 milliamp hour battery
sound familiar yes it looks a lot like
the original s5 so what is the point why
would Samsung do this well Samsung has a
history of a shotgun approach try
everything see what works and if that
weren't enough there's another version
of the samsung galaxy s5 it's called
pride the device in question features a
metallic frame possibly made of
aluminium the overall shape is very
similar to the original s5 though the
phone in the shots appears to be
slightly thicker and wider another
change is the placement of the speaker
on the bottom side of the phone beside
the USB port as opposed to the back like
on the standard s5 now you should know
that although this is a rumor for Rob
shake from sammobile has verified that
these photos are genuine they
our real he just can't confirm if it is
the prime or the active or even a galaxy
family phone so we'll just have to wait
and see I could not make this up if I
tried because clearly Samsung and HTC
are not talking about naming conventions
because HTC also has a prime apparently
it's rumored to come out with an HTC
Prime and eight as expected the prime m8
refers to the components Snapdragon 810
and a 2.5 gigahertz with a 5.5 inch
display with 3 gigabytes of RAM now you
should know that evleaks did correct
himself by saying it was not the
Snapdragon 810 but the Snapdragon 805
but that's not all HTC's executive Jeff
Gordon challenged evleaks credibility by
saying in the past few days a well-known
leaker has been completely wrong about
at least two of his leaks be careful
where you get your news yes although
evleaks has made mistakes in the past he
has a better track record than most and
here he's claiming that the prime m8
will be made of a special material it
will be made of an exotic material a
composite of aluminum and liquid
silicone why would they make this change
we're not sure but we believe the design
would provide better heat dispensation
so for those of you who have been with
me for a while now and watch the body of
work that I've done on other channels
you will know that I've interviewed some
of the highest profile people in the
tech industry right from Facebook to
tumblr to even Google yes that's right
and they made one thing painfully clear
about the industry that there is a lack
of people who have both the technical
chops and the real world experience
that's right what are Jose say that you
absolutely needed to get a job in this
industry but more than anything was
truly important his experience and then
a performer that can be demonstrated yes
that's right a body of work that proves
you know what you're talking about
that's why I loved our sponsor this week
Full Sail University Full Sail offers an
on-campus software development

day one they receive a laptop computer
at an institutional discount along with
relevant software and tools if you watch
youtube videos on a regular basis about
a mobile operating system I'm just
saying tech maybe you're calling visit
Full Sail dot edu /i authority now the
LG g3 is less than a week away from
officially being unveiled but that's not
stopping the rumor train from chugging
along while previous reports seem to
make it clear we won't be seeing a
Snapdragon 805 the slides here confirmed
the handset will in fact have the same
Snapdragon 801 found in other recent
flagship phones like the Xperia z2 and
the Oppo find 7 although we've seen a
few leaks that point to a redesign gy
we're still not completely sure how
extensive this overhaul will be more
than likely there could be a few other
hardware and software tricks up LG
sleeves for those of you interested in
more rumors about the LG g3 you can
check out lawns video he did recently on
that very topic thanks for watching
