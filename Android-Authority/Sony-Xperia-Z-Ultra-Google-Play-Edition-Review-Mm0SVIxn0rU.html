line between tablet and smartphone was
the other one to get the Google Play
edition treatments recently hey it's
Josh regard from an authority what's
going on everybody
and this time we're taking a look at the
Sony Xperia Z ultra Google Play edition
as always when it comes to the Google
Play editions they are the exact same as
their original counterparts when it
comes to pretty much most of the
elements leading up to the software and
in that regard you can always check my
review of the Sony Xperia Z ultra found
here at the Android Authority YouTube
channel but we will talk about a few
points in design as always the form
factor and the aesthetics and this one
is the same as the original but the
Google Play edition does come in black
compared to the white one that I did
review last the glass panels are kept
together by a metal spine and this is
tempered glass that we're looking at on
both sides of this phone and also as is
the case with a lot of experience if not
all of them at this point this does come
with IP certification and that means
that this phone can definitely take a
bit of a tumble and it is dust proof and
water resistance the tumble that it can
take is due to the tempered glass on
both sides in the end the sony xperia z
ultra still gas great looks and is
really just the kind of design that you
would expect from sony these days and
only really Sony can deliver it so in
the end this is a phone that does look
and feel very nice even if that size is
a bit of a hindrance for it all around
6.4 inches in the screen comes in at
1080p resolution and 342 pixels per inch
now Sony brought in the triluminos
technology that does make for a very
vivid experience and a great experience
for all types of media and also the
screen does retain its ability to
register presses from any real metal
surface you can basically use anything
that has metal to conduct a stylus like
experience on this large screen again
the only real problem here is its size
but it does provide a very fun
experience in the power department there
definitely is no shortage of it in the
experience the ultra as it comes with
the Snapdragon 800 and the adrenal 330
now the Xperia Z ultra was an early
adopter of this particular package and
ended quite a bit of justice after all
the time scape UI in the original Z
ultra was already pretty
mystic and thus quite speedy but now you
have the stock android 4.4 kitkat build
with all of its optimizations and thus
is a step further in that proper
direction all in all you have a very
speedy experience here mostly because of
the processing package but also the
benefit of an optimized operating system
that speeds along just fine
due to all of that performance when it
comes to the hardware we already
mentioned the dust proofing and also the
water resistance given from that IP
certification and also the two sides are
made of tempered glass which gives it an
even more rugged outlook underneath the
surface it is capable of connecting to
all of the major mobile networks
including LTE networks and after that
there are a couple of really good
features that are available in here like
expandable storage found under the small
cover right over here via micro SD card
and then the battery is 3050 milliamp
hours in its unit which provides a very
decent battery life on a phone as big as
this and with this much power and in my
original review I said that it could get
that far it could get maybe close to 2
days with frugal usage and with the
power saving features on but since this
is stock Android you don't get the power
saving or the standby features at the
original Timescape UI provided in the
original version so without those you
might just get a pretty decent battery
life on here maybe not anything that is
truly impressive and then we make it to
the camera
now since the Z ultra is about as tablet
as a phone can get the lack of even a
flash diode on the shooter should pretty
much allude to what quality you can
expect from it the stock Android app
does bring a few functions to the table
but is definitely not as robust as the
original Timescape UI camera application
it there is the lack of the superior
auto which we did enjoy on pretty much
all of the Sony Xperia phones that came
before it and as far as quality goes the
shooter does give good 8 megapixel
photos given that lighting is nice the
pictures are quite vivid but obviously
they won't yield too many good low-light
shots because obviously you don't have a
flash diode built in and now finally the
software it's actually really
interesting what Android 4.4 KitKat
looks like on the Xperia Z ultra because
well after I thought about it for a
while I realized that even if you do get
the full Android KitKat build on here
the Timescape UI was already pretty
minimalistic so it might have already
provided more or less the same
experience in the original now of course
the updated Android does mean there's
better optimization and it does have a
more elegantly simplistic look compared
to the Timescape but with that in mind
Timescape did more or less provide the
same general functionality you had the
home screens the notification drop down
even though stock Android has a better
power shade and of course Google now so
what is it that you lose in the
translation here well mainly what you
lose are the small apps triggered by
opening the recent apps button on the
original Xperia Z ultra these are small
overlays that did help with some
multitasking and then after that you do
lose also Sony's own takes on the media
apps like the album and the very good
performing Walkman for your local media
content ultimately the experience of the
most updated stock Android build is
really worth the choice for many but the
fact is that you don't really lose too
much if at all from the conversion from
Timescape to android 4.4 kitkat
now whether or not that's a positive or
a negative to you really depends on
where your standpoint is and in that
regard $649 is just about what's going
to sway you one way or the other
yeah you can also get the original
Xperia Z ultra for around this price and
maybe a little bit less so for a phone
that can scratch that tablet itch as
well as this it still might be a pretty
steep price to pay for you and so there
you have it the Sony Xperia Z ultra
Google Play edition you can't really
deny it's good looks and like the
original we do applaud its build quality
and that IP certification is really nice
to have it might be a very large device
and that might be a turn out for some of
you but in the end this is probably one
of the best large devices you can have
out there especially with one as big as
this now we did find that the Xperia Z
ultra does fill a niche much like the LG
G pad that came out with it the Jeep had
fulfilled the mid-size tablet range the
8 inch range and then the experience the
ultra though it might be a little bit
weird makes actual sense because it is
the closest thing you're going to get in
the u.s. to a tablet range
can take phone calls we don't have any
tablets here full tablets that take
calls and if you have a smart phone that
is as large as this it's the closest
thing we can get to that so that's a bit
of a niche that I believe Google is
trying to fulfill here with their Google
Play Editions and you know what it's
actually not too bad an idea in the end
having the device like this is actually
quite valuable if you need a huge phone
that acts like a tablet then that is
what you get here whether or not it is
valuable to you is the question that you
are gonna have to answer as always thank
you guys very much for watching and I
hope you enjoyed this review of the
Xperia Z ultra Google Play edition now
