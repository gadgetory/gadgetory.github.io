Samsung Galaxy Note seven debacle we got
more news and first up is a potentially
exciting new wearable option the sony
xperia ear sony has started taking
pre-orders for its Xperia e R at
personal assistant earpiece in parts of
Europe for shipping sometime in
mid-november the earpiece links up to a
companion smartphone app and is supposed
to allow the owner to issue spoken
commands to their phone similar to
Google now Siri or Cortana owners can
use it to make phone calls perform
internet searches and more with the
included microphone conversely the
Xperia e R has its own voice features to
help read out text to users along with
messages from apps like Facebook
messenger and whatsapp Sony is taking
pre-orders for the Xperia e exclusively
at least for now on the company's own
store sites and a number of countries
namely UK France and Spain people who do
pre-order that your piece will also get
a code that offers a discount on any
Sony Xperia smartphone samsung is really
hoping for their next win so much so
that they called their next device
Samsung next while Samsung is still
reeling from the battery debacle that
plagued the Galaxy Note 7 the South
Korean phone maker is far from giving up
in fact Samsung India has started
teasing the next upcoming Galaxy on next
smartphone on Twitter with next
deliberately being misspelled as NXT
Samsung India revealed a full metal
unibody handset with an octa-core chip
and a rear shooter with LED flash other
than that the company provides little
information about what consumers can
expect from the next member of the
galaxy on family of products it's
notable that the upcoming handset will
be launched less than a month after
Samsung unveiled the galaxy on 8 the
galaxy on next we'll see the light of
day on October 20th in India and will be
sold exclusively on Flipkart until then
we'll have to wait for more details
about the phone now if you liked what
Mother Google is already doing to help
you manage your flights through Google
now and Gmail you're gonna like the fact
that Google's trying to help you get
cheaper flights to Google wants to make
it even
year for people to snag the lowest
possible airline prices thanks to the
latest version of the company's flights
search service the update which will
roll out in the coming weeks will inform
users if a price for a specific flight
could go up in the near future or offer
tips to get the best fare for a
particular route if a specific flight
number is entered into Google flights it
might send a notification informing the
user that the current price is expected
to go up in a few hours and that it
might be good idea to purchase the
ticket now in order to secure the lowest
possible fare if a person is still
picking the best flight on a specific
route the app will offer suggestions for
alternative airports or different travel
days that might lower its ticket price
now let's talk about a new SmartWatch
called the misfit phase and it sure is a
misfit because there's no touchable
screen so how do you use it well there
are two buttons on the side of the watch
one is pretty straightforward it's an
activity button which you use to set
alarms the other is for The Misfits link
system so you can customize it to take a
photo from your phone play music control
Misfits smart light bulb etc the watch
is in fact shower proof swim proof and
on top of that the replaceable coin cell
battery inside will last up to six
months as for the features the misfit
phase does everything that a regular
fitness tracker should do counting steps
tracking distance calculating calories
and looking at sleep patterns but it
goes beyond that you may not be able to
rotate the bezel or play around with the
screen but misfits new SmartWatch does
have a small LED window at the bottom of
the watch face and you can fully
customize that by designating a specific
color to a specific person it also has
haptic sensors so it vibrates when you
have an email or text message it's also
very subtle and discreet something that
might be a deciding factor for you you
have the option to choose between
silicon and leather for your bands which
come in to various color options this
starting price for the silicon is 175
bucks and 195 for the leather bands I am
really curious about what you guys think
about a SmartWatch that doesn't really
look like a SmartWatch and there's no
touchscreen let me know in the comments
below I'll be reading them you guys
remember from like 15 years ago when
people were making money hand over fist
in the dot-com bubble
remember we didn't call it a dotnet
bubble or dot-org bubble we didn't call
them dot biz billionaires we called them
dot-com billionaires because that's the
power of a dot-com now why is that
because no domain name extension tells
your story with the same degree of trust
as a.com or.net domain name dot-com and
dotnet domain name extensions inject
credibility into your online presence
