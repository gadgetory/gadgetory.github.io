reporting live from CES 2013 where a pep
comp digital experience it's really
tough to stay focused there's an open
bar many open bars and lots of delicious
food but none of that matters we're
looking first at the wall away this is
the mate the ascend mate and so what
essentially this is this is probably the
largest well I mean you could call it a
tablet we're looking at a 6.1 inch
screen with a 1280 by 720 LCD display
now most people don't know it but while
we actually make some processors they
have a high silicon division yeah so
this is incorporating a quad-core 1.5
gigahertz it's the arm a9 reference
design now in terms of the battery
inside we're looking at a whopping 4050
milliamp battery which probably makes it
one of the largest but considering it's
got a 6.1 inch display is that 4050
milliamp battery is going to be needed
additional specs included eight
megapixel camera on the rear we have a 2
megapixel camera front-facing all the
other standard stuff like Wi-Fi GPS
initial connectivity is looking like
it's going to support oh well actually
there's nothing really listed on that
it's just wcdma a device it's likely
that they're not going to offer an LTE
variant to start but it is substantial
now you probably can't help but
appreciate but 6.1 inches kind of use
this one-handed you're kind of at a loss
no matter what you're gonna have to do
most your stuff with two hands the
Galaxy Note 2 which a lot of people
criticize me they say that is a large
device but just to show you five point
three inches versus 6.1 in terms of the
form factor of the tube
we have either way we're taking our
first hands-on look here now we're going
to get back to you with regards to a
release date and price points obviously
it is featuring Huawei's uh you I we are
the day is featuring Android 4.1 out of
the box ICS which they say features will
always emotion UI which we saw Annie for
balloon is actually highly customizable
other than that side it appears to be
very robust looks to be quite strong the
screen is very brilliant despite being
not of the 1080p variety so we're gonna
go one of these guys in for review maybe
we can give it away flow generous either
way this is the first hands-on look at
the huawei ascend me here at capcom
digital experience CS 2013 my name
starts lack of a thanks checking this
