regard from Android Authority what's
going on everybody and this is the
Samsung Galaxy s7 versus the iPhone 6s
these two phones actually have a lot
more alike when it comes to design than
they might think the iPhone 6s is an S
iteration so it probably was expected
that it was not going to have a
different design from the iPhone 6 and
that's definitely true it basically has
the exact same body with some
improvements in the overall design
including the fingerprint reader that's
in the home button and 3d touch that was
put into the display but overall it's
the same metal unibody design that was
received quite well and it's smaller
stature makes it really easy to handle
in one hand but the same cannot be said
for the galaxy s7 as they have finally
put the curves on the back of the device
much like in the galaxy note 5 so that
it's it's incredibly nicely in the hand
now you still have the translucent
colors and the glossy finish but this
entire body is now water and dust
resistant which is a great feature that
returns in the galaxy line but it still
holds very true and very well in the
hand at with the 5.1 inch display making
it so that it's not too big and not too
small in terms of its handling now
design has always come down to personal
preference so we will leave it up to you
to see which one you think is actually
the better looker and the better feel we
do give the iPhone a little bit of
credit when it comes to its ergonomics
but the galaxy s7 is definitely closing
the gap on there and we think that is
one of the most incredible feeling
Galaxy devices ever things start to
really separate when it comes to the
displays because we have a big disparity
in the resolutions and the sizes of
these screens we have the 5.1 inch Super
AMOLED display that comes in at quad HD
resolution for the galaxy s7 meanwhile
1334 by 750 resolution is what you get
in the iPhone 6s and a 4.7 inch IPS
screen now the significant change in the
pixel density and also the resolution
mean that the galaxy s7 is being used
for even more than just the media the
gaming and the text that you will see on
its screen but also it's being made to
power VR experiences and also the Super
AMOLED screen just makes all of the
colors pop but we will give I phone some
credit for having a nice looking display
as well at the IPS screen does a good
job of displaying iOS and
is a pretty enjoyable experience all
around if not quite smaller if you are a
speck hungry person then you know which
one of these two you're going to pick in
display performance is a little bit more
murky the reason why is because we have
two different ecosystems that require
very different things from their
processing packages nonetheless the
galaxy s7 comes with the Snapdragon 820
backed by the adrenal 530 and four
gigabytes of RAM though there are going
to be versions of the phone that are
powered by the Exynos 88-90 on the other
hand we have the iPhone 6s plus which
we'll use for this example and it
features a Apple a9 processor clocked in
at 1.8 4 gigahertz backed by power VR
graphics and 2 gigabytes of RAM as
always going by the numbers in this
comparison is not very easy to do
because the ecosystems require very
different things and that being said
both of the software iterations in these
phones move along very swimmingly
especially in the iOS iteration you have
a pretty locked down operating system so
it is made to be optimized for what is
put into the iPhones on the other hand
you have the sheer power of the
Snapdragon 820 or the Exede nose 88-90
with Android marshmallow powering
TouchWiz and all the refinements and the
optimizations that are needed to make it
a very smooth experience and thus far we
have seen a pretty great experience with
this even more toned-down version of
TouchWiz Hardware comes down to a number
of similarities and one key difference
Hardware has both fingerprint sensors
embedded in the tactile home buttons up
front and the functionality is largely
the same but we have to see how the
galaxy s7 s fingerprint reader stacks up
to the iPhone 6s is one which is
admittedly quite fast in terms of
battery the galaxy s7 comes with a 3000
milliamp hour battery which is needed
for all of the power that is underneath
the surface but the iPhone 6s has a 17
15 milliamp hour unit that everyone
pretty much agrees is not really enough
for a full day's worth of use and
finally in hardware the main return in
the galaxy s7 is the additional storage
you can expand the storage now with a
micro SD card slot which is a returning
feature and we applaud Samsung for
bringing back this feature where a lot
of people thought they went wrong in the
galaxy s6 now though the iPhone 6s does
come with 3d touch it is a pretty useful
feature that does add some functionality
that iOS didn't have
for and provide some ease of use as long
as you know exactly how to use it
but ultimately 3d touch is something
that still has to evolve and we are
looking forward to see what Apple does
with it and we can see what Android may
do with it in the future when it comes
to the cameras we haven't had a whole
lot of time with the galaxy s7 to really
compare it shots to the iPhone or even
just to look at the shots from the
galaxy s7 but we will name off the specs
and you can wait for a camera shootout
that will come when we get our review
unit for now will tell you that the
Apple iPhone 6s this camera now features
a 12 megapixel rear camera with the F
2.2 aperture and a 5 megapixel
front-facing unit on the other hand the
galaxy s7 comes with a 12 megapixel rear
camera at F 1.7 aperture and the sensor
now sports much larger 1.4 micron pixels
which allows the camera to take it much
more light and make far far better
performance in low-light situations now
we weren't able to really spend a whole
lot of time with the f7 as I said but we
did see that the phase detection
autofocus embedded into every large
pixel really makes auto focusing a snap
so that might be one big trick up the
sleeve of the galaxy s7 when compared to
the iPhone 6s and finally in software
it's the age-old battle of Android
versus iOS but we have some interesting
developments in Android as we see in the
galaxy s7 there is actually an option
under galaxy labs that allows you to
move all of the apps onto the home
screens much like the way that the
iPhone 6s does now that is a little bit
disconcerting and troublesome or
worrisome rather for a lot of Android
faithful users who really enjoy their
app drawers and if this is the trend
that's going to be moving forward the s7
might just be a part of that bandwagon
but until we actually see that happen we
do see that Android and iOS have no
longer a gap when it comes to the
different applications you can run on
them it just matters which one of these
you actually want to see on the daily
and whether it's the iPhones more glossy
look or the Samsung Galaxy s7 s more
let's say cartoonish look from time to
time in TouchWiz TouchWiz still has all
of the different multitasking features
as well and there are kind of out of the
way from the view of the user so you can
still use them if you go looking for the
different things like multi window and
even the pop-up view on
other hand the iphone6s sort of relies
on its recent recent apps screen in
order to do multitasking but it does go
through it quite smoothly ultimately it
just really matters which one you want
to see every single day and if your
preference is on one ecosystem over the
other at least you're going to have the
same experience on both because all the
apps are pretty much made available
between the two and so there you have it
for this quick look at the Samsung
Galaxy s7 in the iPhone 6s things were a
lot closer between these two phones last
year but because the s7 has brought back
expandable storage and the water and
dust resistance we are inclined to say
that the s7 has done just enough to
really differentiate itself from its
predecessor now we don't know what Apple
is going to bring in the next version of
the iPhone but this is the one that we
have to work with in the 6s we are going
to just have this comparison ready for
you and you can tell us what you think
in the comments below so keep it tuned
to Android authority for even more about
the galaxy s7 and we will see these two
again in a comparison once we once we
get our review unit so keep it tuned
here because we are your source for all
things MWC 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
