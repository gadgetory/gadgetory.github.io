Authority and this here's a first look
at LG's newest SmartWatch the LG watch
urbane second edition the big story with
this watch is that this is a world's
first Android SmartWatch that can
actually connect to cell towers with 3G
and LTE speeds this means that the
urbane second edition takes the nano SIM
card so it does appear that you'll be
able to make phone calls and get
notifications without a phone which is
very interesting now of course to do
this there needs to be antenna bands
located somewhere and LG had a pretty
smart idea of incorporating these
antenna bands into the wrist bands of
the urbane second edition which keeps
the watch itself looking very clean and
of course it's capable of standard
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections the LG
watch urbane second edition is still
made from a polished stainless steel
housing which looks very beautiful and
has a very nice strong build to it once
again I have very small wrists but with
this watch being 44 point five
millimeters it feels very good it's not
the thinnest SmartWatch but with this
curved organ amah Chryst bands is quite
comfortable the round screen is still
present with a second edition of their
Bane but this time the 1.3 eight-inch P
OLED display gets a bump up and
resolution to 480 by 480
that's 348 pixels per inch which is one
of the sharpest displays we've seen on
Android wear unfortunately we weren't
able to test out the urbane second
edition with the screen on so we
couldn't see this display in action but
if this is just a striper version of the
already great display on last
generations urbane that's going to be
one beautiful display there are some new
additions above and below the ambient
display button by pressing the top
button you can launch your favorite
contact and the bottom button will
launch LG's health app when pressed
however there's no word just yet on if
you can customize these buttons to
launch other settings or apps inside the
urbane second edition we have a 570
million power battery which is quite a
step up from last editions 410 million
power battery LG claims that you'll be
able to get through at least a day and a
half to two days of use on a single
charge lastly we have four different
color choices of these rubber wristbands
including a signature brown space black
luxe white and opal blue as you can see
here the price has yet to be announced
but LG definitely seems to have stepped
up the game here when it comes to
Android smartwatches and we're looking
forward to powering on this urbane
second edition and playing around with
it so make sure you keep subscribed to

coverage on the LG watch urbane second
edition and other Android smartwatches
