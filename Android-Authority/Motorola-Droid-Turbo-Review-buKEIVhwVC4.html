back in 2008 and the reason for that is
because I had a unique design and the
commercials actually cracked me up
they're actually talking about the
iPhone what the iPhone didn't do now
Verizon arguably has not had a splash
with the Droid
ever since the Droid 1 now is this the
phone that Motorola and Verizon can use
to get back to that level of excitement
for Android well this is my Motorola
Droid turbo review the Droid turbo comes
in three different colors we have
metallic red metallic black and also the
ballistic nylon the red and black
conditions are made with a metallized
fiber material it reminded me of a
sturdier version of that soft touch
plastic they became very popular in the
last few years under these materials the
droid turbo includes a layer of Kevlar
which is the material 5 times tougher
than steel my review unit is the
ballistic nylon variety which in my
opinion is the most attractive one it's
a 2 by 2 weave and provides a textured
feeling to the back the ballistic nylon
does add 10 grams to the device so
instead of that normal 169 grams found
on that metallic fiber you'll end up
with a hundred and seventy-nine grams on
the nylon addition which to me is a
pretty good trade-off there's also one
more thing that motorola head up and
sleeve with this device it is ip67 dust
and water resistant and also is Qi
charging compatible a wireless charging
pad and not come in the box but if you
own any charges from the previous phone
they should all work out with no
problems on the front you'll find that 2
megapixel front facing camera and also
the earpiece which actually blends in
with the front facing speaker on the
bottom the capacitive buttons are found
and they look like KitKat buttons which
is a good thing but I rather have
on-screen buttons on the right side
you'll find the power button and also
the vine rocker is that both buttons has
a textured feel and they're also very
clicky
at the bottom you'll find the chin that
Motorola likes to use so often and also
the USB port tucked right in there the
left side of the device is completely
bare leaving you with a smooth side on
the top you'll find the standard
headphone jack flipping the turbo over
on its back you'll find the 21 megapixel
camera with dual LED flash in the middle
and matte black you'll find that
Motorola M logo it's not a dimple like
we've seen on the Moto X or the Nexus 6
but it's just a flat plate and at the
bottom you'll find the Droid logo
underlined in red with 64gb written
inside of it on the non Kevlar editions
you'll find just the normal Verizon logo
the turbo feels great in the hands
especially the nylon is not slippery it
provides enough grip to where I feel
pretty confident holding you without a
case and also I'm happy to report there
isn't Verizon logos all over this device
thank you Verizon the five point two mo
LED display houses the quad HD
resolution
you also have 565 PPI and it's all
wrapped in Corning Gorilla Glass 3 the
overall look on the screen is fantastic
the colors are punchy vivid and viewing
angles are all top-notch now wouldn't go
as far as say the screen is met but
taking this phone on side I didn't have
much glare as I would on other phones
since the screen is a high 565 PPI you
can expect the text to be crisp even
zoomed all the way in and even moving
text is still crisp you don't have that
ghosting image as you see with lower PPI
and generally speaking anything up close
on this screen looks amazing you can use
images you can use text again the video
or even a game everything looks crisp
now I don't think that 565 PPI is even
needed at 5.2 inches but heck it looks
amazing and I'll take it
looking at the turbo spec sheet I had to
take a double look it actually shocked
me I didn't expect moto 2 throat these
top notch specs into a carrier exclusive
device but that being said I was pleased
to see that it came with the
ladies Snapdragon process which is the
805 which clocks in at amazing 2.7
gigahertz but moto didn't stop there
they tossed in the andrina 420 GPU at
600 megahertz and the industry-leading 3
gigabytes of ram onboard storage you
have the options for 32 gigabytes and
also 64 gigabyte now just a note the
nylon comes in a 64 gigabyte flavor only
inside you'll find the 3800 milliamp
battery keeping you nice and charred
throughout the day more on this in the
performance section I know this may not
be something many reviews speak on but
the vibrating motor inside is smooth I
mean when your phone buzz it does not
have that loose feeling it's quick its
tight and it gives you an overall feel
of a solidly built device and that's the
theme throughout this whole phone now as
far as radio bands this is a world phone
so getting signals overseas shouldn't be
a problem
it supports LTE and Verizon's newest
service XLT it does support a limited
amount of HSPA s and other GSM brands
they attempted to make this phone built
for the future and Verizon is throwing
everything they have at it so how do
these specs stack up in real-world
situations what you're probably asking
right now as you can probably tell for
the video thus far the phone is
absolutely blazing fast opening
applications switching between
applications is done without much
hesitation or lag I can only count a few
times that I saw any type of shuttering
going on or any type of slowdown it's
been a great experience for me over
these past few weeks and one of the best
experiences I've had with Android period
once tests like to do is play one of the
most graphically intensive games on
mobile that is grand theft auto san
andreas well it's almost on par with
Nvidia shield the audrina 420 GPU is
amazing it's a beast it'll able to
handle this game without much problems
and it actually didn't heat up the phone
like other iterations would and this
should be seen as one of the industry
leaders for this this phone literally
screams do anything you're attempting to
do with it and it makes using it that
much more enjoyable I'm not a huge fan
of bench
marks but the droid turbo benchmark
scores are amazing with all the
benchmark tests if you take a look at
the written companion piece linked down
below you can see the results motorola
states when it comes to battery you get
48 hours of mixed use as car
manufacturer to do with miles per gallon
estimates usually fall a bit short for
the average person now I was able to get
around 29 hours of battery life after a
few tries and this is just using the
phone normally on Wi-Fi most of the time
with around 4 hours of on-screen time
it's still one of the best batteries you
can get on a mobile device period they
include a turbocharger provides you with
around 8 hours of battery life in 15
minutes of charge time which isn't a big
deal for me since the battery is great
on its own but they added bonus and
flexibility to charge quickly just makes
an awesome battery life even better the
turbo comes from the factory running the
latest version of Android at the time of
its release that is Android 4.4.4 kitkat
Motorola made a statement during his
keynote that it will get L as soon as
possible however you'll quickly find out
that it's not running a stock version of
Android per se you have a rising
software baked into it and also Motorola
software baked into it but it's not as
bad as some devices it does a good job
at actually staying out of your way but
I do prefer a 100% stock Android
experience some of the software that is
baked into the turbo is quite useful the
joins apps software may not be new but
it's a pretty decent refresh it searches
for other people using droids app and
then it brings in all photos and a
real-time stream you can then fling
photos to another person using the
droids app software and it also has
built-in chromecast support heck even
iOS users can install it from Motorola's
website the moto assist is back with
this newest update most of the features
that you know and love are still there
but it has the ability to interact with
other applications once you trigger your
keyword which is totally customizable
you can then have moto assists post to
Facebook set reminders and do an array
of other activities that are housed
outside these
test application it's a good start but
it gets pretty annoying that it opens up
Google almost every single command it
makes me question why I'm even using
this why don't just go to Google
directly also it doesn't have support
for hangouts so I can't reply to a
hangout message via my voice it's a good
start but it really needs some work
my favorite software feature is the
active notifications since the screen is
mo LED it only lights up the needed
pixels to show a notification the phone
pulses information so at a glance you
can see your notifications you can also
interact with the messages by just
pressing it down you can dismiss the
message by flicking away or even cycle
through multiple messages all on your
lock screen while the screen is mostly
off this saves battery and handles
notifications in a very elegant way the
notifications also light up when you
reach for the phone as well just a nice
touch there are also plenty of other
software enhancements built into the
device that are less significant and you
may end up turning them off or not using
them but it's also good to see Motorola
packing this phone with as many features
as possible the droid turbo features
that 21 megapixel camera at F 2.0 the
camera utilizes a tap to focus and shoot
which has mixed reviews it's a pretty
simple camera software once you fire it
up you really know what to do at the
bottom you'll find a toggle to tako from
front facing to back into the bottom
right you can see a switch from video to
still shots if you slide to the far left
a menu will display this will give you
all of your camera controls now you
don't see a lot of controls like you'll
find on like the galaxy s5 or even the
HTC One but for the average camera
photographer out there
I don't really dig into these menus it's
really a direct shooter doesn't have
that many bells and whistles but you
will find normal shooting modes like HDR
panorama and just a few other features
and it may not have a lot of features
but it takes pretty good shots there's a
lot of detail and the cones are pretty
good but being spoiled by the LG g3 and
the Galaxy s5s camera software is hard
for me to like Motorola's camera
software I
appreciate that it's minimalistic but I
still wish I had more control but
majority of the pictures that I take
come out really well the auto HDR mode
kicks on when it needs to but a lot of
times it grabs the natural light and
produces a very fantastic picture now
the rear-facing camera is very good it
pulls out colors very well the sound of
the microphone sounds very good and also
you have three different shooting modes
you have 720p resolution at 120 frames
which gets you some pretty decent slow
motion you have 1080p at 30 frames per
second which I'm shooting right now and
looks fantastic actually
and also you have a 4k resolution which
you can upload directly to YouTube and
you can also play it on your 4k TV now
it does playback on your device or non
4k devices but obviously it is being
down scaled tremendously now I put this
camera just the notch below the g3 and
also the s5 but it's still a very good
camera after using this phone for about
2 weeks as my daily driver
I came to conclusion that this is
probably the best phone on Verizon right
now of course it depends on which brand
you like more because obviously there's
usual suspects
you have the Galaxy s5 and the note and
also the HTC One m8 but this is a brand
new phone and if you're going to buy a
phone on contract and you're stuck with
it for two years you should get the
latest phone that's really good
now the specs on this phone is something
that's top notch right now so coming
into next year where the new flagship
phones are coming out this phone should
be able to compete with those guys still
has three gigabytes of RAM and it is set
up with 64-bit architecture so when
Android L starts rolling out with 64-bit
architecture built into it this phone
will take advantage of it
now there's no such thing as future
proof technology but this is the closest
thing to it when it comes to a mobile
phone as always guys my name is Kevin
