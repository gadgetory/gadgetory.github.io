different features are in signage in
mods so this quick video is going to
show you the proud owners of Opel n ones
how to install signage in mod over the
color OS that you have on the original
version so that's exactly what we're
going to do now because it's Josh regard
from Andhra Authority what's going on
everybody and here we go installing
signage in 10.2 on the Oppo n1 now
before I even get into the procedure of
installing sound engine mod on your Opel
and one which is incredibly easy I do
think it goes without saying that you
should back up all of your data on your
end one before you even do anything on
here connected via your USB and go ahead
and just extract and copy all of your
files from the n1 to a folder onto your
computer so you can backup your pictures
your media files anything that you need
that is important on there the reason
being is because when you put a ROM onto
your oboe n1 it completely wipes the
user data so make sure you do that first
after that you can head over to OPOs
main website or even Sandridge and mods
main websites now Jamaa org and although
it's just a simple matter of getting to
the n1 firmware page and you will find
the same file there as well
after that connect your n1 via USB to
your computer again and copy over that
zip file to the root of your actual
phone of the actual n1 itself so that it
sits squarely in the first place that
you go to when you first get into your
phone using the file system in your Mac
or your Windows PC just rest assured
that your oppo device especially the n1
already comes with all the tools needed
in order to install a custom ROM in this
case CyanogenMod so basically what
you're going to do is just power on your
phone while holding the volume down
button as it is booting up and as long
as you keep that button hold down it
should go into a screen that asks you
what language you want to see your
recovery and obviously in this case
we're just going to say English and
you'll see all of the different features
that are available in the recovery if
anybody of you out there have a flash
third-party roms onto your phones that
should all come as very very familiar
terra-tory but in our case we're just
going to go ahead and install straight
from the SD and as you can see at the
root of the actual file system on the
Oppo n1 we are
we have oh just one file outside of all
of the different folders that are inside
of the route and that's just the CM ROM
itself so if I were to select that it's
going to say here installation package
this operation cannot be restored we're
always going to say yes to this remember
back up your files before you do
anything here because this will
completely wipe the phone so we're going
to go ahead and hit yes and it will go
ahead and update on its own alright and
then the installation is successful
basically here we can hit yes to go back
to the recovery but there's nothing for
us to do there so we're just going to go
ahead and reboot and we should see
savage and mod load up right away and
there you go the awesome loading screen
of CyanogenMod that blue android mascot
right there giving you the look of
you're about to get some awesomeness
here and really ladies and gentlemen it
is literally just as simple as that
like I said I had a version of Santa
janmaat already installed on there so it
just kind of updated my settings
probably didn't delete any of the user
data actually because I already had a
version on there and that's kind of what
happens when you just update the OS
rather than putting a whole new one on
there however as you can see here that
is just the easy way of installing
signage and mod on your opal and one it
could is it is about as easy as you'll
ever have a procedure like that because
opal already puts its own recovery into
the phone but of course if you want to
go back to the original color OS you can
always go back to opus website and find
the original firmware there the original
file and put that onto the root of your
file system on the Oppo n1 and after
that the procedure is literally the same
that's one of the reasons why we really
love although in terms of their hardware
which already looks really nice but
underneath it already has all the tools
you need for full customization of your
Android experience after that sanity mod
really is the operating system or the
ROM that third-party ROM to put on here
because they do take advantage of all
that the n1 has to offer if you haven't
seen my original videos video showing
you the features of signage and mod that
take advantage of the n1 you should
really check it out features like the O
touch on the back right
here the rotating camera and the old
click the little accessory that comes
with it are all taken advantage of in
signage in mod which means they have a
really great and very powerful
relationship made for phones of this
caliber so that is how to install
CyanogenMod on your Oppo n1 if you have
any questions make sure you let us know
in the comments below and if you are a
proud owner of your n1 go ahead and try
it out because as long as you make sure
to backup your data you can always go
back and forth between the operating
systems as you wish again that's just
another reason why we love Oppo and we
love this Oppo n1 so keep it into
Android 34 all of the best coverage
