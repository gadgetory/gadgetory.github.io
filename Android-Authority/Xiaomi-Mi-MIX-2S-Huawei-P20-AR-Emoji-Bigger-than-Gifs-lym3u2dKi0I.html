thing isn't just for the sheep maybe
it's gonna be the best thing since gifts
and don't put in the comments that are
supposed to be gifs cuz I don't care but
before we get into that let's talk about
hardware cuz it's a big week in hardware
news and we'll start off with the
shamelessly named Xiaomi me mix 2's
Xiaomi has confirmed that it will launch
the me mix 2s on March 27th it also
confirmed that the successor to the me
mix 2 will have the new Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 processor the
announcement is also showed off a
mysterious number 273 741 have you got
the geek cred to know what that is mmm I
had to look it up you see this is likely
a reference to the phone's possible
score on the antutu benchmark tool if
that's indeed the case it shows that the
me max 2's will be a very powerful
smartphone indeed now because xiaomi is
branding this phone as a 2's is an
indication that we're not going to see
other major hardware changes in the
phone other than the snapdragon 845
chipset this means we should remind
ourselves that the me mix 2 has the
current processing champion the
snapdragon 835 inside along with a 5.9 9
inch display that has an 89th aspect
ratio and a resolution of 2160 by 1080
it also has 6 q bytes of ram storage
options for 64 128 and even a 256
gigabyte option battery sizes of Ida
3300 or 3400 million powers there's no
word on pricing or market availability
for the me mix 2's although it is likely
to be launched first in China and India
now for you Huawei fans out there the
Huawei P 20 is actually the P 20 that's
official but it won't be revealed at the
Mobile World Congress this week a few
days ago Huawei officially confirmed
that they follow up phones to the P 10
and P 10 plus where the P 20 and P 20
plus the phones are unlikely to show up
at the Mobile World Congress 2018
instead to be revealed at a separate
Paris event in March the teaser video
that sources this information is just 7
seconds long but it does throw in
another
hint towards three camera lenses in a
very brief teaser video hence the
looping while way shows a photo of Paris
with an overlaid date of 2703 2018 the
name of the device appears and then
another hint that the phone will have
count'em three cameras and then it's all
over the three cameras rumor is curious
though as we've got our hands on what we
were told was a prototype of the Huawei
p20 and there were definitely only two
camera lenses on the device granted that
the phone could be an early prototype
model created before the decision was
made to add a third lens so your guess
is as good as ours now let's talk about
specs we are almost certain that the
Cure and 970 chipset will control the P
20 P 20 Plus which means both phones
should have AI features onboard we also
expect to see a choice between 6 or 8
gigabytes of RAM on microSD slot Android
Oreo and a massive battery possibly as
large as 4,000 milliamp hours of course
this is all speculation and nothing will
be confirmed until March 27th so let's
talk about why I think potentially the
AR emoji thing could be bigger than
gifts and I think it's about precision
well think about it for a moment you're
on Twitter or messenger or Facebook and
you're searching for a gift to express
what words can't express as well as a
visual aid but you can't find the gift
that's just kind of accurate and right
the way you want to say it well what of
you could insert yourself in that gift
and say exactly what you want to say or
visually express exactly what you want
to express without having to show your
splotchy skin or a dirty background room
right that's potentially if executed
properly by the developers what AR
emojis could do me likey what do you
think I want to hear it in the comments
below or in a more interesting way on
Twitter with a gif tag me know if you
want to get serious about branding
