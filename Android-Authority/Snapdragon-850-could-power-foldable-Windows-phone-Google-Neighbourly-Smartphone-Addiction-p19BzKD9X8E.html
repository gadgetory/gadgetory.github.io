doesn't mean that the Windows operating
system won't play an important role in
the coming war of foldable devices
according to the information on Winn
future both Microsoft and Dell have
plans to release a foldable smartphone
laptop hybrid running on the upcoming
Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 chipset of
course the latest and greatest chipset
is the Snapdragon 845 which powers
flagships like the s9 the 1 plus 6
HTC u12 plus but the Snapdragon 850 is
reportedly just a Snapdragon 845 chipset
that's been beefed up to be a bit faster
as such the new chip could run the
device design that microsoft recently
patented an all screen foldable mobile
device running Windows 10 that looks
something like a mash-up between a
surface book and a samsung galaxy note
you're thinking too little too late
Microsoft I'm thinking it could be fun
now let's talk a google neighborly
another attempt by mother Google at a
social app the search giant just
launched neighborly designed to get you
as many answers about your neighbourhood
from local residents as possible
currently available in beta you can
either type out your questions or use
your voice as you wait for answers you
can swipe through other questions and
give answers of your own through text or
voice again you can also share questions
to get answers from those who do not use
neighborly now keep in mind that
neighborly is only available to current
residents of Mumbai India but it does
support English and eight other Indian
languages also neighborly is only
available on Android for the moment and
your personal details like phone number
full name and other contact information
are kept private other people can only
see your profile picture and your first
name google has had a long difficult and
storied history with social apps they
haven't done them very well so I would
love to hear from residents of Mumbai
who have used neighborly and tell me
what you think let me know in the
comments below or on Twitter I'd like to
hear if it's useful because when I
looked at it I'm thinking you know a lot
of these features are really sadist
by Facebook groups right now so I'd like
to hear your take on it
now please bear with me for a moment
because I know that I am old enough to
be a dad to most of you let me be a dad
and talk about smartphone addictions
because recent actions from Apple and
Google have made it real news with
Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference
only a couple days away
rumors are starting to leak about what
Apple will launch and discuss this year
and one of the prominent rumors via
Bloomberg is that Apple will announce
new features in iOS to help curb
smartphone addiction but Google also has
done something very similar in its own
software response to smartphone
addictions at Google i/o 2018 it's
called Android dashboard and it's meant
to help you take control of your digital
well-being
the suite offers tools to monitor
smartphone usage how many times you've
unlocked your phone how many times
you've used a specific app etc now call
me jaded but let's get real here Apple
and Google do not care about your
specific well-being they are doing this
because it's good PR and they know that
smartphone addiction has reached epic
proportions I mean whether you talk
about a generation of people and I teach
youth on a regular basis right I mean a
generation of kids who do not seem to
grasp the basic social skills that is
appropriate for their age or the death
and casualties that's happening from
texting while driving it's it's insane
it's like you've got to agree with me
guys that it has reached stupid levels
and it's it's hugely concerning I just
point out to you that if you were to
lose your phone or someone to take your
phone away from you or you were to drop
in the toilet or whatever just measure
the panic and stress that that would
cause you and if that would really
unsettle you if that would really
disturb you I would suggest to you that
you have a problem and let's face it if
you're watching youtube videos about a
mobile operating system you probably
already have a problem I'll talk to you
later IT people know how this works
you're trying to do focus productive
on your screen but your screen lights up
like a Christmas tree with IT alerts and
notifications you're not being
productive you're being distracted but
you can reduce that noise with Moog soft
AI ops by up to 99% Moog soft AI Ops is
an algorithmic IT ops platform that
reduces your IT alerts and tickets by up
to 99 percent by integrating with your
existing IT tools so you can focus on
