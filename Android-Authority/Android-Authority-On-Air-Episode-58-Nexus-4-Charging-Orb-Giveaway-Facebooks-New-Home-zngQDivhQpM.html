original Google+ Hangout show I am Scott
Anderson and I'm Dan Charlton I'm
Johnathan Franklin and Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody this week we
got a giveaway going on Josh want to
give us a little bit more information
about the giveaway absolutely so for
those that are follow our YouTube
channel I recently reviewed the nexus
for charging orb it's nice little orb

standard for the Nexus form so we're
going to be given away the very unit
that I reviewed and this is how you can
enter you can comment on the Google+
listing for this very episode of the
podcast or hang out and we're going to
announce a winner next week on the next
episode pretty much the way that you
would have to enter is in your comment
have the hashtag android authority term
inside of your comment and i will go
through all of those comments only one
don't comment a bunch of times because
i'm only going to count you as one and i
will find somebody among all those
people just randomly pick someone to win
this very charging for okay so some of
you may notice derek is feeling a little
bit under the weather so he's not gonna
be joining us tonight look later Tarek
okay so let's get started with some
April Fool's Day roundup stuff we had
some gmail so Google sniffing and some
google map stuff John you wanna
elaborate yeah we have probably the big
three um gmail blue was one of them and
if you catch all Google's YouTube then
you get to watch all these videos but
gmail blue is gmail in blue where they
highlighted everything about gmail the
comment the
all dat aleksander lying buttons in the
composer and pretty much everything
about gmail has been revamped to the
color blue so uh a little bit
disappointed that they didn't choose
hollow blue for that one and as april
fools day jokes i suppose they didn't
have to go on that farm google nose is
another one and they elaborated on
basically the next generation of google
search which is H smell search where you
can actually do similar to you do to how
you do it with google now right now
where you can actually hit a button on
your phone and actually hold your device
up and it will actually smell out
something and tell you what it is or
identify something might smell and the
last one was a google match treasure
hunt and google match treasure hunt was
a video highlighting that they have
found a bunch of maps off the coast of
madagascar and essentially digitized the
maps it was going to be rolled into
google maps where you can do random
things to try to figure out the clues as
to how you're going to find this help
them find this treasure or worldwide
search to try to decode all the hidden
able to essentially come to the treasure
here there was one other which was
youtube and essentially what they came
up with was that youtube was a search
essentially to find the best video and
it has now been found the work is
opening to be shut down that video and
it's it's over with guys what was your
guys's a favorite mine was a YouTube one
I like the gmail blue I thought the
video is pretty fallacious yeah nose was
pretty funny but I have to say yeah in
gmail blue though I have to say they got
some good people to act on that because
it really made you believe that they
really believed yeah they're so into it
and so I piping it on the back like how
much after nike converging to it really
good now it's finally blew and the
YouTube one was good also did anybody
catch the the actual
naming ceremony what they were not
naming off all the nominees for the best
video or something I'm for life just see
how it was awesome yeah there was a live
feed that went on for like 12 hours of
just naming off all these great videos
no something else that happened on the
first that was not actually a um hey
April Fool's joke was Apple apologizing
to China I thought more than until I
realized it wasn't a joke yeah do you
think it wasn't you at first yeah it was
April Fool's it seemed very big hairy
guys is horrible i saw i did saw 1 c 1
april fool's joke or someone was
praising apples web services as being
the strength of what they've been doing
like mobile me and my iCloud and they
were dead serious about it talking about
all the developer tools that they've
given for the web has been really the
core strength of all their product line
us for the last couple of years so we've
got kind of humor okay so kind of the
big news today and you know the amount
of news that's leading up to it is
Facebook's replacement for Android the
home replacement we last episode we had
a little bit of and I went through what
we what we thought was going to happen
some people were right some people were
wrong but for the most part is pretty
interesting and will elaborate on that
first of all it's going to be exclusive
to a device and Dan our Hardware
resident why don't you go over the
device yeah so that's exclusive to start
this that it's coming to several other
phones and there's list out there
somewhere included a few different
galaxies and some HTC's um so the first
device the big main device that I'm
launching with it is the HTC first which
has a Qualcomm Snapdragon dragon 400
processors this is the first device to
ship with this kind of mid-range
Qualcomm processor it's a dual-core 1.7
yards great 200 I think so it's it's
definitely not the same kind of muscle
as you're seeing advices like the HTC
One and the sgs4 you know all of the
other top end devices only one go by to
ram in as well so kind of lackluster
their disability is a 4.3 inch 720
screen which mean it's only 720 with all
these 1080 devices that seems like well
stir but this is a pretty good screen
into 342 DPI that's better than the
iphone 5 so that's definitely not a bad
screen 5 megapixel camera rear and 1.6
megapixel front in mid range on all your
basic connectivity Bluetooth Wi-Fi GPS
it will have LTE courtesy of n
Snapdragon processor set and it'll be
available in four colors red blue black
and white and actually just going to
ship with jelly bean so the latest not
quite the latest it's only 4.1 but at
least a relatively recent version of
Android plus HTC sense 4.1 and HD and
Facebook home so Scott's going to talk
more about facebook home and what it
means for Android and what it means for
facebook users so facebook home is
basically a home replacement as you
would find with ADW nova launcher apex
basically a replacement for your android
home screen couple of us thought about
this you know last show and we were
somewhat right basically they're trying
to make it people centric they're trying
to have your feet and alter information
just right there at you stirring
stirring it at you in the face there are
some interesting things first thing that
comes to mind if you have friends or if
you have people that you follow post
weird or naughty stuff there is the lock
screen is basically a large picture
potentially be you know if you're out in
public and you don't know what's going
to be there you have no idea so that's
pretty interesting I think that some
people might frown upon that or they're
like the picture smaller but I just see
it where somebody posts a picture of a
friend of theirs that was puking their
brains out at a party last night and
that's what happens when you unlock your
phone yeah for something it's not safe
for work as your boss walks past
facebook home usage is lowered during
spring break some of the interesting
things that they have is the chat head
basically what it is it's a picture of
or pictures of all the people that
you're chatting with in facebook
Messenger and what it does is basically
you can float it around your screen and
move it to wherever you want it out of
the way you can also get rid of it too
but it's an easy access for messaging in
general if you don't want to use the
drop down bar that Android paths I think
it's interesting I think it's a new
interesting concept what do you guys
think about the chat head I mean I don't
use Facebook so I really no no I don't
really want to look at this as a
facebook thing I the features are you
know new and they're not really you know
done by on any other people and it's
just kind of pushing things forward I
think it's like we can applaud them for
adding these types of features now it
could be implemented in something
different but as a feature what do you
guys think about that I think it's
creative honestly it's a different way
to multitask yeah it's it's supposed to
be able to come up no matter where you
want on the phone even if you're working
in a different app so I my only worry
with it is if you have a lot of people
who are chatting with you you're just
gonna see things like book just pop up
like that over and over and over again
and then when you drag it you can
literally drag it across your whole
scream they all kind of like follow it
like a dot matrix or something and I
mean the design itself is kind of cool I
have to admit
but I don't know just am I just get
annoying after a while to be honest yeah
I mean I think it's interesting it's
definitely nice to see a kind of a fresh
look at messaging but with all the talk
about Google babble on the horizon I
feel like this just as a particularly
impressive messaging product right like
it's just facebook Messenger which is
great I guess if you do all of your
conversations within facebook Messenger
but if not okay you gotta look at the
platform for inch and I mean there are
so many people that use Facebook and you
know some people so many people that use
facebook Messenger not texting you know
and SMS is now integrated in some
countries for you know facebook
Messenger so they're really trying to
capture all that data and I think
they're doing in an interesting way um
another thing the messenger has a better
chance than like iMessage just because
it has a potential to be cross platform
yeah that's ready for yet I will
personally want to see more integration
of SMS in there because when you kind of
weigh the options unlimited texting is
about as much as only about what two
gigabytes of data so kind of look at the
options there if SMS starts to become
more ubiquitous the way that people are
trying to make messaging I messager babe
a bold people whatever then I'd like to
see that a little bit more too well
that's mess eventual who's gonna die and
yeah it will go bye-bye nobody will ever
pay for SMS ever again unless I'm
verizon and AT&amp;amp;T of rolled SMS into
their plans for free yeah i was using it
so but i don't have that one for free
well I mean we're imagine lawyer I mean
they're just rolling SMS into it making
you pay more for data because they're
not making money off SMS anymore no well
it also just custom anything to know
yeah so um basically you have the app
drawer regular app drawer the default
one is kind of like your favorites and
then you have you guys remember launcher
pro
that was one of the first ones that came
out with the vertical scroll scroll so
your default access to all of your apps
will be a vertical scroll just kind of
interesting I don't know if that any
settings or anything that's played with
that that's still a stock Android used
to be yeah and they're kind of going
back to that so I just remember when I
used launcher pro for on my droid x add
the up and down whatever the 3d scroll
up and down right yeah that too my droid
x could not handle that so um yeah so
then you can have your your favorites
and everything just put into one thing
your unlock screen is a picture of your
face so your profile picture that's
interesting kind of reminds me of multi
users for android a little bit um I
don't know but the big thing I think
that this is doing is this is not ever
going to be on iOS Park my words because
Apple will not allow this much of a
change to their whole platform so I
really see this as a huge developer and
huge amount of people getting access to
something that is exclusively on Android
mm-hmm just like you know google
navigation was before a lot of people
thought android phones just because you
don't add navigation turn-by-turn
navigation and it was free this might be
another thing that people want to buy
off the you know initial reaction i
think the Vinny to improve some stuff
but it is definitely something that is
exclusive to Android and pretty exciting
because it does things in a brand-new
way although I do personally hate
Facebook um noting because um a lot of
hand would you know the perception is
still the android is the number 2
platform for development that you know
you make you developer iOS first and
then bring it to Android later and this
is an example of and I think Google
needs to run with this because the
number one downloaded app on both
platforms just gotta focus on Android
that iOS does not have will never have
in the foreseeable future so it has a
feature set that just iOS doesn't
compare to you so for that type of user
this you know is a big move because it
could google needs to run with it tell
you and say hey Liam if you shed all the
you know because a lot of companies that
determine what the developers can do
with their applications tell them you
need to make our your app for Android
match the one on iOS you can't make it
better don't you share intense don't use
widgets that if you focus on Android
first you can make compelling
applications there are a lot richer than
what I OSS so it's a good thing from
that perspective and it's also a good
thing to see what Google does is a
reaction to it because if it's
successful they're basically giving
Google roadmap as to how to take the
android home screen just like you know
the Kindle Fire opened up the 7-inch
tablet market and you know people were
saying the same thing this could be the
doom for Android it's like a Trojan
horse and they're forking the OS
basically really isn't forking it but
that's what led the charge for the
7-inch tablet market was the kindle fire
and google made devices like the nexus 7
to respond to it and us the consumers of
benefiting for so when you mentioned up
you mentioned the comparison to the
kindle fire and for canon eos I mean
that's the thing that I find most
impressive about this is that Facebook
isn't for canon eos they aren't locking
it to this device then y zq not a custom
rom it is running HTC Sense underneath
but that's just because it's an HTC
build phone facebook has said it's
coming to other devices it will be an
app available in the Play Store it's
coming to tablets greatly anybody can
download this and subscribe to this
environment so it's definitely run
during the Bergen right there is that's
what Microsoft and they didn't integrate
being searched with it that's probably
really know
because they could have easily put a
beam search embedded into the thing yeah
or they still could in the future and I
could see Microsoft paying them to do
that yeah definitely I agree from
earlier that is it's a pretty brilliant
move to make it more of a launcher like
I've been saying this pretty often on
the show already that I think Ubuntu
should have made a launcher instead of a
whole new gathering system social every
manufacturer retro TouchWiz should be a
launcher and we've been saying that for
a couple years now we don't think it's
going to happen because you know they
need forks for data and something that's
not easily changed because they want
they want it harder to change to another
device manufacturer which makes sense if
for a business perspective so yeah but I
think associate them that that's not
necessary well especially in terms of
facebook home on the you know the device
that they're taking out HTC first yeah
it's not the most high-end device or
anything like that but if i remember
correctly i looked at the listing and
it's only going to be ninety nine
dollars on contract with a TV and 450
off contract oh yeah it's that's that's
a really good game for android yeah
that's a really good gateway if people
get become interested their facebook
users but they're not really on android
they can start with this phone and it's
just an overlay once they peel back that
later it's all android and that's they
are that in it ok so the type of user
that buys a phone specifically for web
browsing and facebook is the cheapo
carrier freebies are you know the
100-dollar phones any news yeah so it's
going to be coming on in April twelfth
it's going to be launching on the HTC
One X the the one x+ samsung galaxy s3
galaxy note 2 eventually the HTC One and
the galaxy s4 now the nexus 4 isn't
included in that I wonder how big of an
earful they got from google from that
facebook maybe did it on purpose i got
one thing that i really do respect is
the fact that they are going that they
have a set schedule of days that they're
going to be releasing app updates this
is cool because they have days literally
designated say hey we are pushing it
update on this day every month so you
know the roadmap and you know when to
expect an app update I like that's I
like that alot really really cool
doesn't happen often enough I wish more
big like big app developers big name app
developers would do that right like
Microsoft does that they have patched
Tuesdays everybody knows they have patch
tuesday as everybody knows Tuesday
you're gonna get updates from Microsoft
right like they may be very object would
do it more often yeah at least on their
more popular apps you know we're going
to be updating it on a monthly or
bimonthly uh you know thing and then you
can have like a page that says we're
working on these features yada yada we
kind of cool um but yeah so in a
nutshell I think it's awesome for
Android I don't think Google's in any
trouble right now from this at all and
it's a new fresh type of look that
features can be implemented into other
apps yeah yeah alright so let's go on to
some rumors damn yeah so there's been
some Nexus 7 rumors or I guess nexus 7
to rumors um sources suggest that it's
probably have a better screen it
surprised the next generation to have a
better screen but it'll be a full 1080
screen which would be nice and
definitely a lot more pixel density that
has now the other big news is that it's
probably going to have a snapdragon
processor instead of an nvidia tegra
processor um I imagine part of that's
because the Tegra 4 won't be ready by
the june or july launch timeline that
google is looking for yes ma'am I
suspect it's probably else because they
want easy LCD compatibility no word on
the like which manufacturer it would be
built by yeah I didn't see anything
about that but it I mean I don't have
any reason to suspect it wouldn't be
aces they did a great job with
everything they did note in a very good
job of the last one um other big news
was the cortex a57 that's the next big
generation and a 64-bit
ARM processor architecture was taped out
by TSMC and arm on the 16 meter process
so there were a lot of different tech
blogs that are writing articles about
how it's ready for manufacture right now
that's not at all true they taped it out
I want to go with a 15 taste of like
they haven't fine-tuned did they ever
find it they've built one one time so
they're not at all close to ready to
start mass-producing 16 nanometer cortex
a57 processors they're looking at doing
that probably late 2014 early 2015 at
the soonest if not further out from
there right keep in mind the chips that
are shipping right now are still 28
nanometers before they get to 16 they
still have to drop to the 20 / 22 and
animator before they get down to 14 16
before they get down to 10 to 12 now
overall just for the viewers how does
nanometers affect performance battery
why is smaller better significantly it
impacts it significantly and it's it's
really just relatively simple math right
like you have to get power from point A
to point B at 40 nanometers point B is
further away it takes more power to get
to point B because it's further away it
is physically for another way so when
it's smaller it takes a lot less power
and it's a lot faster because it's
closer together so by shrinking it down
progressively it makes the entire
process more efficient more power
efficient more powerful you can push it
up to higher clock speeds with less
power and producing less heat so I mean
it's all around it's a huge benefit by
dropping process sighs cool um so big
news but big news for very far on the
horizon um other big news that's been
circulating is the Exynos 5 octa
apparently having a support for 20 LTE
bands according to samsung and so
everybody's been setting their hair on
fire about why does it the sgs4 have the
octa in the united states and all the
other ltd markets when it's getting it
with LTE in Korea
first apparently people have lost a
year's worth of hindsight because
Samsung did exactly the same thing last
year they released in X enos for
carrying international version and then
LTE version that had the Qualcomm
processor except in Korea where they
released an LTE one with the Exynos form
so they're doing the exact same thing
again um but the thing is that nobody
ever said the octa didn't support LTE or
any other XD most processor for that
they all support multi hey that's not
the problem they don't have integrated
LTE right so Samsung if they're going to
put the octa in it is still going to
have to buy an LTE radio from somebody
else most likely Qualcomm so when
they're already throwing money at
Qualcomm why that's been a little bit
more and get the better radio technology
that's in the newer processor great like
the act is going to be paired with
basically last year's LTE radio from
Qualcomm as opposed to the Snapdragon
600 that has this year's LTE radio from
snap turn from Qualcomm it's not
available as a discrete yet so that's
really the reason I don't think it's as
much about supply because Samsung has
some of the biggest and best fabrication
systems in the world and it's definitely
not a compatibility issue it's just wide
spend half the money for last year's
tech and sped up spending a little bit
more for better tech now the Hisense
pulse got updated to Google TV version
3.2 through do you can also install
amazon instant video and voice search
voice search is reported to be forced
closing for most people using the
built-in mic in the pulse remote
Nozick's yeah it does suck the newly
updated google TV remote app works fine
however and the update also includes ir
fixes and stability the clock actually
keeps time which is nice to good fix the
bottoms the d-pad is the best thing the
non swiping d-pad oh my god that used to
drive me nuts yeah speaking of
app updates of the google TV remote got
updated i believe this is the first
update believe yeah since its release
yeah I'm pretty sure I can't think of
any others yeah I can't either or maybe
it's just updated so infrequently that I
lost interest and thought voice search
support for Google TV three-point Oh
replaces the swiping d-pad to the normal
deep end yes like push button directions
not swiping and accidentally hitting the
ok button not doing what you want to
stare and then also added d-pad
navigation and added accessibility nice
update yeah I'm happy with that I do
want to see it more frequently though
but you know it definitely portends well
for the future that they're friendly
getting around change appt it's not
because obviously they finally has so
many somewhere pay attention to the
recent voice google voice chrome but
extension got updated which means
somebody Google is actually paying
attention to google voice mm-hmm and
then also google search got updated
basically you have a real time package
tracking from select carriers quick
feedback settings on cards so those
three dots for the menu on the cards
that's gone be gone we got the circle
with the i in it it's a little bit
easier to touch and you can also say hey
is this helpful or is it not again you
know figuring out your needs and what
kind of car do you like at what times of
the day and also faster google search
results droid-life actually did a video
on this comparing the two the old
version and the new version the new
version is not necessarily faster it
gives you more information quicker which
basically means you know how when you
search for something on the like google
now it would always
have the search results on the bottom
and you'd have to scroll down to get
them all right with the new update
they're actually up top so you see more
this is especially useful on tablets
because it's already there so it's
returning the results at the same speed
it's just making them accessible faster
it actually in the process of making
accessible faster it is a tad bit slower
because it's pulling more cleaning bill
it's pulling automation so bringing in
are essentially yeah used to be worth
something like search result from
non-existent though yeah I mean you
would just see a literal card and you
wouldn't see anything relevant but the
other kind of noxious top screen that
asks you if you would like to search the
internet to find the answer also the
launching of it is a lot faster
navigation through it as a lot faster
which you know everybody ninety percent
of the time is launching it and you know
you're doing it to get a quick answer so
launching speak it is definitely awesome
I mean is there anything else that they
add it to that um in the settings they
had it and a dedicated my stuff place
and where instead of having to go to the
actual card and edit the card itself
like when your sports teams and your
stocks and places and stuff like that
you have a dedicated place in settings
where you can set this stuff up now so
it's a little bit less confusing to
somebody that doesn't know the
difference between the contextual part
and the manual part yeah that is nice I
mean I do know the difference in I
thought it was confusing yeah exactly
especially new users especially yeah
then Diana have you been blinking no I
have it but Google is going to fork the
WebKit the little browser platform for
blink and call it blank rather so they
have have pretty much said that they're
going to wash their hands of apples BS
and fork the platform and do it
themselves better because right now it
doesn't really get updated so they've
pretty much said f you to apple and
they're going to build their own mobile
platform opera is also on board with
this so
that's you know that's different good
news other people are seeing the
problems with WebKit and looking for a
new solution samsung and mozilla though
are apparently working on their own new
browser engine for armed and they're
pushing hard on the optimized for harm
because apparently WebKit and blink and
several others don't run on arm so that
that was fairly confusing from them and
that's an odd pairing to work on a new
special browser since one of the two is
already a browser company so what does
this for mean does it mean faster
innovation doesn't mean google has their
way more more of the time does it mean
developers are gonna have to do
different things in order to do you know
do things yes yes and only if they want
to build a browser on top of it yeah
it's not going to change drastically for
web developers and yeah unless they
drastically change something down the
road but for Apple this isn't really a
good thing because Google was
contributing about fifty percent of the
code to WebKit and that is gone yeah
google said that if somebody wants to
contribute to web get in their spare
time to 32 but you know that's not yeah
Google is basically said they are fed up
with how slow the progression of WebKit
is Apple is bogging it down and so
they're going to take their coders and
Lee so yeah it definitely means that
it'll be faster development because it's
going to develop at the speed that
Google wants it to develop which is a
lot faster than what web kids guy and it
definitely means that there's going to
be new features as well because that's
the whole point as far as web developers
I mean they're still gonna be
subscribing to you no html5 standard
JavaScript etc etc etc they're like they
are changing the web standards so web
devs aren't going to really see a
difference um but if you're looking to
build a browser on top of this platform
yes you need to change your application
but the population of browser developers
you should always smell so that's not a
huge problem um in addition to that
there also is a big benchmarking up
release a 3d mark was released for
android and this provides really the
first two true
cross-platform benchmarking system so
3dmark is available on desktops
available on iOS it's available on
Android it's available on everything
it's not a mobile it's not supported for
every device but it is 380 Meg's so be
worried if you want to download it but
it is a very very robust been working
platform so good news that we can
finally get some really direct
comparisons of how is this device
comparing to that other device yeah cuz
before it's like Chief across platform
the best one to use was I think
geekbench move him it was all right all
right you didn't really track things the
right way behind the scenes 3dmark is
metal ring on this for a very long time
and they like they have really really
poor a lot into this and built it up
from the ground up as a specific
dedicated cross-platform benchmarking
system come to me I gotta those are the
reviews yeah we can finally get
realistic statistics about how does arm
compared to x86 for example uh-huh so ya
Scott tell us about some of the other
updates in Google App World Google sound
search comes to the UK which is really
nice they've been you know not part of
the party when it comes to searching for
songs and getting their content uh this
is nice yeah that works through google
deaf too right yes it does and yes you
don't have to like open the app or have
the widget you just pop up and cool down
start recording that is crisp I don't
know if you have to press the Search
button in order it to press the add like
the voice or maybe it just listened I
don't know I need to fit around that
maybe I actually tried it and then also
just today couple of hours ago the
YouTube app got updated you can quickly
access new uploads from your search
subscriptions using the my subscriptions
feed fixed a bug which caused some
accounts to periodically sign out I was
one of the people that was affected by
that he was annoying as heck
it was really really annoying also
YouTube one channel branding for video
creator channels and other big bug fixes
and stability improvements one thing I
can't get to happen is when I launch the
app I am NOT brought to my subscriptions
by default it's what to watch which is
like recommended videos I can't fix that
I looked in the settings and it's not
there so that sucks because they they
took away that feature like two releases
or three releases ago and then they
brought it back so I don't know if
they're going to be bringing it back but
that's an annoyance I believe if I'm
going to be open my youtube I want I
Suburbans or the option to ok let's go
on to some carrier news shall we yeah so
uh John there is some news coming out of
18 teen this week right yeah antes
basically amounts to things um they flip
the switch on LTE in 14 new markets kind
of various areas in the US and probably
the biggest ones worth noting or like
Mount Vernon and Washington Fresno
California but there are pressed a
little sprinklings in arkansas and
florida illinois Louisiana Missouri New
Mexico New York and Texas so uh if you
look on their website they'll give you a
pretty clear idea of where they just
flip the switch other also still
boasting that their LTE network is the
fastest of all of the available ones is
particularly against their rival verizon
but you could also say a lot of that's
because there aren't as many people on
it right now either
no one is speaking out a lot faster well
not to and there's even less people
although in in Minnesota in general this
the top end speeds it seems that AT&amp;amp;T is
on top with bra you know speed then it
comes verizon than t-mobile in certain
areas t-mobile just annihilates both
carriers which eventually will grow but
you call a carrier aggregation yeah but
yet another one's worth noting is AWS
LTE doesn't travel as far but it tends
to be a lot faster when you do get it if
you're in an area to get it yeah um I'm
having a team over right now is it's no
one like you're driving a car and like
you the car has to like it has a turbo
and you have to like wait for the turbo
to rev up to get power that is my
description right now of the t-mobile
network I don't know why that is but my
it's just like I don't get immediate
speed it's just you know like it has to
warm up yeah yeah it has damn do you get
that same thing I've seen it happen a
couple of times yeah I don't know what
it is just the way they throttle the
network where they don't give you more
power until you start demanding like
they don't give them more bandwidth
until you start demanding more bandwidth
but realistically is a smart way to
arrange it I don't know if this is
related to them but I do notice that on
my xperia ZL it stays on regular HSPA
until i start to use the data then it
hits the plus yes yeah i think it's i
mean it that's kind of the way that the
network is designed to work okay leave
it up to you feel that my name is that
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile have with their LTE
rollouts that the verizon and sprint
don't because they're using a gsm based
network underneath the way it's supposed
to work is your only your device is only
supposed to maintain a minimum level of
connection that it needs at that time
and only jump up what it needs more on a
cdma network you can't do that because
you have to admit it's a solid split
from one of the other whereas you can
kind of slide between gsm + wcdma
LTE very easily also i do want to
mention for you guys viewing that are
just coming in now we are giving away a
nexus 4 wireless charging orb as you can
see josh has right there beautiful
charging orb all you have to do is
comment on the Google+ post that this
show is live on and egg android
authority and we will then randomly
choose somebody that wins and next show
we will be announcing who won this or
abused in the review is that correct yes
the very orb that was used in the review
that i did for it kid does the phone I
don't have one personally does the phone
have to be on the wireless charging dock
in order to charge or can you keep it
like an inch away from what I can tell I
think an inch is pushing it a little but
if I hover like right over it it does
register like it doesn't happen to have
like direct contact no that's that's
what I've noticed and as far as what a
couple people did say about the fact
that the phone can slip off of it that
hasn't happened to me yet so it's kind
of magnet right no it's rubber so it
literally sits there and yeah some
people have been complaining that after
about a month of usage it will just slip
right off all the time so what happens
if you you know phone if you put the
phone like half a half an inch away from
the charging work and then you put your
finger in between do you feel shacks no
okay it was worth it was worth the try
like a few John right now I need to get
one to experiment something um no
notable thing that AT&amp;amp;T announced with
their plans that HD Voice will start
they'll start rolling out support for
the technology later on this year and I
know this that's not surprising
especially as they're building out their
LTE network is big this is this is
something to with Carmen because there's
ever a higher version they're starting
on a higher revision of LTE but living
it he's kind of having
great to go to that and they're
eventually going to have to upgrade for
lte-advanced too so this will you know
it'll be a good thing especially for
voice quality because that's one thing
that AT&amp;amp;T is really being hammered over
in the last couple years but this is in
forever this is in the plans for all of
the carriers verizon AT&amp;amp;T sprint and
t-mobile are eventually going to go to
this because everything is going to be
done over the LTE network and in the
future because it's cheaper it costs
them yep like 12 what it does to keep
operating all these networks yea though
you know it's going to be a nice thing
for the users but it's especially going
to be nice for the carriers because
their operating costs is going to drop
like a rock yeah question less in oshawa
um question is this going an
international giveaway or Google us Oh
anybody can anybody can enter ok so the
vendor move on Mars we will pay for that
shipping um yes only if you can get the
message here but if but yes you are toad
has to be more code but if you are on
Morris tell us how the hell to get up
there man seriously yes please please in
this direction shipping direction
foremost we need the blueprints right
now and use gmail blue to give it to us
only in gmail bliss yeah gmail blue blue
prints from Mars will be good deal um
continuing on what carrier terrier stuff
Ariane yes level also has some carrier
news they for the first time in last
four years finally gain subscribers this
quarter on their branded service so if
they gained about three thousand
subscribers over the last three months
which definitely is not an impressive
number but when you consider it's the
first time in four years that gain
subscribers it's very impressive and I'm
when you've rolled yeah when you roll in
all of their their virtual network
providers they gained around a half a
million subscribers this year so they
really offered this corner so they
really are starting to go in the right
door
that's all before their brand new
uncarrier strategy with their no
contract plans and directly subsidized
by devices independently of your service
plan what what carriers are you guys on
Josh I know your verizon John your
verizon Dan my t-mobile they'll have a
have an off-contract a prepaid plan with
tmobile actually okay how do you guys
like team all-conquering I mean it's
awesome I can move whenever I want ya
know i'm a big fan of it especially with
devices like nexus is coming up for his
cheapest $350 or three hundred dollars
um yeah all didn't come out with you
know yeah so i can get a new device
relatively whenever i want without
having to worry about the contract
locking yep and I'm really woody wife
knows the prices are pretty good yeah
yeah the the web only deal i think that
they have four thirty dollars get you
like 200 minutes unlimited text and five
gigabytes have uh throttled look at data
so that's it really is good with
unloaded tethering out of that
yeah i think so yeah and then if you
unlimited plan but you have to
separately get tethering plans which
seems kind of fair it does for their
networks inc go ahead cuz if it were
that way i would wait for LTE to come
here and get my table Verma hide
landline provider for internet I guess
it's it's really the prices i give it a
big push up because when it comes to
verizon i'm pretty much game the same
stuff i'm paying 50 instead of thirty
dollars and is like two gigabytes of ram
I'm just yeah instead of five a lot more
yeah yeah the newer commander t mobile
news metropcs investors are looking like
they may revolt against the merger
really when it comes down to is they're
complaining the deutsche telekom isn't
going to pay off their being offered
about three dollars less than per share
then the company is currently worth so
they're kind of like to be feeling a
little snob by getting shortchanged by
three bucks to share uh and then in
other kind of legal news Apple bounced
back path that's the 381 Pat was finally
invalidated by the US patent trade
office which isn't to say that it's the
end of that patent Apple can still
appeal it but chances of it not a chance
of ever winning an appeal are very very
small at this point of course that was
one of the patents that Sampson was
found to be infringing and you know
every single device it was one of the
patents the jury specifically said oh no
we didn't bother considering prior art
because that was too hard and yeah hire
are just invalidated the path we're
still the prior art was from the same
patent owner right like Apple can't
claim to know oh we didn't know there
was prior art because the prior art that
you use to invalidate it was from an
Apple employee mm-hmm so really really
bad for Apple um meanwhile Apple is
begging the judge to let them move
forward with the partial retrial for
damages in the Samsung case basically so
they can use all of this evidence that's
probably going to get struck down on
appeals to convince another jury to love
lee a large settlement against samsung
so they can brag about it to the press
before everything gets tossed out on top
here because it's increasingly looking
like everything's gonna fall apart for
them out of p if the longer it takes the
because there are so many pens they have
under investigation right now for yeah
we consider if they smart to stretch
this out really really very smart and it
was a good legal yeah g him the face of
everything that they lost as far as
money which really wasn't that big of a
loss for them because they're making a
metric ton of money right now such a
quarter the only bad thing is that the
damage to samsung was realistically not
necessarily money but reputation and it
said
retrial isn't going to paint impact that
reputation no no an appeal won't either
meanwhile until the appeal gets handed
down apples running around the world
saying Samsung copycat and telling other
judges in other places around the world
Samsung's but already been found guilty
of a copying us on all this stuff and
meanwhile it's it's all a house of cards
the judge didn't really do her due
diligence cuz this should have been
obvious going into it um so I mean it's
all falling apart right like this was
was one of the patents that everything
was found to be infringing so all the
devices that weren't just sent back for
pretrial are now going to have to have
their damages we looked at because this
patent wasn't valid in the first place
and just like the first chunk that got
flipped because the jury didn't actually
say we're assigning X amount of dollars
for this particular infringement and
ximeno dollars for did that particular
infringement they just said oh you know
this about for that device and that
amount for that device they're gonna
have to retry everything anyway so I
mean it's just falling apart for Apple
and looking worse and worse um other
legal news that's also kind of funny
asus settled their class action lawsuit
over the transformer prime people are
still apparently complaining about the
GPS issues in the device I own one and
still had never encountered this problem
ah but they have ever ever never then
again I don't use my Wi-Fi only tablet
as a GPS device why don't you it's the
best thing you can do i I just hadn't
really occurred to go walking around
with it have a problem your phone it
already has GPS yeah yeah like why on
earth protects my Wi-Fi only 10 inch
tablet into the wilderness is my gps
device we only find the wilderness but
you know surrounding neighborhood just
be funny to see people like this walking
on yeah like seriously but yeah so they
have settled the class action lawsuit
for 17 Mel's a customer and a free gps
Tom that's bridge of us don't know by
the way they were already giving away
for free
yeah but you get that seventeen dollars
and the GPS down version dollars was
covering the shipping that originally
they were making people pack and that
dongle looks weird it does and i'll use
the dock yeah in other news jellybean
update android for dot one that too is
now rolling out to AT&amp;amp;T LG optimus g we
got review up air on inra 3.com also
chrome for android the stable channel
got updated autofill and password sync
standard performance and stability
stability improvements good the stable
channel suck and it was very slow good
to see some trickle down from the beta
channel beta channel awesome running a
lot quicker the one problem i have is if
i'm on a website i have to click like
back like three times in order to
actually exit the app kind of knowing
and then also in bigger news the Play
Store now has accessories available in
the US UK Canada and Germany you get a
wall charger micro USB cable and a set
of earbuds with a built-in microphone
the wall adapter is sixteen dollars
pretty expensive the micro USB cables
ten dollars and the earbuds are twenty
dollars pretty interesting and it's
definitely showing that Google really
wants to expand the Play Store devices
and accessories so they can derive more
people better and eventually you know
attract more people that install apps
and music all that stuff we guys think
about accessories I wonder how those if
I'm looking at them right now actually
the earbuds I wonder how good those
would because i'm not i wouldn't call
myself an audio file but i'm very
interested in like carrier branded stuff
to see if they're actually good like
people hated the original apple earbuds
and then they make actually near ones
and they were a lot better i'm curious
what these are the only twenty bucks
that's actually
yeah no I mean good the thing that
annoys me about it is that when Isis
been out for how long and you're just
now putting out accessories yeah yeah
like seriously get it together launch
the accessories for the device with the
device not six months later nobody wants
the accessory six months later they
wanted them six months ago mm-hmm such
as long as they're looking after party
what said generally accessories are made
by third parties anyway it's not like a
delay with the Nexus itself is gonna
hurt the accessories like we're plan
ahead higher proper planning the biggest
the biggest pain is still the nexus 7
dock that that thing is ever no I'm
never gonna own one I don't they know
why one now in the nexus 7 2 is gonna be
on sale like a week that's true if the
Nexus 7 Tuesday will be out like next
Christmas that's true this talk is
compatible with the next Nexus 7 then i
buy one that'd be pretty cool but
there's a lot of stock I just looked
stylish now well in that case I'll wait
till they come up with one that has an
hdmi port because that would actually
make it useful mm-hmm well so pretty
things though I think I want to actually
get that the earbuds with the voice
thing anyone has seriously Elyon maybe
do a review what dollars for micro USB
cable so yeah there it's the new hdmi
era where you pay eight hundred dollars
for a one foot cable of hdmi well but
you can get what it was I really made by
monster yeah made by monster
eight-hundred-dollar OS for dinner Wow
you can go into like a weed islanders
going any can still get multiple dirty
dollars on amazon yeah some people like
more expensive things though that do the
exact same thing yes those people died
things from appleton hey let's be nice
just for posterity sake the nexus 10
page has no accessories on it just
saying
what a shock yeah to be fair Samsung's
not really good about getting
accessories out for their own devices
either hmm then I'd love a dog for the
Nexus tend to be honest random have one
so i made the blunt why would you want
one just to have it on this like in the
corner of my desk there you know i
remember when i first got the nexus 10
and i was reviewing it in my in my
review I kept saying i watch netflix and
movies on this thing all the time so
just have it on the side and not have to
worry about standing it up this room at
a dock that launched women tablet
launched and it was an Android
experience device at a good alarm clock
like that though you could use your
tablet and the speakers were really loud
and it could be by your bed and you
could put alarm on very true though I
wouldn't be very happy if I was mad
about waking up and I smack my next 10
of it so I can definitely see that
happening be easier with the nexus 4 you
know even if it's on a level surface
mm-hmm nexus 4 slipper phone broke my
411 well they got those nipples now yeah
but mine don't have nipples I want
nipples here first good does a crippled
sky um yeah also uh Patrick Tremblay
maybe Google should release accessories
on device launched yes yeah they
freaking should that is a lot to be
helpful if on the Vice launch they had
enough devices to launch no no no that
is all part of supply and demand and
it's part of the game and if you're not
first you will be waiting so I don't
think that'll ever change date night
hope I mean the big problem is I don't
think google expected the man they got
they didn't have this plant meet it yeah
maybe their order with just you know few
hundred thousand boy they they told
everybody with the Galaxy Nexus sales
numbers were they were pathetic they
sold like I think 1 million of them I
mean if you're making such a small they
didn't make that a nexus 4 is because
they didn't expect many people to buy
them because the thing is they're about
that many Nexus is before your profit
margin is so small that means it the
more devices that you
just or order means higher risk so if
you you know are making five hundred
dollars like Apple is on every device
then you know that you can order a crap
ton because you know that if you sell
one of them you're going to pay for
fifteen of them so you know yeah that's
kind of another thing as well that's
true yeah yeah they need to get better
at predicting market demand or will n
retail single they're not good at
predicting anything because Google now
is horrible right just that's hideous so
I think we're going to wrap do we have
any questions from the audience on
google+ or youtube any any questions
about facebook home are you going to use
it would you really make it part of your
life dan if you heard of issue sees
