by bitdefender mobile security wearable
tech is a booming part of the mobile
space and we award this year's best
wearable to the device out of Samsung's
camp that definitely turned a lot of
heads the Samsung gear fit takes parts
of the gear smartwatch and quite
literally turns it on its side to create
a hybrid Fitness wristband the first
thing you'll notice about the gear fit
is it's incredibly vibrant and enjoyable
flexible o LED display of which can be
outfitted into a replaceable band with
Fitness in mind that the gear fit comes
with a heart rate monitor and many apps
to track not only your lap times but
also to track your overall fitness
however to make sure that you don't miss
out on what your phone is doing the gear
fit is able to receive and preview
notifications also while allowing
control of your media applications the
device looks very sleek and doesn't take
up too much space on your wrist while
remaining easy to use with an adjustable
wristband by merging the best of both
worlds and stylish and vibrant fashion
the Samsung gear fit gets are not for
best wearable tech the tablet game was
absolutely booming at mwc and three
different devices really caught our eye
the first to receive our award was the
Lenovo yoga tablet 10 HD plus a sleek
and portable offering that elegantly
provided a solution to a common tablet
gripe to eliminate the need for a
third-party stand or accessory to prop
up your tablet the enlarged bottom
portion of the tablet that houses the
large battery also has a built-in stand
that helps it stand upright for easy
viewing or at a lower angle for easier
typing despite its added function the
tablet remains very sleek with a metal
finish and now packs a full HD display
with an updated snapdragon processor to
bring good performance you can enjoy at
any angle our second tablet award was
given to the huawei mediapad x1 while it
might not see much penetration in
various markets around the world we
commended huawei for packing in full
phone call and SMS capabilities into one
of the best looking and handling 7-inch
tablets around perhaps what we found
most enjoyable about the x1 was its
display which sports very small bezels
in what is actually one of the thinnest
and lightest tablets we've had the
pleasure of handling and when you really
need it you can answer that important
phone call or respond to that important
text all from the same device arnaud
goes to huawei for bringing the phone
into a very nicely built tablet
experience the last tablet award went to
sony for their update to one of last
year's best 10-inch tablets the Sony
Xperia tablet Z to the previous xperia
tablet z was one of our favorite devices
of last year with its black slate highly
angular design that was not only
powerful but also water-resistant and
this year we find it's update even
better than the original the same duel
glass finish and sturdy frame have now
been lightened making this one
incredibly nimble 10-inch tablets the
corners have also been slightly rounded
out eliminating any rigid feel you may
have had with the previous offering an
updated version of Sony's Xperia U I
brings even more optimizations into a
tablet that might have already been good
but has just gotten even better and as
we move into the phone awards we start
off with the best budget smartphone and
that is undoubtedly the alcatel one
touch idol to the update to the original
idol brings a bigger better display and
more power to the already affordable
package the 5-inch display comes with
720p resolution for good viewing a
MediaTek processor brings 1.2 gigahertz
to the smooth handling interface and
expandable storage is always welcome on
the phone that comes in at the sub 200
price points but truthfully what struck
us most was the great build quality well
you might initially think is a metal
finish is actually non glossy plastic on
the back that opts for an understated
but still very attractive form factor
you might not be able to tell right off
the bat that this is a very affordable
device and that is exactly what helped
put the idol too over the top in the
budget category now from the budget we
move on to the mid-range and a phone
with incredible style from HTC has taken
the crown the HTC Desire 816 just might
be trying very hard to not be a
mid-range device but we're not
complaining about some of the flagship
features that come built-in coming in a
very easy handling 5.5 inch form factor
due to the smooth rounded sides and a
glossy plastic back panel is a
Snapdragon 400 clocked in at 1.6
gigahertz backed by one and a half
gigabytes of ram we might not have been
able to show you the quality of the 5.5
inch 720p display but we can tell you it
is definitely a great performer and even
further bucking the mid-range trend is a
13-megapixel rear-facing camera that is
complemented by an industry-first a
5-megapixel front-facing camera to help
you get the best self portraits or 720p
resolution video as possible we're very
excited to get our hands on the HTC
Desire 816 in the near future as it is
our best mid-range device of mwc we blow
it up to the large form factors to bring
you our best phablet of mwc the LG G pro
2 as the update to the very well
received optimus g pro that came just a
year ago at mwc as well the g pro 2
takes inspiration from the LG g2 while
introducing a few new enhancements of
its own the 5.9 inch display might be
larger for some people but we still
didn't find it that hard to handle
underneath the vibrant and great screen
experience as the Snapdragon 800
powering a full-featured user interface
that brings a few new additions to the
table mainly the NOC code which allows
you to tap the screen in standby mode
via a set pattern to wake up and unlock
the phone easily the g pro 2 also has a
camera that sports the updated o is plus
capabilities making its picture some of
the best and sharpest we've seen on any
phone big phone means big features and
the LG G pro 2 thus deserves the crown
of best phablet of mwc and finally we
have the best flagship device and has
the new flagship phone by samsung that
brings a lot of new to the table while
managing to still feel incredibly
familiar the galaxy s5 gets our award
for best flagship smartphone a new
design for the back does away with a
glossy plastic that plagued earlier
models and opts for a perforated
material that not only stops
fingerprints but helps with the feel top
processing power keeps the updated
TouchWiz UI with my magazine second
screen about as smooth as it has ever
been while powering new features like
the fingerprint scanner and the built-in
heart rate monitor on the back but what
might be the most talked-about addition
is the camera as it sports the first 16
megapixel ISO cell technology that could
be used for features like say lack of
focus and real-time HDR for what might
be one of the best smartphone camera
experiences to date it's definitely the
phone that everyone is talking about one
way or another and it gets our award for
the best flagship phone of mwc but we
would be remiss if we didn't mention the
runner up to the best flagship simply
because it does deserve recognition has
the very close second the Sony Xperia z2
while Samsung might continue to add to
their general formula
Sony continues to refine there's two
great results the Xperia z2 moves to an
IPS display that provides the best in
class viewing angles we always knew the
Xperia line could offer and its smaller
bezels helped create one of the most
attractive and easiest handling Xperia
experiences to date especially with the
lighter body and even more improved
built with an optimized 20.7 megapixel G
lens camera to boot there was a lot to
be excited about with the Xperia z2 and
we are right there with our own
excitement over it the only real
unfortunate part of the Sony Xperia z2
is the fact that it's not going to
penetrate as many markets as we know the
Samsung Galaxy s5 will it does deserve
to be out in as many markets as possible
but until that happens we have to give
the Sony Xperia z2 the runner-up
position and so there you have it for
the best of the mobile world congress of
2014 mwc undoubtedly had a lot of
blockbuster announcements and they all
make 2014 look very bright for the
smartphone tablet and wearable spaces
reviews of all these devices will come
as they are released so make sure you
keep it tuned to android authority

things android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
