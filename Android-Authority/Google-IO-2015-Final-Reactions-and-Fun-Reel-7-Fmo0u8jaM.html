every single year it's incredibly fun
not only to be a part of this community
that is full of developers and you can
see all of them down there actually
there's a class going on right next to
me right now so we're trying to be just
a little bit quiet but ultimately it's
really fun and it shows how much we
Google really loves the developers and
really shows how much they want to take
care of them I mean you'll see in the
fun wheel that's going to follow after
the speaking part just how there are
there's like a big old playground on the
second floor which is right behind me
and you have everything from arcade
machines to beanbag chairs to swings and
seesaws and everything they just really
wanted to create like this fun
environment for everybody but of course
that is not just that's only part of
what Google i/o really is Google i/o on
the other hand is all about what is
coming for the upcoming year and we
though it might not be quite as big as
Google i/os from the past there is
actually still a lot to be excited about
here and at the keynotes we've got
basically a look into what would be the
Polish of Android which a lot of people
probably do agree is sorely needed and
Android M we're really excited to
finally get our hands on that maybe a
little bit later this year aside from
that however Google photos is something
we're going to be you
a lot over the next however so many
months and probably afford the
foreseeable future because you'll be
able to get unlimited updates and
unlimited uploads I should say of your
photos and videos but from there the
keynote was pretty uneventful actually
we had some protesters last year come
out of there come out at the keynote out
of nowhere so this year like the
security was really ramped up there were
metal detectors and the entrances and
because of that nothing really happened
which turned out to be really nice and
it was pretty much a more laid-back I oh
I would have to say it wasn't really
centered around any one product or
device I should say was the center that
around any one device that they were
really hoping to decide or sort of get
out there because obviously an Android
at this point in 2015 we have so many
new devices that really already give the
experiences and or high-end and give
everything that the users might want so
it's now about refining those
experiences but really the big story out
of here for me was cardboard and you can
see the motif around here there's brown
everywhere it's almost like this wooden
look all over the place in the way and
but way back over there you have that
look as well but the reason why it is
because you guessed it cardboard
cardboard is getting a huge focus this
year not only because it is a very easy
to put together and a very affordable
platform but also because it's going to
be used as a VR platform for not only
people to enjoy things on YouTube via
the jump program but also because it's
going to take an educational standpoint
you're going to get the expedition's and
I did a video on that as well where kids
can actually observe and experience and
be
immersed and be a part of all of these
things that they should be learning from
otherwise their textbooks and maybe
through like video documentaries and
those things might become a thing of the
past at least to some extent because
expeditions is actually really really
cool and then I did also did a video on
the atap project project jacquard where
circuits on circuits but they say the
little chips are actually connected to
the specific stitching of particular
clothing and those can be actually used
for inputs as well as biometric readings
I say biometrics because we already have
clothing that that does those sort of
things but now you can also add on top
of that the ability to get input or to
control things like your phone or
anything else and there were some demos
on that as well but really Google i/o is
every single year a great little stamp
on the middle of the year showing where
we're going and where we've come from in
this particular year and in 2015 we've
had some really great Android iterations
already and Google is just continuing to
make all of those ecosystems better and
bolstering other ones as well
so to all these developers that are
behind me it's all of you that are
watching I hope you guys all enjoyed my
coverage of Google i/o what follows this
will be a fun reel so I could just show
you maybe just a couple maybe two to
four minutes of some fun stuff that's
not only here but also the After Hours
party that I went to last night all of
which that footage was shot on the
galaxy s6 edge so I just so you guys
kind of know that when you see the
footage and why it's a little bit
different from the ones I have here but
in any case thank you guys very much for
watching make sure you drop us some
likes on our video subscribe to our
channel if you haven't already and
remember to check out all the other
content that I made here at Google i/o
because we are your source for all
things Android see you later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
