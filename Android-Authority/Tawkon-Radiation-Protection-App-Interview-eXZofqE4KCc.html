android authority I'm here with a very
kind gentleman named Gil Friedlander is
the co-founder and CEO talk on which has
some very cool technology that has to do
with SAR another forms of measurement
I'll let you live very little further
but i want to thank you very much for
your time today sir so pleasant Darcy I
think great being here yes sir a bit
about technology so talk on is a mobile
application it's an android app that you
can download for free for your android
phone once you downloaded it runs in the
background and detects when mobile
radiation from your own phone spikes
during a call once we detect these
spikes we will provide you vibration or
subtle alerts during the calls and if
you look for a moment at the screen you
will get a tailored suggestion telling
you how to talk on continue the call and
avoid that radiation and it could be
changing your locations moving a few
feet aside it could reduce dramatically
the exposure to radiation connect an
earpiece a Bluetooth or use the speaker
so distancing the phone from their head
very simple suggestions that allow you
to avoid these radiation pieces so you
mentioned that these only really
occurred you know at specific intervals
and if you
use the best practices I think you can
avoid the pitfalls of over exposing
yourself to radiation is very true so
it's it's important to say that from our
statistics about ninety percent of the
time your phone emits low signals and so
very low radiation about five or ten
percent of the time there are these
Peaks specifically when you're in an
elevator or in a basement okay sometimes
within a car or a train interesting we
let you know and alert you when these
radiation pics occurred during a call
and we also see that if we are able to
save you one minute of high radiation
during a call it's equivalent to five
hours of exposure low radiation so if we
let you know when it happens and save
you that short terms it's very dramatic
on your radiation absorption and so I
saw on your blog that you can part
listing essentially the top 10 worst
offenders in terms of Sao what is SAR
stand for and is the FCC or any
governing bodies do they have consumers
sort of bodies at best heart is in do
they do the testing in their labs to
determine the phone is not saved for
sale or so the FCC's set a standard for
the maximum radiation absorption that is
allowed for the phone it's called saw it
stands for specific absorption rate the
maximum level is 1.6 wats 2 kilogram
okay if a manufacturer does not comply
with that a threshold it could not a
market his
phone what users are not aware that
phones differ dramatically in their
maximum level of sorrow so you can buy a
low emitting phone or a high emitting
phone on average the old blackberries
are the highest emitting phones with
this sour which is almost 1.55 it's
almost the max the iphone is kind of
average around one yeah the Samsung
androids are very low around 0.3 so this
is something that you're concerned with
or you want to take some precautionary
measures go and purchase a low phones
are so you how long is talk on been
around for and how many apples and users
do you have so talk on has been around
over three and a half years we have with
our new version over a million downloads
and it's going very very fast yes a good
retention and great feedback from the
users or think four point four stars on
the android market that was very good
right now so what what carriers made the
greatest man aration radiation per
capita in the world if you will what
carriers or handset manufacturers use me
handset manufacturers so so the highest
ones or blackberry a Apple is kind of
the average and Samsung or one of the
lower ones did you have any time to test
the z10 yet we didn't test it yet but we
do see we do know the official test
results of their
phone and they're doing a much better
job now in reducing their sorry missions
yeah so now you mentioned up when we
were talking before the wh 0 you know
which is really a very respected you
know government body obviously is this
something that they're taking the heart
and taking seriously the proliferation
of mobile devices is it's almost absurd
yeah so you know technology is great and
the value that mobile phone is bringing
us is really amazing yeah we would never
want to forget have let them go and and
it's important to say that science is
not conclusive yet about the health
impacts of mobile radiation with that
said many research bodies are saying
that there is issue that it may cause
cancer lower sperm count for males a
cognitive issues Wow the World Health
Organization which is the most reputable
body in this area last year classified
non-ionizing radiation that mobile phone
emit as a possible carcinogen yes now
it's not definitive yet but it means
that more research needs to be
undertaken and it does suggest to
undertake precautionary measures so to
try to minimize mobile radiation as much
as possible target is a great tool that
provides you alerts and very simple
tools of how to minimize that radiation
obviously technology is not going
anywhere so we need to have how to grow
with it and so deal with it and the fact
that you're working towards this end you
know it almost feels like you're the
protector consumers of all technology
and they're sort of you hope to see
ourselves in that way yeah very much
that's why I wanted to say thank you
very much for your time today perfect
doors will stay in touch and I really
appreciate your time Salah lender the
pleasure this talk on here check out the
android app you care of what radiation
in your head but the best practices that
you can employ thank you very much guys
as android authority here live on the
ground at Mobile World Congress parcel
oh thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
