Authority and we're taking a quick look
at last year's test of an edge and
comparing it to the newly announced
Galaxy s8 plus the edge moniker is gone
because both versions of s8 this year
have curved edge screens but the s8 plus
would more or less be the direct
successor to the s7 edge it's an
evolutionary upgrade but it's another
step forward in samsung's approach to
reaching that bezel this feature that we
all dream about the bezels on the s8
plus are dramatically thinner than the
s7 edge which makes way for an even
larger 6.2 inch screen over the 5.5 inch
of the s7 edge these shrunken down
bezels allows the screen to truly be the
center of attention and it looks
absolutely stunning this also means no
more Samsung logo in the front and
because there's more screen Samsung's
long time signature home button and
capacitive keys have been swapped out
for on-screen keys with the home button
gone the fingerprint sensor has been
moved to the back but instead of sitting
squarely in the middle below the camera
where we normally see rear-facing
fingerprint sensors it sits awkwardly to
the side of the camera which at the
moment doesn't feel quite as friendly
it's definitely going to take some
getting used to but in addition to that
the s8 plus brings back the iris scanner
for an alternate way of unlocking the
phone the s8 pluses design picks up
right where the s7 edge left off you
still have a metal frame with front and
rear glass panels and while the s7 edge
is still a very sleek device the s8 plus
refines the design even further with a
more rounded and curvier body it's
incredible how smooth and comfortable it
feels and it certainly doesn't feel as
big in the hand as you initially might
think from a phone with a 6.2 inch
screen the screens on both the s8 plus
and s7 edge are AMOLED displays as you
would expect from Samsung at this point
but with the s8 plus Samsung has gone to
an 18 and 1/2 by 9 aspect ratio which
makes the screen narrower and taller and
it's partly why it's more manageable in
one hand this also results in more
pixels on the long side of the display
but it's still considered a quad HD
screen from a hardware perspective the
camera on that state plus is practically
the same as the one on the S of an edge
it's 12 megapixels with F 1.7 aperture
and the crazy fat dual pixel autofocus
but Samsung says there's been
improvements made to the camera software
and image processing and the eight
megapixel front camera now features
autofocus the si plus swaps out the
micro USB port of the s7 edge for USB
type-c but other features we
like ip68 dust and water resistance
wireless charging expandable storage and
you still have a headphone jack thank
goodness
now all the phone got bigger the battery
on the other hand got smaller but only
slightly it's now 830 500 milliamp hour
battery instead of the 3600 I was in the
s7 edge which I doubt will make a
significant difference and after the
note 7 debacle Samsung's most likely
doing this a place safe the SI plus runs
Android nuga out of the box with a
vastly improved user experience that's
much cleaner and easier on the eyes over
the what now feels outdated TouchWiz
skin of the s7 edge but the big standout
feature and trending smartphone feature
is the s8 plusses AI assistant called
Bixby
it also has Google Assistant on board
but like many of samsung's previous apps
or features this is meant to compete
directly with Google's and because it's
Samsung's own AI it's very heavily
integrated into the software and core
functions of the phone to change the way
you interact with your device
there's even a dedicated hardware key on
the side for quick access and what we
can only assume is designed to encourage
us to use bixby as far as specs go the
s7 edge has the snapdragon 820 and 4
gigs of ram and with the s8 plus being
the new device it's obviously going to
have newer specs
it's an octa-core processor with 4 gigs
of RAM as the world's first 10 nanometer
chipset according to the Samsung Samsung
has a broken amuse on the specifics of
the processor just yet but if history is
any indication it'll be the latest
Snapdragon processor in the US and X
knows for the rest of the world even
though this is an evolutionary update
the changes are rather significant and
the s8 plus is shaping up to be a beast
of a smartphone so if you want to know
more about the s8 plus or the regular
Galaxy s8 keep it tuned here to the
