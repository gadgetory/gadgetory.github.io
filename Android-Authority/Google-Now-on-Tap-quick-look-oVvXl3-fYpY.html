handy the Android authority app guy and
in this quick look video we're gonna
take a look at Google now on tap to
start with Google now on tap is actually
very easy to use to engage it simply
pull up the information you want now on
tap to analyze and then press and hold
the home button this will bring up now
on tap which after a few moments of
loading will display any information it
can about whatever it is that's on your
screen in card format below that is a
Google button that will simply open up
Google now once the card pops up you'll
have a few options and they're all
listed as icons across the bottom of the
card you can google it find images open
maps open social media pages and a whole
lot more how much information that's
available depends on the subject at hand
hockey players generally only have a
Google search button and images while
restaurants have plenty of other options
it works pretty well most of the time
and you can use it inside of
applications during our testing we used
it on Google newsstand at Google Plus
hangouts slack Google Chrome and a few
others now on top has no issues parsing
the information from each one and
delivering the results results are
generally easy to pull up as long as the
subject is clearly written for instance
Alex here asked me about halo 5 and now
on Todd was able to pull up a card for
Halo however when neurovascular Marble
Avengers movie it wasn't able to figure
out what it was supposed to be searching
for hilariously when you go to the IMDB
page for the Avengers now on top has no
issues pulling up a card about the movie
we found that there really are a ton of
results we found hockey players movies
actors fictional characters little
Chinese restaurants in New York City
Landmarks from Europe and a whole bunch
more there really is a lot more here
than we originally envisioned on the
other side of the spectrum there were
things we expected now on top to be able
to find easily to no avail it was able
to find the Galaxy Nexus from a text
message but nothing about the Nexus P
from an article title when you add it
all up it really is a case of your
mileage may vary if you only use it for
certain things than cards will almost
certainly pop up every time pulling up
now on top on every page that pops up on
your smart phone on the other hand will
likely not work the majority of the time
Google now on tap is for the most part
very impressive having the ability to
instantaneously glean information on
whatever happens to be on your screen is
both enjoyable and functional of course
there are some issues here and there and
the service
we'll likely get updated over time to
overcome these early flaws we imagine
many of them will be ironed out by the
time stable marshmallow starts making
its way around to everyone if you're
interested in getting now on tap you'll
need a device running marshmallow and
you'll need to be updated to the latest
version of the Google Play services as
well as the latest version of the Google
app it should start working from there
everyone else will have to wait and that
about does it for this video folks once
again I'm Johanna the Android authority
app guy and why you're here you might as
well subscribe to the Android Authority
YouTube channel because we are your
source for all things Android as always
thanks for watching everybody and have a
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
