Android authority now I'm sure you know
that Android is an open source project
that means all the source code is
available on the Internet and you can
download it and build your own based
version of Android now this means that
there are plenty of private individuals
hobbyist groups and even commercial
enterprises that use the open-source
code for Android to build their own
Android variation if you think about
signage and model sides and ink they are
probably the two most famous examples
now have you ever wondered how to
download and build Android make some
modifications and therefore produce your
own customized version of Android well
let me explain everyone we get any grand
visions of producing the next version of
Sandwich in modern we're going to just
modify Android so much let's just have a
reality check here Android is a
complicated and full operating system
and there is lots and lots of components
to it there's all with the lips kernel
and there are all the frameworks and
subsystems and different stacks that
need to do all the stuff that Android
can do then there's the user interface
on top of that and there's the core
applications on top of that I mean it's
big I mean the build space on my build
machine is 120 gigs so that just shows
you how much data there is involved in
building a vote about not all source
code by any means but it's a huge amount
of data so what we're going to do today
is do some very very simple things just
pitting step baby steps really just to
see the principles involved in building
and modifying androids ah you get your
own custom distribution now what we're
going to do is two things first of all
we're going to download and build the
Android source code using the Android
Open Source project and then once we
have that successfully flashed onto a
test device we are going to modify some
things about it and then flash that
modifications onto the test device to
see a variation of Android that we've
done using our own
fingers now before we get started we
must say there are some prerequisites to
this now what are the prerequisites you
need to have some command line knowledge
with let's on Linux with us on Mac OS 10
you really do need to have some command
line knowledge and that includes also
not only things like CD and LS and
change directory and all that kind of
stuff but also things like make and Java
compilers and just editing source code
from the command line if you don't have
that kind of knowledge then really
you're going to find this a bit of a
struggle but you have that knowledge if
you know what I make file is if you know
what a compiler is then this is going to
be fairly straightforward now Google
have got some great documentation on the
Android Open Source project website
about how you download and build the
Android Open Source project now I'm not
going to repeat in verbatim all the
things they've said there so a couple of
bits of advice first of all go and read
that documentation the link is here in
the description it's also over on the
Android chrome website with the article
that goes along with this video read it
then we in again and then when you think
you've read it again read it a third
time because if you skip over bits if
you don't register things and it's said
if you didn't understand something you
said it's going to make the whole build
process difficult but if you've absorbed
all of those build instructions if you
understand the principles are going on
you can be a whole lot easier for you
now the basic steps to building the
Android Open Source project are like
this first of all you need to have a
compatible build environment and that
means basically a Linux machine or a Mac
os10
machine now you're going to need quite a
bit of memory in hard disk space my Mac
has got eight gigs of memory and 120
gigabytes of disk space was put aside
for this build so you're going to need
those kind of
requirements to be able to download and
start the build process now once you
establish the build environment the next
step is to sync your local repository
with the repository without on the
incident and that's pretty huge for me
it took 24 hours so it's the kind of
thing you're going to run overnight and
maybe a bit longer and you're going to
see the results slowly but it is working
don't worry it is working it just takes
a long long time now once you've got the
source code once you've got the build
environment established you need to get
hold of the binaries now not all the
drivers for the different parts of these
Nexus devices are distributed our source
code now I've chosen to use a nexus 5x
really the nexus is the easiest devices
for building the AOSP project and the
binaries are available inside the
project repository need to download them
and unpack them inside of your build
environment now once you have the
binaries the source and the build
environment setup the next thing to do
is to choose the build type and you do
that using the lunch tool and then
you've got a whole bunch of options
there you just pick the one for your
particular device then once that's all
set up you can actually go ahead and
start the build process using make now
again this process can take quite a
while several hours again depending on
the performance of your machine so be
prepared to let this thing just churn
away in the background until it's
finished building the whole project and
then once you have a built firmware or
you get a success from that make command
you then need to make sure the or
bootloader is unlocked on your Nexus
device and then you can flash over the
new ROM onto the device now as I've said
the instructions are pretty good that
Google provide however there probably
are some pitfalls and some bumps that
you going to meet along the way and I've
done this whole process recently and
I've got over in the written article all
the different tricks and tips I learned
on how to make the build successful I'll
give an example is one stage during the
make process where I was constantly
running out of memory even though I've
got a gigabytes now there are ways
around that and I've got that listed
over in the article so please go and
read article because I always expect in
this recent process
has been dumped out there I think you'll
find that useful if you hit a barrier
during this build process now if you
make a download and build the firmware
and flash it on to your device first of
all congratulations well done that's a
big step in this process now the next
thing we're going to do is modify
Android so that we can say we have our
own custom very very slightly custom of
course but our own custom version of
Android and we going to do two things
first of all we're going to modify the
messaging app that's the app that's used
for SMS messaging just to be slightly
different something that we've added to
it ourselves and secondly we're going to
modify the Settings app so that we can
have the build name and the build number
of this rom inside of the settings okay
let's go ahead and modify the messaging
app what you need to do is you need to
change directory into packages apps and
then inside they need to find the
messaging app which is in packages app
messaging then drill down through source
comm Android messaging and edit the file
called bugle application Java now bugle
application Java is basically the entry
point into the messaging app now scroll
down art of a long list of import
statements you want to import the toast
widget and you do that using this line
of code now once you've added that in
now go down to the oncreate function
that's the function that's called when
the app is first started and add in
these two following lines of code
towards the bottom of the function
you they need to save that file CD back
up to the beginning of your working
directory the root of your working
directory and then start another make
and that will recompile the necessary
files and produce a new system image
which you can then flash on over to your
device now once it's flashed over at the
device reboots go into the meshing app
and you will notice that the first time
you open the messaging app a nice little
toast appears at the bottom saying
welcome it's a minor change but it just
shows you that we can modify the Java
code of these core apps and get them to
do the things that we won't want to do
now no self-respecting ROM would be
without its settings page that tells you
the name of the ROM maybe the name of
the author when it was built the version
number and so on we're just going to add
two fields to the setting page in the
about phone section to just talk about
the name of our ROM and the version
number so to do that you need to go into
packages apps settings res XML and find
the device info settings XML file and
then right down at the bottom just
before the preference screen close tag
you need to add in these lines of code
now as you can see they basically give
us a preference we talked about the
wrong name whiz-bang pop ROM and the ROM
build number seven point zero point one
I get you to follow the same process
save that file go back up to the root of
your working directory rebuild the
Android Open Source project flash it
over onto your device and then when it
reboots
go to settings go to about phone and
you'll see those two new fields that you
have added in there well done now it was
like it add as a caveat that's really a
hack what I've just done there with the
settings page really all strings need to
be defined in strings.xml under each of
the individual languages that are
supported by your wrong these are
hard-coded strings it's the wrong way to
do it but it's the quickest way to show
you for this video if you're going to do
any serious open source Android project
development then you need to make sure
you do it right you
rings dot XML now let me just emphasize
that what we've done here are some very
simple changes however the principles
are exactly the same you modify the Java
code or you modify the XML for the
layout and for the user interface and
you make it you compile it and then you
flash it on to your test device now
again we've made some very small
modifications however with more work and
more effort you can make a more and more
customized version of Android well my
name is Gary Simms from anger Authority
I hope you enjoyed this video if you did
please do give it a thumbs up also don't
forget to subscribe to handle
authorities youtube channel definitely
download the endless royalty app because
that is a great place to get all the
latest news and features directly on
your mobile phone and also never forget
to visit and refer calm because we are
your source for all things Android
now I'm glad you what hits into the
video because I want to tell you I've
now got a new green screen what do you
think about my new green screen please
tell me in the comments you think I
should use it more in the future use it
less I'd love to hear what you think
because a new thing for me and I'm just
playing around with it your opinion
