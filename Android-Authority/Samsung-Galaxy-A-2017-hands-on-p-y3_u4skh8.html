features from the galaxy s7 at a lower
price point where should you buy them
what's up guys is not with our hands on
the galaxy a series 2017
this year's handsets don't overhaul a
lot from previous years with Samsung
opportune to borrow specific galaxy s
features to improve the overall
experience
the first of these is the design with
all three galaxies a models borrowing
the curved 3d glass ray and mineral
bezel from last year's flagships all
three models also borrow the galaxy DNA
with ip68 certification for
waterproofing anomalies on display
microSD card expansion and a long
lasting battery that's the similarities
but the difference is also crucial with
varying specs across the galaxy a3 and
a5 that we have here as well as the
galaxy a7 which isn't coming to the UK
the a3 and a5 spot what something is
calling an advanced camera with the a3
offering a 13 megapixel where an 8
megapixel front camera while the a5 has
a 16 megapixel camera on the front and
the back both come with F 1.9 aperture
and the galaxy a5 also has phase
detection autofocus for lightning fast
focus times one particularly useful
feature is a floating shutter which
allows you to drag the shutter button
anywhere on the screen in a bid to solve
this problem of clamping your thumb when
trying to take a selfie the camera also
has a swipe UI so you can swipe up or
down to flip between the cameras swipe
left to change modes and swipe right to
change effects both handsets are powered
by a quad core Exynos processor with the
a3 sporting 16 gigabyte storage and to
gigabytes of RAM while the a5 features
32 gigabytes of storage and 3 gigabytes
of RAM both hands has come with USB C
port as well as a fingerprint sensor
which is builded into the home button
beneath the screen the a3 is powered by
a 2,350 milliamp hour battery while the
a5 has a much beefier 3000 milliamp hour
battery available in four colors black
sky gold sand blue mist and peach cloud
these handsets offer a touch of the
flagship Galaxy S experience at a much
more affordable price point at 279
pounds for the a3 and 369 pounds to the
a5 in the UK they both have pretty stiff
competition
they do offer a glimpse of the overall
galaxy's experience for half the cost or
less so what do you think of the galaxy
a 2017 series and do you plan to buy
them let us know in the comments below
