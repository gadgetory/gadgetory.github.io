system have come a very long way but
sometimes it's nice to look back and
revisit your roots now that might sound
like a bit of a cliche but that gave me
an idea what if I took some of the
original Android phones and took them
for a spin
use them as my daily driver and saw just
what kind of experience I got with them
compared to what I'm able to have today
and what all of you are able to enjoy
these days as Android users well I
picked a doozy the original Google phone
so let's find out how it goes because
it's judge McGarr from Andhra Authority
what's going on everybody and here in my
first episode of the flashback series
I'm going to give you my unboxing and
first impressions on this the t-mobile
g1 by HTC and here we are fairly simple
packaging we have a quick reference
guide right here and you can already see
the picture on the front of the keyboard
with the screen that slides out that's
exactly what I was envious of when I
first was doing smartphones or using
smart phones I had a blackberry in the
beginning and when my friend had this
particular phone in black otherwise I
was really jealous that was that my
first case of real phone Envy but let's
take out the device itself the brown Wow
this thing is really small I have to say
it's it's weird considering how all of
these smart phones back in the day were
this small and back then we thought that
they were humongous to begin with and as
time went on the screens got bigger and
bigger and well yeah look at where we
are now 5.5 inch screens 6 inch screens
but none of them have something like
this the QWERTY keyboard right
underneath the screen that slides right
out with a simple mechanism there you go
these kinds of form factors I really do
miss and I wish that we had them more
often in the current smartphone game
taking a look at some of the other parts
inside of the Box this is the back cover
and yes there it is it says Google right
on the back perfect
there you go
battery is installed and I'll go ahead
and power on the phone when the time
comes it's interesting how the standards
have really changed over time I'm about
to open up this Micro actually not my
cry almost I had to correct myself there
we have the charging cable with the plug
already put in there but this is a mini
USB port as you can see here a mini USB
plug very different from the standards
that we have today and just another sign
of the times and an interesting way of
seeing just how things have changed with
smartphones from this original Google
phone and there we have it the unboxing
of the original Google phone the g1 by
HTC for t-mobile
as you can see t-mobile actually does
show up right there now that we're here
there's actually one thing that I forgot
to do when I put that battery and that's
put the SIM card in I do have a t-mobile
SIM card right here but there's going to
be one big problem here and you're going
to see once I get this back cover off
right there do you see how huge that
area is for the SIM card back then we
had very large SIM cards nowadays we
have what are called nano SIM cards
which are so tiny now really because
they learned how to cut apart all of the
girth that was around the one area that
needed to work looks like this very
large one right here is the one that we
need now another problem is being posed
here the nano SIM adapter requires
another shell right underneath it so
here is nano to Micro SIM and then
finally Micro to original sin
so there you have it this is Android the
original that came on the g1 it's going
to turn down the brightness just a
little bit just to make sure that we
don't have too much going on see I'm
already having some trouble getting
around this version of Android because
it's just so old now that navigation is
quite different sound and display and
then I believe it should be down here
brightness even the responsiveness of
the screen itself is it just feels
different compared to what we have today
but yeah there you go we have Android
here the app drawer is right here and
we'll drag it up and here are all the
icons for the different applications
that are installed and yeah I have 3G
working on here at the moment the market
as it is still called here it's not even
called the Play Store yet we bring down
the notification drop-down and yes we
can put a SD card in here which is great
I already have some voicemails coming
inside we'll be able to use this for
texting and for calls of course but
really everything just looks really
different and it's to accommodate this
smaller screen of course yes but even
then just all of the elements are a
little bit different if I hit menu right
here we have these settings to be able
to change the wallpaper go straight to
the settings from here see the
notifications as it comes down then go
straight into search as well with a
quick search box up there I wanted to
call somebody I can hit this button and
we'll go straight to the phone
application which was a different way of
doing things back then and something
that's definitely not around nowadays
with full screens being on the front and
of course using the trackball here on
the bottom is yet another way of
navigating around but with a full
touchscreen it's a little bit different
now here's where things get even more
different I already have the handling
down because this is a very small phone
but when we are looking at let's say I
turn on the phone here hit menu to
unlock if I want to search for something
there's always the on-screen keyboard
right here which obviously we're very
used to now so if I wanted to look up
something like say Royal
rumble results it's pretty simple I'll
go ahead and hit the delete button all
the way but of course we have the great
QWERTY keyboard right here now this was
the feature that I was most envious of
when it came to the friend that I had
who was able to get the g1 while I still
had a BlackBerry Bold I really loved how
this just looked really different and it
was really beautiful but if I wanted to
type with here one of the arguments that
can be made is that it is just not as
quick now I'm sure I'll be able to get
used to typing on this keyboard and
certainly something I'm going to report
on as I use this as my daily driver over
the next couple of weeks let's say but
nonetheless having this real tactile
feel here is to me something that we
don't have these days in smartphones and
it's something that I wish would come
back but now that I actually am typing
on a keyboard like this I do see now
that there's a reason why we've moved on
to touchscreens and so there you have it
for this first edition of the Android
flashback series I couldn't have picked
a better phone to do this flashback
series on first then the original
Android phone the t-mobile g1 by HTC now
there's one thing that's clear I'm not
going to have the same experience on
here that I do with current phones like
say my Moto X 2014 or the Nexus 6 or
even the oneplus one that's because
while we're dealing with what could be
considered in the smartphone industry
and ancient piece of technology and I
have to tell you going through all of
the elements of Android on here along
with the QWERTY keyboard in which I
really do want tactile feel to come back
to smartphones currently and that's the
reason why I picked the g1 to start this
flashback series I will admit it does
indeed feel pretty ancient but
nonetheless you're going to see some
videos over the next couple weeks from
me talking about the camera how things
have changed since then
talking about the experience of using
this on the t-mobile network I already
have some problems with speed because I
only get the 3G network on here and you
already saw how tough it was to get
these nano Sims we have now
installed onto the full sim on the back
behind that or underneath that battery
Android has come a long way and that's
already clear from this original this
preliminary look at the original version
of Android and I'm going to go through a
lot of different elements of the phone
and give my thoughts on how I feel about
the g1 but if there's one thing that I'm
already excited about with this it's
that I'm pretty sure I'm gonna have
quite a bit of fun trying to get this
thing to work for me on the daily it'll
be a way for us to see just how far
we've come in the smartphone industry
and how far Android specifically has
come so stay tuned for all of that and
all of the best coverage here at Android
authority and don't forget to subscribe
to our channel if you haven't already
drop us some likes on these videos and
stay tuned for my flashback series on
the t-mobile g1 I'm going to give you my
thoughts on a bunch of different aspects
and some vlog style videos and let's see
what kind of reactions I get being the
phone reviewer guy that all my friends
know but I'm rocking this original
ancient ish piece of technology
nonetheless stay tuned for all of that
and for even more here at Android
authority because of course we are your
