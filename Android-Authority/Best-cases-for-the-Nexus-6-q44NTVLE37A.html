Android Authority and if you recently
just picked up a Nexus 6 you're probably
looking for some cases to protect it so
today we're going to be rounding up some
of the best cases that you should
consider when it comes to protecting
your Nexus 6 we're going to kick this
list off with the two official cases for
the Nexus 6 starting with the naked
tough case by case made this case
features a dual layered design with a
TPU bumper to protect those corners and
sides and a plastic outer shell for
extra reinforcement as the name suggests
this case is going to provide protection
while still allowing you to show the
aesthetics of the Nexus 6
due to its clear design it's a slim and
lightweight style case so it's not the
most protected case in the world but it
should hold up just fine against the
average drop the case fits well and
doesn't add much to the Nexus 6 at all
and all the openings for the camera and
ports are very precisely cut leave the
tab buttons for the power and volume
keys mimic the real buttons for the
Nexus 6 so you still get that ridged
power button which is a really nice
touch and they're also very responsive
and tactile another great feature on
this case is the built-in kickstand
which is awesome for watching YouTube
and movies however I did notice that the
stand felt a little bit flimsy which can
be concerning as to how well it's going
to hold up over time another thing that
I will say with this case is how much
dust and lint can get inside of it due
to the large opening on the back for the
camera and Motorola logo and since this
case is clear you're going to notice it
very easily directly from Google Play
this case is pretty expensive coming in
at $35 so my recommendation is to go
through Amazon where it's going to cost
you half that price
the second official case for the Nexus 6
is the Stanfill eoq case and this one is
also by case-mate this is a wallet style
case for combining both your phone and
wallet into one there's a hard plastic
shell on the inside to hold and protect
your phone and the cover is made of a
faux leather material to give it that
wallet like feel the case fits well with
openings for the front-facing speakers
and camera but nothing for the Motorola
logo the top and bottom are completely
exposed so you shouldn't have any
problems fitting larger microUSB cables
or head
phone jacks but keep in mind there's not
a whole lot of protection in these areas
just like they make a tough case the
power and volume Keys mimic the real
keys of the Nexus 6 with a metallic look
and a ridged power button the case also
features sleep to wake functionality
built into the cover and there are two
slots on the inside to hold two credit
cards IDs or whatever else you want to
put in there just don't get too carried
away because the cover is not going to
close all that well if you pack way too
many cards inside and even having just a
minimum of two cards will prevent sleep
to wake from functioning the cover can
also be used to prop the Nexus 6 for
view media and it seems to hold itself
up well despite not having anything to
lock it in place the case overall is
pretty solid but the build quality is a
little bit questionable as the gray
lining on the inside separated almost
immediately when I started using it
again just like the naked tough case the
stand folio is very pricey at $40
through Google Play it is cheaper at $30
on Amazon but even at that price it's
still pretty expensive the next few
cases are made by spigen starting with
the ever so popular and very stylish
looking Neo Hybrid as with most hybrid
cases the Neo Hybrid features two
materials that make up the case a TPU
housing for shock absorption and a
plastic frame to give the case some
extra Flair and more protection on the
corners and sides the frame comes in
several different colors but the one
that I have is champagne gold the case
is very slim and form-fitting and not
only does it look good but it shows off
the natural curves of the Nexus 6 very
well making it one of my favorite cases
at least when it comes to aesthetics the
cutouts for the camera Motorola logo 3.5
millimeter headset jack and microUSB
port are all very precise as you would
expect from a company like spigen but
what I really love is the metallic power
and volume buttons they look good in are
very tactile and easy to press and I
like how spigen chose to give the volume
key a different look by separating them
into two buttons in the hand the case
feels fantastic with the frame providing
plenty of rigidity and the TPU on the
backside helps out with the grip for a
price of $20 or less depending on the
color this is one of the most well
rounded cases you can buy for the Nexus
6 a case that spigen offers that it's
very similar to the Neo Hybrid is the
slim armored case but instead of a
plastic frame wrapping around the sides
of the TPU housing you have a plastic
shell that wraps around the entire back
of the device also like the Neo Hybrid
the shell on the slim armor comes in a
few different colors but unlikely new
hybrid the slim armor features a
built-in kickstand it's not the
sturdiest of kickstands and it can feel
rather flimsy but it props up the Nexus
6 without much of a problem in the hand
the slim armor feels practically
identical to the new hybrid in terms of
overall size and weight but the back is
slightly thicker and you can definitely
notice that by how recess the camera and
Motorola logo are the coverings for the
power and volume buttons are flat but
they're clearly labeled and very easy to
press with a very satisfying click all
in all it's another solid option from
spigen that's very good-looking and
sturdy and for less than $20 it's very
affordable if you're not into these
thicker more protective cases speaking
does offer their thin fit series that
isn't going to add much of anything to
your Nexus 6 at all this case is super
slim and lightweight but like all cases
designed to be this thin you're not
going to get much in terms of drop
protection especially along the top and
bottom which are completely exposed the
plus side of it being thin is that it
preserves the overall size and shape of
the Nexus 6 giving it a very sleek feel
in the hand all the cutouts are perfect
including the power and volume which are
spacious enough that you can still
easily press them with your thumb the
best part about this case is the
non-slip mat coating that gives it a ton
of grip I never felt like the Nexus 6
was going to slip out of my hand and it
actually makes using the Nexus 6 in one
hand a lot easier because of how grippy
the back is with a price ranging between
eleven to twelve dollars depending on
color this case is an absolute bargain
next up is the unicorn beetle series by
subcase and this is another hybrid style
case with TPU wrapping around the sides
for shock absorption and a hard plastic
shell for the back unlike some other
hybrid style cases the two materials
have been fused into a single piece the
case hugs the Nexus 6 nice and tight and
provides a pretty solid amount of drop
protection without adding that much
extra
- the Nexus 6 it's not the grip of cases
because the back is smooth plastic but
the texture TPU sides still make it a
heck of a lot easier to hold on to the
name Barenaked Nexus 6 all the cutouts
are very clean and spacious and the
coverings for the power and volume keys
are very meaty and tactile even more so
than the raw buttons themselves at a
current price of $13.99 on Amazon it's
pretty inexpensive and is easily one of
my favorite cases as far as overall
aesthetics protection and feel in the
hand is concerned and finally our last
case for the Nexus 6 comes from case
ology this particular case is very
similar to the Neo Hybrid from spigen in
the sense that it is a two-piece design
with a TPU housing and a plastic colored
frame wrapping around the sides to
complete the look the unique part about
this case though is the backing which
comes in several different colors and
materials like carbon fiber mesh and
leather the one that I happen to have
here is the leather version in Burgundy
red and if you happen to have some motor
maker envy these particular cases might
be the perfect solution I can't speak
for the other materials but the leather
version does provide a nice amount of
grip for the back but the plastic frame
is a little bit on the slippery side you
will get a very solid amount of
protection with this case without making
the Nexus 6 feel overly bulky and the
cutouts for the camera imports are
precise but one thing to note is this
case does not feature a cutout for the
Motorola logo like some of the previous
cases we've mentioned the only drawbacks
to this case that I found is the
coverings on the power and bond keys are
a little on the mushy side when it comes
to the feedback and the plastic frame
doesn't fit quite as flush to the TPU
housing as I would like but otherwise
this is a very decent case for the price
and that pretty much wraps it up for
this list of cases for the Nexus 6
definitely let us know down below what
you guys think of this list and are you
guys already using some of these cases
