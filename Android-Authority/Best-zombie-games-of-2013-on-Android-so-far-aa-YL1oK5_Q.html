handy the Android authority app guy
there are a metric ton of zombie games
on Android most are pretty good some are
really good and some really aren't so
today we'll take a look at some of the
best zombie games for Android first on
our list is a simple zombie puzzle game
called stupid zombies - this game uses
the old Angry Bird style gameplay where
you have to shoot all the zombies and
the fewest shots possible in order to
get a maximum of three stars we're not
saying this is better than Angry Birds
but you do get to shoot zombies in this
game and you don't get to an Angry Birds
it's free it's addictive it's quick and
it's simple and it's fun not a bad way
to waste a few minutes and you can
choose between male and female
characters number 9 on the list is
called zombie - this interesting little
game puts you in the shoes of a couple
of zombie shooting kids as you - their
levels and shoot zombies this is by far
the most simple game on the list because
all you do is jump and shoot you can't
collect power-ups including a nifty
little meth to help things along but
basically all you're doing this game is
run for as long as possible without
dying
the longer you survive the faster the
game scrolls it's simple but people like
it and oh this one is free too
viii on our list is a sort of zombie
strategy game called earn to die in this
game you slowly build up a car that's
capable of running down zombies and
making it through levels the only thing
that's as fun as shooting zombies is
running them down right there is a
strategy element to this game you can't
just mash the accelerator and make it
through you have to tilt the car upgrade
accordingly and use your resources with
the terrain in order to make it through
so far it's definitely one of the most
complicated games on the list still fun
though next up is a fun little driver
game called zombie roadtrip this is very
similar to some other games on the list
where you control a car and you must mow
down zombies with both your car and some
guns for as long as possible you simply
keep going on and on until the Horde
catches up to you you can buy upgrades
as you go including cars weapons and
various items in game you can perform
front and back flips in order to gain
more boost which eventually helps put a
gap between you and the Horde it's a fun
little game especially if you want to
pass just a few minutes for longtime
fans of our YouTube channel you may
remember number 6 on our list
zombie highway it was actually the first
review done by yours truly we reviewed
this game a while back because it was
one of the best and most addictive
zombie games out there it also has
fairly decent graphics which is always a
plus so here's how the game works you
simply drive down an empty stretch of
road forever zombies jump on the sides
of your car and you must Ram them to get
them off or you can simply shoot them
off before they tip you over there's a
lot of stuff to unlock and the game
takes a long time to play it's not free
but quality stuff rarely is
zombie Smasher is fifth on the list and
this is the only one on the list that's
played in portrait mode the premise of
the game is pretty simple you tap the
screen to smash zombies as they try to
truck past you on the screen in various
patterns it starts out easy enough but
eventually gets pretty difficult you get
some power-ups to help you along the way
and some obstacles come along to help
make things harder for instance you
can't hit living people or it's an
automatic game over it also uses the
classic three-star scoring system
nothing wrong with that number four is a
shooter called gun zombie Hellgate this
is a first-person shooter where you
stand in place and shoot zombies as they
come after you there's a selection of
weapons and other items that you can
unlock and it's actually pretty fun once
you get used to it the only trouble is
getting used to it it has a very crowded
menu that takes a few minutes to
acclimate yourself to once you're past
that though the game is actually quite
fun also guns Aubie has a few other
games under their belt including a
Halloween game that is rated as well as
this one the first game in our top three
is called samurai vs zombies defense -
this is a sequel to an already very
popular zombie game and it improves on
the first one in almost every way this
is a combination of hack and slash and
tower defense a combo it pulls off
pretty well so here's how you play you
are a warrior who hacks and slashes at
zombies but you have to kill them all
before they reach your side there are
power-ups charms and even allies that
you can summon to make things easier
there's a multiplayer and it also uses
Google Play game services which is
always a plus
the second best zombie game on our list
is the venerable dead trigger this game
revolutionized shooting zombies
first-person shooter style and remains
one of the best FPS zombie shooters out
there it's fun it's challenging and the
graphics are pretty good too in case
you've never played it in this game you
go on various missions to kill zombies
earn experience and money and progress
through a storyline the gameplay is
wonderful once you get used to it and it
makes mowing down zombies on mobile fun
oh yeah did we mention that it's free
lastly don't forget to keep an eye out
for dead trigger 2 which should be
released sometime this summer it's
probably gonna be just as good as the
first one and here we are at the number
one game on our list and it's called
zombies ate my friends this game is
actually an RPG style game where you go
through a storyline gain levels find
equipment complete quests and all sorts
of other things obviously if you're not
into RPG style games you won't like it
but people obviously like this one quite
a bit you start out after a chopper
crash and you need to find the copilot
then you do save a few people kill a few
zombies and then the copilot crashes the
chopper again it's definitely an
interesting game with a lot of elements
and that's why it's successful the only
downside is you have to take a break
when your energy runs out if you take a
look at our leaderboard you can see how
these games stack up against one another
keep in mind that we don't break these
games you do there is no bias on our
part to check these games out there are
links for them in the video description
this was such a fun list to do there are
a few things in this world more
satisfying than mowing down a field of
zombies it's a fun way to pass the time
and even a good way to relieve stress
killing hordes of people who are already
dead is always preferable to killing
real people and you know spending your
life in prison
