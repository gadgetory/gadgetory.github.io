handy the Android 230 app guy and we're
nearing the end of September that means
it's time to round up the best Android
apps that were released this last month
as usual if you want to check out any of
these apps for yourself you can find
those links in the video description
below
desk dock is a unique Android
application that allows you to share
your Mouse from your computer once
you've connected your device using the
app you'll be able to move your mouse
from your monitor straight on over to
your android screen you can think of it
like making your Android device into
another display along with mouse
functions you'll be able to copy and
text paste from your two devices and a
whole lot more those of you who go pro
will also be able to share your keyboard
it should be compatible with Windows Mac
and Linux
Fox Sports VR is a fun little
application that lets you watch sports
in VR it puts you in a large vip-style
suite like you would get if you were an
executive at a football game you'll be
able to watch live games on TV inside of
the setup it works surprisingly well and
you'll also have the ability to watch
the game from various angles and views
the app is totally free but you will
need a cable provider login in order to
watch any of the games
Google alo was released in September to
heavily mixed reviews on the one hand
Google assistant is totally awesome and
is capable of doing all kinds of fun
things which you can utilize in any non
incognito mode chat on the other hand
the application doesn't offer a whole
lot of functionality just yet and some
are concerned with google logging
conversations and non incognito mode
chats it is worth noting that it's an
early release and more features are
definitely coming for now though it's a
solid but fairly basic messaging service
it's free to use if you want to check it
out for yourself Google trips is a
travel application that can help you
plan an entire trip from beginning to
end you'll have the ability to include
things like your itinerary directly from
Gmail along with any restaurant
reservations and other plans that you
may have those of you who are traveling
somewhere and don't know what to do can
access a list of popular landmarks and
tourist attractions that you can check
out it also features an offline mode so
you can check your plans even if you're
somewhere without a web connection it's
also completely free movies is a navbar
customization app that puts music
visualization right there on the navbar
the way it works is that you go in and
turn it on and then you put on some
music from there you'll be able to see
this video
no matter what else you're doing movies
also allows you to customize the
visualizer by changing its shape and
color there is even an option to have it
work on applications that may not use
the navbar properly like Google Chrome
and Spotify it's free to check out with
the pro version going for a dollar
ninety-nine navbar apps is another naff
customization tool that allows you to
customize your navigation bar it comes
with a variety of options including
images solid colors and you can even
turn your navbar into a battery gauge to
see how much longer you have left
perhaps the best part is that the
application doesn't require root access
at all but you do need a fairly recent
version of Android in order to use it
you can get most of the features for
free or fork out the $0.99 for the pro
version Nick jr. released their official
application this month and their
programming is still about as good as it
gets for kids the app contains tons of
Clips shows games and various other
content from the network however in
order to get most of it you will be
required to log in with your cable
provider it is suffering from some early
release bugs which should be kept in
mind but it'll no doubt be a solid
application after a few more updates
Paper Planes is a proof-of-concept
application where you build paper
airplanes and then throw them into the
internet the idea is that you put your
location stamp on an airplane and then
throw it someone else then finds it puts
their stamp on it and then sends it out
again you can also catch planes thrown
by other people and the location stamps
show you where all those planes have
been it's not useful for anything in
particular but it's a fun little
experience and interesting to see where
the plays you catch come from swipe
widget for Facebook is from the same
developer who did swipe for Facebook
which is one of the better third-party
Facebook apps out there this is simply a
collection of Facebook widgets that
allows you to check out various things
on Facebook there are options for
notifications messages and others to top
it off you can even customize the widget
to work better with your home screens
most of the features are free with the
pro version coming in the form of in-app
purchases but you do get to decide how
much you spend the lowest available is a
dollar 50 taskbar is one of the more
interesting Android apps released in
September it's a launcher that gives you
a taskbar similar to what you would see
on windows or even Mac OS you can launch
applications from there quickly and
easily if you're running Android nougats
the application can even open apps into
Windows this isn't great for phones but
it could be a lot of fun if you use it
on a tablet it's surprisingly fun to use
and it's completely free you can pay a
dollar ninety-nine
