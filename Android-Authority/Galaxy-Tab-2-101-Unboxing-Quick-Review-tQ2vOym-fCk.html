clayton over to android authority calm
and today I've got an unboxing review of
the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 to now I've
got the 16 gigabyte model and as well as
the Wi-Fi model and without further ado
we'll just get into the unboxing here as
you can see we have our top little piece
here and it says our samsung USA or
website there and whatnot when you open
it up you can see here that we have our
little sticker on the screen SS samsung
galaxy tab 10.1 to with a 10.1 inch WXGA
display android 4.0 ice cream sandwich
and this has touchwiz it comes with
Smart Remote options secure enterprise
solutions and that it just lists some of
the features right here so we'll just
take the device out of the box as you
can see this has a nice silver paint on
there and we have our micro SD slot
right here here's our micro SD with our
two volume buttons and our screen on
button I'll just set the product aside
for a second and show you what else is
in the box so you can see here we just
have our samsung media hub package that
shows us how to operate our samsung
media hub we have our samsung galaxy tab
2 information a little pamphlet on how
to use it and then it has a little list
of accessories that can come with this
and we have our charging cable USB as
well as our AC adapter slide in here and
our USB plugs into that and into the
galaxy tab so here is the galaxy tab 2
i'm going to take the protective plastic
off the screen and it's fairly light you
know it's a really good device this is a
kind of cool i like the speakers right
here on the front of the device rather
than on the sides as the galaxy tab 10.1
original model had and this is you can
just tell there's a lot of improvements
between this and the Galaxy Tab 10.1
original and get our galaxy tab to boot
up screen is a really nice feel to it
and we'll just wait this boot and we go
through our setup we can start and we
get our settings here of course we can
choose our wireless network right off
the bat and I'll go ahead and do that we
get our IP address and go next we can
set the date but I'll worry about that a
little later and I'll worry about my
google account a little later as well
and I'm not going to use their location
and I'm not going to personalize who the
device is owned by and the tablet is set
up and ready to use and see here we're
running ice cream sandwich we've got
this nice wallpaper we here we go we
have the widget will recommend popular
applications when connected to Wi-Fi
network all recommended applications are
guaranteed to be compatible with your
device and these are s suggestions so I
will tap to access the S suggestions
while this is loading we can check out
some of our other features we have our
soft keys for the Ice Cream Sandwich got
the back of the home and then the
reasons as well as our screenshot button
and then we have our little status bar
here that when we tap brings up a
TouchWiz themed little menu here where
we can scroll through left and right to
see the different toggles that we have
access to you can go through our
settings here and we can set up a
software update and a Samsung Account so
clear anyways these are the s suggest
which shows you a lot of the apps that
are compatible with this device and I
guess guaranteed for all these devices
this is where you'll probably get some
of your first apps there's the Galaxy
Tab essentials we have facebook you know
our different apps here and adobe flash
player will need there's a bunch of
different stuff cool stuff anyways I'll
just go back to the home and this is a
widget as you can see when we scroll
through our screens we just have this
cool transition effect where basically
everything leaves on a glass tile and we
have infinite scrolling as well where we
can just go left and right through all
of the home screens you can tap and hold
the screen to add items as it instructs
us and we can remove items by holding
and then dragging to the trash and
there's also other options such as
information of stuff like that but
anyways a lot of the preloaded widgets
and apps right here we've got our camera
email readers hub maps internet samsung
apps and the Play Store this is our
Music Hub we can connect and we can
wirelessly sync music through our
servers here skip the message confirm
anyways I I'll go back we've got our
media hub our game hub and then the
weather which I have not set up yet
and we just go through here's a few more
apps that come pre-loaded every galaxy
tab 2 comes with 50 gigabytes of dropbox
storage so that's really nice you can
have all of your stuff stored in the
cloud there and i'll just check out the
settings as you can see this is still
like a good solid TouchWiz user
interface there's not too much
difference between this and the old
Galaxy Tab honeycomb model- the fonts
and a little bit of the icons as well as
toggles and whatnot I mean this is
completely revamped operating system
many ways we have our Wi-Fi bluetooth
get a usage and more the more would be
the airplane mode and keys via Wi-Fi as
well as VPN and Wi-Fi direct we can
check out our data usage which is just
like on the Galaxy Nexus phones or any
phone that's running a you know ice
cream sandwich we have our data usage
cycle and we have our apps that of use
the most data it is we have our sound
options wallpaper lock screen display
and the power saving option as well as
storage battery and applications options
and if we scroll down we can go to the
about device and see this in fact
running for da 03 go to our developer
options and we can choose to have USB
debugging we can allow mock locations
desktop backup password we can have a
strict mode and we can show our pointer
location just like on the Galaxy Nexus
and we can show our touches as well it's
really not too laggy it's kind of nice
and we can show CPU usage and we can
force the GPU rendering which is nice
and also choose to not keep any
activities as recent and we can limit
background processes so anyways now that
we've gone through a few apps and
whatnot i'll show you the recents window
for the galaxy tab now running Ice Cream
Sandwich you can just slide these away
cancel your running applications that
way anyways we can check out the camera
this has a front facing camera and
obviously the device is face down now
but um we can turn it up this way hello
turn it back at least we have our this
is basically still the TouchWiz themed
from honeycomb it doesn't have the UM
stock ICS like on the transformer prime
or anything like that
just go back and go to our appt Spain
where we can just sort through them and
we just scroll and has a limited
scrolling through out all of the apps
let's comes pre-loaded of course with
the drop box as well as chat on the game
of messenger music hub music player so
let's play music play movies all of the
Google things as well as a photo editor
and Netflix if you have netflix account
this comes with Polaris Office and a
Smart Remote anyways go to this next
issue app and this is just if you have
any next issue account apparently
anyways here's our google talk we have
our video maker video player youtube and
screensaver and when we select screen
saver we can enable the screen saver we
can able touch to stop and i will start
the screen saver and so this is the
screen saver that you have if you wanted
to have this sitting around and it
actually just basically gives you specs
enjoy richer video and games under a
world of entertainment options stream
movies with netflix
media hub and we'll just let this go
through its little video because it
gives you a lot of good specs here HQ
anywhere you go and you can put an HDMI
out from an adapter available from the
Samsung
Smart Remote
and this has a really nice display you
can see everything is really rich really
clear HD quality display face-to-face
video chat of course I could sing but uh
that's the ice cream sandwich but
basically you can just see that this is
a really nice like interface for playing
movies you know if you're watching a
full screen movie or something you're
not going to have like any pixelation
really this has a really nice pixel
density and get right in there and it's
an HD picture quality and we'll just end
this little demo video anyways we can go
to our widgets tab where we have all of
our different widgets such as calendar
bookmarks and accuweather application
monitor have some dual clocks so is our
email you know just the usual widgets
just go through we can set up a cool
music player widget and music hub with
it and we have an s planner and an s
planner task as well as the S
suggestions we went over in the first of
the video and we have infinite scrolling
like we do with all the menus now if we
go here we go to the Google Play Store
or search through applications and
widgets and we add a memo if you didn't
catch that right there which is pretty
cool I enjoy limo apps that come built
in and I'll just go to youtube and show
you the picture quality of this device
and once we search you can see that
we're running the ice cream sandwich
keyboard and when we go to our keyboard
setting this we can choose google voice
typing as well instead of different
input methods if you have a different
keyboard you have installed anyways we
have our basic numbers and punctuation
three different panels of those with
some emotion columns right there and our
numbers are in a nice layout right at
the very top anyways I will just search
android authority will make this full
screen and just get an idea for how the
videos look we've got our video loading
and you can just see it's playing it
nicely it's HD you know it looks great
and we have our usual interface for the
YouTube app that usually comes on
tablets and whatnot and how we unlock
our galaxy tab 2 will be to touch
basically anywhere and drag the lock to
open very nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
