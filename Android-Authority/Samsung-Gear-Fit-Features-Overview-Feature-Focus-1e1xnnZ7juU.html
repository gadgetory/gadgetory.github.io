by bitdefender mobile security hey in
Strasbourg our firm Android auto what's
going on everybody and we're moving from
the Samsung Galaxy s5 a little bit to
head on over to the Samsung gear fit now
they did drop the galaxy named for their
wearables and maybe primarily that's the
reason why is because it's not running
an Android iteration anymore this is
Tizen that we're looking at here so I'm
going to go through some of the features
of the gear fit manager as you can see
here on the galaxy s5 which allows you
to manage the software that is on the
gear fit a wrist band right there I'm
just getting a little distracted you're
looking at just a beautiful screen
that's on the gear fit this will go on
your wrist and it just looks really cool
in your wrist and gives you all the
information that you need when you're
doing workouts but also it also does
things like control the media allows you
to find your device and also it gives
you some of your notifications so those
are exactly the things we're going to
take a look at in this future focus so
what will happen here is we'll take a
look at the clocks and there are quite a
few available as you can see right here
there's a lot of them the one that you
probably would like the most and one
that I personally really enjoy is the
style clock if we hit the style clock
and head back as you can see right here
the style clock came up it's this lovely
one with the words when you look at the
home background you'll have something
like the color palette which will allow
you to pick something simplistic just
like one color in the background let's
try it for an Android Authority green
right here and you'll press this right
here and you will see it changes and you
have the green on the gear fit now has
your
another one that comes up is in the
wallpapers now I like this one very much
let's take a look at the more images
you'll look at your gallery and you'll
see a lot of different images that are
permeated all throughout your us your
smartphone and let's say we'll take a
look at one of the pictures that was
taken of the hot-air balloons and you'll
get a crop right here that allows you to
select a particular portion of the
SmartWatch and when you hit done it will
cut it up and send it straight to the
fit so once we get into the actual
notifications themselves there are some
options here like relating the
information from the fit to the actual
smartphone itself you can add a preview
of the message that you're getting the
notification to the gear fit when it
comes on and also here are some of the
notifications that you can't get
everything from missed calls to
voicemails to emails and of course you
can have more notifications from
third-party applications and here they
are now the gear fit has to be set up
for notifications in the accessibility
settings of your exams on galaxy s5 or
related device but once that is
activated you can pick all of the
different applications that you want to
get those notifications from so let's
take a look at the actual functionality
of the fit itself I'm not going to put
it on this time but as I told you before
if you have it on your wrist like say
right here I find it a little bit just a
little bit odd because you're if you're
looking this way you kind of have to
look at it at an angle it's a little bit
odd ultimately especially especially if
you're working out maybe not wearing it
like this all the time I would probably
prefer it to be on the bottom portion of
my wrist so that I could lift my hand up
and look at it this way it seems a
little bit easier to me in this fashion
if we head on over we have the
notifications like I showed you before
no notifications this time because none
came up and also the media controller
when you have your phone let's say in
your pocket while you're working out and
you have a Bluetooth headset or even
headphones connected to your Samsung
Galaxy s5 you can control
you can control your music playing using
this so it's easy for you to change the
song let's say if you're going out for a
jog find your device obviously if we're
going to find the device I'm going to
have the galaxy s5 right here
and I'll head there and here is the
galaxy s5 telling me I'm over here go
ahead and just swipe that out
head on over to the next page and we
have the pedometer which I showed you
already and it allows you to really
count your steps so you know just how
far you've been walking or running all
day
there is also an exercise tracker for
various forms of exercise in this case
it's mostly distant stuff like running
walking and then just even a hiking mode
over on the side now a couple of you
commented that my heart rate is kind of
high well that's not my resting heart
rate just like right now I've been
filming all of these videos for you guys
out there looking to provide you the
best content possible and running around
with these cameras obviously my heart
rate might be a little bit higher but
there you go it's in contact with my
skin and the light should be on
measuring my heart rate underneath my
skin there
and let's see what it is it's probably
Oh 80 right now well I did have a bit of
a break so it looks like my heart rate
is a little bit more normal at this
point and ultimately it's just a really
nice companion for all those times that
you're going to be working out either
running jogging or otherwise but it's
also something that you might want to
keep on because it is rather thin it's
not too thick and it allows you to just
be able to snap it on and off of your
wrist very easily and it actually looks
quite stylish so this is Josh of Agartha
ma'am Jordan thority here at Samsung at
the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
Spain bringing you all of the great
coverage of the new products coming out
of Samsung's line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
