Jace and this is where we try and answer
your most pressing Android questions
like why is it that Google makes Android
open source and better yet what does
open source even mean when the licensing
costs for manufacturers can be crippling
that's sort of like saying sure you can
date my beautiful daughter I'm just
gonna castrate you first now first off
let's clear up one of the major
misconceptions when it comes to Android
and open source most people tend to
believe that although Android is free to
use and install manufacturers have to
pay mother Google a licensing fee turns
out not exactly true
you see if you and I want to install
Android on any of our compatible devices
we can do that free of charge no problem
but when a manufacturer wants to sell
Android power devices to the masses they
must get licensed by mother Google if
they want to use Google mobile services
as Gmail Google Play Store and Google
Maps etc now to get that certification
they don't have to pay anything to
Google but they must get certified or
tested by Google recognized third-party
testers and that can be expensive
anywhere from forty to seventy thousand
dollars for every one hundred thousand
devices yeah that's what I thought okay
so now that we've clarified that Google
doesn't make money off licensing Android
how do they make their money well with
over a billion downloads of Android or
installations of Android they are able
to get a much farther reach making an
open source and free and it goes back to
Google's fundamental business model
search ads and with all our use of
Google Play Store Google Maps Gmail
Google keep you name it they have lots
of relevant data on our lives what we
buy what we watch where we go who we do
it with they are then able to give us or
deliver us targeted ads that are
relevant to the things we care about
that's how Google has made a gazillion
dollars now the next question is one
that I've answered multiple times before
and some of you are going to be sick of
this but it was one of those popular
questions recently in the forums and
that
should I get a phone and a tablet or
just get it all the one option and buy a
phablet so now it's time to take stock
of how you actually use your device now
how you think you use it but how you
actually use it in a day to day basis
women in my family for example my wife
and my daughter they're pretty casual
users so they use their phone to text
call play candy crush and Facebook and
that's really about it and that is the
vast majority of Android users however
if you are watching this video you have
passed the threshold of being an Android
geek and if you can afford it you really
want one of both when I first started
out I bought a phablet the note 1 and it
was fantastic for a time but after a
while it just was not meeting my needs
so if you're doing a lot of media
consumption and you're not just using
your phone casual like most people do
get both if you can by phone now save up
for a tablet let me know what you think
now the third question is can I get
Google now to work on my desktop if you
use Google now on your mobile device you
can see certain now cards on your
desktop computer if you're signed in to
Chrome including weather sports scores
commute traffic and even reminder cards
some of these cards may be based on the
location of your mobile device Google
now on Chrome shows a subset of now
cards you can see on your mobile device
which uses your device's location you
can edit your location settings by going
to location reporting and location
history on your Android or iOS device at
any time now here's a big one how do I
choose the best antivirus app for my
Android device well the short answer is
you don't
Android has enough security built into
it to protect you from the most common
tasks that you will do the danger comes
in when you one root which technically
does increase the vulnerability of your
device at least to some measure but the
most common risk is when you go to non
Google Play Store sites to download apps
China has some common ones you don't
want to go there you are running a risk
to really corrupting your device so
don't do that all right
this is where I normally say thank you
for watching Edward army and connect
with me here and Android brothers over
there but not going to say that today
what I'm going to say is that I have put
in some hard freaking
our clues into these Android Q&amp;amp;A shows
before and those of you who got the
clues and we're able to answer it got a
t-shirt or a Google Play card gift card
but clearly those questions were way too
easy here I thought they were hard
here's an example I put a tiny tiny tiny
little clue in a tiny tiny tiny part of
the screen for one frame that's a half a
second and people got the clue 16
minutes after the video is published
early on a Sunday morning clearly way
too easy so I am taking this to a whole
other level for the next four QA is kind
of four there will be a clue tiny tiny
little misleading screwed up crazy clue
that will lead to one fundamental
question or the answer to one question
and that question is what is the next
big leap forward in 2007 the iPhone came
out and boom smartphones exploded what's
the next big leap forward you can't just
say Oh wearables does that's an obvious
one right or Android one or something
I'm looking for an idea not just a word
but an idea and it will start to shape
as as we go through these next four cue
days so the clue has already been in
this video or it will be or it is right
now you don't know but it's somewhere
and there'll be at least one clue in all
of the next four q and A's good luck
what will be the next big leap forward
see you later on Android QA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
