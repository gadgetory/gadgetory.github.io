Authority and today we're taking a look
at the LG g5 versus the Samsung Galaxy
s7 edge these are arguably two of the
biggest flagships of the year and two
phones that most consumers will be
looking at when making a buying decision
so let's find out exactly how well these
two stack up so this year LG decided to
go in a completely different direction
with their flagship while Samsung chose
to refine and improve what they had with
last year's s6 what the g5 LG basically
started all over from the ground up it's
a completely new design with all new
materials the g5 is an aluminum unibody
design with a nice little chamfered edge
that runs around the backside of the
phone it may not feel like a metal phone
though because LG coated the phone in a
primer and paint through a process they
call micro dicing which is supposed to
make the phone look more seamless but as
a consequence it feels less premium the
most interesting part about the g5 S
design though is the fact that the
bottom chin is removable allowing you to
swap in different modules like the
camera grip or the hive ID Act from Bang
&amp;amp; Olufsen the modular aspect of the g5
is a very bold move by LG and it's nice
to season trying something different but
it definitely needs some refinement the
s7 edge or s7 is pretty much just a
continuation of last year's s6 and s6
edge the s7 edge is made of the same
glass and metal materials which means it
still feels slippery in the hand and is
a total fingerprint magnet but it's a
little bit bigger now thanks to the
larger screen and it's also a hair
thicker than before the phone is also a
lot more comfortable feeling in the hand
because everything has been rounded off
including the back glass and the metal
frame so it doesn't have that same sharp
feel that a lot of people complain about
with the s6 edge as far as one-handed
usability goes the g5 is definitely easy
to use in one hand due to its smaller
size but overall the s7 edge feels a lot
nicer and way more comfortable despite
being a bigger phone obviously if you
want a smaller galaxy s you can always
opt for the regular s7 specs wise they
are pretty much identical on the inside
they're both being powered by the
Snapdragon 820 Adreno 530 and 4 gigs of
ram so they're both extremely extremely
fast phones and you won't really notice
too
much of a difference between the two and
real-world use if any at all gaming
multitasking opening apps web browsing
and whatever else you do on a smartphone
both of these phones do them all very
well they both also have microSD card
slots for up to 200 gigabytes of
additional storage for storing all of
your photos and videos another
similarity that these two phones share
are the built-in fingerprint sensors but
the g5 has its fingerprint sensor built
into the power button on the back side
of the phone whereas the s7 edge has its
fingerprint sensor integrated into the
home button on the front of the phone
whether you prefer a fingerprint sensor
on the back or on the front is a matter
of personal preference but what I will
say though is that the g5 fingerprint
sensor is much faster to set up and you
don't have to push the power button down
in order for it to read your fingerprint
like you would with the home button of
the s7 edge both of these fingerprint
sensors however are blazing fast and
very accurate so you shouldn't have a
problem with either one in regular
everyday use where the s7 and s7 edge
have the leg up is in water and dust
resistance capabilities it may not look
like it because there's no flaps or
anything covering any of the ports but
that's because all the sealing is done
from the inside so if you need that type
of protection because you drop your
phone in the toilet or the sink a lot
this phone will give you that peace of
mind but don't attempt to do the same
thing with a g5 with the Snapdragon 820
inside both of these phones do support
quick charge 3.0 but if you care about
wireless charging you're only going to
get that with the s7 and s7 edge thanks
to the modular design the g5 does
however retain that removable battery so
if your phone dies you can simply swap
it out for a fresh one and go from 0 to
800 real quick while we're on the
subject of battery life the g5 has a
2800 milliamp hour battery whereas the
s7 Edge has a slightly larger 3000
milliamp hour battery and battery life
on both of these phones have been really
good in my experience if you put a lot
of value or faith and screen on time
numbers as your main measuring stick for
evaluating battery life the s7 edge is
the clear winner by a significant margin
but despite the disparity in screen on
time numbers between these two phones
I've actually had no problems getting
through a full day on either phone with
the same type of usage taking a look at
the displays the g5 has a 5.3 inch IPS
LCD display with the resolution of 2560
by 1440 and
got everything that you would want out
of a display on a flagship smartphone
it's got really nice and accurate color
reproduction great viewing angles and
it's super sharp thanks to that quad HD
resolution 5.3 inches is also a very
respectable size that you won't have any
problems when it comes to things like
playing games or watching YouTube the s7
edge has the same 2560 by 1440
resolution but it's a slightly larger
display at 5.5 inches and it's using
Super AMOLED technology just as you
would expect from a Samsung flagship
this is hands-down one of the best
displays on the market if not the best
and it's absolutely stunning the colors
are very vibrant and saturated the
viewing angles are nice and it has those
rich inky deep blacks that you come to
expect from AMOLED the whites don't look
quite as accurate or as clean as the
whites of the LCD on the g5 but that's a
pretty small price to pay for what is an
overall very fantastic looking screen
the SM Edge also features that curved
glass that spills over on the sides
hence the edge moniker so when you're
looking at content like YouTube videos
or playing games it creates for an
awesome looking waterfall effect that
you don't get with any other smartphone
currently on the market one thing that
these two displays have in common is
that they both utilize and always-on
display feature to show basic
information like the time and
notifications the one for the s7 edge is
slightly more fleshed out because it can
be customized to show you a calendar and
it's much brighter and easy to see over
the very dim looking always-on display
of the g5 s but it isn't exactly a
make-or-break feature for either phone
what people really want to know the most
about is how do the cameras on these two
phones stack up to one another after all
Samsung and LG produce some of the best
image quality in the game right now when
it comes to Android smartphones the g5
is rocking a dual camera set up just
like the LG v10 except this time it's
been moved to the back the main lens is
a 16 megapixel sensor with optical image
stabilization laser autofocus and F 1.8
aperture the secondary sensor comes in
at 8 megapixels but it's a wide-angle
lens and it's easily one of the coolest
features on the g5 not only is the
wide-angle lens a lot of fun to use but
you can get some really amazing looking
shots with it and it's something that
the s7 edge is just not capable of doing
with the s7 and s7 edge Samsung decided
to go with fewer megapixels this year
for better low-light performance similar
to what Google did with the Nexus phones
it's a brand new 12
pixel sensor with optical image
stabilization and is currently the
brightest lens you can get on a
smartphone at F 1.7 aperture the SM Edge
is also utilizing a new dual pixel auto
focusing system that's extremely fast
and noticeably much faster than the g5 s
laser auto focusing especially in low
light LG's camera software is very
simple and intuitive but at the same
time offers a lot of freedom with a
variety of different shooting modes
including slow-motion time-lapse
4k video the ability to shoot in raw and
DSLR like manual controls if you really
want fine-grained controls over your
picture taking the same can pretty much
be said about samsung's camera software
it's simple easy to use and offers a lot
of the same features that LG does like
4k video shooting in RAW and manual
controls with Samsung's Pro Mode but you
do get some other unique features like
hyperlapse and YouTube live streaming
it's safe to say that both of these
cameras take fantastic looking photos
and you can't really go wrong with
either one
the images are sharp rich in color very
well detailed and full of depth in some
situations the photos between the two
can look pretty identical but in most
cases I notice that the g5s images are
typically more towards the warmer side
while the s7 edge stays with cooler
color tones the other huge difference is
how over sharpen the s7 s images are
compared to the g5 it isn't always a bad
thing and in some situations it works in
the camera's favor but in this flower
photo for example you can really see how
aggressive the over sharpening is and it
just doesn't look quite as natural as a
g5 image even though the s7 is supposed
to be really good in low-light the g5
surprisingly does a much better job the
photos are sharper more detailed and
they're significantly less noise
reduction the sm does however handle
highlights a lot better than the g5
there are a lot more blown out on the g5
whereas the s7 is able to keep them in
check but overall the low-light and
nighttime shots generally look much
better on the g5 as far as software goes
the g5 comes with Android 6.0
marshmallow out of the box the latest
version of LG's custom interface which
brings a lot of changes generally it has
a much cleaner appearance feels much
more fluid and LG has dialed back a lot
of the software features or at least
have made them more hidden so it's a lot
less in-your-face
the biggest change to the UI is the lack
of an app drawer
you either love or hate but since this
is Android it's not a huge deal you can
easily bring it back by downloading a
third-party one like the Google now
launcher or nova or if you really want
to stick with LG software LG recently
released their home 4.0 launcher which
brings the app door back to the g5 the
galaxy s7 edge is also running android
6.0 marshmallow
and i'm basically going to be repeating
a lot of the same things here because
samsung has cleaned up their interface a
lot to the animations are much nicer and
TouchWiz no longer feels slow and this
is probably the nicest TouchWiz has ever
looked but if you're still not a fan the
theme store offers a lot of options to
really customize that how you want
including making it look more like stock
Android the biggest problem is that
Samsung still bombard you with a lot of
duplicate apps and if you have a carrier
version the amount of bloatware is even
worse but the same can pretty much be
said about the g5 with the s7 edge
you're also getting those edge specific
features like the apps edge people edge
tasks edge and the edge panels that let
you see a variety of information such as
sports scores stocks and whether there
are third-party apps out there that can
do a lot of the same things but with the
s7 edge the features are baked right
into the OS and because you can see more
information and do a lot more with it
it's actually useful now the biggest
question of them all is which one should
you buy obviously you can't really go
wrong with either one because they both
do the typical things that we expect out
of a smartphone extremely well they're
both fast they have great cameras great
displays and good battery life for me I
prefer the s7 edge because it's a much
more refined smartphone experience
whereas the g5 feels like a first
generation product and in a lot of ways
it is surely LG will have it all figured
out in the next version but if you
really feel compelled by the g5 s
modularity didn't give the phone a shot
if you'd rather play it safe the s7 and
s7 edge is the safest bet money can buy
