SmartWatch is basically bigger in a lot
of different ways it's Josh of agar from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this is our first look at
the Samsung gear s 3 now one thing that
needs to be mentioned right off the bat
is that the gear s3 is actually not
going to be replacing the gear s2
instead it's going to be standing right
alongside it and you'll see why in this
first look there are two versions of the
gear s3 the classic edition and the
frontier edition both of which have a
few subtle changes in their looks and
feel but for the most part have the look
of the gear s2 classic with the ridged
rotating clicky bezel that still feels
really nice to rotate around and it's
nice to have a tactile way of doing
input aside from just the touch screen
to differentiate between the two
versions of the gear s3 the classic
basically has the look of a typical
fashioned metal watch and the gear s3
frontier is supposed to be a little bit
more ruggedized it has a matted feel to
the metal and has flat buttons on the
side as opposed to the ones that pop out
on the gear s3 classic as mentioned
before the bezel that rotates and has a
very audible and very tactile click to
it it's still really nice to use but it
can also be used for a number of
different other functions now when calls
come in to the watch and yes you can
take and make calls using the gear s3
you would be able to reject or accept
the call simply by rotating it clockwise
or counterclockwise and the same can be
said for other notifications and
different parts of the watch where you
need to action upon them and this bezel
wraps around the 1.3 inch Super AMOLED
display that is scratch resistant using
Gorilla Glass sr+ now the screen is
mostly the reason why this watch is a
little bit bigger than the gear s2 it's
certainly a large watch so anybody
looking for anything that is smaller
than this will probably not be looking
to the gear s3 as their next SmartWatch
purchase even for me it's a little bit
bulky on my wrists but the entire body
of the gear s3 is IP certified for water
and dust resistance with some extra
military-grade protection to give it a
boost in recognization our demo actually
showed the gear s3 frontier in severely
cold and severely
hot temperatures and it was still
performing perfectly in either case and
users can use any regular 22 millimeter
watch straps in order to change the look
of it so there are no proprietary straps
that are needed anymore like on the
original gear s2 so the main difference
between these two devices is that the
frontier which is supposed to be geared
towards the more outdoorsy type has LTE
connectivity so even though the look and
feel of the watch bring to mind things
like hiking and camping LTE connectivity
makes it more of a standalone device so
you can actually get your notifications
straight to the watch and as we
mentioned before you can certainly take
calls on this using the speaker and the
microphone combo that's built in all of
the other connections and sensors are
available like the heart rate sensor and
also GPS for tracking ones distance and
then there are a bunch of other sensors
for typical or fitness tracking
capabilities there's also a couple of
features that come from the gear fit too
like streaming Spotify through the Wi-Fi
or LTE connections depending on the
version you get and of course this music
can also be played through bluetooth
headsets as long as they are paired to
the watch local files can also be put
into the storage of the gear s3
SmartWatch so you can have music on the
watch always at the ready when you need
it so all of this goes on top of the
already existing Tizen OS ecosystem
there are plenty of applications already
there and a lot of new ones were being
showcased during our demo and with a
growing ecosystem Samsung hopes that it
will bolster the experience for both the
gear s3 and the gear s2 that came before
it so the main addition is Samsung pay
Samsung pay on the watch has to be set
up on the gear s3 and from there you can
hold the back button to bring up Samsung
pay select a card and then use either
the MST or the mag stripe reader or NFC
if it's available at that particular pay
station across many retailers being able
to pay for items using a watch is pretty
cool and Samsung pays a wide support
should make the gear s3 pretty appealing
to anyone who wants to do this so
overall the gear s3 brings a lot of what
we all remember from the gear s2 just
adds a few things on top but thankfully
the gear s 3 is supposed to be in
addition to the line rather than
replacing the gear s2 after all if
anyone's looking for a more accessible
size and maybe look to their SmartWatch
the gear s2 is still available
and doesn't really fall behind in plenty
of its capabilities sure having LTE
Samsung pay and also the ability to use
regular watch straps could make the gear
s3 a little bit more appealing but with
its size at least the gear s2 is still
available even then however we do like
what we see with the gear s3 and we'll
bring you even more about it here at
Android authority as we bring you more
from Berlin at Aoife 2016 so make sure
you stay tuned because we are your
