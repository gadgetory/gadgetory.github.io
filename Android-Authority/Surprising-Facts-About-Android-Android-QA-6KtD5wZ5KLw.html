brought to you by domain.com alright so
some surprising and fun facts about our
beloved Android and we take a poll on
the possible next name for the next
version of Android it's the letter M so
what's it gonna be
milky way mocha or my wife's favorite
malted milk balls I swear to God I
didn't think that one of myself so that
you think that Android was Google's baby
no Google didn't create Android they
bought it the company was named Android
apparently after one of its founders
nicknames given to him due to his
obsession with robots this is Andy Rubin
now did you think that Android
originally held the vision of a mobile
operating system no it was meant to be
an operating system for cameras Android
co-founder Andy Rubin said that the
operating system now a dominant force in
the smartphone market was actually built
for digital cameras but when smartphones
took off the Android team decided to
pivot and change the system accordingly
the Android founders claimed that they
intended to develop a camera platform
with cloud storage for your online
photos the cameras would be connected to
your personal computer and then synced
up within Android data center but five
months into the original plan the team
decided to pivot and design a mobile
operating system for smartphones now who
designed the now famous Android logo the
Android logo was designed by arena block
for Google in 2007 it's surprising to
note that the inspiration for the logo
is the human symbol on restrooms which
was modified into the shape of a robot
now there's also a rumor to suggest that
the logo was based off an Atari video
game called the gauntlet the third
encounter now who made the first Android
device hint it wasn't a nexus that
distinction goes to HTC it was the HTC
dream or also known as the HTC g1 it was
the first ever Android smartphone it was
running Android 1.6 or donut version it
came with a three point
inge capacitative screen and a slider
QWERTY keyboard
now the next surprising fact about
Android is sort of a myth that I want to
debunk the myth is that Android is open
and free and yes it is open and free
anyone can download it on their devices
and then even sell them and you don't
have to pay anything to Google but
there's a very big catch you have to pay
for Google services you know kind of the
core apps that and what everyone loves
about an Android phone Gmail Google now
Google Maps all that kind of stuff so
it's kind of like saying hey you can
come live in my house for free open and
free no problem never pay a dime but if
you want to use the toilet appliances
water or any of the lights you gotta pay
me a hefty fee yeah not exactly free and
open now when we say android is a
dominant force and it's the most popular
mobile operating system in the world
it's true it's everywhere it's even in
space there is an Android device running
in space NASA has equipped a floating
space robot with Nexus S handsets these
devices run on Android Gingerbread
that's kind of scary I don't remember
Gingerbread being that stable now let's
talk naming conventions and you know
lollipop and KitKat and you might even
know Ice Cream Sandwich but do you know
all the naming conventions right back to
the beginning
Android 1.0 was Android Astro then
bender cupcake donut Eclair Froyo
gingerbread honeycomb Ice Cream Sandwich
jelly bean KitKat and of course now
lollipop now the next fun fact about
Android is the fact that it is based on
a Linux kernel and that's just not geek
speek that actually matters the Android
core runs on a Linux kernel this
monolithic kernel enables the us to make
multitasking a breeze you don't have to
quit applications running in the
background to make this system smooth
Android kills the background apps that
are not in use for a long time and
provides a lag free interface now I
think this is worth a t-shirt for those
of you who can connect with me on
Twitter or Google Plus with the most
accurate naming convention for the next
stage of Android it'll be Android mm
something
we'll send you a t-shirt anywhere you
are in the world no though this fun fact
is not about Android I do like the fact
that I can now give Joe Hindi his domain
name appropriate for his station Android

about Commodore get more you now have
