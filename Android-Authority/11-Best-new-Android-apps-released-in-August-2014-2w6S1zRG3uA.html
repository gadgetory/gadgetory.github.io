Hindy the android authority app guy
we're nearing the end of August and that
means it's time to round up all of the
best applications that were released in
August of 2014 blur is a new application
from the makers of evolved SMS and
talent for Twitter it brings with it
google now style launcher functionality
and alongside Google now it allows users
and app developers to create cards and
customize the experience even further
it's brand new but it's definitely worth
a shot if you like Google now launcher
but wish it could do other things too
t-mobile's device on lock app is in its
infancy right now but it's primed to be
a must-have application for t mobile
subscribers the app's premise is very
simple it will unlock your device to
work on other networks for now the
selection of phones it's of horse is
very slim but eventually it should
support more so keep your eye on it do
it is a fun minimal brain teaser game
where you control two balls that revolve
around a central points you must spin
the balls to avoid obstacles and
continue on the game features a bunch of
levels for free and you can get even
more stuff if you fork out the three
dollars for the full version it's a lot
of fun and the core game is free to play
it so why not give it a shot the once
dead google news and weather application
has come back to life and is now
available in the Google Play Store the
revived app also comes with a brand new
car do I that brings a modern touch to
the old application it's free in the
google play store right now if you want
to give the revamp news and weather app
a try one of the best summer
blockbusters of the year also came
accompanied with a pretty decent mobile
game this is an action-adventure game
that also has some RPG elements there
are no in-app purchases which will
appeal to a number of gamers and it's
pretty cheap all things considered
hangar is an application that
essentially puts a small app dog in your
notification pain so you can get to your
favorite apps more quickly it's a great
tool for minimalists who don't like
applications on their home screens or
people who heavily multitask you can
customize it yourself or let the app
choose based on your tastes everyone
remembers locket lock screen is the
application that used to let you tap on
advertisements on your lock screen to
earn money now it's marching to a
different tune as a news aggregator lock
screen replacement it'll feed you news
that you want straight to your lock
screen for you to check every time you
turn your device screen on it's in beta
but it's also free so it's worth
checking out
surgeon simulator is already a classic
on pc but now it's available for android
in this slightly twisted surgeon game
you're supposed to operate on people and
save their lives key words there are
supposed to in reality you can do pretty
much whatever you want and you can have
a lot of admittedly grotesque fun with
it it's a paid game but there are no
in-app purchases while I personally
dislike this game I can't deny that its
popularity and ability to kill time by
making you hate yourself is something to
truly behold it's not a fun game but it
isn't not a fun game if that makes any
sense it's free to play and you can hit
yourself right along with the rest of us
who have played it tap path is a
potentially useful application it allows
you to control hair device reacts to
tapping on links for instance a single
tap will open the link in a browser
while a double tap may added to ever
notes and a triple tap may let you share
it on social media the possibilities are
nearly endless and if you deal with
third party links a lot then you should
totally have tap path last and certainly
not least this month is Wally this is a
beautifully designed wallpaper
application that really shows off the
elegance of material design it has a
really good wallpaper selection and it's
actually pretty fun to use if you want
some new wallpapers give this app a shot
if there was an application released in
August that you want to tell us about
because we missed it let us know in the
comments once again I'm Joe Hindy the
