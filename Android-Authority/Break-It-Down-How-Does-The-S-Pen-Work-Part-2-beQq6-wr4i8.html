S Pen this is a hacksaw guess what I'm
going to do now since the last break it
down video I've gone through and read
every single comment you guys have left
going through all of those comments
two things kept popping up first you
want me to get more technical and second
you really want to see me break the
s-pen believe me I am more than happy to
do both of those so let's break it down
again let me tell you it was not easy
getting this thing open apparently with
the earlier iteration of the S Pen it
was fairly easy to take apart as long as
you were careful this was not the case
for me yes I really did need to use a
hacksaw what you're seeing here isn't
even all of it
I had to saw somewhere near an
additional centimeter off to gain access
to the guts of the s-pen there is one
part of the S pen's internals that you
can access without tearing the entire
thing apart and luckily it's the only
part you'll probably ever need to access
two potentiometers are located beneath
the S Pen button which is easy enough to
pry off with a knife as long as you're
careful these can be used to adjust the
s-pen sensitivity though you shouldn't
need to do this unless you're having
problems now let's get down to what
we're all here for and start exploring
the internals of the s-pen first we'll
look at the button right next to the
potentiometers we just looked at this as
you might guess is what is pressed when
you click the S Pen button from here
we'll move on to the nib and coil you
can see that the actual nib itself is
just a small piece of plastic when this
is pressed the part that actually moves
is the coil assembly this is where the
pressure sensitivity comes into play as
we saw in the last video the coil here
is what picks up the electromagnetic
field coming from your note device I
can't tell from looking here where the
energy picked up from the coil is stored
but considering the relatively small
amount of power required by the
pen it's likely stored in a capacitor
somewhere here in the circuit board you
can probably tell from looking here that
what goes on in the s-pen is actually
relatively simple the real power behind
the S pen's functionality is the Wacom
dual digitizer that sits behind the
screen and whatever device you may be
using the S Pen circuit uses the energy
it receives from the electromagnetic
field to start oscillating and return
its own magnetic signal the digitizer
then determines the S pen's position
relative to itself by plotting the
points on its own internal grid this
dual digitizer is also what allows the
note 2 for example to receive both
standard capacitive signals like you
touching the screen and the
electromagnetic resonance from the s-pen
now you might wonder if this waste
battery life the answer is kind of it
doesn't take a lot of juice to power the
relatively small field needed for the
s-pen but at least in note 2 you can
turn this off by using the battery
saving feature this turns off the EMR
portion of the digitizer when the s-pen
is seated in its holster or whatever
you'd like to call it speaking of this
in the comments from the last video
somebody asked how the device can tell
when the S pen's been detached there are
a few ways this can be done but the
simplest and most likely option is that
the spring-loaded detent mechanism that
holds it in place
sends a message when the S Pen is
removed simple as that and there you go
now let me show you something this is
what's left of the S Pen and this thing
is never going back together again
unless you're prepared to buy a new S
Pen I'd say this is one of those things
you don't want to try at home
now I'd like to take a quick second and
say thank you to everybody who left
feedback on the first break it down
video whether it was positive or
negative we really appreciate it looking
through all the comments you guys have
ideas for a ton of stuff you'd like to
see us break down and believe me we're
keeping track of all of them that said
keep the ideas coming it's a lot of fun
putting these together and as long as
you keep watching them Wilke
making them now here's the thing we have
new videos going up basically daily now
so if you want to stay caught up make
sure to subscribe I am Chris look for
mandroid authority thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
