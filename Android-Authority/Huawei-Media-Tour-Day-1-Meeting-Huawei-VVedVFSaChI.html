finally brought Darcy and I over to Hong
Kong where we would chill out for a
little while before we were picked up
and sent over to the border crossing
where we would cross from Hong Kong into
mainland China and of course the city we
were going to was Shen Zhen now the
border crossing had a lot of security
checkpoint - took a long time to get
through and to be honest I was a little
bit scared because I don't quite look
like my passport photo from four years
ago but nonetheless we got through and
eventually made it to the great city of
Shenzhen where a lot of the Chinese tech
companies actually are housed - now
which gives Shenzhen a very westernized
- look was a sprawling city full of all
of their buildings and was actually
pretty green with all of the lush trees
so after a 14-hour flight from Los
Angeles some time in Hong Kong so that
we could get ready for the transport -
this particular city we are finally in
Shenzhen China it's across a bridge from
Hong Kong
is this is sort of becoming like the
Silicon Valley of China you have a lot
of the startups coming up here but also
a lot of the companies I've been moving
out here and Huawei is one of them and
they're the reason why we're actually
here how Huawei was gracious enough to
invite us over to Chen Chen and then to
over to Shanghai after this for us to
take a look at their campus and all the
facilities that they have and you will
be able to get some insight into how
they create their bonds what kind of
strategies that they have and we'll be
able to talk to a lot of high-level of
people from Huawei and kind of pick
their brains a little bit but finally we
aren't here this is technically our day
one of this particular trip I'm bringing
you these vlog style videos so you get
to see a little bit of what we are able
to do media tours such as this or
something that we hope to be able to do
more often in 2015 and it does start
with Huawei and we're going to see how
Jen Jen is which is a lot of the
companies that we happen to know in the
market especially from this particular
market happened to be housed right here
in this city a Huawei are the ones are
going to be spending time with and today
we're going to have
a few of their people tomorrow hit over
to Shanghai after we get a tour of the
Shenzhen campus a large group that
consistent of Huawei's internal
representatives including PR was joined
by us the US media including people like
slash gear and rubra gizmo and then
another group of UK media joined as well
including Gizmodo UK and pocket lands
but from there we were able to get
together with everybody and have dinner
and talk about what was going to happen
over the next few days if there was one
thing that was very clear to us was that
lobbies representatives who were going
to be handling us for the next few days
were very hospitable but of course we
would have a jam packed next couple of
days touring the headquarters and the
campus and having interviews with a lot
of high-level representatives and of
course for us and road authority the
focus was on the devices we have here
picture DSM H 7 and the honor 6 plus of
which we played with at the dinner and I
do have a full review of that coming
very soon so you can stay tuned for that
and for more of these vlog style videos
from the huawei media tour we will also
have a few interviews from the
high-level representatives that will be
cut down into maybe 10 to 15 minutes
snippets from the one-hour interviews
that we were able to conduct with them
as a group and you can stay tuned for
all of that over on the side go and head
on over to the next day of vlog style
videos from our tour with Huawei in
Shenzhen China and then Shanghai</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
