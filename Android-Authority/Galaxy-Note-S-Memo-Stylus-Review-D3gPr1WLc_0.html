authority and you're watching our
youtube guide to the S Memo for the
samsung galaxy note the samsung galaxy
note comes with our aspect and this S
Pen allows you to use applications that
is built on the phone one of them that
is created specifically for this is the
S Memo right here to launch the S mammal
or you could just tap the application
and the icon runs throughout most of the
TouchWiz interface and it stays there on
the home screen as a on the app drawer
for quick and easy access alternatively
what you might want to do is to create a
widget that allows you to have quick
access to the S Memo or you could use
the S Pen to launch the S Memo to launch
the sm or using the S Pen simply click
on the click of a button on the s pen
and just simply double tap on the screen
tap that and you will launch the S Memo
lite version is the same as the full as
memo application
it's just that this is more of a live
version so to use the asthma is very
simple the sm 0 allows you to take memo
in the form of text or in the form of
drawing the difference here is at the
top of the application though he fourth
symbol here is for the tax evasion so as
it do television but it can be combined
in one single memo let me show you an
example this is the tax version and this
could be combined together with the S
Pen for doodling
so it works two in one which is
interesting and nice the way this
edition works is that you can see your
memo at a glance on the application but
you could also create folders to segment
eyes and organize your memos so for
example if you want to separate your
work from your personal memos you could
simply create our folder work for
example in the obeah on top then and you
can move your memos into the folder for
to move your memos into the folder just
use the menu button go for more so like
move choose the member that you want to
move and select move to work move here
and you will appear right there it would
be a it would be nice if something that
made it solve a bit like the icons on
your home screen that could be drag and
drop but at this moment to move your
memos into a folder requires those few
steps which is not a problem memos that
are created within the folder stays in
the folder and let's move out so it
works both ways so look at the text here
this is a standard text that is offered
in a memo so this is a standard thanks
which is fine it was together with a
swipe so in case if you need a different
kind of keyboard again the input method
wats if you want to change your keyboard
the doodling equation allows you more
settings you can have a pen setting a
brush pencil or highlighter this bar
allows you to increase the width of
the stroke so you could have a more a
bigger stroke vs a teener strong this
color palette allows you to choose the
color that you want while this arrow
down allows you to toggle sort of shades
which is pretty nice so for those who
are drawing who use the S Memo for
illustration in books very well this
button is hot opacity so let's say for
the highlighter let's say we choose to
have it tick you can choose to also have
it a more transparent look or more
opaque look the original box the same
way as to have a bigger eraser or
smaller Tina one so let's say for
example if I but to choose a highlighter
I will choose a bigger brush so you can
see the effect and the eraser ones and
as a teener eraser
or if you choose for it to be thicker
you'll be a more will be a fuller eraser
so thin a thicker Ariza so you can erase
things believe us or Tina Ariza if you
want to make tiny amendments you can
also use pinch to zoom to zoom in to the
places that you want to move is
basically to use two fingers on move
while if you attempt up with us in your
finger you will erase or pinned just
like a spin so to move zoom is basically
using two fingers this is the back icon
that allows you to go back and forward
like I can do and redo safe is safe
cancel this basically remove all changes
since the last say this icon drop-down
has a few things here this allows you to
rename your file your memo so it suits
you maybe is in a meeting you need to
assign a name for the memo or it could
be an artwork that you're working on and
you we need to rename your masterpiece
you yeah you know so this title area
allows you to rename your file and in a
zoom mode
this button allows you to
single-handedly move the animal or the
memo without using the two-finger
interaction just now this one is to a
picture so you can take a picture or use
existing one from a clip auto clipboard
or even a map so you can add pictures
from other areas of your OS or within
your phone itself pictures that you have
snapshot your screenshots from google
maps from any other area where is
important to you this recording button
allows you to record voice memos
together with d the are on your memo so
for example let's say we call testing
123 testing 123 basically he just plays
back it becomes a voice memo together
with your memo and once safe you will
see a microphone icon on your memo so
you know that there's an audio file
attached there
the final one is to muck your memo as a
favorite so you could see a special icon
a star icon on your memos so in a sense
you will see which one is your favorite
or if it is something that you want to
include in your memos that would be a
great addition for the more you could
lock your memo by bringing up the menu
and you could key in pin to lock those
memos just in case you might
accidentally eat or overwrite or doodle
by accident some of your memos so let's
delete this form
and let us explore what else can we do
be as memo firstly as always you could
share your memos to throw out your other
part of your OS let's say I want to
share map that has been drawn it goes to
all share your social hub photo editor
picasa you can share yr bluetooth or
Wi-Fi you can share all what's up
facebook even email so it's a nice
addition if you're working businessmen
who is needing something like this for
me i find this a very useful because it
allows me to snapshot some of my work
related things and give an example let's
say I go to Polaris polarises
application and allows you to see Excel
PowerPoint Word documents PDFs and let's
say I am at a conference and up on
screen there is a PowerPoint and let's
say I'm seeing this graph and this is
basically a snapshot of what I have so
I'll just take a snapshot and let's just
take this as a camera shutter life
gotten all I need to do is go to S Memo
and import that photo in
add picture from gallery and I'll just
find that screen capture just now so I
can resize this to fit into according to
my need and I just zoom in okay okay all
right so this works as it is so let's
say I want to make an amendment of this
memo and let's say I want to change and
I want to use a red pen for amendments I
can Circle it I can say Amen
the men
for this part and let's say I want to
change or let's say arrays or delete
let's see this pot
did it
so I could really take a lot of work
that I'm currently doing weather is from
a conference from a existing PowerPoint
or from an artwork and I could basically
take a lot of this notes on the go and
the breeze of it is so simple it's
almost ridiculously Samsung integrated
the s-pen into the device is fantastic
you can link it to your aesthetic and
export it to your gallery you can print
it out let's say I want to print it out
why is samsung printer probably buy a
bluetooth which is fantastic I can share
this schedule straight to gmail and it
will create a jpeg version of the farm
so easily without even being cute
also alternatively some of you guys
might want to take different kind of
memos and let's have a look at what
other kind of memos you can take with
the S Memo this is a graph with tiny
tiny boxes for you to draw on if you
change the background you can have lines
you can have a blue colored pinch salt
like a task manager a blank sheet of
paper by yellow paper some sort of
different kind of memos a graph-based
paper you can see that as well as
musical notes so even for people who are
recording the song or you are probably a
songwriter this works well so let's say
you're doodling your music and you are
working on the go you can also record an
odd you know the song and hum it so when
you go back to the studio you can
actually base your work on this so it's
fantastic is easy to use it's
interesting the way Samsung integrated
all this together so basically that's
all about it regarding the S Memo is
easy to use is fantastic for business
people who are dealing with powerpoints
and need a tool to record changes
amendments powerpoints PDFs Word
documents Excel sheets or it could be a
recording device for people in the
creative industry in the entertainment
industry or joke
it could be for entertainers we could
work for graphic artists people who need
to draw who need to illustrate on the go
so the S Memo books fantastically easily
for all this people who will make use of
the S Memo so that's about it for the S
Memo is quite nice I've even did a
masterpiece this is an awesome phone so
