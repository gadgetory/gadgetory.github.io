has some similarities because you have
that textured rear pattern in the back
and has the stainless steel rails on the
sides but it isn't the v10 this is
actually the LG X adventure and it's a
mid-range of phone that's exclusive to
AT&amp;amp;T
this is organized phone and it looks
exactly like one it has a very
substantial film to him when you hold it
and it doesn't have the fragile mess
that you find with the LG G six and it
features an ip68 rating with its
construction meaning that it has some
shock resistance to it and actually can
survive underwater 1/2 meters of water
for up to 30 minutes if you're the kind
of person that is very abusive to your
phone you know that the LG X venture
will endure most of the stuff there's
also this orange button on its side it
actually launches the outdoor essentials
portal and it's great for outdoor
enthusiasts because it gives you access
to things like the barometer the compass
physical activity weather and even the
flashlight and also programmable so you
could change it to do other things it's
also worth mentioning for a phone that
has water resistance with its
construction you have a three millimeter
headphone jack there is a fingerprint
sensor and this BP 4100 milliamp hour
batteries so you know it's going to have
endurance over most other phones as for
display it's a 5.2 inch 1080p display it
will suffice as when it comes to the
details but the colors seem a little bit
subdued and which check it out outdoors
a little bit and it's kind of difficult
to see in direct sunlight it's running
Android 7.0 new get but the downside is
that it's heavily filled with ATT bloat
where for example you have things like
the DirecTV app and most of them you
can't uninstall but seeing that this is
an exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T that's something
you have to live with so under the hood
it's powered by qualcomm snapdragon 435
with 2 gigabytes of RAM so when it comes
to trivial things it seems to handle it
but don't expect it to do more processor
intensive stuff so if you're serious
camera this isn't going to be the phone
for you and as for the cameras on the
back of a 16 megapixel rear camera with
an LED flash it can capture video at up
to 1080p resolution and on the front you
have a 5 megapixel wide-angle camera at
$330 outright the LG X venture seems
reasonable not if you don't want to
spend a whole lot of money in buying a
flagship phone and there's a big
difference because you could pay $600
for a flagship or if you want this phone
which features that ruggedized
construction it's only 330 dollars so if

X venture you could check out our
