authority at CTIA 2015 and we're taking
a quick look at the next bit Robin which
is a really cool and unique device that
ain't to supercharge the smartphone
experience with the power of the cloud
rather than the boring smartphone
designed that we've seen on other
devices the next bit Robin comes in this
really cool white and mint color and
it's got this really nice unique design
if you'd rather something a little more
traditional the midnight color which is
dark blue and almost black is also
actually very nice as well up front
we've got the 5.2 inch 1080p IPS screen
which is flanked by two dual
front-facing stereo speakers with dual
amps given that former HTC One VP Scott
crow designed the Robin we're expecting
the speakers to be similar to HTC
boomsound to the side of the top of
speaker we've got the five megapixel
front facing camera and the sensors and
as you can see circles make up a big
part of the next bit design with the
volume keys on the left also circular
and quite easy to press on the right
we've got the fingerprint scanner built
into the power button like the
experience at five range and the mint
colored SIM card tray which remains the
same color
whichever color Robin you buy moving to
the back and there's a 13 megapixel
camera that lets you capture and bra and
comes with phase detection autofocus and
a dual led true tone flash beneath the
camera we've got the next bit logo and
four LEDs which light up when the Robin
is talking to the cloud and look around
the funky the Robin is about more than
hardware though and the software is
where next bit may be on to something
truly special as this model is an early
prototype and isn't running the full
next bit OS the companies show no suit
software running on an LG Nexus 5 the
cloud features include the ability to
offload frequent infrequently used apps
to the cloud to free up space on the
handset once offloaded you're left with
the grayed out icon and you can restore
an app and its data including any login
credentials just by tapping the icon and
don't worry guys the Robin uses Wi-Fi by
default unless you to use your data the
launcher comes in two flavors with one
offering a simplified homescreen and the
other a classic interface including an
app drawer the Robin runs on android
5.1.1 lollipop and next pair are already
working on the marshmallow update if you
switch the launcher you'll still be able
to make use of any cloud features
including the great hour icon the hands
icon
thirty two gigabytes of on-board storage
which is expanded thanks to a further
hundred gigabytes of lifetime free cloud
storage on top other notable specs
included Snapdragon 808 processor three
gigabytes of RAM USB type-c NFC LT cat
for a two thousand six hundred eighty
milliamp hour battery and quick charging
given the pre-production nature of the
Robin will certainly impressed with both
the hardware and the software and it's
likely to be further refined before the
handset launches early next year with
the retail price of $399 or $349 if you
back it on Kickstarter is certainly an
interesting smartphone and for the most
part the Robin certainly seems to
deliver a unique experience so there you
have it a quick look at the new
crowdfunded next bit Robin and for more
info don't forget to check out the
written post which you'll find a link to
