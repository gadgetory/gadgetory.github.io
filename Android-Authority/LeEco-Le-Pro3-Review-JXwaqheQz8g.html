releasing a phone that was one of the
first to sport the Snapdragon processor
of the time while they don't necessarily
have that feather in their cap with this
affordable flagship device they're
hoping that it will still make a lot of
waves it's Josh regard from Andhra
Authority what's going on everybody and
this is Ali Ecole a pro three to any
avid smartphone fans you might find that
the latest in credibly familiar yes we
do admit as well that it looks like a
one plus three now that comparison might
actually come back a little bit later in
the review but we had to put that out
there first
from there however the metal body does
have a glossy feel to it which gives it
a nice Sheen even if it is a little bit
fingerprint prone now the size of that
screen helps the phone handle really
well especially in one hand it's not
that difficult to get from side to side
or from top to bottom and from there
there is the lack of a headphone jack
now this is a bit of a bold choice by a
company like Olay eco which is trying to
really penetrate the Western market
however you do get an adapter that we
have misplaced once or twice already
that adapts the USB C port into a
headphone jack overall the phone is
quite good-looking however the fact that
it looks so familiar kind of detracts
from the overall package at least to us
it begs the question besides the
different lay up logos that are on the
back and the one that serves as a home
capacitive button what exactly defines
the eCos design language in this
particular smartphone cycle granted the
phone looks and feels really good still
but starting things off with such a
derivative style might actually
foreshadow the future of the lay pro 3
as we've already mentioned the 5.5 inch
screen helps in the handling dept though
having a phone at an affordable price
point means they have to cut a couple of
corners and that begins with the
resolution 1080p is an unsurprising
solution to have on a phone of this
price and we're not going to really
knock it down for not having quad HD
resolution well we will say though is
that at 1080p this IPS screen actually
has a couple of missteps in the standard
ly eco color mode which does have a
vivid mode that you can switch to we
just found that the colors were a little
bit muted and didn't have the vibrancy
and the punch that we would really want
from there the easiest problem that we
can see at first glance is the large
bezel around the
is just kind of hard to ignore and those
black bars are really noticeable
especially when playing games or
watching videos it's about a standard as
you can get there are definitely better
display experiences out there even with
other phones of this price point so
general users won't really find a whole
lot to hate about the screen aside from
maybe the bezel but unfortunately it
doesn't overachieve at all we have to
preference this performance section by
saying that the e UI that LICO put on
here as the software had quite a few
hiccups
so as the Snapdragon 820 One has already
proven itself as a reliable processing
package we just saw that there were some
crashes and some force closes with a
couple of apps during our experience
with the phone I did play a few good
games on here including the trail which
is one of the more lag prone experiences
available right now and it wasn't any
worse on here than let's say on the
pixel getting through all of the
different applications and jumping
between them using the recent apps
screen is actually a breeze and going
among all of the different home screens
is really not all that difficult it's
just going into particular applications
and seeing a few of the bugs that really
brought this down for us and
unfortunately that inconsistency
continued in hardware but we'll start
off with a couple of positive points
calls are actually really good on the
l'Ã©cole a pro 3 mainly because of the
phone speaker that doubles as another
speaker and to that point having dual
speakers is actually a huge gap for this
phone mainly because while we were
watching youtube videos for example or
playing games we never really felt like
we had to connect bluetooth headsets or
even adapt our wired headphones to the
device because the sound already was
doing a great job with certain Bluetooth
speakers that I tried to use I found
that the NFC that I wanted to use to
connect them together was really
inconsistent and then even then once I
got the phone connected to the Bluetooth
speaker that connection would cut out
from time to time it's one of those
experiences that you kind of take for
granted until it starts to get wonky the
fact that NFC and Bluetooth would ever
cut out was something that I couldn't
help but notice another thing that was a
little bit inconsistent was the
fingerprint reader now it felt like I
had
press the fingerprint reader more than
once from time to time and then even
then just hold my finger there until the
phone unlocked and woke up when the
fingerprint reader works it actually
works quite well it's just that it was a
bit inconsistent it was something that
we couldn't help but notice however the
brighton spot for hardware is definitely
the battery life it is dependent on the
4000 70 million power battery which is a
higher capacity found on even flagship
devices these days I was able to get a
screen on time with an upper limit of
around five hours now for me that's
actually pretty good and we do give a
good marks but it's also kind of
expected for a battery that is that size
the camera of the lay pro 3 is a 16
megapixel shooter capable of 4k video
recording and has a few different modes
available to the shooter but before that
there is a front-facing shooter of 8
megapixels that has a beauty mode that
is on by default even ad number three
out of five it does feel a little bit
too aggressive but even then the selfies
from this phone are pretty much just
decent at best the app in general is not
the fastest one out there mainly in the
sense that the shutter to file speeds
take a little bit longer than we would
like still it is pretty utilitarian
you're able to swipe towards the
different modes and then swipe up for a
couple of extra modes depending on where
you are the thing that really got us
however was that HDR is a mode it's not
a setting that you can turn to auto on
or off instead you act to make the
effort to turn on HDR so you can get
those better photos so as such the
pictures coming from the lai pro 3 are
actually not all that bad we mentioned
before that the screen kind of had muted
colors and this is one of the great
examples of that the pictures on the
phone when we reviewed them didn't look
all that great but once I got these
photos onto a computer I actually found
that the color saturation was probably
my favorite part despite the lack of
detail in lower light situations for
most broad daylight photos the color
actually made the photos pop a little
bit more and I was actually quite
impressed by that general users will be
able to enjoy their smartphone
photography on the lai pro 3 though
prosumers will probably wish that there
was a bit more speed in the app and
probably a little bit more control and
finally in software the e UI brings its
agent style flavor of Android that means
typically no app drawer and some of the
elements might look quite different from
Western styles of Google's OS echo to
their credit do try to move some
elements around like for
while taking the quick settings and
putting them in the recent apps screen
there are actually quite a few options
and features here that you can take
advantage of as long as you really need
to and the notification drop-down is
actually a bit cleaner because of it
where the Eagle hopes that the EU I will
separate itself is through it's like eco
streaming services like oh did well to
get quite a few different partnerships
with networks like CSO and Showtime but
a lot of that content can be found in
the lay app but where things start to
get convoluted is where they have the
lay live which is where the app drawer
button would have been it brings you to
a grid of three by three content
distributors that all stream content
straight to the phone on an ongoing
basis overall the main issue that we
have here is that the average user will
be a bit confused and probably
overwhelmed by the overall experience
obviously the Eco wants to make sure
their streaming services are at the
forefront but without any guidance as to
what exactly is going on here the users
might get a little bit weary of it and
just install a third-party launcher
while there are a few perks like 5
terabytes of photo and video storage
included that also backs up all the data
of the phone it's a little tough to
recommend a whole new bill payment
system just to enjoy what is supposedly
supposed to be the best and biggest part
of the LEI pro 3 one last perk of being
part of the Lego ecosystem is that
members can get the layer 3 at a pretty
deep discount that makes this phone one
of the most affordable ones out there
today starting at 399 dollars the phone
can be on a flash sale at the LEI mall
and come in at 299 dollars it's
undoubtedly a wonderful price but as you
may have found in this review you kind
of get what you pay for
first price the lickle a pro 3 is a
solid device but it only really makes
sense as a recommendation if acquired at
299 dollars and for its full price there
are plenty of other phones to consider
out there including the oneplus three it
brings an inconsistent experience
overall with lae features and software
that aren't particularly useful for
anyone that just wants a reliable
Android experience at a good price as
always thank you guys very much for
watching I hope you enjoyed this review
of the Lea kool-aid pro 3 we obviously
had some hopes for this phone especially
considering the way that Lai eco seems
to be carrying themselves in the tech
space recently but unfortunately the
phone suffers from the same issues
we kind of expect on phones at this
price point keep it tuned here to
Android 34 even more and remember to
