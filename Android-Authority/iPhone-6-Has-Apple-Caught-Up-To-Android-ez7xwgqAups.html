brought to you by citrix gotoassist the
number one global market leader in
remote support welcome back to android
weekly my name is Jace and unless you've
lived like a hermit under a rock for the
past week you will have known that Apple
released a slew of new products making
Apple fanboys go.we and Endre geeks go
but I think everyone needs to just take
it down a notch be compassionate and
understanding and remember that Apple
fanboys are our brothers intact and they
will be braving some dangerous early
lines this week that can be downright
wooly yeah come on admit it some of you
are thinking about making the leap over
back to the dark side so the question
remains has Apple caught up to Android
until we can get our hands on the iPhone
6 and the 6 plus or start hearing more
hands-on reviews and details about them
we can really only judge the new phones
based on paper specs as it stands the
new iPhone seems to have caught up in a
few crucial ways such as screen size and
the addition of NFC Apple's latest
handsets seem like a step in the right
direction even though they're on paper
spec prowess still pales in comparison
to most Android flagship phones actual
real-world performance however can be a
very different story
I'm not even gonna try and prevent the
flame or that this video is going to
incite because the mere title alone is
gonna make it to happen but I will say
this the last time I merely praised iOS
people were clamoring for my resignation
unsubscribe to this guy this is BS this
is Android Authority not Apple authority
guys I use iOS every day I use Android
every day and I love both there's things
I like about both and it's ok my
identity doesn't have to be closely
wedded to a mobile operating system so I
know many of you will want to know what
we thought of the Apple watch compared
to Android wear
first and foremost these are watches and
when it comes to this most basic
function Android wear has a major
advantage
and the fact that the display is always
on in contrast Apple watch only turns on
when the display is lifted on your wrist
while this usually doesn't take that
long
judging by Samsung's past implementation
with the gear family this doesn't always
work as well as it might of course this
isn't just a watch it's a SmartWatch and
both watches seem to give us options
here while Apple claiming it has tons of
options each Apple watch comes with a
range of watch faces that you can change
whenever you like
choose stop watches stock quotes weather
updates and more when you combine all
the possible options the opportunities
for personalization are virtually
endless according to Apple
I gotta admit though I was expecting
more from the Apple watch's design Apple
can design fantastic hardware my MacBook
Pro is by far the best laptop design
wise it's just fantastic it's so well
thought out I expected more from the
Apple watch though but we know that
Apple and many other manufacturers
stagger their innovations so let's say
they have five killer features for the
Apple watch they may just put one
feature in now and stagger out those
releases year after year thereby
maximizing the profit they get from each
innovation we'll see now I was so proud
of Samsung to see that at least a little
bit they've returned to their old form
when it comes to marketing and they gave
Apple a little right hook success only
two years two years for us to do
something groundbreaking here this hurt
us bigger screen
wait bigger screen yeah it's like every
phone has a bigger screen unbelievable
now I love the whole note the difference
that was a nice touch Samsung quick

now for those of you asking me about the
rumors surrounding the HTC Nexus 9 this
is for you
Nvidia has taken Qualcomm to court over
the alleged violation of 7 GPU patents
but what you probably didn't know was
that Nvidia zone legal filings prove the
existence of the HTC Nexus 9 and it's
coming this fall as you can see below
Nvidia mentioned several devices using
the Tegra k1 including the HTC Nexus 9
first it confirms that the device will
have an Nvidia k1 chip second it
mentions that the tablet will arrive q3
of this year and finally now we know the
tablet will be called HTC Nexus 9 thanks
