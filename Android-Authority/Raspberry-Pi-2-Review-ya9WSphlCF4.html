authority back in 2012 the release of
the Raspberry Pi started a whole new
revolution something similar to the home
computer revolution that we experienced
in the 1980s not only was this small
board a fully functioning computer it
also had a set of GPIO pins and allow
different circuits and robots and all
kinds of things to be built and on top
of that it only costs $35 and now here
we are a few years later and the
Raspberry Pi foundation have now
released the Raspberry Pi 2 so let's
take a look at it ok let's just spend a
few moments looking at the Raspberry Pi
itself as you can see it's a nice small
ball the same form factor as the
Raspberry Pi 1 going around the ports
here here we can see the microUSB port
for the power here is the HDMI video
connector here is the Raspberry Pi
camera module connector audio going
round onto this side we can see Ethernet
four USB ports and then also here at the
back are the 40 GPIO pins which we'll
talk about little later
here is the Broadcom SOC
system-on-a-chip which includes the GPU
and CPU for cortex a7 calls and then
when we look round here on the back we
can see the micro USD car and here is a
Raspberry Pi model B raspberry one model
B next to a Raspberry Pi 2 model B we
can see some of the big difference here
the model the original model B only had
had less GPIO pins this one that has 40
there of course here was the SD card
rather than the micro SD card then of
course the processor is very different
both Broadcom chips broad comet and an
excellent job in making these chips for
the Raspberry Pi foundation this one was
only based on the arm v6 architecture
single core running at 900 megahertz
this of course is based on the arm v7
architecture cortex a7 again also
running at 900 megahertz but it's a quad
core in other differences you can see is
that this one has two USB ports the
model B plus had four this one has four
as well so more power more memory
microSD card more pins
but the same form factor like the
Raspberry Pi one the PI two can run a
variety of Linux distributions the
easiest way to store an OS for the PI is
to use the new out-of-the-box software
package or newbs for short it boots the
pi and then allows you to pick which
operating system you want to install you
can even install multiple operating
systems and dual boot viral but menu so
I've just booted up the new
out-of-the-box software distribution you
can download from the Raspberry Pi
website it boots up and gives you a menu
that allows you to choose all the
different Linux versions that can run on
the Raspberry Pi as you can see the
first one the first one based on Debian
wheezy is the recommended one but
there's also for example opening lick
for the write with PI one and for the
raspberry pi 2 there are some other ones
here most of these only support the rise
with PI 1 however these initial ones
here at the top all support garage-door
a 1 and the rise with PI 2 to install it
you just click on it hit the install
button and after you've confirmed it it
will just start to download it onto the
micro SD card after it's completed it
will boot up into the new operating
system very simple very easy to get
yourself up and running on the Raspberry
Pi 2 now one of the big announcements
that was made at the time of the launch
of the Raspberry Pi 2 was at Microsoft
will be releasing a version of Windows
10 for the raspberry pi 2 this release
of Windows 10 will be free through its
windows developer program for IOT what
yet isn't known however is what will be
included in this free version of Windows
10 it will obviously be a cut-down
version but how cut down remains to be
seen there is one major operating system
that unfortunately is not supported by
the raspberry pi 2 and that's android
the raspberry pi one didn't support it a
moment it doesn't seem like that will
change for the ride with PI to the
Raspberry Pi foundation doesn't see
Android as a priority and there appears
to be some porting difficulty due to
some missing drivers from Broadcom
however of course this could all change
just like the raspberry pi 1 the
raspberry pi 2 is supported by openelec
soon after the raspberry pi 2 was
announced the open it project released a
new build which supports the raspberry
pi 2 here it is running boot up on my
ride with
I too I'm also using a remote control on
my Android smartphone there downloaded
from Google Play and as you can see it
actually works absolutely fine
and if we go here down to the system
settings I want to see to show you that
the system is running at 1920 by 1080 at
a full screen and that's roughly around
30 frames per second it's managing okay
test out the video playback capabilities
of the Raspberry Pi 2 using open elec
I've got two video files here both are
video files are produced by my video
editing software and I therefore I'm
able to control the bitrate one is at
around four and a half megabits the
other one is at 15 megabits so let's go
ahead and see how they go we'll go with
the slower one first of all
four-and-a-half megabits just give that
going okay that seems to play fine but
as I experienced on other occasions the
mouse does jump around when you're
trying to move it however the controls
are still usable and I can press pause I
can jump forward to other places and
that all seems to work without any
problem ok let's go back and try the
other one now at 12:15 sorry and a heart
15 megabits per second let's start that
now and that's running as well but again
the same thing the mouse does jump
around a bit however it is still usable
if you just let them out gently go to
the places you wanted to go to one of
the attractions of the Raspberry Pi and
in fact other SBC's is the ability to
connect Hardware leds motors servo
centers etc directly to the board and
control more to that hardware from
within a computer program the advantage
of the PI over a microcontroller board
like the Arduino or the embayed is that
the general purpose input output pins
GPIO pins can be controlled from a
variety of programming languages and not
just C or C++ it's a quick look at how
you make an LED flash on and off using a
Raspberry Pi ok besides the Raspberry Pi
you're going to need a few little bits
of equipment to make this easy the first
is a solderless breadboard you can get
these off eBay you can get them from
sites like banggood okay and that's
going to be our base where we build the
small circuit
we're gonna need of course an LED that
we need there we're gonna need a
resistor something around 220 ohms maybe
270 ohms and a couple of cables these
particular cables have the connector
that can go onto the Raspberry Pi and
the pin that can go into the breadboard
now building these circuits is quite
simple first of all you need to take the
LED notice that the LED has got one leg
longer than the other
you put the longer leg towards the
positive so I'm gonna stick this here in
row 25 and 24 okay we take the positive
connect it to that pin and we're gonna
put it around here onto the pin on the
Raspberry Pi 1 3 5 7 pin 7 there okay
then we take the resistor that comes out
of the LED and we just put it in any
other space there makes it fit naturally
and then we're gonna go from the end of
the resistor into pin 9 which is ground
on this GPIO circuit okay and that's it
there's the circuit board and now we
have to do is use some programming to
make that like a LED flash on and off
okay so I've kicked it up everything to
the Raspberry Pi the power the video
cable the ethernet mouse and keyboard
i've booted up it's running Linux now
and I'm running a small Python script
that controls this GPIO pin number seven
causes current to go down it through the
LED through the resistor and back
through down to ground and as you can
see the LED is flashing you get full
instructions in the written companion
please check that out and you'll find
out how to write this program fully but
as you can see just not very much money
we have a fully working computer a very
simple circuit that even a child a young
adult a teenager
anybody could have a look at and learn
about electronics and computing and it
quite very practical very hands-on so
there it is the $35 Raspberry Pi - hope
you've enjoyed this video if you have
please give it a thumbs up also don't
forget to write some comments below tell
me what you think about the Raspberry Pi
-
tell me how you think it compares to
other single board computers also don't
forget to subscribe to and rathore
--'tis youtube channel and also you can
