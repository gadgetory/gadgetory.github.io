going on everybody and I'm here with
Chad and he's with cell control control
yes I was gonna say driver idea cell
control he's gonna show us an app here
that will probably make the lives of a
lot of period parents life easier and
also be a way to curb all of the let's
say accidents for drivers who are using
their phones so Chad when we go ahead
and yeah sure so imagine we're driving
down the road here and I try to use my
phone I have a blocking screen that pops
up this blocking screen prevents me from
accessing text messaging email Facebook
and keeps me safe now this app is going
to prevent me from doing that but the
new technology that we're unveiling
today allows me as the driver to be
blocked but at the same time if I'm in
the passenger position and I hold the
phone then within a few seconds it's
going to unblock and it's going to allow
the passenger to use their phone freely
does take anywhere between five and
thirty seconds
so what exactly cob what exactly make oh
there you go so since I'm the passenger
I'd be able to text do whatever I need
to phone that way the driver can focus
on the one thing that the driver needs
to focus so how does this technology
well we have a little box that goes
sticks on the window and goes right
behind your rear-view mirror there it's
solar powered and it emits a signal into
the cabin that the phone picks up
through the app and the phone can
determine based on the characteristics
of that signal whether it's the driver
side or the passenger side you saw it
did go into our engine right that's
because you're holding it like right
here and right here is kind of a right
there's like an invisible line and this
is about where the invisible line is
right so you're going to get it's going
to be always blocking here it's gonna be
always not blocking here but if you get
too close to this line it's going to do
is going to no that's just the nature of
noise yes yeah there's a virtual line
and if you're within a few inches of
that line you're gonna go in and out but
if you stay here you stay here then
you'll stay where you need to be that
scre echt that's correct we have this
small module here that plugs into the
obd2 port it's compatible with all
vehicles 1996 and newer and you just
plug it right in and without even having
to pair your phone it allows you to
communicate the vehicle speed over to
the phone
there you go what are some of the
various futures for some control that
are available with Cersei parent yeah
well some things that are really
important is as a teen maybe mom and dad
don't want me using the phone but they
want to make sure that calls from mom
and dad always come through so you can
whitelist phone numbers and only those
phone numbers will come through in
another scenario you might have a teen
who's away at college and you want to be
able to use the navigation app to make
sure they don't get lost on their way
home so you can whitelist apps to make
sure that that it comes through yes if
someone is already using that because I
remember there's a there's a little
module that you can use yes that's
correct
ma yes correct are you able to use both
at the same time if you using this in
conjunction yes absolutely you can buy a
splurt able for your obd2 port just like
a splitter cable for your TV at home or
whatever that'll allow you to plug two
devices in absolutely and how much will
a system like this cost right you can
buy the device now from Walmart for $89
with the box here we don't have the
price set for that yet but it will be
available in q3 q3 all right all right
well that was a quick demo of the safety
that's called the self-control that you
can use in any of your cars we're inside
of a Fiat right now it's the first time
I've ever been in one but yeah it looks
to be a application that could really
sort of ease the tension that parents
have on their teenagers or the kids are
out driving or anything like that oh and
also I think you mentioned earlier now
that I've kind of gone to that dog it is
able to track things that happen with
the car and report it back to the parent
right absolutely if the parent chooses
they can set a speed limit if their
child goes over that speed limit they'll
get an email additionally we can track
hard braking hard acceleration just some
basic driving parameters so mom and dad
know if they're driving crazy or being
conservative
question do you use this in your own
household on your own
absolutely you do absolutely how's it
work yeah yes yeah it works great I feel
I feel much safer knowing that everyone
in my family is used and I'm sure a lot
of other parents would feel safer as
well all right well that was cell
control again Chad thank you so much
okay thank you we'll see you for seeing
you from the floor here at CTIA 2013
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
