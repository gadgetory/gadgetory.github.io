the feedback from industry experts the
LGG six is shaping up to be affordable
flagship for this year that's comforting
especially what the company has to do it
for for the last year now before we get
to the LG g6 let's briefly go back to
the humble beginnings this is the
evolution of the LG G series it is sort
with the g1 that was actually HTC with
the very first Android smartphone
instead we had the lg optimus G which
was released back in 2012 and was the
first phone in LG's camp to be slapped
with the G branding it actually followed
after the Nexus 4 so its specs and
design language were very similar here
in the US it had limited availability as
18t and sprint were the only two to sell
it so its reach and general popularity
were kinda limited the LG g2 was
released in the fall of 2013 and it's at
fourth the distinctive design language
that the series would be known for like
its rear plan and volume controls and
power button it didn't disappoint one
bit because it was a powerhouse
featuring a very large 5.2 inch 1080p
display a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
processor and the 13 megapixel rear
camera it even brought along an IR
blaster for its follow-up flagship in
2014 the LG g3 made all the necessary
iterative improvements it made sure to
maximize its screen real estate cramming
in an unbelievable 5.5 inch quad HD
screen the first globally launched phone
to have a quad HD screen it's also the
fair first time we were introduced to
the laser autofocus system and then
later on a VR specific headset made for
it the only complaint critics had was
its choice to continue using plastic for
its body that however was sort of
remedied with the LG g4 in 2013 when a
new leather like rear cover was offered
giving it more of a natural feel I guess
it certainly stood out for that just
because weather is not an option you
often find and this was a phone that was
really marketed to photographers it
featured a new 16 megapixel sensor with
OAS
infrared active autofocus system and an
RGB color spectrum sensor which analyzes
the lighting to optimize the white
balance and best of all it offered true
manual controls with photos this was
then arguably the crowning achievement
in the series and then came the LG g5 a
radically different phone that you could
say alienated longtime fans of the
series gone were these subtle curves of
the chassis and the rear plan involve
control replaced with a brand new
premium modular design and a dual camera
configuration now the move to a metal
body was a nice touch but the modular
aspect never seemed to appeal to
customers and even though its friends
attempt to enhance the functionality of
the phone none of them really flew off
the shelves and it's sad to say it but
life wasn't good when you play more this
old brings us to where we're at today
with the LG G 6 a totally redesigned
phone that has a lot at stake it was
back to the basics with this one so
rather than continuing with the modular
approach from before that was scrapped
entirely an LG opted to keep it simple
and trust us it's a gorgeous glass
clatters foam with features consumers
crave like a water resistant design
built-in wireless charging full manual
controls for photos and videos and a
killer camera best of all it's the first
phone to market with an unconventional
18 to 9 screen aspect ratio making for
one heck of an impressive screen to body
ratio now the verdict is still pending
for the LG G 6 but we've seen the
company go through a whole lot with the
G Series last year in particular with
the g5 was a learning experience for
them however the LG G 6 seems like it's
enough far better position only time
will tell whether they'll have the
staying power to remain relevant
throughout the year and that is the
evolution of the LG G series my personal
favorites were the LG g3 and g4 but what
about you guys you guys want to learn
more about any of the phones I talked
about in this video you could check our
