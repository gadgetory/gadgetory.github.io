Adam here with Android Authority and I
have a great review of the app reddit
sync pro as I open up the app from my
home screen you'll notice that the
design is very up-to-date with the ICS
and jelly bean standards the flow from
screen to screen is very smooth and holo
themed now when you open the app for the
first time you will be greeted with the
front page of Reddit you can sort which
posts you see on this page by hitting
the top right icon and choosing from
what's hot new rising top and
controversial speaking of posts if you
click on one and look at the comments
you'll notice that this app not only
shows you the Karma but how many up
votes and down votes a certain comment
has received going back to the top of
the app and working from right to left
you'll see that there's an update button
that will refresh your feed and a submit
button where you can submit either text
a link or a picture that you can take on
the spot or grab from your gallery
before I move on you'll notice that if
you are logged on and have any sub
reddits you can easily switch between
them with a flick of your finger on the
home screen I added Android on there
just as an example while I'm on the
subject of subreddits you'll see that if
you go to the subreddit page the icons
on the top of the screen will change to
add subreddit refresh and a twosies
sword another way you can sort your sub
reddits manually is by pressing and
holding the squares to the right of each
entry and moving them to the position of
your choosing this is great if you want
to sort them by your greatest to least
favorite if you were to press and hold
an entry anywhere else you'll be able to
delete that subreddit moving on if you
press the reddit logo in the upper left
corner you will see a main menu of sorts
where you can do a multitude of
different things sub reddits is pretty
self-explanatory casual is a cool
feature where you can view a subreddit
without subscribing to it it makes it a
lot easier to view other content you're
interested in without making that
dedication search is yet another
self-explanatory button
profile will display your karma and
recent posts if you're logged in I just
created this profile so you'll see that
I really don't have anything going on
here saved is an awesome tool that shows
any images or post you saved for later
while we're here I'm going to select
this picture I found and show you that
you can pinch to zoom which is pretty
cool the images on this app are hosted
by now I'm probably going to butcher
this but uh injure in ger its IMG you
are I probably didn't say it right
either way but you know I'm sorry about
that and anyway they're actually pulled
from their servers going back messaging
will display your inbox and your outbox
sync will do exactly what it says
there's log out and finally settings if
you press that button you will see that
the developer or developers didn't skimp
at all with what you can do you have
things like initial comment count
message check interval and color scheme
color scheme will change my default blue
theme to any of the other available
colors scrolling on down night mode will
change the background to a sort of
grayscale in the font to white you also
have other toggle settings like internal
browser handle there's that word again
imager anger I don't know galleries and
Google Drive integration Google Drive
integration is by far one of my favorite
features if you have the drive app
installed on your phone and this option
is checked then any image you save on
this app will be pushed to the cloud
freeing up space on your device this is
perfect for someone like me who loves to
try out a bunch of apps every single
week the final interesting setting on
here is hide not-safe-for-work threads
this is really helpful if only because
it'll save you from getting in trouble
at the office that's all I have for this
review reddit sync pro is an amazing app
that will certainly stay on my home
screen for a while I hope you enjoyed
this review and please give it a thumbs
up and some feedback in the comments
