language to Android and today we're
making Kotlin an officially supported
language in android so the latest Google
i/o conference Google announced that
soon Android studio would support
Copland development out of the box this
is big news but if you don't know what
Koplin is then it might is going to give
your head slightly
so basically Copelan is a programming
language and now it's going to serve as
an alternative to coding in java when
you build your Android apps it's a
little more modern in some ways than
Java and it's probably a lot simpler for
a beginner so in this video I'm going to
go over ten reasons why you should
consider using Copelan for your next app
project the number one Copland is super
easy to set up
people have been developing apps with
Copeland's for a while now using a
plug-in available through Android studio
but going forwards as of Android studio
3.0 starting a caitlyn project is going
to be as simple as ticking a box that
says support Copland development so it's
very easy to get started and there's
really nothing stopping you from diving
in and giving it a go number two it's
interoperable with Java try saying that
five times quickly so basically what
this means is that the two languages are
very similar and you can use Java
commands and Java libraries in the same
program that you're developing with
Coplin so this means that there's
nothing you can't do because you can
always just fall back on Java number
three is that it reduces boilerplate so
basically boilerplate code refers to any
lines of code that need to write out
lots and lots of times so it don't
really serve any purpose the function of
your application Coquelin has been
designed in a way but it stops you
having to do this you basically have to
write a lot fewer lines and this is also
partly what makes it easier for a
beginner so that's a big benefit and
across the rest of this video I'm going
to point out some specific examples of
how it achieves this number four is the
synthetic extension so synthetic is an
extension for coding that can add to its
functionality and it's really useful
basically with a single line of code at
the top of your script you're able to
avoid ever having to write five views by
eye
again you can identify your views and
then just refer to them anywhere within
your code this is an example of saving
boilerplate its safety having to write
hundreds of lines across the course of a
big project and it's one of my favorite
advantages of using coding for
development number five is that you can
pick your own programming philosophy so
basically programming languages come in
a variety of flavors but the two main
ones are object-oriented and procedural
it's basically changes the structure and
the organization of your project and
there are advantages to using
object-oriented which is what Java uses
but it is a little more complicated and
everyone has their own preferences
basically with Copland you can choose
how you want to structure your own
project which might make it a bit easier
for a beginner and is also preferable
maybe to someone who comes from a
functional background having choice is
always a good thing number six
no more null pointer exceptions often
referred to as the billion dollar
mistake null pointer exceptions are one
of the most common errors in Java and
one of the most common reasons that your
apps on Android crash so Koplin attempts
to do away with this making the whole
process much simpler with null safety
basically it's just one more way that
Copland makes coding a little bit easier
and a bit more friendly for beginners
number seven might not sound like a big
deal no semicolons basically in Java
every line has to end with a semicolon
which sounds like not a big deal but it
is a lot of punctuation over the course
of millions of lines and not only that
but you can end up hunting to find where
you've missed one basically Copland
allows you to use semicolons but it
doesn't enforce it so you won't have
that little error to worry about number
eight is that there's no overhead to
using code min so the standard library
is very small and basically this means
that using codes in to build your app
isn't going to make them any larger and
it isn't going to make them any slower
so there's really no downside if you do
prefer Copland give it a go number nine
that's already good support for Coplin
so while it's new that Android studio
will support
Copland development out of the box
people have been developing Android apps
with Caitlyn for a while thanks to a
plugin this means there's already a ton
of resources and forums sample projects
etc and you're not going it alone
you're not exploring entirely new ground
number ten learning new languages is
always a good thing so if you already
know Java why not learn Copeland's it's
not too different from Java I mean you
can pick it up quickly and then you'll
be adding an extra string to your bow
and expanding your skillset Copelan is
also used in some server-side
development in web apps so in general
it's a useful thing to know it could
help you get a job someday or it could
just come in handy for personal project
and there are many more benefits to
using Coquelin as well that I haven't
gone over in this video for example
exceptions are unchecked and you can use
lambda expressions basically totalling
is a slightly more modern programming
language and it's probably a bit easier
like I said if you're new to Android app
development certainly worth trying out
there's no harm in it so give it a go
hope you found this video useful guys if
you did please consider leaving a like
maybe showing it around and leave a
comment down below and let us know what
you think about Kirkland development and
whether you're going to be adopting it
into your own workflow going forward and
