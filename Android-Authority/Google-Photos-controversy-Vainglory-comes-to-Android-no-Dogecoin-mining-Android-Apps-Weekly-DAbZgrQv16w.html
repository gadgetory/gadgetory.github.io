show is brought to you by rocket VPN
little begin ladies and gentlemen I'm
Joe Hindy the android authority app guy
and welcome back to android apps weekly
let's get right into those headlines
first up this week it's been announced
that mojang the company behind minecraft
will be killing off support for another
one of their games called Scrolls
reports are that you can still play the
game through June of 2016 but that's one
less game in the mojang library
cyanogenmod has been teasing a new
browser called jello this is based on
chromium like many others but this one
includes some fun customization features
like site-by-site privacy settings there
is no ETA for release yet but this looks
like it could be pretty good recently an
application was taken down and the
developer was sued by the FTC the reason
was because the application was designed
to mine dogecoins when not use this not
only makes the device slow with terrible
battery life but it's also illegal in
the United States they settled for just
shy of 50 thousand dollars Google photos
saw some controversy this week after the
appt mistakenly tagged black people as
guerrillas as you can imagine this is
not good news and people are
understandably pissed off the developers
have issued apologies and have removed
gorillas from the database entirely
until a permanent fix can be worked out
select theaters will be having way more
fun with the upcoming terminated release
than many others it's been announced
that some theaters will let people play
a terminator genisys game on the theater
screen before the movie shows this is
really cool and it should definitely
happen more often there are even more
android apps and games news don't forget
to check out this week's newsletter
there will have a complete list of
headlines updates and new releases that
we didn't have time for today if you're
so inclined you can subscribe with your
email address and have this info sent
directly to your inbox every single
Friday okay folks we'll take a look at
the apps and games that made a big
splash this week normally we don't
include application updates here but
pushbullet had one so big that we want
to talk about it a recent update not
only cleaned up the user interface a
whole bunch but it also added a full
messaging platform other improvements
include better pushing between devices
and your regular bug fixes and
performance improvements if you want a
one-stop shop for connecting your
computer to your Android device
pushbullet seems to be the way to go
yeah who's a v8 launcher is another
application that got a huge update this
last week that's worth talking about the
application now includes a new feature
called smart stream
is kind of like a competitor to Google
now it keeps an eye on the stuff you do
on your device and then tries to compile
a feed of stuff that you might be
interested in this also includes weather
data directions and it'll even pull up
your music application to the front if
you plug your headphones in the geometry
wars 3 was released to the Google Play
Store this last week to positive reviews
the game includes a glorious display of
colors and fast-paced gameplay it
includes over 50 levels including
classic arcade levels 10 battle modes
and multiple control setups it's
currently 499 but there are no in-app
purchases and the game currently has
over 500 positive reviews verses 16
negative reviews this one's a no-brainer
for those looking for a time killer the
vainglory is a hotly anticipated MOBA
that was released on android just
yesterday it features a league of
legends style plays scheme where you can
play as much as you want for free but
some of this more specialized items and
characters may cost a couple of bucks it
features long game matches customizable
hero builds and all of the awesome stuff
that you'd expect in a MOBA do be warned
this game packs a serious punch so
low-end devices may not handle it very
well half-life 2 episode 2 is released
on android but there is some bad news
it's only available for the Nvidia
shield tablet and Nvidia shield android
TV device if you've never played the
half-life series before you'll probably
need to play at least half life two and
half life 2 episode 1 to know what's
going on this however is a console
quality game with great graphics a good
story and plenty of things for you to
shoot it's seven dollars and ninety-nine
cents with no in-app purchases thanks
