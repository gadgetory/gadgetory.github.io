home to a stranger as a prospect that
some people wouldn't be too keen about
but when that strangers an AI powered
speaker of sorts we suppose most people
won't be as reluctant at Google's press
conference in San Francisco the company
introduced its AI driven Google home one
of the first things to drop at us about
the Google home is its overall size it
has an inviting tone to it especially
when the basis can be swapped for
different colors however it's them unit
of sizes especially noteworthy because
pictures and renders a bit don't do
justice and justifying its size it's so
small compact enough that you can even
rest it in the palm of your hand you
also have the touch sensitive control
panel on top of the unit which have
embedded LEDs that glow would you glide
your finger to adjust the volume or when
you initiate a voice action speaking of
voice actions this is the core function
of Google home from playing the song
finding out the weather for tomorrow and
even adjusting the lighting of a room
Google home manages to perfectly
recognize voice actions with its dual
far-field microphones of course you
initiate by saying ok Google and it does
well in noisy conditions too I can see
ok Google this plane
this is titanium originally performed by
David Guetta and SIA karaoke version by
titanium I am titanium the other
integral part about Google home is the
integrated hi-fi excursion speaker
system we're yet again impressed by its
power to clarity not only does it remain
crystal clear and rich with bass buts /
potencies never compromised in the noisy
conditions we were demoing it in and
when you have multiple Google home units
connected they play music in
synchronization they're able to do that
because their network connected so
there's no bluetooth connection here
whatsoever
okay Google Play sync by Ed Sheeran
today when we envision the world of
tomorrow we sometimes have this
imagination of an artificial
intelligence source at the home
monitoring everything Google home is one
step towards that direction not only for
its ability to intelligently provide
answers to questions and tasks but also
for its ability to control the home as
well right now it supports things like
the Google chromecast nest built you and
much more and even though it's still a
limited selection we imagine that the
collection will grow as time goes along
pre-order support are available right
now so forking over $129 will land you
one it will be available in-store
starting on November 6 and will come
with a free six month trial to YouTube
bread so that's a quick look at the new
Google home so if you guys want to learn
more about it you could check out our
