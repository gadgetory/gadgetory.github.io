Hindy the android authority app guy here
and in this quick video we're going to
take a quick look at a new application
called we mail okay so here's what we
mail is all about the idea is to turn
your email experience into something
that is more simple and enjoyable on
your mobile devices it does this by
incorporating a mobile friendly user
experience that is adorned by material
design and bears a striking resemblance
to how messaging apps work one of the
things you'll notice immediately is how
emails are organized generally they're
in chronological order whereas in we
mail they're organized by sender so if
someone sends you a bunch of emails they
all appear in one space and not as
individual emails here's a basis for
comparison here is how it looks in
classic gmail and here is how it looks
in we mail so you can see that the
application does save quite a bit of
space in terms of functionality it
actually performs more like a chat
application rather than email messages
are threaded in a bubble layout much
like whatsapp or hangout and that can
make them easier to read you can respond
to e-mail and otherwise interact with
the email just like you can in a
messaging application with a few extra
tools included because it is email one
fun feature is the voice response
instead of trying to figure out what
you're saying and put it in text the app
actually records what you're saying and
sends it as a sound file if you're on we
email you can play these right from the
chat bubble and if you're on a regular
client they show up as a sound file
attachment that you can download and
play and we mail the attachments are all
managed under one interface kind of like
you'd see in cloud storage I get a lot
of attachments and this actually made it
substantially easier to manage and find
files and it's actually one of my
favorite features of this application
there is also an above-average search
function to find messages you've sent or
received overall this is something very
different and whether or not you like it
will be determined on how much you like
dealing with email in its current format
there are a lot of spots where we mail
is faster and more efficient and that's
especially true with attachments and
dealing with a lot of emails from the
same people over and over again the
material design does look nice and it
fits this application like a glove
without being too ostentatious I did
have a pre-release copy so there were
some things that I experienced that
probably will make it into the actual
application such as some sync delays
especially in gmail but that is
something you may want to look out for
since this is a
brand new application it's also worth
mentioning that this app doesn't include
a lot of the things that full-featured
email clients use like text formatting
so if you're big into that you may not
be writing a lot of emails on here on
mobile devices this has a chance to be
something truly different the focus on
simplicity is apparent and refreshing
and they do support multiple accounts on
multiple services if you're up for
trying something different the link will
be in the video description below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
