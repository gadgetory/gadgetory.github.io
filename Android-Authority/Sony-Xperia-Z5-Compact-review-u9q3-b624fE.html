Android authority now it's fairly well
known that Sony's mobile division is
struggling in fact really the company
has ended into a make-or-break period
where if it doesn't see profitability
soon and maybe the whole mobile unit
could be for the chop and this is the
background which we turn to the new Zaid
5 series particularly the z5 compact now
I did an unboxing on periscope a few
days ago and now it's time for the full
review so if you're ready let's go
before we get to the review I want to
say one thing I did drop this phone
while I was videoing it it was up on a
shelf it's about this high it was
outside the wind blew and the phone fell
down it fell straight flat on its face
the screen didn't break but you will see
there are some scuff marks on the side
so if you want to drop test there it was
unfortunate the camera wasn't rolling so
I couldn't capture it but the phone did
survive so please excuse the scuff marks
when you see some of the close-ups ok
let's go the design of the Zed 5 compact
will be instantly familiar to anyone
who's acquainted with sony's other Z
devices particularly the z3 compact now
as you can guess from the compact name
this is a smaller version of the z5
premium and the standard Z 5 however it
does use exactly the same design
language as its bigger siblings
including the signature button layout
from Sony which includes that dedicated
camera button and a large power button
in the middle of the right hand side
bezel however a downside of Sony's
layout is that the volume rocker is
towards the bottom right hand side and
it really is hard to reach regardless of
which hand you are using to hold the
phone now going around the device you'll
find the 3.5 millimeter a headphone jack
along the top on the bottom you'll find
the USB port along with a microphone
hole there's also a microphone hold up
towards the top on the right-hand side
you'll find that signature button layout
as I've already mentioned and on the
left hand side you'll find a flap which
protects the SIM card and the SD card
and fine enough it also has a strange
piece of roll-out plastic which contains
the C e and F
see see information on it on the front
you'll find the 4.6 inch display which
has a resolution of 720 p which gives us
a pixel density of around 323 on the
back of the phone you'll find the 23
megapixel camera and a flash and a
couple of Sony logos one thing is sure
though the phone has been updated
particularly the power button has been
changed to incorporate the fingerprint
reader the z5 compact remains
quintessentially a Sony device so let's
talk about the display now since this is
the compact version as I've already
mentioned it has a 4.6 inch display with
a 720p resolution however I must say the
screen is very crisp the color
reproduction is good
due to the triluminos display technology
along with the x-reality engine that
comes from Sony it's also got great
viewing angles because it is an IPS
screen and Sony are also included in
this model a dynamic contrast enhancer
which according to Sony makes the
brighter parts of the screen brighter
and the darker part a truer deeper black
cause the real question is do you want a
4.6 inch display when it comes to
watching videos playing games or reading
text the smaller display may take some
getting used to especially if you're
used to a bigger screen already
however the trade of course is you have
easier handling which of course is what
some people want but if you're looking
for a high display experience a high
performance experience in terms of
display the the z5 compact is probably
not for you so let's move on to the
performance and the hardware now the
good news is although this has a smaller
screen Sony has not compromised on the
specifications the internals are exactly
the same almost exactly the same as its
bigger siblings you get the octa-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 back by the
Adreno 430 GPU and 2 gigabytes of RAM
those 32 gigabytes of internal storage
and there's the option to add more via
the micro SD card slot course you get
all the normal connectivity options
including NFC Wi-Fi GPS Bluetooth and of
course this is a 4G LTE phone the only
difference really on the internal specs
is at the z5 and the z5 premium come
with 3 gigabytes of RAM and they have
slightly different battery sizes so
let's look at the fingerprint reader the
fingerprint reader is built into the
power button on the right-hand bezel and
if you pick up the phone with your left
hand you'll probably want to use your
left index finger to unlock the phone if
you pick up with your right hand you'll
probably want to use your right thumb
over all the fingerprint reader is fast
I've had to had any miss Reed and it's
easy to program the phone also comes
with some waterproofing specifications
is specifically IP 65 and IP 68 which
according to Sony means you don't have
to worry if you get caught in the rain
or even if you want to wash off some
dirt from your phone under the tap
however Sony does recommend that you
don't put the device completely
underwater
you don't expose it to seawater and that
you don't pour hot drinks on it as for
sound there's a 5 compact features dual
front-facing speakers that mean the
sound is unobstructed when you're
placing the phone on a flat surface and
it always means the sound is projected
up with an outwards from the phone now
these speakers can get pretty loud
considering this is a 4.6 inch display
however at the higher volumes the sound
does lose some depth and it can sound a
bit tinny a bit squeaky
there are a number of audio settings
that can be used to improve the sound
quality including clear Audio plus and a
dynamic normalizer there's also a manual
mode which allows you to use an
equalizer and also activate various
surround sound options personally I
found that using the bass boost mode of
the equalizer improve the speaker sound
reproduction however of course your
tastes may differ when it comes to the
battery the Sony's said 5 compact packs
a 2300 milliamp hour unit which should
be enough for a small phone like this
considering it has a low resolution
screen and of course Sony devices have
always been known for their great
standby times and for their extra useful
power saving modes with modest use you
should be able to get a full day's
battery life out of this phone and even
more if you turn on some of those power
saving features a screen on time of
between 4 and 6 hours should be very
possible as my tests shown you can
stream YouTube videos for around 6 hours
on one charge or play 3d games for
around 4.5 hours now personally during
my testing the best I got was 44 hours
of standby time which is almost two days
with three hours and 49 minutes of
screen on time however these numbers
were heavily influenced by my snapdragon
ten thermal tests which we'll get to in
a moment and those tests drain the
battery faster than normal before we
leave the battery it's worth mentioning
that this said five compact supports
quick charge 2.0 which means that the
phone can be charged up to 80 percent
relatively quickly my tests show that
you can charge the phone from 10% to 80%
in about an hour or two just 50% in
about 40 minutes a full charge from 10%
to 100% takes one hour and 40 minutes in
total now let's talk about the
Snapdragon 810 for a moment this CPU of
course got a lot of bad press when it
first appeared because people reported
overheating issues and as a result the
thief's CPU speed was throttled and of
course therefore the performance dropped
now in an effort to rebuild confidence
in the Snapdragon 810 Qualcomm released
a newer version of the SOC with a 2.1
label on it and it looks like Qualcomm
plan has worked because Sony of course
has picked up the chip for its lead 5
line as did while way for the Nexus 6p
but the question still remains
does the 810 version 2.1 overheat now
unfortunately the answer is a little
more complicated than the question for
everyday usage including web browsing
email in gaming and using the camera for
taking photos I can tell you the phone
does not overheat according to my
testing using a handheld infrared
thermometer gun you can expect the
temperature on the back of the phone to
raise by a maximum of 9 degrees Celsius
during normal usage now to put that into
some context a temperature of the top
left-hand corner of a samsung galaxy
note 5 goes up by 10 degrees when you're
playing Epic Citadel for 20 minutes
however this isn't the whole answer when
you are recording 4k video the device
does become very hot in fact Sony knows
it when you enter into the 4k mode you
are greeted by a nice dialogue which
warns you if the device temperature
rises the app may close during use your
recording will be saved automatically
and the warning dialog is Right once you
start recording 4k the device
temperature does start to rise and
indeed if it does get too hot the app
does close this isn't an immediate thing
we aren't just talking about one minute
of recording but if you record 4k video
for around 20 minutes the device heats
up significantly and the app will close
according to my measurements the
temperature of the back of the z5
compact can rate as much as by 20
degrees Celsius
it's also worth pointing up the 4k
recording eats into a battery life
significantly this excessive heating
unfortunately isn't just limited to 4k
video if you record in HD video the said
5 compact also heats up by not quite as
much but still by a significant 17
degrees centigrade in terms of general
performance the Snapdragon 810 is an
absolutely excellent processor the UI is
always fast and responsive games play
well normal productivity apps run well
you never feel that you're wishing you
had a better processor in the phone in
fact for 3d games epochs it
scored a rate of 50 8.5 frames per
second in ultra high quality mode which
is an absolutely excellent score and in
terms of and two to the maximum I saw
was sixty-two thousand one hundred and
thirty now it's interesting having run
the 4k video test which heats up the
device a little bit the antutu score
then dropped to fifty thousand nine
hundred and fifty-five which is about
eighty percent of what the maximum score
is so let's move on to the camera with a
twenty three megapixel Sony Exmor RS
sensor a wide-angle twenty four
millimeter lens and of course that
option for 4k recording I was really
looking forward to see what was it five
compact camera could do however I must
confess that I am a little disappointed
part of my disappointment maybe because
my expectations were too high this is a
sory device Sony makes great digital
cameras Sony sells its mobile sensors to
lots of other smartphone makers this has
a 23 megapixel so a sensor and so on
basically I was expecting great things
all I can say that the camera on those
85 did not meet my expectations now it
doesn't mean it's a bad camera in fact
it's quite a good camera but I wouldn't
say it's the best now I'm going to show
you a few pictures here that I've taken
using the Zed 5 to show you what I mean
if you want to see a full collection of
photos that I've taken both in 23
megapixel mode and in 8 megapixel mode
using super sampling please check out
the review that is on the android
authority website as you can see in good
data at the camera works well and there
is little to choose between the 23
megapixel mode and the 8 megapixel mode
however some pictures are dull and
washed out and in low-light situations
the camera tries very hard to produce a
good shot
however the noise levels can be very
high even for simple indoor shots with
lots of internal lighting now the camera
in those 85 compact is the same as the
camera in the bigger z5 now for a deeper
comparison you should also check out our
camera shootout between the red 5 the LG
g4 the galaxy note 5 and the iPhone 6s
which you will find on the Android
Authority website
having said all that my disappointment
about the cameras performance will
slightly alleviated by the bundled
camera app it truly is a great app and
offers more than just the standard HDR
and panorama along with a full manual
mode there's lots of additional modes
including in AR mode which can
superimpose computer-generated scenes
like dinosaurs and fish onto your photos
or videos there's an AR mask mode to
mask your face with different
computer-generated masks a time shift
movie mode which record at a high frame
rate and applies slow motion effects and
a multi-camera mode which allows you to
record the same scene from multiple
camera angles so let's move on to the
software the z5 compact comes with
android 5.1.1 lollipop by default and it
will receive an upgrade to Android 6.0
marshmallow
at some point in the future Sony has
added a light skin on top of the stock
Android experience and it also includes
some extra features and Sony related
apps as well as a software for managing
the fingerprint reader there is a myriad
of device connection options including
the ability to wisely play content on
your device to other Sony devices like a
sony tv there's also screen mirroring
and connecting to PlayStation
controllers there's also a theme library
with some free color based schemes and
some paid schemes that you can pay for
and download and these are based on
movies like frozen cars Donald Duck Mad
Max and so on under the power management
section in the settings there are
several different power saving modes
available including stamina mode ultra
stamina mode and low power mode there's
also an estimate shown of how much
battery life you've got left there were
just 40% left the estimations showed
that the phone would stay on standby for
an extra three days which is quite
impressive in terms of extra apps sony
has included life log for tracking
calories steps and sleep movie creator
which makes movies from your photos in a
similar way to Google photos track ID
Sony's music recognition app wise pilot
turn-by-turn navigation software and of
course some dedicated PlayStation apps
including PSN PlayStation and PS video
one final thing worth mentioning on the
software side is the inclusion of some
small apps when you tap on the recent
apps button there is a small toolbar
with a selection of small apps like a
calculator and timer and if you tap on
little up arrow you'll be given other
apps including a mini browser Gmail and
the music app so what about the price
the dead five compaq is available in the
UK from a variety of carriers and
outlets and costs around four hundred
and twenty nine pound without a contract
in Europe you can buy off contract
directly from Sony for five hundred and
ninety-nine euros there is no news yet
of when the said five shoes will
officially reach the USA however you can
find it on amazon.com at the time of
writing I found one seller who was
selling it for five hundred and eighty
dollars however the average seemed to be
around $700 as our there we have it the
said five compact now if you were going
to buy this phone the decision really
comes down to whether you want a phone
that's smaller than five inches or not
if you are looking for a sub five inch
display then this could be the very
phone for you you've got flagship
specifications you've got the IP
certification and you've got all the
extra apps from Sony however don't
forget it only has a 720p display the
camera isn't as good as the hype will
leave you to believe and if you record
4k video the device is going to overheat
well my name's Gary simple and with
authority I hope you enjoyed this video
if you did please do give it a thumbs up
also please tell me what you think about
the Sony z5 compact in fact all of
