authority on hair the original android
hang out chill on google+ I'm dare cross
I'm Scott Anderson this week we're
joined with 3 special guests we have
returned gasps Francisco Franco he is a
popular chrome developer for multiple
devices if you're under the routing and
robbing I'm sure you've heard of them we
have returning guest Derek Moore who's a
fellow android enthusiast and we have
john curley with us as well in first
time on the show but he's a longtime
friend of the android community welcome
everybody so this week was pretty much
Android Christmas right Scott yeah
google i/o long 2012 once a year
definitely release everything new coming
on jelly bean and we're all excited
about that and we're kind of going to be
going over that a little bit later in
her show um but the agenda for tonight
is going to be we're going to be talking
about some internet statistics I've got
some numbers released how many devices
are getting activated we're then going
to be going over jellybeans in depth
then a lot of google app apps got
updated a lot more functionality and
then some devices that were released the
nexus 7 the nexus q and then we will end
with a little bit of some rumors all
right so let's talk about the stats real
quick so Android is huge right I mean
that that's why world period Android is
a force to be reckoned with last year at
i/o 11 there were 300 million devices a
year later there's 400 million devices
and a million of those devices are
actually being activated every day now
so from about a month ago when it was
950 yes I predicted it would be a nice
milestone for i 0 12 and guess what here
we are a million devices a day that's
that's insane that's actually 12 new
devices every second of every day so as
the show's been going on now for
a minute we've had roughly you know five
devices activated that's nuts um the
Play Store is growing too there's
600,000 apps available to play store and
that leaves us with about 20 billion
total downloads that's that's insane
like I said Android is is growing leaps
and bounds now let's bring us to the
Android Christmas as I said android 4.1
jellybean was officially announced
officially released to certain people um
on Wednesday first day of i/o and during
the keynote it was just gift after gift
after amazement left and right up first
thing I want to talk about is project
butter and you know the saying you know
smooth as butter that that's pretty much
what project butter was all about um
they were doing things such as you know
setting a standard is 60 frames per
second across the board for for
jellybean ah good triple buffering and
they're ramping up cpu on screen touch
so when you touch the screen that means
you're going to do something so boom
let's make sure you know we're using
this much power it is possible that way
it's not slow there's no lagging it's
whenever you touch the screen so it's a
jelly bean is the most responsive
fastest most fluid version of android to
date um i know that some of us in here
Derek myself Francisco and John are all
using jelly bean and said Mr aight guys
i mean is it not project butter is it
not as smooth as butter fat oh yeah it's
in theaters now Francisco use it you
said before the show a few interesting
things that as a kernel developer you've
actually seen some of the project butter
commits in the android kernel code is
that right yes I've been following
Android Oh mop the tree for a long time
and I've been emerging patches along
and in one of the patches like one month
ago was to the interactive governor and
was exactly like we see on the project
butter when we enable that option we
touch the screen and cpu just ramped it
up basically to the medium processor
frequency so we've been secretly with
and without knowing testing one of the
functionalities of this project butter
so it's kind of nice seeing what they
actually did on the colonel side blaming
it on an ICS rom right now and using
your kernel and possibly other kernels
as well could be seeing that cpu
performance increase if they're using
your cut one of those custom kernels yes
that's right but i have to say that
how's the work on the project butter is
Colonel the other out health is on the
android system so we can see some
improvements from that edge but not all
of it and most of the improvement is on
the Android that triple buffering does
most of the work so we just see a tiny
bit of the improvement this nice to see
that some attack be back for a little
bit by the development community Justin
even just a little bit let me know
though every little bit helps so I
wonder how much does it ramped up the
CPU does it go to a hundred percent does
it go to 90 how much does it actually
increase the CPU cycle clock cycle it
depends because the system is always
replica ramping down not only because of
the touchscreen if the system is running
applications on the background and I
touch the screen maybe it ramps to the
maximum if the system is not using
anything else if I touch the screen
maybe tramps up to the next frequency
maybe to the other next frequency it
depends on a lot of things not just my
pressure not just to me using obviously
it helps a lot because we need that
frequency power so for the Messiah
decipher the user space changes there
a nice talk at Google i/o called for
butter or worse that was full of really
horrible butter puns and it's actually
up on YouTube right now chet haase a
whole monkey the the the two tech leads
on the project talked about it and
apparently a lot of the improvements
were from the the UH triple buffering I
didn't realize they had some kind of bad
buffer management problems and a pixel
floor surface flinger that they by
adding additional buffering and they
were able to fix a lot of the latency
problems then you know what I said it
they definitely did I staff there
thursday morning at and compared my
phone my galaxy nexus running jelly bean
which we'll get to later with somebody
on ICS stock and just sitting there
doing similar functions you know side by
side i could definitely tell as well as
I oh they did the demo too they have
more much more sophisticated tempo than
I did but uh yeah I can definitely tell
was a lot faster yeah didn't it I oh
they act like a 4,000 frames per second
a camera and they did an ICS versa jelly
bean and they kind of opened up the at
work and jelly bean seems smoother and
it beat it but it was very smooth yeah
they use one of the cameras that Peter
Jackson used for the new Lord of the
Rings movie cameras are called wet so
the red / juice yes someone seeing this
can just go do it up right so beyond the
performance increases we have a whole
bunch updates did you know core
functionality such as you know home
screen widget which is neat yeah you
know before in ICS in below you have a
widget you add to your home screen if
there's an icon in the way or another
widget in the way you can't add it there
you know it turns all red you've all
seen it you know so we have to then not
put the widget down we have to go movie
icons all around make space to put that
widget there and then and then we can
put it there well that little hidden yo
little annoyance is no longer there in
jelly bean so as long as there's enough
room on the screen for the widget it
will move the icons around or
pre-existing widgets around Hilda's
danced all around the screen as you sit
there and move up and down left and
right and everything making room for the
widget it's very nice it's something
that you know you're like wow why should
we should pad it's all along you know
it's it's it's very very nice well Derek
it's actually funny that you mentioned
that because i'm learning ICS you guys
are running jelly bean i was running
making some widgets and I call it the
red screen of death because it makes a
little red and it's an it is definitely
an annoyance and it actually has annoyed
me a lot more recently knowing that the
problem is no longer there well I'll
tell you what's gone after the show
we're going to root your phone we're
going to put jelly bean on there so you
don't have that problem anymore right
buddy I went into a little bug I think
related to that teacher today when I was
you know dragging a bunch of icons out
of the the icon drawer on to the home
screen if I they wouldn't go into
folders sometimes and the icons would
end up chasing each other around the
launcher screen it was it was kind of
funny to watch because they the one icon
would not join knowing folder so i think
it's just a little bug they had stuff to
work out before they release the final
version i'm gonna try it no they are
chasing anyone okays know Oh game it was
so we had some other updates they say
core functionality uh who here doesn't
have a lot of pictures on their phone or
a lot of albums and when you take a
picture with your camera you want to cry
after you open it off it depending on
how many pictures has to load it can
take forever you know me using a google
plus and having a lot of different
albums and posting pictures all the time
wow it is so slow the gallery arm ice
cream sandwich you know it I almost
never wanted to even browse for an image
to set as a wallpaper it would take a
minute to search them all that's good
enough if it's learning instance like
it's nice day so but me on that you take
a picture with your camera and the
animation is completely change it it
 the image slides to the right so
like a terrace
all yeah yeah so yeah exactly so it's
loves you watching it it slides to the
right so um that's actually reversed it
some left all right so it's like this is
very fast I haven't tried it before yeah
what the hell yes no no I used to hate
that right so you see you take a picture
right see you hold your phone up and
take a picture you look at you like no
that's a bad picture I just did it my
bed oh you would have to delete it right
no not anymore you just flick up it's a
it's like a card doesn't come like webos
sir other functions on ICS you know
jellyby as soon as I saw that I thought
that's that's classic Matias Duarte
right there yes that's so good to see
flip right off the screen there goes the
bad picture you don't want big pretty
girls having some fun right now I just
want a picture like this disgust yes he
can get me to sit down just flipped left
right Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom it is
it's funny you mean as you can see
francisco's haven't I was like just
flick additions around and I I thought
that was amazing and it's something that
you're like wow why didn't we have this
before I mean it's very cool um Android
Beam was that was a add some
functionality to ICS was first
introduced and you know what I've never
used it in the past since December 17
months I've never actually not that's a
lot I've been two or three things to
people playing around but if you know
current things you can being two people
like contacts or a YouTube video or a
web page and hell not hey I just took
this picture all I want to send this to
you okay what's your email address you
need to go through all this crazy stuff
well well now with the new version
Android Beam and jelly bean you can beam
pictures and videos right to people so
now you take a picture and you can you
can send it right there being very cool
of course you have to have people to
have NFC enabled devices that those are
becoming increasingly more popular no
you can send vanilla the wall yes I'll
have I tried it no but uh oh I I wonder
how big the file size sure there has to
be a restriction you're not going to
send like this and now
long you know video Amy you know even a
five minute long video is pretty darn
law you know big and so I mean it
depends on the resolution and whatever
but I mean I don't know big you can a
sudden be interesting to see what the
threshold up on that is and uh you know
also I said I haven't tried it because I
don't have anybody is around me that's
running jellybean but as soon as I find
somebody that is I will try that it's
like you said spot you know it might
just be based on one side um so
notifications got a very interesting
overhaul what do you guys think about
the overall they've got a huge overhaul
awesome i love the multi finger gestures
I mean that's just adding so much more
functionality to your phone and it's
just great we have more options you can
can you make them all collapsed by
default um because I know that the top
one is always hot when the top ones
Oakland it depends see we take a picture
I'm sorry when I take a screenshot
allure you or someone for you share a
picture or take a picture yeah don't
nobody here's one of your somebody
shares a picture on google + pictures
are automatically open more so than the
third they're not collapse so you can
see like a little preview of the picture
so if I took a screenshot right now my
phone it would show you know the top
inch or something of a little preview
look at that i'm teaching francisco sink
industry sporting goods Lloyd yeah it
depends on the knee priority of the
notification there's there's a talk at
i/o about that i think the the what's
new in Android talk and they were
talking about all the different pre they
have different layouts for the new
notifications and I thin you can also
toggle they expanded the list of
priorities for notification so I think
if they're low priority they're not
expanded by default and emails you know
before you know any done eating just saw
who was from I remember if you saw the
subject really I don't remember okay
Scott shaking his head no but but now I
can actually see
first couple words or lines of email a
little snippet you pull down and you can
see like 5k yeah yeah it's like the
first six or something like that when
you when you open it up oh you don't
even me to go to the gmail out yes so
widgets are now actionable yeah you know
it's bigger not legit I'm sorry
notifications it is very very neat the
whole reason they did this is less clips
I know you don't the cap around anymore
oh I go and all you can embed action
buttons into them to for you know
calling back and whatnot is really
really useful miss calls knew right from
the woods yet that's the only one I've
seen actually uh the past two days
playing with it I'll know there's any
other one knocked off my head I think
they showed some proof of concept ones
and one of the talks but I hope we see
more soon now you can customize those
notifications let's say for example a
google plus I don't want any
notifications from there I can actually
go into that app and just say no more
people plus notice the patients so you
can turn off so if you have an apt it's
annoying but you like it the app put it
you know it sends you enjoy
notifications you just turn it right off
you don't have to worry about it just go
just hold down on the notification app
info and the check uncheck little boxes
allow notifications and you're golden
another feature that was released was
offline voice typing which i think is an
interesting feature you need a cellular
connection to actually write things um
pretty cool and if I mean if you're
going to be doing a lot of dictating
throughout the day and you don't have a
good service or you just don't want to
suck up your battery life kind of cool
oh you know what I i I'm a fan of that
somebody that commutes almost an hour
each way to work uh every once in a
while you know I want to set I want to
send a text message key know maybe mom
driving on a typo I'm driving because
that's not that's not safe right again
small amounts of things I don't do that
but uh but but that doesn't mean that I
won't hit the voice search button and
dictate my text message
I've done that before you know I'm
sitting there at a stoplight or
something you know you know it's
dictated text message but I draw a line
drive to work i drive through areas to
have no service i live out no no we're
right so i've tried to dictate a text
message when i have no service and it
just sits there searching and searching
searching and then never sent and I
generally get pissed and then that end
up typing it out or something you know
so that's very cool that's now rendered
locally you don't have to worry about
having servants I like it besides saving
lives you shouldn't do that when you're
driving but it's gonna be good Oh what
else we got new here with jelly bean
well we also got a high def or higher
definition contact pictures yeah thanks
cool contact pictures you know if
they're out the right resolution they're
going to be blurry and it's wasn't cool
you know and that was a server-side
problem if you sync your contacts let's
say you had a high-resolution picture
and gmail I believe her google contacts
with dumb it down there like 125 x 125
and then ICS to make it like 250 x 250
but still it's enough you know that's
nothing so there must be more of a
back-end change maybe I'm heard in one
of the side chats that the system wasn't
going to allow it to be over the size to
be overwritten by other services I
haven't tested it yet to be honest with
is but it's a very cool feature though
that I know that now I'm talking about
on the test and try it out later we also
got a phone app updates smart app
updates or basically it looks like you
download an apk in order to update that
APK it's actually going to add the
additional code in the apk and not make
you redownload the whole file so
basically what Google said is that the
data usage is actually cut down to one
third um which I think carriers will
like and I think people that
or not not on an unlimited plan will
like that well actually saw wood
interior not like that because now
they're not you know I'm using as much
date oh yeah I mean you can look it
users or users are going to make claim
the loan on their network is hurting now
one thing that we're not sure on that is
that might not be a specific to jelly
bean update because it's a Play Store
update so and from what i remember
reading is that devs don't actually have
to do anything you know it just all
happens on the back end all they have to
do is upload their their new app and
it'll go through bit by bit looking at
what has changed so if a developer
completely redoes their app that's and
that's gonna be a full apk you know it's
gonna be a big download but if somebody
just looks a like Angry Birds that's a
new level now the only Adele abebe up so
yeah that's not it means faster
downloads less data you know that that's
very cool and from I oh I believe it
looks devices from 2.2 or 2.3 and higher
that will get that but I do believe is
the Play Store upgrade very cool very
cool oh they're doing is they're also
encrypting apps now that you've if any
paid app is now stored encrypted I'm
guessing that's to cut down on piracy
yeah you know which helps out developers
such as a Francisco that has a few apps
on the App Store what do you think about
that and it's piracy we have you noticed
anybody uh you know parting your apps
yes are you a fan of the app encryption
than I assume I haven't read much about
it but the concept seems cool the piracy
happens piracy gist everywhere so even
for applications that cost like two
heroes come on people just copy the apk
and share it but we can just add some
licensing and it helps a bit so seeing
google come
certain RC it's it's very good let's
hope this helps in theory well last but
not least i wanna spend a man or two
here talking about google now and voice
search in my opinion besides the state
performance the coolest most exciting
features of jelly bean um I know that
that's pretty much the most i've played
with even though it it's you know it
might get redundant after a while in the
honeymoon phase I think it's gonna wear
off because people now is more than just
a assistance ok that's a gift a starting
with this here so voice Actions has been
around since august two thousand ten i
believe yeah so yeah android users have
had it boils huge just know maybe wasn't
as good because it wasn't an AI you know
it didn't give comical answers but you
know you can always say send a text call
remind me to you know simple things like
that it's always done but the new voice
actions are previously were there
instant they're completely accurate i
haven't had any problems at least um
they're very very fast I mean like I
said the learner near instant and
depending on the answer of the query the
question you asked it's going to be
dictated back to you which is something
that's you know something that's new a
video on youtube comparing Siri to
Google now a 10 interesting video just
probably go look at it yeah I actually
did that Thursday yesterday morning with
a co-worker that has an iphone and I SAT
there with her iPhone and hit the head
Siri and head voice google search voice
search everyone follow I hit them at the
same time and did did a few things and I
I was amazed it's
after its near instant the results were
better uh some of the things that you
can ask that I've played with and figure
it out I made a post about it earlier
where'd it go alright so you can ask for
well you know simple things like you
know what time is it obviously um you
can ask things like like the commercial
saying you know do I need an umbrella
today what's the weather tomorrow I lost
the weather right now no is it going to
rain Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday
insert a day of the week what's the
weather next Saturday you know things
like that you can do that you can find
dates I can say you know when is
Christmas this year what what day of the
week is the fourth of July for mine meet
up to make a google plus posted 8 p.m.
remind me in four hours remaining me in
12 minutes you know set alarm you know
the time now things you couldn't do
before sports fans are gonna love this i
can say i can say hey did the yankees
play today all right hey what's this for
the yankees game you know you're you're
you're visiting an area right and you
see I'm really hungry for panera bread
for lunch take me to panera bread how do
i get to panera bread show me the
closest panera bread you know and you're
going to get directions on how to
navigate there um now simple things you
can say how old is or how tall is a
certain person might have to be a famous
person obviously so you know if use like
you know president of a country prime
minister or the country now let me on
somebody like that drop a bomb on
something or if you say you know uh
Larry Page how old is Larry Page how
tall is here you know things like that
you can ask simple questions basically
what you can asking people search right
now and it talks back to you um you can
have it play music or youtube videos
like I can say or play Radiohead play
Coldplay nothing and things like that
and some artists it didn't work for but
the summit did it it brought up playlist
or fraud songs they might play music and
if I can have it
I can choose to play something by them
on YouTube you can it's been in the past
you say send a text and an email to
person hears the message until the call
but since it is google search for
everybody that has jelly bean right now
I hit the button and say do a barrel
roll your dog does it do it yeah it does
it wait no do a barrel roll do a flip
around it's it's it's loading right now
I'm on it just it just brought up the
meme that I know your meme page why do a
barrel roll mine does it mine flips
around I'll try to add up to a barrel
roll John is your slip around yep yeah
if you'll a barrel roll yeah so if you
say tilt it'll tilt okay so basically to
sum up for a voice search and Google now
it is a nexus that's just something I
voice search we haven't even touched
people now have google now it's a
completely different animal but those
are tiles as well those are tiles but
that's voice search google now is
automation google now has honestly
google now is not has nothing to do with
with voice search is now from google now
you can do searches and the more
searches you do with voice search does
make google mouth better for example if
i search for sports scores that's going
to then google now is going to say all
he's interested in the Yankees so we're
going to start showing him Yankee
information so they are related but
they're completely but there are two
separate animals so have any you guys
play around people now it did down
scared me yeah I wanted it's eerie well
after I put it on there i went to work
and it apparently knew where I worked
before like I didn't touch anything on
the Google now but it's it said like 27
minutes to go home no traffic delay and
I'm like okay you know i'm at work and
where I live without me actually
entering it in its kind of freaky well
very helpful now they do did you ever
enter that information into latitude at
some point latitude yeah all over your
working because that's where i can
actually gets home and work from
latitude but yeah I i installed it late
late night Wednesday night and I look at
it and it's like 58 minutes to work to
what the hell like ever I was I was very
surprised so yeah so I did not to get it
confused that Google now it's complete
automation um remember that patent that
maybe like a month or two ago was found
if you go filed for last fall and we're
all wondering hey is this that you know
is this a google assistant with it is
but it's a it's you know it's you now
it's more than just the assistant it
automates everything world oil
domination from google yeah so so a
personal example i'm at work um it tells
me how long it's gonna take me to get
home the opposite it tells me the
weather outside but neat thing is it
looks around where I'm at and says all
well is he going to go to you know hey
look here here's a beaver stadium you go
watch a football game here's the Bryce
Jordan Center go watch a basketball game
here's the creamery go get some ice
cream you know it's giving me locations
that I around to go do things and then
it also says you're standing you know
great right outside here and there's a
public transit system here so I get the
bus schedule in front of my building
because the bus stops there so I can and
I mean it's amazing so if you're
visiting an area you don't know if I
stop is one oo schedule is you put on
your phone you look at it and then it's
going to show you where the bus stop is
where the subway is what the what trains
to take you know what buses to take
everything so but Jared I wondered do
you ever check the bus do I well you
know what I do take it around campus
because Penn State University is huge
okay
so I'm just wondering like get it oh if
it gives you the card of you know public
transit let's say you you know disable
that that one turned on by the way I can
swipe it away well it will pop up again
until the data changes that's the thing
a lot it scared a lot of people like oh
wow these are all these are cool you
know then they get rid of that
notification or get rid of that card and
then there's a ball I broke it oh my god
i broke i take it whether back how i get
leather back well it's not going to show
you the information until the weather
data changes don't worry you didn't
break it you know whether doesn't update
instantly know it gets it from a third
party source so whenever that weather
data is updated that means the card will
be restored or notification I'll be
restored but Google now said gives you
right now information on whether as we
said traffic so as Johnson tamiya he
doesn't more metropolitan area than I do
so first road construction it might tell
him how you need to go this way home
because there's construction if you
search for a flight number then you're
most likely flying it assumes so you're
going to get flight data sports you know
maybe Yankees others talking about a
train you can do translation currency if
you're in a different time zone will
tell you your time back home and I said
it in places up there looking to add
more cards as time goes on but brought
me right now it is very quiet I as a
service that I would use on a daily
basis if I was away from home be
generally around him I don't think I
need to use it like one con it's kind of
an annoyance every place I've checked in
around town if I poor if I pull it up
right now it'll tell me how long it
takes to get there every place I've
checked in because i knows my location
data in those places I've been so I see
like all the gas stations and
restaurants or in the lake and
everything and tell me go here go here
to here here ah but I can just swipe
those away so anybody else
been using google now I've been ranting
and raving back for a few minutes here
anything I missed you like it you can
use it definitely is i mean i've been
using a fully search for 22 years now i
think so it runs off my voice it knows i
don't have to rip I don't have any
issues with it really I mean it it's
amazing I'm speechless on before we move
on to big rapids you go app updates uh
uh a whole bunch of questions thought
you were uh yeah I got a um what would
you guys recommend the Galaxy Nexus
erator the galaxy s3 well now the
jellybean just came out money answer is
gots next to some onion eric Moore well
uh well I I'm always been a nexus fan
but the someone ported jellybean to the
International unlocked galaxy s three as
well so you know go android community I
mean I'm I have to say I'm really just
amazed at the community this thing's
been out what two days and it's already
on three devices now sometime in the
afternoon and okay I was running it at
eleven-thirty yeah it's turns out anyway
although you might yup yeah Galaxy Nexus
or of sgs3 hmm i have both devices and i
can tell you that the galaxy nexus
became as smooth as the galaxy s3 so
little of the exes so you would say next
is then because of its update ability or
now i still prefer to use the galaxy s3
so the galaxy s3 i mean it might even
get faster with the jelly bean update oh
I hope so how are you John the master of
phones i think every week I talked to
your on a new phone so good but your
what you take on I got to stay with some
exes I hate overlays I mean it the Nexus
here you know so
what are other questions we have here
Scott um we have a question that looks
like about clockworkmod so using
clockworkmod touch 5.8 point 0.2 um are
you able to make a jelly bean back up
down eric s looks like you tried twice
and fails i'm using twerp I know works
on twerp John you're using clockwork
right yeah I used 5.8 point 0 2 and I
was just able to do it right now after
the question always posted okay so yeah
it looks like I mean it might be a case
for case basis but uh said John's able
to do itself and I am on the gsm version
on know if that's going to be what the
difference is if he's on LTE r ya try to
remember here Erica talk to you before I
don't remember if you're you're on LTE
or you're on which Mary you're on be a
so it looks but I can do it on what's
work a derecho you have the LTE version
did you do a clockwork mod backup I
haven't tried to back up jelly bean yet
I have the ICS back up but not jelly
bean yet yes yes back not mine went by
mine that's that's a horror story I can
talk about after the up oh I love
everything on my phone well he a long
long story short there's two versions of
jelly bean out there for the Galaxy
Nexus I'm not going to tell you which
one to run ah because people were having
hit and mrs. the boat but the droid
vicious one I couldn't my phone wouldn't
boot I had to fast food restore all the
factory images but the the JD now it's
called barren ve or whatever it's called
that one that works great for me but
said but you know people haven't hit
messed with each cell you know your
mileage may vary that's just my own
personal experience but I was water I
haven't no I've been restored to factory
image is a long time i will now we're
going to do some quick itself
so over the past couple days we've got a
lot of apps Google Apps actually updated
first one maps google maps and earth
earth brings three mapping capabilities
and an update to google maps brings the
ability to download maps for offline use
now take into consideration that
turn-by-turn navigation nap searching is
still unavailable without a data
connection which I hope that changes but
hopefully soon placed are all also got
updated to three dots 7011 place for
website also allows you to remotely
update uninstall and install android
apps I won't get into the search
features because the search function of
the app store online is not there yet
and like we talked about earlier app
updates will make the double portions of
the abk um if need be basically cutting
down on the apk size for updates and
also added to play store was magazines
you can buy a singular issue or you can
actually subscribe for a year and also
TV shows you can buy a singular TV shelf
rican by the whole season so content
going up making it more desirable pretty
awesome I think that's a great addition
you know to a place till I mean there
have something for everybody now you
know we didn't want to do books well hey
we got magazines you didn't want to do
movies well you can actually buy the
movie now you know and said just rent it
uh you know maybe that was stopping you
from doing it before maybe not like new
but you're all about TV show maybe you
don't have cable TV so they have
something for everybody their ecosystem
their content consumption you know his
ability is growing if it didn't grow um
the tablet that we're gonna be talking
about soon would be less desirable so
they need to actually keep their content
growing um honest more apps Google Drive
was updated I can quickly find files
that you can have been recently opened
or shared with you can also upload or
download any file type
or to your google drive which is
actually really nice you can also select
contacts to sure it easier that makes it
very very easy to share on google docs
also it has some faster navigation and
faster navigation while syncing in the
background and you can also align your
text in the document editor um currents
gotta fit in as well basically a little
bit it's a lot faster it goes hello holo
theme it's now actually an aics or jelly
bean hat you know yeah that was the
first thing I knows yep looks a lot
different I think it looks better I got
some things that hide automatically and
get some trending topics as well which
is kind of cool on the Google+ update on
google+ app got updated actually got a
phone update and it actually has a
separate everyday for talent the same
same APK but it's a it has tablet mode
now which i could for the past year you
know we've been hearing people yell i
want to tablet mode you know in you know
what do it worked on tablet it was a
tablet mode but i was was a you know
zoomed in phone mode you know there was
tons of white space or black space
depending on which I virginal yap he had
it would just felt weird using it from a
tablet gyasi I hated it I never used it
for my tablet just isn't right but but
uh now listening derrick's dog has a
mind of its own yeah yeah so I podcast
people hook my dog is sitting on my
chair and he is a cute little bastard i
love you anyways uh so so was i talking
about such keep dogs um pouco plaza
google+ that yeah the tablet app is in
his night I want to use the tablet app
or I want to turn my phone in landscape
mode so it looks like the tablet app you
know it it's nice like I don't I'm
telling you what this is the answer to
everything that people wanted for
Google+ so
if you're not happy with the tablet mode
you're never going to be happy because
it's definitely absolutely amazing
nothing um personally I hate the fact
that you swipe the side ah you know like
that I like that my big fan of it I mean
it's still a lot better than it used to
be um but it just left or right or I
don't know if anybody else notices I was
just actually invited to hang out that
cook on my Nexus you can now bluebox
people and you have the people showing
on the bottom individual videos Wow tell
pearl sorry I declined her hang out but
yeah you can actually blue box people
you got all the videos at the bottom of
everybody in there now very interesting
moving on YouTube got updated a
much-needed update in my from my point
of view um nice you are changes yeah I
like him it's kind of going along with
the new plus phone you I kind of get
that side bar that you can bring over I
like it and then you also preload videos
over Wi-Fi while charging well in you
can you can preload two types of videos
so all my subscriptions I can preload
those or you know how you have that
watch it later feature on what you guys
i've never used it um now maybe I'll I
want to because what anything that I tag
is a watch it later it'll precash those
as well so very very neat doc I might
try it out I have but one thing is you
actually do need an internet connection
to actually watch those cached videos so
it's not like you're downloading the
video which is uh what we're just
completely understandable just let's say
something got you know copyright it and
it got uploaded to YouTube you cast it
then hey I got it interesting i did not
know that so let's well it's better than
nothing not say that yeah and all the
caches on Wi-Fi and wall charger so just
listen I think that's pretty stupid I
additive because you know why would you
it doesn't make sense because they can
catch the file somewhere encrypt it and
still loading bullets offline well any
problems and without anyone cracking it
I don't understand the problem that's
stupid if you cannot give you want to
cash it you want to watch it later
without internet connection third rule
stupid anything you know Google movies
and all that stuff a watch so and
then chrome top did and notice how I
didn't say chrome beta and I lost the
beta test no chrome actually got a whole
bunch of things but because of some
recent developments with patent wars now
I'm gonna say what devices chrome was
now supported on because it may make
people when it's hang out rage and break
things but with that said yeah for
Android it is now no longer beta has a
scratch graduate hat on and everything
so we're getting some questions about
the nexus 7 I know I'm a lot of you
Paula tuned in just to hear about that
device so without further ado by the way
this show is running a lot on movies we
show no was going to run forever because
we got her someone to talk about so
Nexus 7 has a Tegra 3 processor now some
people such as developers on a fan of
that Tegra 3 processor but from a user
standpoint you know it has four cores
plus the one companion core and it's a
one point three gigahertz set and so
it's bad but uh said spec wise and we
heard long these before right that's a
88 1 gig ram 8 and 16 gig storage
depending on which version 7 inch screen
1280 by 720 you know no SD card and no
rear camera but there's a front-facing
camera which you know perfect because
the device is so small affordable it's
meant you know you can use hangouts on
to be accomplices whatever but you cares
about specs you know it's uh it's not
really you know meant for that in my
pain then you
it's supposed to be fast and fluid
portable you know lightweight easy to
use consume content but besides all
those marketing buzz words that make an
amazing device as I said earlier that's
a Tegra 3 and a lot of people don't like
developing on that so it'll be
interesting to see you know what type of
you know customization in terms of
kernels you know we get Francisco you
want to talk a little bit about that yes
I have a take away three in my home I
have a 1x Tegra 3 is a fast chip there's
no doubt about that the companion core
plus 4 course is a nice idea but I think
it's not very well implemented and it
can cause some leg especially if you are
using the companion car you can control
if you are using the companion color of
the quad core so you bought the control
device and you are using one core I I
don't like it on a colonel side the
drivers are really hard to it I have a
love of our time to read what they want
to do the drivers the routines when
changing the cores and going to the
companion cord that's not very clear
it's a clumsy called integra isn't very
friendly to the open source community
because i think they are controlling the
tag well cpus on the colonel like a
microkernel each other kernel or in
userland have no idea what they are
doing I can control what they do I can't
over call the device because we have
like six frequency tables come on it's
not easy what not not easy I think no
one will know the joy sorry you would
like to see in a nomad processor or
something Maximus
I was hoping I was hoping they would
introduce our map for 470 I would enjoy
that but I think tango tango 3 maybe
it's cheaper for them and after all it
has four chords in the 12th Corps GPU so
it's very powerful but I think not as
powerful as accents quad-core so it's
not bad at all but for the developer
community I think it's not it's not nice
I in my point of view it's just my pee I
know we have another question anybody
here pre-order a nexus 7 yep i reordered
that non thing before noon when I so
dare cross he did dirt muah ding up yup
you did Franco assume you didn't I can't
I can't tour the oh you can't oh you
know like lady you could work on I yes I
would but I can't order to put you okay
John I got anything in a 16 gig order
yesterday why would you order one beach
I wanted for my car and then try and do
a built-in car stereo system and
personally is yeah now Derek more which
one did good one today you would I got
the 16 okay why did you get the 16 a
couple reasons one I mean it was only 50
bucks to double the price so that's
that's a pretty good deal and also yes
even though a lot of my content is in
the cloud there are a couple games that
have really big downloads that you know
are inching up on a gig just just for
just for the game so if i wanted the
extra space just for breathing room yeah
I wanted something cheap I I got 88 for
200 bucks I you know I don't think I'm
gonna have a problem don't do a whole
lot of games I may I played what I may
play born because that was the game they
demoed and may have a pretty cool I was
a cool give them
but besides that game I mean I don't do
game so yeah eight games will be on for
me I do stream everything you know
through google play now also in Google
you move music and everything so I don't
need local storage so if you're like me
everything's in the clouds in the end I
think the eight gates perfect but as
Derek steady know ok if you're a huge
Android gamer you might need some extra
space or not John which one which one
you gonna hook up in the car made bigger
than 16 game the gig I have everything
on the cloud storage for my tethering
plan so I mean hang out mobiles uh music
on the go if I can figure out to hook up
the Q &amp;amp; 7 in my car it'll just be sweet
now Scott could you work um episome so
I'm kind of keeping maybe in the future
on near future I'll decide in the next
couple weeks now you have a zoom Wi-Fi
or LTE el tee hee oh how does hot Sun
yeah i'll just say no matter you'll get
jelly bean is supposed to come out for
the zoom here you know in the near
future oh I was doing you're gonna get
it yes uh 2380 months after you know
what for what it's worth I heard a rumor
earlier today a rumour Rumour a rumor
that Verizon was looking at the end of
July the Galaxy Nexus now that is an as
you complete number there's nothing it's
so like that rumor I like that are you
talking enough so uh if that rumor is
true then zoom LTE would probably get
into this and that is a nun confirmed
rumor somebody was talking about it I
they're talking actually a lot of my
posts on google cost so yeah I'm kind of
on that note I mean I I think one of the
most important things that Google
announced that no one's talking about is
the the platform development kit like
they're actually going to give om's
access to the source early and I really
wanted to hear more about that because I
think that's sort of the you know the
Android upgrade Alliance take two that's
how the fragmentation hopefully well you
know yeah about em co co what's
impossible
it might alleviate it has to find out
lead time I'll tell you what it's not
going to hurt you know it can't hurt it
can only help so it's like s Derek Moore
said admits last year I 11 they
announced the Android Alliance to get
down timely updates and then we never
heard from it again a year later so
hopefully the PDK PSA okay thank you
today yeah hopefully the PDK a platform
development kit helps alleviate some of
that pain okay so let's move on to the
other device the ball with a blue /
multicolor ring the Nexus Q um it's gone
on sale for two hundred ninety nine
dollars and basically it's a ball and as
an Android computer um it's basically a
social sharing platform um is what I got
out of the google i/o and interesting
functionality and basically picture
yourself going to a party somebody's got
a nexus q and you got a whole bunch of
people with a whole bunch of music in
google music and they got android phones
go over to the house you make your own
playlist the master playlist and it's
just awesome because you're sharing your
song or somebody else but the thing is
you're not giving your song so I I know
all they did that with the copyright so
it's legit but it's pretty interesting I
personally think it's overpriced what do
you guys think it's a look-see nexus in
the books we don't this Queen John girly
bought one so let's let's hear from the
man had shield out 300 bucks for that I
seriously didn't know what it was until
about five hours after i bought it um I
seriously just thought Nexus the deaf
community is going to make it to where
it needs to be so I had no worries I see
this being a replacement for my blu-ray
network
player welcome to my netflix the deaf
community actually got a game running on
I believe yeah 24 hours yeah yeah which
is I mean get some up there so Gorski
situation I just have a giant death star
/ email looking device you because yeah
it allows you to socially choose what
you want to watch and what you want to
listen to besides that the streaming
functionality is in devices that are you
know like the vizio google TV they only
cost a hundred bucks it's two hundred
dollars cheaper so I'm really not sure
what's gonna happen with it I mean it's
very cool I can walk up to it because it
has NFC and tap it so that's cool but
besides like a deep gadget I don't see a
lot I don't see besides like techies
buying you know what see any use for it
I I don't not know why Google just
didn't integrate this into the google TV
um because that would make sense that
this product in a Google TV let's make
the google TV costs 150 maybe even 200
if it had all this functionality yeah
might be worth buying it 150 I think
would be good yeah I don't see how this
integrates with the rest of their
product line I mean it seems like it's
what sort of competes with Google TV and
if you just want to socially play music
I mean there's other apps you can use to
do that I mean why not just use you know
Spotify or something it seems that and
that you have to have an android device
interact with it just I don't see a lot
of these getting sold but I mean it's
more than just a you know a phone shaped
ball and he actually has an integrated
amplifier so you can plumb speakers
right into it yes it can replace your
home stereo your your home blu-ray
player yeah but social sharing needs to
be portal portable so okay I'm gonna
plug in my stereo and then poet I gotta
unplug it oh when I come home I got a
blood back in that could be a nuisance I
I'd like to see where it goes um I
didn't buy 1i
not going to buy one right now I'm going
to wait a little bit John when you get
yours let me know maybe I'll drop down
to your house you're only like two hours
away we'll play around with it I like
some dog step on mike's st a square /
place for our turntable channel and not
just share music that way Chris so let's
move on talk about jelly bean for other
devices um as we're hinting out earlier
and talking about earlier the Galaxy
Nexus gsm actually be tacked to version
from google the google play store that
version was handed out at i/o and within
a few hours of the deaths turning the
phone on it received jelly beans the
over-the-air update and then because our
community is absolutely amazing you know
they took nandroid backups and poured it
over to the regular gsm version and then
because our community is even more
amazing people took that version and
ported it over to the toro or the
verizon LTE version now it's not and you
know it's not compiled version it
support to basically what they do is
they take all the files that are
supposed to be on the LTE version and
drop them over to you know drop them in
the rom remove all the GSM files edit
some files at it some xml and small you
know whatever on the standard porting
routine and you have a as close to
possible jelly bean ramen and said most
of us been running it for a day or two
generally without any issues mean it
took a day to get some bugs ironed
outfit it's completely stable i use it
as my daily driver i would use it for
the next year's my daily driver it works
great um it has been ported to the 1x
it's not fully working into some
features don't work ah the sgs3 the
galaxy s3 it hadn't pointed over to that
but i don't think everything's working
yet either now right before the show
started you guys were
and about it the nexus s image is being
released is that what I heard nexus 7
all the nexus 7 image is okay I thought
I heard you say Nexus S I was gonna say
that's it that's really quick we heard
the nexus s and the neck Galaxy Nexus
gsm version as well as the zoom should
be getting it in a couple weeks google
announced that so if you have any of
those devices and you're not into you
know bleeding edge getting it before
you're supposed to you'll get it here
you know maybe two weeks or so as well
that's when alsp is not dropped so we'll
start seeing custom moms um I believe
they are going to push through your
speed in like ten days knock knock more
HP comes first and images so I really
will come faster than you think let's go
to have that they put the nexus 7 images
out there that means people already
starting to already start ripping them
apart making custom roms form which in
my opinion you know I they got a silly
you know give people you know play with
it for at least a week figure its
internals out and then start ripping it
apart you know but that that's my
opinion in word I'm sure we all think
differently are we talking about porch
I'm talking about I'm talking about
running a custom rom you know i'll go
ahead and read about it for a minute so
I've read your I've read your post about
that post yes long story short is people
were making custom curls already in rom
tweaks already for these ports now and
these aren't fully stable ports good
because the ports and there's already a
couple things along with them so they go
ahead neck throw more stuff into the mix
by you know tweaking kernels puts roll
wait a second let me explain the the
kernel source it's stable comes directly
from the source it's not hacked it's not
kind of San I understand that the
colonel sources is available
yes so we can get and try to improve the
reports experience and since we are
going to build our next kernels based on
that code there's no problem in starting
to the changing so I understand that
it's just that either I would prefer
that if the two wrongs that are out
there came with the stock kernel yes
said of instead of fox kernel or you
know franco.kernel they came with the
stock kernel and then users could flash
these experimental new kernels
themselves I think that is an absolutely
stupid to throw more bugs into the mix
right off that you know yeah that's just
it makes me know it makes the experience
bad and but to be honest with you I
guess the colonel but I'm running it's a
stock kernel but I guess you compiled it
actually yes I go to sources and I come
pumped because they be installed the end
the script leverett's r and says
something I I see your name on it so but
enjoy vicious put it off on his thread
and it when i run that it says script
thanks to Francisco Franco but but
anyway I compared the build number of
the colonel so what I'm running is the
same thing as the stock kernel on the
gsm version right now so it is that but
in my opinion you know anybody that
wants to flash these columns on their
galaxy nexus is go ahead they're
completely stable but make sure you
download the stock kernel as well and
flash that and then when you want to
start testing or not bleeding edge stuff
go ahead and uber these other guys
connells me they know what they're doing
but you know there's no there's no
reason to throw more kinks in the mix
from day one Satan's taste-off figure
out how it works know how it works and
then start tweaking it you know because
anybody I tell the difference you know
like it I would hate to see jelly beans
before jelly beans performance or
concept degraded because you know you're
running a custom kernel off the bat I
would be welcome sir concerning about
years a user one twix than just colonel
because the lungs are not based from
source so i think that's more
problematic than installing the colonel
but I see what you mean you are I agree
with you so hopefully he said hopefully
somebody out there ports doesn't clean a
hundred percent clean poor you Nellie
drops the files and then it's the files
that need to be that make support work
and you know doesn't do any in it that
be changes or whatever other people are
doing but after all after all 40 support
it's not the compound from source it's
not the same thing I know beggars can't
be choosers I should be happy with what
I'm running right now but if it could be
better i want to be better yes I week so
last but not least I who watched the
project glass keynote demonstration yep
who had your mind one idea looks pretty
awesome I am getting them instead yeah
right now they're available at i/o for
1,500 bucks yeah is that a raffle price
or is that I can purchase it if I have
fifteen dollars you can purchase it it's
not your purchasing it there was a good
promise between you and google that when
they did you get the first walking it
the first ones and then you pay that
yeah i just take this that's all I do
now for those who didn't watch it I'm
going to pull fine the video and post it
later you need to go watch that it's a
Google+ Hangout broadcast on air like
this is right now just cool um they jump
out of a blimp even cooler and they film
the entire thing all the jumpers the
skydivers whatever they're called all
wear glass so we were seeing what
they're seeing as they're falling to the
earth in it you know then they you know
scale down the building and ride bikes
and
and you always extreme me on sports
you'd stop taking them to get up on
stage to yesterday the glasses and
everything that it was very very cool I
absolutely loved it but because this was
all very cool but why do you want
another device catching more moments of
you uploading them to Google servers
they know what were you leave they know
where you go then they will be like your
eyes they will see what you see all to
serve you better at I'm okay with that
yeah I mean that's how they make their
money they they need to know a decent
amount of information about the people
that they're serving at you because you
know nine degrees on their business is
ads so I it makes sense but it's up to
the end consumer on whether or not it is
worth it for them I mean if you're on
other types of services if you're in
skydrive or if you're on Facebook or on
Twitter I mean your information is
getting shared there too and they know
information about you and it's whether
or not you want to do it or not so let's
remember that the end user wants to buy
a 15 pair of glasses and show his
friends oh my god i have a 1500 glasses
look at me then user things like this
most of the end user yeah but the 1500
is for the developer model only it's not
for the end user that they're coming out
2014 okay okay sorry know what else is
still it's still a bad idea in my
opinion I don't want to share my house
wine whatever I do with you it's another
relationship but I think it's such a new
new type of device that we don't really
know what its gonna get used for yet I
mean maybe it'll just be for obnoxious
ad serving but I don't think mean the
use cases they talked about so far you
know people taking pictures and
uploading it to share with friends and
family and I don't really have a problem
with that as long as it's not
he's on no yeah i think it means they're
looking at enhance you know enhanced
your life so I think that it's cool i'm
gonna buy one pending my wife Leslie
spend much money I can handle your wife
I got this well I don't know if I could
afford over $1,500 for a pair of glasses
I just don't know if I do it well I that
that's for the developer version i'm not
sure that the consumer costs will be
lower yeah those ruling so good yeah so
there's a whole lot other stuff that
happened to google i/o um there's a lot
to cover that we didn't you know
additional information to cover it we
didn't talk about there's anything that
you would like us to touch touch on talk
about for a few minutes here go ahead
and leave us a comment and we'll do our
best to talk about it but said we try to
cover the main things that were most
interesting and not most popular um they
said that's that's really about it
personally I oh we forgot to mention a
rumor good is rumored according to to do
I completely forgot about it I don't
know why I did um silly there's no
Griffin is two things there's a security
feature was added to they face on lock
um so let's say my friend got a picture
of me I wanted to unlock my phone with
the face unlock that's cool if now he
actually can't because they added a
feature that you have to blink um yeah I
actually took a pic took screenshots
that yesterday and I wanted to write an
article an android authority about it I
not busy last night and I won't be able
to do it tonight but tomorrow as long as
nobody else writes on the radio right up
on that yeah it's not a blank I'll tell
right now it's close your eyes for one
second
because I blinked you like after
watching I'm blanking now and it didn't
do it something there blinking blinking
i'm like 'i didn't recognize you you
know they tried again blink not again as
I ok me close my eyes one one-thousand
open and then it worked so whenever you
try it you'll do a normal blank or even
on delayed blank make sure you really
wait a second so the screen can see your
eyes closed and that's what it does it
wants to see your eyes closed because
then if you open your eyes quick enough
you can see your eyes closed in the
yellow and that small delay and then you
can see it if I did authorize you so
it's a neat feature though uh you build
a picture off anymore and unlock it the
rumor of us talking about is the nexus 7
might have a big brother Nexus oh yeah
yeah digitimes reported that earlier
that day at some insider information
that a 10 incher is coming so if you're
not used to holding the 7-inch or in
your hands i know i had a question when
you guys coming don't you guys think do
you guys think that they will go
directly an apple to compete with apple
and offer a freedom freedom us are on
the same prices too or do you think
it'll be a you know we're going to lose
money when we sell these but it'll be
with content that we make it up
hopefully both yeah yeah hopefully both
go after the ipad and I don't know
effectively happen you gotta some type
of you know what ya mean they're selling
the nexus 7 basically at cost so that
they're you know an entirely trying to
make money off content there just the
same thing that amazon did but they were
losing money right there was something
like that oh well it's a rumor they
didn't say out on when uh brady was an
interview he didn't actually say you
know how much it cost them you know what
they were making or selling on it but
you know since it's a Content device and
it's sold too cheaply they're probably
not making a whole lot on it and they're
going to make it up with content similar
to what you know amazon is doing four
hundred dollars what do you guys think
price point if
these rumors true what do you think the
price point will be you got to depend on
the spec we can't go anything without
the specs exactly so do you think it's
going to be a full-blown tablet that
competes with the ipad directly or do
you think it's going to be a fever one
with Nvidia's you know kai the low-end
storage model of it I bet will be 300
Andrew bucks the high-end storage heavy
yeah they let me know if they have a 32
gig version or something our owner will
have a 16 gig or something like that or
3264 I don't know but the low end
version will probably about 300 350 okay
let me check CPOE questions here said
the aisle lot information to talk about
so um one thing about I oh they do one
mention because it's hot it's a hot
topic right now earlier today Apple and
Google Apple and Samsung I guess had a
legal ruling that may result in G God's
Nexus getting banned in the u.s. not
sure on that it all depends what Apple
tries to do plus the judge didn't rule
that song their patents such as slide on
law you know the thing that people been
doing for thousands of years at the door
is patented by by Apple and Android uses
that similar liquids of four patents
once what one has to do with search
multi-source search your dad yeah it was
federated search the slide to unlock
their data detector patent the same one
they used against HTC and the fourth one
was um on-screen keyboards with the
predictive text input yeah so basic
functions predictive text multi search
functions so he would even affect jelly
bean you know I mean these are standard
functions and then phone if you could
potentially affect quite a few smart
phones yes I'm curious to see how Apple
plays with this because if they go
directly at Google then you know who's
going back at apple and
at mica temperature it will hurt
consumers though because they'll be
wasting money during number well and
this is also subject to Apple posting I
think a 96 million dollar bond basically
the Apple has to put up some money in
case this you know they lose that they
can reimburse samsung for lost profits
yep okay so if you have any other
questions uh go ahead and hit us off and
we'll try to answer them next week where
we'll hopefully have some more jelly
bean information to throw at you on a
thank our friend John for joining us
