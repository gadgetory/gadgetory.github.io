original android hangout show on google+
I'm Derek Ross I'm Scott Anderson bad
Charlton and I'm Johnathan Franklin this
week we're going to talk about how Apple
launched a new Android experience
platform and we're all switching to it i
kid i kid i were to talk about some
google acquisitions our cruzerlite
contest results scott's gonna hit up his
favorite thing some android app updates
and John's gonna talk about some devices
we're going to talk about some industry
news and routing and ramen and then
we're going to wrap up the show by
actually really talking about iOS 7 and
what we think about it as Android user
since we know that our bread and butter
are staple up google+ pretty much hated
on iOS 7 the the last couple days so
we're gonna you know we we truly think
about it all right so let's uh let's get
started first I want to start out by
saying a little public service
announcement if you signed up for google
play music all axis on the day it was
officially launched which was the first
day of google i/o may 15 if you signed
up that first day you're free 30-day
trial is going to expire tomorrow and
you're going to start getting billed so
you need to make a decision tonight if
you want to keep the service or if you
want to get rid of it if you waited a
day or two before you start of the trial
and you have another day an easy way to
determine when your all access trial
ends if you want to cancel it is to open
up the app go into settings and on it
and write in settings it'll tell you
when your billing period begins or visit
the app on the Play Store it will list
subscription and when the billing period
begins ahh real quick prices on that if
you don't remember
it's 799 until june thirtieth and then
after that it goes up to the full price
of 999 so you have 15 days really to
decide if you want to save two bucks a
month I I'm gonna do it I've never
purchased a music subscription before
and I've never you know bought Spotify
never bought pandora any of the others
but i like google music and I've always
liked it and I've I've actually found a
lot of music through it you know the
past month so I'm gonna buy it I'm gonna
you know it's only eight bucks a month i
think that's not gonna break my bank and
I like the service so i'm gonna do it
how about you Dan what do you have you
been using it I used it for a little
while and I like it I've never I've
never really tried any of the other big
music streaming services I guess I don't
think about frame of reference for it um
ultimately though I just don't listen to
another music just i would spend the
page or five dollars we did that on ok
John how about you what are you gonna do
with all access they can use me you're
gonna buy it i have been using it i was
a spotify subscriber i do like the fact
that this kind of merges together the
music in my own collection with
streaming so to me that that in itself
makes it more convenient so i'm probably
going to continue the subscription and
the predictive aspect of it really makes
it better to all right and and scott i
sit down i see your bed is not me we're
talking about that first i went to the
place that I've learned how to do it and
now I just need to implement it um you
forgot already yeah alright so so what
bektas yes music are you going to have
you been using it you're gonna buy it I
haven't been using it and kind of the
same sense of as Dan I don't I can't
really justify that amount of money
going to something that I don't use a
lot like Netflix if google had send up a
video subscription thing I would justify
it because hey I watch a lot of TV and
movies and all that type of video
content but audio is more of an
on-the-go thing like and I'm
on the go as much as I used to be so
yeah okay videos scription so bad though
out of the four of us you know fifty
percent are gonna stick with it I use it
every day going to work and coming home
to work so I I'm gonna yeah that's worth
it to me i got an hour drive each way I
know that it's like a new service but I
wonder if anybody's watching this are
you guys going to subscribe to it and
are you going to get it before june for
you um yeah let us know in the comments
what you think about all access if
you're gonna buy it in the next few days
then be interested in to see if you know
if it's 5050 kind of like the android
authority on air team all right so uh
continuing along with ecosystem news
google bought popular crowd sourcing gps
navigation app company ways for 1.3
billion dollars and now Scott you said
you actually have used ways before if
you want to talk a little bit about that
it's pretty much like a crowdsourcing
navigation system it's if you were to
see an accident on someplace and your
own really really slow you would report
that or let's say there's a blocked Road
that has you know that doesn't have
access on one side of the road you can
report that and it'll you know different
you around there whereas with Google
Maps it doesn't really have that because
it's not to the second updated it is
updated with like places and details and
stuff like that but like with regards to
directions ways really excels in that so
the social traffic you know reporting
aspect of it you think that we might you
know you think that would be beneficial
to see that in google maps in the future
i think it'll be some type that they'll
have to integrate some type of thing
like that with regards to navigation um
I don't know how they would do it though
because it is I've you use the app and
it's somewhat bloated in the sense of
reporting there's just a lot of stuff
going on with that app I mean you can do
a lot of
with it but you know with more things it
comes it gets really hard to put it on a
such a small device and scream that it's
really difficult so they might do some
things um what do you guys think I think
mm-hmm for navigation glass to me is a
better platform to do that with because
glass gives you all those tools to
actually report to something like Waze
instantaneously like you can say ho glad
ok glass take a picture it's already
location in context aware so you can say
you take a picture and upload this to
you know the social aspect of it and
then it's a done deal you know you don't
have to pull your phone out and go
through all these context menus if you
just notify a glass real quick I think
that's a better navigational experience
than on phone by default so if you see a
traffic accident you would use you know
ways on glass to take a picture of the
accident and upload it you're saying
yeah just be lightning fast you know it
wouldn't be an inconvenience to let
people know what's going on one thing I
think I think there are days like it
Danny isn't wave like a contextual app
like doesn't it learn your route for or
something like that ya can ok I think
Google's out to the data more than the
app I mean this guy you comin up a big
bloated but I don't think they're
looking to replace max ways I think
they're looking to suck in all the ways
data and the you know the easy ways that
users can submit that data and just
bolster mats yeah I mean it's got about
a user base of about 50 million and that
user base you know Google would like
that yeah okay all right well so if you
use ways I know some of you've already
commenting saying that you do use ways
and you you you like it so uh let us
know you know if you use ways if you're
excited about this acquisition if you're
excited to see some type of Google
fication of ways or integration the
current apps all right so let's uh let's
talk about a contest all right so we

and have fun alright so let's talk about
some app updates Scott Anderson's
favorite part of the show so we got some
new stuff from the Google+ app update
first of all when you launch the app it
now with the last update it when you
launch the app the stream wouldn't
refresh which was annoying you'd have to
click the refresh button it's a tap here
very fresh well now it refreshes right
away when you launch the app that's
guys you can also delete photos from
photos view which again is nice
performance improvements also global
notifications so if you see a
notification on desktop then it will get
taken away from the mobile so that's
good google music got updated you can
keep music on your device a lot quicker
you can have there's a low medium and
high bandwidth setting for mobile
bandwidth usage search quality
improvements and overall reduced data
which is always nice with those low
detik caps also google released google
cloud print this was a nice feature
there were some third-party apps that
would hook into the printing service
before and now google has released their
own official one can meet works very
simplistic you know very easy to use but
who prints things these days you guys
print things horribly ever okay yeah you
know Scott I was trying to think when i
installed that app is like wow this is
so cool I've wanted I've won this for so
long and I remembered wait a second i
used to use the third party version of
this a year ago why haven't i used in
the year ah that's right i don't print
anymore but you know if I'm ever out and
about and I need to print something on
my home that's waiting for me when I get
home or something I can uh it's an added
bonus feature I don't know how often
i'll use it you know at work I print
more than I do home but still not that
often it is worth noting that Google
just struck a deal with HP along with
bringing google apps to allow you in a
lot of different places as far as
enterprise goes so this is a really
timely kind of update for that to take
place
yeah and then press got updated John no
you use press yeah the they did have a
couple of UI enhancements including uh
dropdowns to get to your feet a little
bit faster where it used to take you to
a different view but the biggest thing
worth noting is that they're adding
support for feed Wrangler and feed bin
both of those are actually subscription
models but the app also knows that
they're going to be adding support for
fever and feedly in the near future and
feedly is actually going to be a free
model that's similar to Google Reader is
it back end that's the main thing that's
worth noting is even if you don't use
press we're about two weeks away from
the google reader shutdown so all of
your favorite RSS readers are very
likely to get an update very soon and on
your end as a user you need to make sure
you decide which one that you want to
use and get yourself ready to migrate
away from google reader in the process
you know get your feeds migrated over to
feedly or wherever you want to use and
go ahead and make sure that's ready
because they're ready to swap over to
this now cocoa and we did have some
device news kind of small device news is
the the galaxy s4 zoom it is official
and it is a phone and camera hybrid
because we all love hybrids on this one
kind of rounds out the whole galaxy s4
lineup which we have the s4 there's four
mini the s4 active now we have the s4
zoom and you also have the s4 Google
Experience edition but this one's going
to come with a 4.3 inch qhd display a
1.5 years dual-core processor one and a
half gigabytes of ram 8 gigabytes of
onboard memory with an x SD card slot 16
megapixel camera with 10 times optical
zoom and optical image stabilization so
the camera on it actually should be very
nice and of course you've got all the
usual connectivity in the phone which is
LTE Wi-Fi Bluetooth
or in NFC and oddly they have an event
scheduled for June twentieth in London
to announce we'd really don't know what
they're going to announce because ever
since they've scheduled that event
they've already officially announced
three phones and two tablets so rumors
are pointing toward they're also being a
galaxy camera two successor which is
kind of the non phone version of this I
would think and that kind of rounds out
your devices so it'd be interesting to
know what the users think on this one
kind of all of the s4 not just the s4
anymore you know the galaxy s lineup is
branching out to the you know in
addition to the house for but to Mitch
devices that kind of cater to a very
specific usage scenario you know I'm
kind of worried that Samsung's running
the risk with so many devices that
they're spraying the resources so thin
on the software side because you know
it's tended to be in the past where if
you didn't get a flagship Samsung device
you're just not getting software support
and I think that's the direction like
ship Samsung device you're not being
very good software support that's true
but you know the s4 and the flagship
models are really the only ones that
really get decent softwares and
everything yes whatever number and
everything else is just kind of
forgotten about I think that's the area
that they need to improve on is making
sure that there are a lot of countries
where people just can't afford to have a
flagship device but they deserve to have
a really premium song of software
experience on the phone I think that's
where the market needs to head because
nobody has really done that on the low
end I think there's money to be made
like that nanos got kilometer my son
everyone we talked about this a little
bit last week but it's because the
manufacturers aren't really held
accountable for the quality of the
devices carrying it so until the Samsung
and HTC and LG motorola are the people
who get the phone call when somebody's
upset with the device instead of verizon
and sprint or t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T what do
they care
yeah just want to you know sell as many
and not necessarily i think that the low
end needs to have what samsung did with
the high end is have a consolidated you
know brand recognition where people even
if they're talking about a good solid
for the money device they know to get a
samsung you know whatever they decide to
call it because that's you know if you
can dominate the low end and get brand
recognition on that just like you do
with the high end then they could really
open themselves up to a continual you
know brand loyalty yeah getting into
some industry news t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T are
expanding their LTE role house with a
bunch more cities for both carriers
meanwhile in the ongoing drama over
who's going to buy sprint and Clearwire
clear where board is now recommending
that the except DISH Network's offer for
about forty nine and a half percent of
the company a dish is offering market
value and syringes offering button valor
10 per share below market value which is
about a quarter of the value of the
company full market uh so cleaners board
is recommending to the shareholders that
they vote for the dish network deal um
to clear dish isn't trying to buy out
there are with us they're trying to buy
half of clearwater sprint still owns the
other half one way or the other uh
meanwhile softbank is pumping their
offer for sprint up to twenty one point
six billion dollars we're still just
under five billion dollars less than
DISH Network's offered by script so if
dish can scoop up clearwire that
definitely makes them a much smarter fit
for sprint meanwhile if Softbank can't
get their hands on sprint they
apparently her looking at potentially
mobile ions which would definitely make
deutsche telekom packing because they've
been trying to get rid of a company
forever but you know otherwise a lot
interesting back and forth between
softbank and Dish Network fighting over
sprint right now so it'll be interesting
to see who comes out on top of that
hopefully of spring can put their crap
back in winter ones that end so Scott
how are things going in V fruta dry then
I don't know if Scott's prepared to talk
about routing and ramen not this week
anyways alright so I'll cover root and
rom and all Scott you make your bed next
week mine maybe you promise to make your
bed I'll cover it and ramen for you
alright so so cyanogen aka Steve Kondik
took to Google+ this week to demonstrate
something that he hopes to get merged
into mainline cyanogenmod and and that
is incognito mode for acts it basically
does exactly what it sounds it allows
for you to take you no privacy into your
own hands it gives you a mode where you
can choose to deny applications act
access to your personal data you know
such as your messages your contacts your
your call logs so hopefully this gets
implemented in the future and it's a you
can't pick and choose you want it turned
on for this app but not that app and
this happened not that I'm it's a one
size fits all you either enable
incognito for everything or you don't so
I think this is very cool um it'll be
interesting you know how many people
will start to use it since so many apps
out there you know request this this
type of data you know for you know so
many freemium apps request list so they
can you know sell your data um I would
use it and I would turn on a heartbeat
and if it does get merged in the
mainline cm um liquid great tons of
applications unless it's feeding them
incorrect unless it's you know feeding
them bad data i I'm not sure on the
implementation of it well even still
something like say a contact replacement
well obviously if you're using a contact
replacement app you probably can't use
incognito mode
right but I mean this is a huge swath of
regular use cases that are just broken
buttons I don't really see this as
something that's beneficial we can
remember that cyanogenmod is only eight
miles out of a billion users there's
only five million people using science
in water or so even still they've looked
at some rather radical things before and
backed off when Google or other powers
to pee more or less said that's a bad
idea don't do it I definitely think this
was a bad idea don't do it I get that
everybody's all about privacy and blah
blah blah but come on and that's an
interesting thought you know I do
nothing to say to your Indian but but i
would i'd like to be in control of of my
data you know i think that i'm curious
to see if it pans out if it does make it
in the mainline cm i think the obvious
answer to this problem is actually
something you could cherry pick from
blackberry where blackberry actually did
allow you to have individual control of
permission for their apps and a lot of
that was because they did it for
enterprise reasons but they you know if
Google did this as a you know but then
you run into the issues of developers
being able to monetize because users
could actually you know cut off a
channel for monetization from them so
that's a real sticky issue yeah all
right so in other in ramen news not so
much root in ramen but developer news um
sony opened up their Smart Watch program
and basically said to developers have at
it they posted the open-source binaries
and code examples up on their website
and they're basically telling developers
to go ahead and flash alternative
firmware which is root and ramen but not
the same written arrahman it that we
would you know considering android and
ramen you can see the details for more
information at sony developer world if
you're you're interested in and you know
this is it this is very cool for
wearable tech because right now you know
not a whole lot of wearable tech is
open-source up you know so this is great
for developers to basically push
wearable technology or the Sony's
SmartWatch now too
to the next level and you know pebble
doesn't you know pebbles not open source
but a pebble is also very popular so
this is Sony basically saying hey wait a
second we're not the only smart watch
out there and we're open source now and
in other route and ramen news one of my
favorite Android ROM so paranoid android
open source they're increasingly popular
halo concept and if you're not familiar
halo is think of it as facebook chat
heads for everything and not just chat
it is for every app that there is it
works with every app it's a way to view
your notifications what and open the app
that produced the notification in a
separate window on top of what you're
already viewing so let's say I'm
listening to music or scrolling through
my playlist on google play music all
access dan sends me an email I go gmail
notification normally I may be a you
know normally I would have to stop
looking at the playlist to read and
respond to Dan's email now I can
basically have that still stay there and
a window pop up and reply to Dan's email
if I want all without having to leave
play access though there's tons of in I
don't know if that was a greatest
example cuz it's good but uh it's a very
neat feature ID it's probably coming to
a custom rom near you even if it isn't
paranoid android a lot of random roms
are implementing it right now so go
ahead and check that out and let us know
what you think i think it's a pretty
revolutionary concept into notifications
and multi window support because it is
multi window and it's not samsung's
implementation of multi window um but
not at all and it's substantially better
because your multi window is on samsung
as clumsy really calm
and speaking of revolutionary concepts
we had a few people comment at the
beginning of the show saying oh we
missed the Apple iOS segment of the show
you did not we're gonna we're going to
talk about why Dan John Scott and myself
are going to be switching to iOS 7 and
leave an Android I can't finish that
sentence um yeah so so John let's talk
about since you know so you know since
you're Johnny Frank lets you know you're
kind of similarly named to jony ive's
that's lenze yes now let's have the the
meeting of the John's let us know what
what's coming with iOS 7 and why do we
wanted and why we don't want it why do
we love it why don't we hate it why do
we love and hate it I want to enter a
screen share here to kind of just give a
visual representation all right so so
those of you that are listening on
soundcloud or put another podcast later
John's gonna show us some screenshots so
I don't want to try to describe what
you're looking at yeah really kind of
rapid fire just so that podcast
listeners aren't left out completely but
you know we'll just kind of cover it
real quick um alright so here we go the
first thing you're going to see is the
iOS 7 obviously the lock screen is
completely different it gives rid of the
kind of semi-transparent gradients and
everything it's got a flat bar with text
and time John John I'll interrupt you
here on I think you actually put up a
Ice Cream Sandwich lock screen there
you're showing the wrong one buddy I'm
sorry I have to apologize there's a
definite similarities out I don't think
that putting a bubble style live
wallpaper helped them you know as far as
the hearing ice cream sandwich Facebook
that's pretty odds they were showing out
the live wallpaper that they ensure
introduced they call it parallax but
it's a gyroscope
it's a live wallpaper that pulls off the
gyroscope sensor and actually moves with
the phone it actually looks like almost
like something Samsung would do just
kind of out of gimmicky am I correct in
assuming that you no longer swipe from
left to right to open the device you
still swap swipe from left to right it's
that's actually the interesting part and
to anyone on this poem arrow at the
bottom it's anywhere on the screen oh
yeah because that was a big patent
wasn't this the interesting thing is
that it looks like looks like you would
swipe up bizet actually to take you to
control center so it's still actually
left to right I'm get it does still it
has read it says slide to unlock and has
an up arrow and I slide from left to
right this is intuitive from Apple I
guess so now the camera oddly i'm not
exactly sure how you unlock straight to
the camera i would get you a dragon but
i'm not exactly sure it's the barrier i
guess you would drag that up and do the
slide to unlock is still left to right
that the arrow on the bottom is actually
to open up their new control center
directly from the lock screen so you
know something else that make that
reminds me of android is nothing not
because the you know the bubble circle
we know background not because the
minimal you know look of the the top and
you know the bottom you know the
unlocking but the the time centered in
the middle with the thin I mean it's not
Roberta rabota but it's pretty damn
little close to looking like Roberto hey
hey it looks like a very thin kind of
derivative of helvetica it is yeah but
but I mean a thin time in the middle
with the date underneath it I mean ad
yeah I'm sorry that this looks like what
we've been using for the past two years
you know the so I'm gonna pop over there
no dash cos cos I want to pop over to
the home screen so the icons the home
screen itself has been kind of
drastically changed and yes designers
help people are in a in a constant
debate over whether they like the icons
been
whether they the colors the shapes or
its its minimal in shape like the
weather and also the daughter of them
are very simplistic in the in the color
palette is kind of all over the place
but now now dan dan I'm sorry now John
correct me if I'm wrong here I heard
that what that what they did to design
these icons that Jony Ive's actually
looked at matias duarte 'he's shirt
collection and decided to use the colors
on his shirts to color the icons on the
iOS home screen is that true or false um
well I'm message or to be fair Matthias
is a shirt collection pretty much covers
every color of the spectrum it's hard to
get away from that but um you know the
curious part and just as an example of
what you're looking at if you look at
the weather icon and the App Store icon
as an example the gradients are actually
in different directions like one of them
the shiny gradient comes from the bottom
to top and then the app store when it
comes from top to bottom and you see
that a couple everyone the mail icon
comes from bottom to talk to and the you
know a couple other ones it kind of
makes you curious because the you know
with iOS 6 and below they always had
that top gradient that was very
consistent in iconography on all there
you know and that's kind of curious it
makes you wonder if they were really
designed at the same place or if it was
kind of a design by committee thing
looks like on idea builders and it's
good about this is like a fourth great
project yeah so I'm wondering does jony
ive's have any children and did he go up
to his son or daughter and say hey go
get your for us on colors we got work to
do it's it's it's really it this is
probably the biggest point of debate
over a lot of the um not not just the
fans of it but a lot of the analysts and
blogs and
they're taking to it is that the icons
maybe a step back not necessarily the
concept behind going flat with the icons
but how they implement it all if they're
come up yeah a lot of them just look
like they changed it for the sake of
change and not really designed it it's
like hey listen we haven't changed
in five years six years i'm sorry in six
years let's go ahead and just change
everything with the icon colors because
we can yeah and lick there's there's no
sort of theme to it safari and calendar
and photos and new skin and a couple
others are white backgrounds with random
crap on top of them and then everything
else is a colored background with a
couple of more colored with just white
oh okay what I want what I want to talk
about is okay there's a lot of users
that have been using it okay so a lot of
users on iOS a lot of people are are
used to what they're using so will this
be successful and will this be something
that will push Apple you know into a
higher percentage and fight back it's
also worth noting that this is you know
essentially beta software you know they
have time to listen to feedback and
change some of the things about it yeah
they did that really nice with Apple
maps right yeah yeah I mean it's a point
of debate whether they actually will but
if enough people you know complaining
about it how do you think they're still
I do think a lot of these things are
moving in the right direction and even
and to be honest with Android when they
redesign and kind of came up with the
holo theme you know ice cream sandwiches
the first one that the majority of
people saw but really honeycomb was the
first one that really introduced that
design language and honeycomb was a
little bit overdone and too much of that
kind of tron flat boxy look so if I if
Apple is smart enough to really evolve
they can you know there's still
refinement to be done yeah big thing is
who were a design company everything we
touch is pretty and lovely and awesome
and this is just ugly it's it is
interesting and I'm curious you know
it's really hard to tell so far and I'm
gonna pop to the next slide this is the
the new camera by the way but it's going
to be interesting about it is is really
when it gets in the hands of average
users because the right now you're
talking about really tech you know kind
of guys you know this this isn't the
casual average fan that's analyzing this
you know you're gonna have to see how
the use of your at I don't have a
problem with the camera software I
Emperor's actually pretty unpretty
improved you can swipe over to go
directly to say s square image or video
photo it's actually been simplified a
lot it just gets rid of the really big
gradients and everything so I don't
think there's a lot to mention because
the camera hasn't really changed much in
functionality um now just demonstrating
this real quick you can implement
filters uh TouchWiz does this it
actually has filters built into the
camera too well so does I mean total
stock Android they you know that the
film came out with the ice cream
sandwich we've had sweet every year the
difference was stock Android stock
Android actually does it in the gallery
and this is done on the camera so it's
not alive yeah that's how Samsung does
it to to me I prefer to be in the
gallery because to me I use a camera as
a point-and-shoot you know I want to
premeditate if I wanted to premeditate
taking a picture I would get a real
camera personally I just don't mean just
because they take better pictures it's
not so much that I don't necessarily
value having image filters I just think
that a phone camera primary
functionality is that you need a camera
right then at that very moment to take a
picture very quickly it's not so much
that you know if I wanted to think it
out then I would just think it out and
use a better camera because phone
cameras still aren't on you know they're
better but they're not the you know like
an HD yeah like a really high quality
yeah yeah nah hey there he took 650
pictures with that camera apparently but
this is a part of their camera roll and
another thing that's worth kind of
thinking about you can see at the very
top that they're kind of using the back
up carrot that doesn't have that really
embedded looking raised button look
and it's using a lot more typography
lately more about how you navigate
through android apps well then this is
interesting because when it you're
talking about applications are
developers that kind of focus on
cross-platform if you look the camera
roll is actually when you hit back the
text is telling you where it's going to
go to if you go back we're on Android on
the action bar the text actually tells
you where you are so it's going to be
interesting how many developers kind of
screw this up for each pilot let's go
back to the camera roll not you're in
the area that's not where you are
regular that's where it's going to take
you so you're probably going to have
developers to get confused as to which
yeah and that's kind of sad because I
mean we all know that interest in a lot
of applications get ported to android
from i lo so those you hit back right
there because the back is telling you
that back is camera growth yeah the back
is tell and I don't really think either
one of them is necessarily wrong I just
hate the fact that you have the
potential for it to be different than
what the user interfaces convention is
going to be if you're talking about a
developer that's developing for
different platform and the other ? is a
done button done well the death that's
actually the point of editing and image
right there that that's what this
screenshots of and without letter thing
to start editing it the other thing that
kind of makes me curious about this done
editing yeah when you're done editing I
guess so both camera roll and doesn't
take you back to the camera now I've
done well yeah I guess done technically
would take you back to it but yes it
would be done editing so what would you
do once you hit it no in the case of in
the case of iOS and in the case of iOS
you have to provide a back because there
is no back on them no that's right
because mr. but don't make a struggle it
makes sense that they did it it's just
then the other thing that kind of makes
me curious is you know you got three
different types of typography on the top
right there yeah and you know you really
don't have a clear touch delegate the
thing about that is not so much that
it's typography is that what is it going
to look like when translations come to
play in languages that have where a word
is going to be substantially longer than
that is it going to be a scrolling
marquee of text or is it going to be you
know to miss ooh I mean this is a
legitimate concern I think dad about is
probably going to resort to having to
use iconography instead of text in
situations where they can't fit
everything on the top bar yeah I mean
even on this one it already looks bad
with camera roll but yeah it's kind of
cluttered you know it's kind of
cluttered like that and it's really not
big text you know it's not a long
description or anything it just makes
you kind of wonder when you translate it
into Norwegian you know what's what's it
going to look like so um airdrop is
another one that they announced and what
airdrop does is very similar to group
group cast on samsung where it uses
Wi-Fi and bluetooth to be able to share
directly with iOS or you know or mac
users so what you're going to do is it's
going to use kind of like a it doesn't
require you to be connected to a Wi-Fi
network I don't think it actually can
use the network but it is very similar
to Wi-Fi direct where you're going to be
able to send people images in multiple
people images so it's Wi-Fi direct until
it's a little something else that we've
had it's apples totally proprietary and
unnecessary implementation of Wi-Fi
direct it essentially is it's
functionally the same as Wi-Fi direct
and this is their jab they were taking
an NFC where you don't have to touch
phones together but the thing about it
is that group cast does the exact same
thing but the other part of it is NFC
isn't just used to share photos or
applications is the thing about it if
see you know when we went to the big
Android BBQ they used it you know as an
identification method where people would
touch a paper slip there was NFC enabled
and actually get your information
directly from that you have the
potential for mobile payments you have
the potential for
even if you wanted to say put a NFC tag
on the outside of a restaurant so people
it would automatically let people check
in on foursquare or something like that
you know NFC has a lot more direct
capabilities because it doesn't require
you to initiate a connection um the
music application has been you know
pretty much redesigned and another thing
as they announced iTunes radio iTunes
radio is very similar to pandora how it
is basically a DJ that comes up with
playlists based upon you know your music
interest and you can kind of see where
they're going with the user interface
inside applications and I do think it's
a big step forward for them over the
scheme orphic kind of look at the fake
leather paper and you know all those
backgrounds it's very typographic it's
very thin it's very you know kind of
light um but also the other thing worth
noting is in the majority of their
applications the backgrounds are pure
white in nearly everything it almost
reminds you of the the first ipod you
know in user interface you can see the
bottom where they have the five options
on the bottom kind of action bar that
they have that has remained functionally
almost exactly the same as the last one
so the user should get thrown off too
much by it it's just a lot more you know
typographic without having the raised
button look I do think that's a better
look for them than it was and so we'll
just keep moving on this this is what
they call control center and control
center is essentially very very similar
to how notification toggles are done in
android in this case what you're doing
is swiping up from the bottom it does
you know kind of include a set amount of
toggles it doesn't really let you
customize them no way the sky nice
things yeah so what you see is what you
get on there I do think it's good that
they have those options on there it
would be nice if you could customize
them and it's also kind of odd that it
sloped you know you have the brightness
and the music slot music volume sliders
and completely different
places and it would be no kind of
interesting that you've got toggles and
airdrop an airplane and things is like
it's it looks very similar to touch
whizzes a notification area where it's
all kind of jumbled up and weird plate
you know touch whistles however TouchWiz
looks disgusting that actually this is
actually attractive yeah that looks good
hey you know TouchWiz is is what I'm
trying to say with TouchWiz is TouchWiz
does it in a really cluttered kind of
ugly and disjointed kind of weight and
it kind of reminds me of that where it's
you like the fact that it's functional
but it's not attractive like it could be
done better like it could be organized
better its nest yeah it's it's cluttered
as it doesn't really flow you know I'm
gonna disagree I love the way that that
looks I think it's I think it's very you
know minimal looking i love the icons i
like i like it i do very much like the
look of it I think the organization just
needs to be a little bit better yeah I
mean it's but you know we've had you
know custom toggles on custom rom since
froyo you know thanks to signage in mod
and another prop that i'll give them on
this is a you know with 4.2 the way
Google did it and of course custom roms
change it but you know when you hit
Wi-Fi on Google's method it just takes
you to the Wi-Fi settings where this is
a direct toggle no not well in 4.2 they
changed that job yeah you mean the way
that Google initially implemented it
took you and that and that was kind of
for point-to-point telling me yeah and
the way that they did that was google
shouldn't done it like that initially so
i'll give them props for getting that
right you know their Wi-Fi you know
there's only Wi-Fi us will take you
setting hit the toggle on bluetooth and
Wi-Fi though jobs for learning from the
mistakes that google made over a year
ago way to go um you didn't make same
mistakes some other company did last one
though these next screen shots I'm gonna
just kind of rapidly go through just to
get an idea of the user interface
because the conventions very much the
same as current iOS it looks a lot
different it's more typography you know
the fonts bigger is thinner and it's all
that it is a lot cleaner if you see like
a start and lap you know it's very
minimal I really like it actually it's
very minimal it reminds you of Windows
Phone hollow in the way that they go
with very thin fonts and you know it's
just not it's not trying to be something
it's not you know what the top half of
that tough habitat reminds me of Android
it reminds me of the the new stopwatch
clock alarm you know in Angeles cottages
in to be fair I think windows really
kind of got these this kind of look
first you know the really type of
graphic you know focus and you know
windows kind of went a little bit too
far on the flat UI it mean with the
tiles and it's kind of a mom it's really
mono you know when you customize it with
blue tiles you know your whole phone
experience just becomes blue everywhere
we're mixing and matching the colors and
the fonts and everything has been
something that actually Android and iOS
you know by the look of it have kind of
improved on it it's flat and it's
minimal but it's not like nauseatingly
minimal wear it doesn't have any depth
to it yeah that's the well windows
that's the part with Windows Phone that
I think they need to improve on is that
the OS is simple and it's flat but it's
it doesn't have any depth to it
whatsoever yeah you know I think that
that's a perfect representation right
there of how very flat it is the dialer
is very flat looking I don't like the
dialer I don't have your departure
hangar the part that confuses me with
the dialer is why they went with
transparency on the Rings because if you
have somebody with a really light
colored wallpaper it's going to kind of
and that also kind of goes back to a lot
of the other things that they did with a
lot of transparency with it but with
transparency is one of those
is that you have to be very careful with
unless you're implementing drop shadows
kind of like on I context on the
launcher yep sometimes you have to be
really careful with you know unless
you're doing something with drop shadows
the messaging app to me compared to
their last messing the app is a huge
improvement Oh accident that's a major
improvement I like that a lot i'm a big
fan of the the new messaging app
compared to the audience if you look at
like auto correct do you see the bubbles
it's just nausea ting for so long i
would really think their messaging app
is beautiful compared to what it was oh
yeah it's a huge improvement and you
know the message dialog boxes you don't
see the big embedded I like that
keyboard John yeah it's got a thin fun
it has a really kind of light feel to it
without being um the other the other
thing I'd like to see them do on the
keyboard is similar to other ones where
it doesn't differentiate with lowercase
and uppercase letter Android how you can
push gold the top row to get numbers
yeah you know I think the keyboard could
I really would have liked to see them
open up to third-party keyboard so the
calendar have to me was probably the
best improvement of an application that
they showed because if you look at this
calendar have with the week view and
everything that's one area that I wish
google would focus on a little bit more
as their calendar yeah I actually think
the calendar on this is very attractive
and it's all agree i like the calendar
minimal and the month views and
everything just kind of get it right i
do think that they did a very good job
with the calendar application and in
most of these applications though um
that you know the applications
themselves actually look like a big
improvement I do like what they're doing
with the minimal look this is your
notification center and it splits into
tabs you have today and all and miss
notifications and it's very when you're
looking at compared to Android's
notification area it's very kind of rich
in it it's rich but it's also kind of
like if you have a ton of notifications
you're not going to be able to get to
them very quickly but it does show a lot
of content in the notification area so
it's going to be interested if ur
inappro CH but it's you know whether
it's to the users preference is going to
have to kind of you have to see what the
feedback is okay let's uh so just yeah
just quick overview that's really the
big changes aside from if you can see
here safari is getting kind of a tab
layout and they've also there's a
there's a lot of changes uh happening
with with iOS you know the rumors were
true it you know the icons are all
different it's a much flatter more
minimal design me being a fan of minimal
themes for Android stock Android I don't
like sense i don't like TouchWiz I don't
like I don't like anything is in stock
Android or you know AOSP based I I like
minimal Android so I'm a fan of the new
iOS 7 except for the home screen icons I
mean and does everything else I like I
don't see anything wrong with anything
else mean there's maybe a tiny little
thing here there but Android has a tiny
little thing here there that isn't
perfect either so if we could take away
the icons I love it and I I wouldn't I
mean I don't like the platform I'm not
gonna drop an Android don't get me wrong
but I love the the new design I think
it's great they've a new design it's not
six years old anymore they needed to do
this I'm happy no I think you're
absolutely right apart from the really
kind of random iconography everything
else about it is clean it's uniform hits
unified it's straightforward and it's
very apple and it looks nice it really
does like you said I'm not about to
brush off you get Apple I don't really
care for the platform Apple didn't
really announce anything interesting
special existing insofar as developer
option
or new features for servant well I guess
iTunes radio service but really iTunes
radio and polish on the UI's all they
have to offer for innovation you know
but hey the the new Mac Pro that was
their big claim to fame as innovation
but we're not talking about pcs the show
so so John after you know you have an
extensive review you obviously taking a
lot of time to look through iOS 7 what
are your what's your quick and dirty
final thoughts on it final thoughts I
think that it looks a lot better it does
look a lot better than the scamorza and
I and to be fair I hate to get more fit
you eyes you know even with my desktop
with Linux I've always gone for the
minimal look but um you know what ? that
I have with iOS isn't so much you know
what did they do what are they going to
do because apples always been this is
what you've got deal with it you know
and the question is how the average user
is going to respond i think the
enthusiasts really gonna like it because
it does look cleaner it doesn't look
fresher I think the ones that bought it
for familiarity and building off of
their previous experience lioness is
probably going to see this and boot it
up and get I absolutely frightened by it
because and that's not just because of
the way the you is that's because people
are so scared when they see change and
because it's a change I think people are
going to you know you're always going to
have people that even when Google update
something yet people they're half and
half and the last point is a question
mark of is Samsung going to be looking
at this questioning and trying to do
something with TouchWiz because we all
know that they've tended to use some
influence I think that one benefit of
iOS being so white like so many white
backgrounds the Samsung would be
committing suicide to themselves if they
implemented it because they're LED
displays you know you substantially more
power producing the color white than any
other one so I don't even think Samsung
is going to have much as they can take
from this because they would completely
kill their user experience so I duh
before we get to Scotts thoughts i hope
that Samsung does something
because their UI is just old and
outdated as iOS 6 and below so I think
hope this is motivation for them I just
hope they don't cottman car you know I
hope that you know if Samsung feels that
you know Apple felt the need to step up
because of google you know Samsung
doesn't need to necessarily feel the
need to step up because of Apple Samsung
needs to cut the middleman out it'd be
more like Google and just be done with
it is my personal opinion on it Scott
are you switching the iOS no but with
regards to third party the device
manufacturers or whatever leave it stock
let the user decide what they want
they're fun to look like in the end
pretty much I like the new look I think
it's going to piss a lot of people off
because everybody's been very used to
something and that's that it hasn't
changed for so many years this is a very
big change especially the transparency
that will make people angry um but yeah
not changing all right well I see we
have we have a lot of comics basically
showing me I'm not going to repeat what
they say because uh there's some choice
words it that well I just guess I'm not
gonna repeat them but it obviously shows
that there's that there's you know
fanboys air quotes for you guys
listening uh that exists on both sides
of the spectrum either you know you love
you love you the platform you use every
day and you hate the competitor or you
don't care and it's a mobile platform
and use you use what you like so I think
that's what boils down to if you like
Android you're going to use Android if
you like iOS you're gonna use ILS it all
boils down to your own personal
preference and you know some platforms
allow you more personal preferences than
others so there isn't any other
questions I see you know basically i'm
looking to the comment list here and all
a whole bunch of comments on iOS and
Android in general no major pressing
questions uh actually you know what just
just a thought here so I phones
generally have pretty good battery life
well Christian Klaus wants to know is
Apple's iPhone 5 LCD emily d or LCD
because all that white is such a battery
hog and that is true white is a battery
hog but that depends on your screen LCD
there's no difference whatsoever
producing colors because LCD is backlit
one hundred percent of the time yeah I
think that's why he was asking he wanted
to know if it was LCD rambling and
emmalin redoute of what i don't know at
all the thing is the iphone is neither
of these it's IPS so kind of an elephant
debate IPS is powered slightly
differently it's still that good but
realistically projecting the whiteness
is not be more battery consuming animal
coloring as dispensing yeah and I've in
it an AMOLED displays use roughly three
times as much power producing why than
it does any other color because it
requires every every single sub-pixel
has to fire full force basically where
you know so essentially it with oled you
would want to have a dark thing you know
period it preferably okay so Scott uh
where do people find is when they're not
watching us on on the youtubes or the
Google+ YouTube obviously like you just
said alright you can listen to us on
soundcloud podbean itunes soundcloud
it's kind of where it's at i do like the
removal appt right now also andhra
30.com check us out there we do a post
after every show and i'm going to start
something doing something new i did a
test of it on last episode I'm going to
segment the show on YouTube and give you
segment two things about when we talk
about things because I know that it's a
long show and you want
you want to listen to one thing then go
ahead up and I'll be segmenting the show
so so start any chance we can get that
awesome segmentation on soundcloud who I
don't know I'll look into it okay all
right so more android authority on air
features coming at you thanks to the man
the myth the non bed maker Scott
Anderson all right Oh have a good night
everybody great weekend long live
Android I mean iOS 7 or whatever you
choose good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
