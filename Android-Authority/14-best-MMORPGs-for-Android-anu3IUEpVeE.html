handy the Android authority app guy and
in this quick video we're going to take
a look at the best MMORPGs for Android
first up is arcane legends and it's a
solid MMORPG experience you can play
with friends battle PvP or play solo if
you want to there are a few races and
classes to choose from and it's been
known to work on slower internet
connections Ave Abell online is another
MMO that has a few unique features you
can evolve your classes into better
classes as you progress and engage in
tower scrambles which can have upwards
of 1000 players it's fun and it's
consistent brave trials features a bit
more of a cartoon style of graphics and
features over 120 skills that you can
teach your characters it's a bit more
casual of a game which may chase away
some hardcore fans but it's still pretty
good
dark legends is an MMORPG where you play
as vampires instead of elves and dwarves
it features hack and slash style
gameplay similar to gauntlet legends it
features thousands of pieces of gear to
collect and you can play solo or with
others the Dungeon Hunter series by
Gameloft is well known and vastly
popular right now you can go with
Dungeon Hunter 4 or the newer Dungeon
Hunter 5 because they both have similar
gameplay and features you really can't
go wrong either way eternity warriors 3
is another large MMO by a decent
developer you can join guilds play
online co-op or PvP and compete in
tournaments there is a lot to do with
new content being added frequently and
the action RPG gameplay is fun Legion of
Heroes is another hack and slash MMORPG
that uses a slightly more tactical
battle system than most there are over
100 Heroes available that you can play
and you can engage in ninety person PvP
battles order and chaos online is one of
the more popular MMORPG s on Android
that has decent graphics with
leaderboards pvp co-op and over 2,500
skills that you can learn and 5000
pieces of equipment to collect it's huge
and it's fun and it's free to play
Pocket Legends is a cutesy MMORPG that
feels like it's designed for casual
gamers it has the standard PvP and co-op
modes along with a storyline that you
can play through it's a bit simple but
that's perfect for casual gamers
Ragnarok path of Heroes is an anime
style MMO that you can play on your PC
along with your mobile device you can do
the standard stuff like questing and
battling with friends and the level cap
is 99 which is nice the saga of conquest
is an mmm
Oh RPG that employs turn-based mechanics
in an old-school JRPG look and style you
can choose between four races and five
classes it has a smaller user base than
others which can be nice if you want
something more intimate star Legends is
a unique MMO because it uses sci-fi
elements instead of the classic fantasy
stuff you can play as an engineer a
commander or an operative
it has familiar mechanics but the change
in environment makes it feel fresh Tibia
me has been around for a long long time
and it's still going strong he uses
retro style graphics but retains most of
the standard MMO style there is loot
bosses bad guys and events that get
thrown on a yearly basis war spear
online was a recommendation from our
readers and it's pretty solid the
graphics are a bit old-school but they
are colourful and fun the game boasts
over 1,000 quests so there's always
something to do and there are 12 classes
to choose from and that about does it
for this video folks that video likely
won't be updated again but the article
certainly will so check back from time
to time to see what's new there if you
have any recommendations tell me about
them in the comments if you haven't
