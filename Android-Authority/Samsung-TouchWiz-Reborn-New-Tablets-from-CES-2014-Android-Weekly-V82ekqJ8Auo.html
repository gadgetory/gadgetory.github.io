is Jace and to consider that this past
week at CES was busy would make me
master of the obvious I mean come on we
had Joshua get so excited he starts
dancing in the little show and he
finishes with downward dog and then we
had Michael Bay the big Hollywood
director gets stage fright is it uh that
uh how he was experiencing movies she's
no sorry I'm sorry and our own
commander-in-chief Darcy got so excited
about wearable tech that he told John a
tech Buffalo to start wearing biometric
nipples the biometric sensors tell your
wife and maybe we can know how your
heart like it like the other biometric
sensors yeah I do not yet have two
biometric nipples but perhaps hmm I
could make that work all right guys just
a little disclaimer here before we start
and that is that android authority
covered a lot of information that
happened last week at CES and i could
not possibly review all that just in one
show it would take far too long but what
I have done in the show notes below is
provide a plethora of links to some
great stories that transpired over last
week at Consumer Electronics Show be
sure to check that out today I just
cover things that tickled my pickle
let's see yes so the new Samsung tablets
we saw at CES look bigger gorgeous and
have a revamped TouchWiz which is gonna
make a lot of you just did ii with
happiness touch me touch me touch me
touch me now many people may be confused
about samsung's new naming conventions
for their tablets there's no pros and
tab pros and what's the difference well
so far the biggest difference is that
the tab pros do not have a stylus or s
pen while the note pros do the revamped
TouchWiz which is now being called
magazine UX looks fantastic and for me
just my personal opinion here is one of
the most exciting things to come at a
CES this year it's the beginning of
tablets showing that they can be
seriously considered as devices for
professionals and not just content
consumption devices moving on to
wearable tech and I promise you no
nipples will be harmed in the filming of
this episode now as expected pebble
announced the launch of pebble steel
which is pebbles second generation
SmartWatch
it is designed to meet the needs of
consumers who wanted a SmartWatch with
better build quality while the pebble
steel offers the same features at the
previous SmartWatch including five to
seven hour battery life waterproof
features android and iOS support the new
SmartWatch is thinner and it's made of
forged machine stainless steel
furthermore the display is protected by
Corning Gorilla Glass and the lens
includes an anti fingerprint coating
moving on to Intel Smart earbuds Intel
Smart earbuds provides biometric and
fitness information to the user via a
smartphone application the device can
measure heart rate and pulse while still
delivering full stereo audio and is
powered via the headset jack that's
plugged into the smartphone or tablet as
for fitness a companion app on the smart
device can keep track of run distance
and calories burned now Intel's product
has no commercial name yet and this is
just a mock-up so will be interested to
see what OMS can produce Lee New Year
moving onto news about Nvidia's
innovation so nvidia announced the
next-gen tegra processor called the
Tegra k1 and it is a significant spec
boost particularly when it comes to
graphic prowess the new Tegra k1
features the impressive 192 core Kepler
GPU delivering what Nvidia claims will
bring next gen console gaming graphics
to mobile devices now this got Tim
Sweeney of Epic Games so excited he said
this we can take absolutely anything
that runs on PC or a high-end console
and run it on Tegra I didn't think we'd
be at this level on mobile for another
three or four years know whether that's
true or just hype the Tegra k1 does have
impressive specs thanks for watching a
droid beeps my name is Jace and if you
