from Andrew authority while smartphones
still remain most popular Android
devices there still a demand for tablets
and today we're going to be looking at a
new tablet from Alcatel OneTouch
the hero 8 the design of the hero 8 is
really quite nice you have the 8 inch
full HD display in case in an aluminium
frame on the back you have the 5
megapixel camera and a connector for the
magic fillip covers which we'll talk
about in a minute on the top you have
the headphone socket the IR blaster and
a tray for the SD card and for the SIM
card moving towards the bottom of the
device
you'll find two stereo speakers and a
micro USB port like the hero 2 the hero
8 has a series of covers available for
it known as magic flip covers some of
these are just simple covers that
protect the screen or fall around to
become a stand while some of them are
more complicated for example there is a
cover that has LEDs built into it and
could display the time and various
notifications moving on to the
specifications device has a 2 gigahertz
octa-core processor from media Tech 2
gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
on-board storage there's also a micro SD
card slot which takes cards up to 32
gigabytes there's a 5 megapixel rear
facing camera and a 2 megapixel
front-facing camera and the unit is
powered by a 4060 milliamp hour battery
in terms of connectivity you get GPS and
of course Wi-Fi Bluetooth and then
there's the IR blaster
it also has 4G connectivity you can put
in a SIM card and you get internet
access while you're out and about the
device comes with Android 4.4 KitKat and
you have full access to the Google Play
Store the display on the hero 8 is
really quite lovely it is a full HD 8
inch display with a resolution of 1920
by 1200 the colors are bright the
display is vibrant and using it is a
pleasure in the settings as a special
section that allows you to change the
color warmth and the saturation which
means you can tweak this display to
really something as pleasing to your own
eye in terms of performance
performs really well it's antutu scores
are three 9910 and running Epic Citadel
the demo app for the Unreal 3d engine
the hero 8 manages 51 frames per second
on the high quality setting the frames
per second on the high performance
setting was only marginally different at
50 1.1 frames per second
the GPS performance of the hero 8 is
excellent and the device is able to get
a lock indoors and outdoors without any
problems whatsoever one thing that makes
the hero 8 different to other Android
tablets is the software Alcatel OneTouch
have worked really hard to bring
something different to the hero 8 but
only is there a customized launcher
which doesn't seem to slow down or
produce any lag whatsoever but the
device has a special feature that allows
you to run applications in a small
window on the device you can launch an
application and then minimize it to a
window and then you can have another
window which would lay on top of that
and another window would you lay on top
of that and you can move them around
similar to what you would do on a PC
with Windows or a Mac with OS 10 the
only complaint I have about the software
on the hero 8 is the soft keys we're all
used to having the HOME key in the
middle of the menu bar at the bottom of
the screen however to make room for two
additional keys to do with the windowing
I just talked about
Alcatel OneTouch have moved the other
keys to the right of the screen that
actually means the back key is in the
very center and the HOME key and the
Menu key are further to the right when I
first started using the tablet I kept
hitting the back key rather than the
HOME key however after a few hours of
use you get used to the fact that the
keys have moved to a slightly different
place the hero 8 has a four thousand
sixty milliamp hour battery
it really could do being just a little
bit bigger according to my testing
you'll get around three to three and a
half hours of 3d intensive gaming or
four hours of YouTube watching or four
and a half to five hours of watching
films stored locally on the internal
storage now it's not a smartphone it
doesn't need to be ready in your pocket
all day long for all day long use it's a
tablet and I'm sure you're not going to
use it for that many hours during a day
however I would have liked one we've
just a bit more battery life however for
me it isn't a deal-breaker it's okay but
it would it be nicer to have something
better the camera on the hero 8 is
pretty good for a tablet most people
recognize you're not going to use a
tablet taking snapshots as you go out
with your kids in the park but
occasionally is useful to have it just
in case you need to take a picture
somewhere it has a five megapixel rear
facing camera and a 2 megapixel front
facing camera for me it's always the
front-facing camera on a tablet that's
most important because that's what I'll
be using if I'm doing video chats and
other things like that
the camera software on the hero 8 is
almost the same at the camera software
on the hero 2 you get HDR mode panorama
sports mode night mode and there's even
a built-in QR code scanner over all the
camera is easy to use the pictures taken
quickly and for a tablet
I really wouldn't expect much more you
can find some more sample camera shot in
the written companion that goes with
this video review you'll find the link
to it in the video description below
I've been using the heroic for a few
days now and I must say I'm very
impressed and then all the normal things
I would do on a tablet Twitter emails
web browsing reading ebooks listening to
music and I've been really pleased the
only thing I would complain about is the
battery but that's about it everything
else is really really good and there it
is
the Alcatel OneTouch hero 8 a lovely 8
inch tablet a nice design and excellent
screen some great software it could
probably do with a bit of a bigger
battery but overall a great device my
name's Gary Sims
