authority today i'm reviewing a call to
schedule call to schedule is an app that
helps you keep organizers what it does
is every time you receive a call whether
you miss it it's incoming or outgoing
call it gives you the option to have a
pop up on your screen where it'll ask if
you want to schedule an event after a
call so say you are a realtor and you
receive a call and when it hangs up
every time someone calls you generally
your schedule button so here will yes
miss call best fittings you want to
create event yes so now it brings you
right to the event scheduler instead I
have the cliq something or remember it's
automatic reminder every time you want
to create an event um there's the option
for the pop-up to ask you every time or
there's option where it just brings up
the scheduler every time you receive a
call or missed call or make a call call
if you schedule is a very small app it
won't take up a lot of space on your
phone it's run it runs in the background
but takes up no cpu or battery life so
it doesn't drain your battery and it's
quick easy to install and quick setup
just like we saw earlier um there it is
settings and there's bypass after the
call pop up so if you select that option
it pretty much just put the call to the
calendar right after you did one of
these options outgoing call incoming
call miss call but overall i really call
to schedule it's really good for people
who would have a lot going on makes easy
to schedule appointments in your
calendar and without forgetting and for
any busy professional it is a must have
app
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
