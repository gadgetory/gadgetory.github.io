is Clayton represent an Android
Authority calm and today we're going to
be installing the zag invisible shield
on our Samsung Galaxy s3 now before we
get into the invisible shield it's
always a good idea to power down our
devices because there is some wet
application fluid that we have to put on
the device it's always just a good idea
to have it turned off so now that we've
powered down our Samsung Galaxy s3 you
can just get into some of the details
regarding this zag invisible shield
we've got our instructions here this is
our application solution also within we
have our squeegee we have a nice
electronics cleaning cloth and then we
have our actual skin here the Zagg
invisible shield for the front and back
of the galaxy s3 so we'll set that aside
and open this up now another thing we're
gonna want to do is use our nice
electronics clean cloth just remove our
Samsung Galaxy s3 of any fingerprints
oils anything trapped on the body you're
also gonna want to make sure that you
have your hands washed so you don't get
any oils on the screen so to set that
aside open up our package here set that
back now of course we're gonna follow
our instructions instruction number one
is cleanliness make sure your hands are
washed make sure the device is free of
fingerprints and oils now second what
we're gonna want to do is actually spray
some of the applicator fluid on our
fingers before we touch our device and
the invisible shield to make sure we
don't get fingerprints on there so I'll
just get a little bit on there a little
bit on my fingers there it's almost like
a mist and it's not too wet so it's not
too inconvenient see you can still work
with this stuff on your fingers and
we're gonna apply the front first
I'm gonna do is just lift these up
gently
now as this is hanging in your hand
you're gonna want to apply some of the
solution on to it you almost want to
soak it with the solution and I wouldn't
suggest spraying the solution directly
under your device you just kind of want
to keep that to the screen so now we'll
just lay this on our device it's like
we've got a nice fit there we can use
our squeegee and just work some of the
air bubbles out of there so you can see
we do have a few air bubbles in the
screen it's been working those out
gently
now the invisible shield is somewhat of
a sticky piece of plastic so you don't
want to brush too hard with the squeegee
or you might move it across your entire
screen you're gonna want to keep your
electronics cleaning cloth handy to
catch the excess application solution
that comes out of the edges when you
squeegee it out just have this on there
so once all of our cutouts are gone I
couldn't get that one we'll just spray
some of the application fluid on there
we're just gonna want to do the same
thing just set it on there I'm gonna
gauge where to set it by the cutouts for
the camera and the LED the speaker there
yeah make sure it's not too wet we're
gonna want to keep this handy again
working this out lift it up oops you can
lift it up and work with our hands sure
the fluid isn't soaking any device
and I really want to make sure to get
our edges on this but before we attack
the edges
we've just got to work all of our
bubbles out of the sides but it's a
really nice install especially our front
we got our front on nice and we've got
our back on nice now our device is
protected as you can see it's not really
going to take to any scratches and dings
is a really nice application our sag
invisible shield and it's installed very
easily just got to take your time guys I
mean you'll have a nice product
installed on your Samsung Galaxy s3 so
if you're looking for more protection on
your Samsung Galaxy s3 I would suggest
installing the Zagg invisible shield so
if you're looking for a little more
protection on your Samsung Galaxy s3
everyone check out the Zagg invisible
shield and stay tuned with android
