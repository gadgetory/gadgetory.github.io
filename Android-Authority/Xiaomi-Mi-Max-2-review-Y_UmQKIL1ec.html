Andrew authority and today we'll be
checking out the Xiaomi me max - just a
quick note although I have prepared this
video my colleague Abhishek Baxi has
done much of the testing as well as the
written post linked below and with that
out of the way let's talk about this
phone if you recall last year's Xiaomi
me Mac this is really only a minor
upgrade from that the design isn't all
that different the mean UI software
hasn't changed much and yet it's still
ludicrously large with a six point four
four inch 1080p LCD display the display
itself is really just kind of mediocre
color reproduction is okay and it's
coated in Gorilla Glass 3 but doing
angles are disappointing and both
Abhishek and I had issues with auto
brightness we certainly understand
shammies need to keep costs down but we
would have liked to see a better display
given how critical it is to the content
consuming audience that this phone is
aimed towards as you would expect a
large display also means a large body
the overall design is quite nice though
the premium metal build looks good and
the build quality is better than the
originals the now curved side edges also
help a bit with handling not to the
point of being able to get away with
one-handed use but there is a built-in
mode for that if you need it of course
there's no built-in mode to make the
fingerprints to reach we found its
placement to be a tad unfortunate but
are happy with the Reavers accuracy
although the me max 2 is fairly slim at
seven point six millimeters it's
certainly on the heavier side at 211
grams that's because it's packing a
massive 5300 milliamp hour battery as
you may have guessed this allows the me
max to to offer some incredible battery
life even with heavy use charging times
are pretty good too the now included
quick charge 3.0 charger enables
charging from 0 to 100% in about two
hours you may also use the new max 2 as
a power bank if you'd like to charge
another device you shouldn't need to
carry around two phones though is the me
max 2 supports dual SIM cards don't plan
on using it in the United States though
it is not compatible with LTE at all
actually and it's only partially
compatible with 3G if you don't need two
SIM cards you can expand the
with a microSD card if the 64 gigabytes
of internal storage isn't enough media
lovers will also enjoy the phone stereo
speaker setup audio is loud and
importantly it sounds full with little
distortion and yes there's still a
headphone jack there's an IR blaster too
for controlling TVs and other appliances
there's unfortunately no NFC onboard so
what the mean X 2 has Google's blessing
to run Android pay you can't use it in
stores the overall global software
experience is pretty good it ships with
me why eight point five over Android
7.1.1 nougat which is nice
we appreciate me wise design as well as
its features and customizability the
dual apps feature for example lets you
run two instances of the same app it's a
cool concept but we had trouble getting
it to work with snapchat which is really
the only app that we wanted it for by
the way if you aren't already following
us on snapchat now's your chance okay
let's move on the UI also seems pretty
well optimized as day to day performance
was alright despite the mid-range
Snapdragon 625 we're sure the four
gigabytes of RAM helps to keep the
performance smooth as well
you should be happy with the setup just
don't expect it to compete with
flagships the same goes for the camera
it's 12 megapixels with an F 2.2
aperture and it's quite frankly just ok
color reproduction is good but images
came out soft especially around the
corners the biggest issue that we
noticed was poor dynamic range as you
can see you can either get the
highlights or the shadows but not both
HDR helps but it's not the ideal
solution
unfortunately when taking the phone into
low-light conditions it turns into a
potato not literally of course but
images do come out really soft and
really noisy I don't think I need to say
much more so how much will the mean max
to set you back well it depends on where
you live but you can expect anywhere
from 250 to 275 dollars that's
impressively competitive for a segment
with a little competition perhaps the
best use case for this phone is as a
power bank with smart phone features
built in the me max 2 is great for binge
watching Netflix and its large battery
could certainly come in handy but its
large size and general mediocrity make
it difficult to use day to day that's
not to say that this phone doesn't have
an audience but rather that you should
consider
carefully whether this phone is right
for you and that will be all for this
