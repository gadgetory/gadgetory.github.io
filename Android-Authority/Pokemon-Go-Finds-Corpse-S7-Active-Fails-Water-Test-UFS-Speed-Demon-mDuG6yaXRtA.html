more than she bargained for while
playing pokemon go Pokemon go is an
augmented reality mobile game players
capture train and battle with virtual
Pokemon that they find throughout the
real world shayla wiggins jumped a fence
to chase a Pokemon but to her shock
discovered a corpse floating in the
water instead Wiggins promptly called
911 she said I was pretty scared and
cried for a while police later reported
the man's death appeared to be an
accidental drowning what are the chances
of a Pokemon appearing at the exact same
spot of a floating corpse the only way
the story could get any more bizarre is
if the man fell into the water while
chasing a Pokemon himself let us know
about your pokemon adventures in the
comments below just a couple weeks ago
we were lauding the virtues of the
Samsung Galaxy s7 active but it turns
out that it has failed a water
resistance test spectacularly the
Samsung Galaxy s7 active is advertised
as being one of the most rugged devices
in the market today however if Consumer
Reports is correct in their findings
these claims might need to have an
asterisk appended to them a twice run
tests demonstrated that the Samsung
Galaxy s7 active does not appear to be
able to withstand their advertised water
resistance of 30 minutes in five feet of
water just to make sure they didn't
somehow get a faulty device researchers
took the test again with an additional
device this smartphone failed as well if
not quite so spectacularly the screen
gained a permanent flicker effect and
also got water in the camera lens
moreover water was also present inside
the phone's sim card for those of you
who have the active have you had any
problems like this please let us know in
the comments below now let's talk ufs
new ufs memory cards leave microSD cards
in the dust at least in terms of speed
but it will be a while before they
become common samsung announced this
week the industry's first memory cards
based on the ufs removable card standard
the ufs 2 point 0 is the internal
storage standard that is designed to
replace the more common
and slower emmc standard Samsung used
the ufs 2 point 0 memory for the first
time on the galaxy s6 now Samsung brings
the same superfast standard to removable
storage specifically the 256 gigabyte
ufs card provides sequential read speeds
of up to 530 megabytes per second which
is five times higher than the typical
microSD card at least according to
Samsung the performance improvements
carries over to write speeds as well
even more random write speeds are a
whopping 350 times higher than with a
maker SD card samsung says the device is
equipped with ufs cards can read a 5
gigabyte movie in just 10 seconds if you
guys remember from like 15 years ago
