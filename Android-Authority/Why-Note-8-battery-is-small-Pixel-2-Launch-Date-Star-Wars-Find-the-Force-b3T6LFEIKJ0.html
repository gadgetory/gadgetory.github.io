busy converting this to this but this
isn't even really done yet we got some
work to do but tech news keeps rolling
on so let's do the same so let's start
off with the Galaxy Note 8 specifically
the battery and you may be thinking
Sammy what's going on with the
diminutive size well many people thought
that too and they asked the Samsung
Mobile chief ko dongjun otherwise known
as DJ ko and here's what he said quote
there are some reasons why we can reduce
the battery capacity one of them is the
10 nanometer processor that has enhanced
the phone's battery efficiency by 30%
users can also adjust their battery use
based on their smartphone use base
patterns which increases battery
efficiency overall now I can guarantee
battery safety the phone will maintain
more than 95% of battery capacity even
after 2 years of use so do you like that
explanation does that allay your fears
regarding the battery size or safety
well DJ ko thinks it does and he thinks
a lot of you are gonna buy it as for how
many units of the Galaxy Note 8 ko
expect Samsung to sell he said and I
quote the note 5 sold 11 million units
I think the note 8 will sell more than
that but the shipments could be adjusted
because we still want to sell more
Galaxy s8 phones the investor states
that Samsung aims to sell 48 million
units of the s8 and si plus combined so
that's good news for Samsung and the
head of mobile but there is some bad
news for the acting boss of Samsung or
shall I say the underboss Samsung's
acting chief lee jae-yong the man
directing Samsung in the absence of his
ill father Lee Kum Kee has been found
guilty of bribery perjury embezzlement
and other charges after a six-month
trial Lee who denied the charges is now
facing five years in prison though
prosecutors were seeking a 12-year
sentence lee jae-yong arrest arrived
early in February amid a number of
corruption stories arriving from South
Korea including charges against former
president Park who was also on trial
Lee was accused of bribing president
Park in return for her support for a
controversial merger between Samsung
affiliates something which is said to
have helped Lee solidify his position at
the top of Samsung and good
for you pixel fans out there the pixel 2
is expected to launch on October 5th the
next generation of Google handsets may

2 XL will be introduced almost exactly a
year after the original pixels the two
new phones manufactured by HTC and LG

their processor and the snapdragon 836
other likely specs include a 5-inch
display for the pixel 2 and a 6-inch
display for the pixel 2 XL OLED screens
4 gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of
storage always-on displays and
squeezable frames a feature borrowed

Kathleen Kennedy the president of Lucas
Films who is presently sitting on top of
her death star of money now my audience
