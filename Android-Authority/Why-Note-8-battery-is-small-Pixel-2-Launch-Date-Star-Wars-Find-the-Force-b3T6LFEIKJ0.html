busy converting this to this but this
isn't even really done yet we got some
work to do but tech news keeps rolling
on so let's do the same so let's start
off with the Galaxy Note 8 specifically
the battery and you may be thinking
Sammy what's going on with the
diminutive size well many people thought
that too and they asked the Samsung
Mobile chief ko dongjun otherwise known
as DJ ko and here's what he said quote
there are some reasons why we can reduce
the battery capacity one of them is the
10 nanometer processor that has enhanced
the phone's battery efficiency by 30%
users can also adjust their battery use
based on their smartphone use base
patterns which increases battery
efficiency overall now I can guarantee
battery safety the phone will maintain
more than 95% of battery capacity even
after 2 years of use so do you like that
explanation does that allay your fears
regarding the battery size or safety
well DJ ko thinks it does and he thinks
a lot of you are gonna buy it as for how
many units of the Galaxy Note 8 ko
expect Samsung to sell he said and I
quote the note 5 sold 11 million units
I think the note 8 will sell more than
that but the shipments could be adjusted
because we still want to sell more
Galaxy s8 phones the investor states
that Samsung aims to sell 48 million
units of the s8 and si plus combined so
that's good news for Samsung and the
head of mobile but there is some bad
news for the acting boss of Samsung or
shall I say the underboss Samsung's
acting chief lee jae-yong the man
directing Samsung in the absence of his
ill father Lee Kum Kee has been found
guilty of bribery perjury embezzlement
and other charges after a six-month
trial Lee who denied the charges is now
facing five years in prison though
prosecutors were seeking a 12-year
sentence lee jae-yong arrest arrived
early in February amid a number of
corruption stories arriving from South
Korea including charges against former
president Park who was also on trial
Lee was accused of bribing president
Park in return for her support for a
controversial merger between Samsung
affiliates something which is said to
have helped Lee solidify his position at
the top of Samsung and good
for you pixel fans out there the pixel 2
is expected to launch on October 5th the
next generation of Google handsets may
arrive on October 5th
according to Evan Blass if Evan is right
and he usually is the pixel 2 and pixel
2 XL will be introduced almost exactly a
year after the original pixels the two
new phones manufactured by HTC and LG
will share most specifications including
their processor and the snapdragon 836
other likely specs include a 5-inch
display for the pixel 2 and a 6-inch
display for the pixel 2 XL OLED screens
4 gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of
storage always-on displays and
squeezable frames a feature borrowed
from HTC's u11 flagship good news for us
Star Wars fans out there they are
bringing us an augmented reality
treasure hunt Star Wars Episode 8 the
last Jedi is hitting theaters this
December ahead of its release date
Disney and lucasfilm's are holding a
global event to celebrate the launch of
its merchandise this week the event is
known as force Friday - it follows the
original force Friday event that Disney
rolled out prior to the release of the
force awakens in 2015 and will launch on
September 1st appearing alongside will
be a global AR experience known as quote
find the force we got all that from
Kathleen Kennedy the president of Lucas
Films who is presently sitting on top of
her death star of money now my audience
is smart so smart that sometimes you're
inspired by a business idea and then you
try and get the name of that business in
a domain name and your next perspective
customer is searching your business name
and they assume you have the dot-com and
if you don't you're giving your business
away to the one who does that's the
power of a dot-com now why is that
exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions inject
credibility and your online presence
and who doesn't want to be credible and
don't forget you get 15% off when you
use our coupon code Android when you
think domain names think domain.com hey
guys I need your help specifically on
what to put on those shells back there
in my backdrop that's not a green-screen
that's a real thing this is a lot more
complicated than it looks there's new
mics and lights and a whole bunch of
stuff going on but I need something on
those shelves that is Android related
tech related and something with a nice
personal spin on it you know something
that screams Jace lawns got the whole
Ironman thing going on and I need
something else maybe knife related dog
