authority and the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge
is here and I've had it for a couple of
days now which is obviously not enough
time for a full review but it is enough
time to give you guys an unboxing in my
first impressions after 48 hours
so the Galaxy s7 edge isn't a complete
redesign and instead is more of a
refinement over last year's s6 edge that
is by no means a bad thing because
Samsung got a lot of things right last
year and they only really need to make a
few changes to make their flagship
smartphone better for starters that
sharp in hand feel that a lot of people
complained about with last year's s6
edge is now a thing of the past it's
also slightly bigger this year due to
the increase in screen real estate which
I personally like but despite that it's
still relatively thin and extremely
comfortable to hold the back is slightly
tapered along the side similar to what
we saw with the note 5 and while it's
not a game-changer it does add that
little bit extra to how it feels in the
hand and complements the overall look at
the s7 edge really well the glass
backing is still a huge fingerprint
magnet just like before which is kind of
a bummer but it's generally a very small
price to pay for a phone that looks and
feels amazing the screen still features
the same 2560 by 1440 quad HD resolution
as before and everything still looks
super sharp and super crisp but now you
get to enjoy it all on a much larger 5.5
inch display everything from web
browsing videos movies and games have
all looked absolutely fantastic and
display in general has been a total
pleasure to use it's pretty safe to say
that Samsung makes some of the best
smartphone displays on the market and
this beautifully curved AMOLED screen
with this deep inky blacks and vibrant
colors is certainly quite the looker
with the galaxy s7 edge and of course
the regular s7 Samsung has brought back
a couple of features that were arguably
missing from last year's models number
one is micro SD card expansion which
means there's no 128 gigabyte version
this year and instead you're getting
support for up to an additional 200
gigabytes of storage for all your photos
and video feature number two is the s7
edge is water and dust resistant again
which means it will survive the
occasional spill dunk in the toilet or
getting caught in the rain the awesome
thing about it this time around is that
it's all sealed in from the inside which
means no more annoying flaps that get in
the way or could potentially get broken
one of the biggest weaknesses of last
year's Galaxy S was battery life but
this year Samsung has shoved a massive
3600 milliamp hour battery inside the s7
edge and it has definitely done the
trick even though I've only had the s7
edge for a couple of days now I can
already tell that battery life is
drastically better than the s6 edge on
day one I was able to easily hit the
five hour mark of screen on time which
was pretty incredible and so far I've
had no trouble whatsoever getting
through a full day despite snapping a
ton of photos and doing some light
gaming the camera has taken a bump down
from 16 megapixels to 12 megapixels
which may make some people initially
think that this is a downgrade but
there's a lot more to a camera than just
megapixel count and other things like
the actual sensor and image processing
are much more important when it comes to
overall image quality Samsung's
basically taken a page out of Google's
book and with fewer megapixels you're
getting much larger pixels which results
in better low-light performance and it's
helped out even further by the F 1.7
aperture picture quality has been
absolutely fantastic and I've had
nothing but a blast using this camera so
far both daylight and nighttime shots
have looked incredible and while I want
to hold off final judgments I've been
really pleased with the amount of depth
color and detail that I've been able to
pull out of this camera I've also really
enjoyed using the front camera a lot
especially the new wide selfie mode
which is nothing more than a glorified
panorama mode for the front camera but
it works really well for fitting your
friends or just more of the background
into the frame performance thus far has
been about what you would expect from a
flagship smartphone especially when it's
packing these Snapdragon 820 here in the
States and four gigabytes of RAM loading
apps playing games and web browsing have
all been extremely fast although I will
admit that I do still notice that
occasional lag that's typical of Samsung
phones which is not a deal-breaker but
it definitely lacks the fluidity that
you may find on something like stock
Android the Flipboard homescreen
scrolling lag is still there and while
the delay it's nowhere near as bad as
previous Samsung devices like the s6 and
note 5 it's definitely still noticeable
and has only become more apparent to me
the more I use the device software has
also seen a lot of improvements
especially with the edge functionality
that takes advantage of the s7 edges
curved front glass panel you still have
all the same features from before like
the apps edge and people edge but the
apps edge now features two columns of
apps which makes it a lot more useful as
a multitask or an app switcher of sorts
Samsung has also introduced a couple of
new edge features like the TASC edge for
quick shortcuts to comment
ass and edge panels I can show you a
variety of pertinent information like
the weather stocks and sports scores I'm
still not entirely sold on all these
edge features as far as their usefulness
goes but at the bare minimum it's a
great way of storing apps contacts and
other bits of useful information that
can all be accessed by swipe of a finger
without cluttering up your main home
screens new to the s7 and s7 edge this
year is the always-on display which can
show useful information without draining
the battery because it takes advantage
of the ambulance screen by not lighting
up every individual pixel right now it's
pretty limited in functionality which
can probably explain why it's not
enabled by default and can only show you
the clock calendar or just an image if
you don't care for the other two I do
like the calendar one quite a bit and so
when I've used the most often but it
would be nice to see Samsung expand upon
this feature in a future software update
to make it more robust but that's pretty
much going to do it for my first
impressions of the galaxy s7 edge after
48 hours hopefully you guys enjoyed it
and stay tuned for the full review which
will be a lot more in depth and if you
