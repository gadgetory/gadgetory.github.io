to hire native English speakers because
if they did they would not have posted
an ad with this wording for the upcoming
huawei watch a wearable to be worn now
that's right up there with such chinese
english translations as do not disturb
tani grass is dreaming or my personal
favorite please don't touch yourself let
us help you triad now I get it while
ways trying to make a knock at the
embarrassingly Giggy Google glass but
let's talk about that watch Huawei is
gearing up to relaunch its long delayed
watch or the watch as anxious fans have
come to call it first announced at the
Mobile World Congress in March the
Huawei watch will probably hopefully
become available on September second as
per a pre-order page that popped up on
Amazon and a tweet from an official
Huawei account for versions of the
device are listed on amazon from a basic
stainless steel version that costs about
three hundred and fifty dollars to a
gold-plated model going for a pricey 799
the device is sold and shipped by amazon
so it's unlikely that the prices
artificially inflated as sometimes
happens with resellers the high price of
the huawei watch is quite surprising it
looks like the Chinese giant is happy to
match Apple on pricing whereas other
Android manufacturers have kept prices
much lower with consumer sentiment in
the wearables field steadily eroding
it's definitely a bold move by Paul way
but we don't see that high price tag
lasting for too long and we had good
stuff for all you sony xperia fans we're
talking to z 5 and the highlight for all
those camera aficionados out there is
that it now seems all but officially
confirmed by sony that the z5 will
feature an impressive 23 megapixel rear
shooter the device is pictured here
looks similar to those that have come
before it the phone still retains the
same rectangular shape sonia's used
since its origin though again with new
rounded edges ports can also be seen
along the bottom end of the device sans
the flap which looks like the smartphone
will once again achieve its
waterproofing primarily through ceiling
rather than covering the Xperia z5 is
expect
to have a fingerprint sensor built into
the power button the button in turn will
now be flat as opposed to this circular
protrusion that had graced the previous
models in the series now we've also
heard some interesting rumors regarding
the droid maxx too and the turbo 2
thanks to the folks at hello moto HK
there's now some more evidence that
motorola will in fact rebrand the Moto X
play as the verizon exclusive droid maxx
too as you can see from the leaked
images here what's allegedly the droid
maxx to back plate is shown off next to
the Moto X playback cover the two look
very similar but if you look closely you
can see the standard Verizon branding
above the Droid logo on the bottom of
the device as is the case with other
rumors we should take this with a grain
of salt since nothing is yet been
confirmed with that said now that we
have some visual evidence of the
potential rebranding these rumors are
certainly becoming much more believable
now specific details on specs are scarce
but sources claim that the phone will
have a quote unbreakable display now
that's a strong statement indeed a later
update from phandroid confirm that this
is partly due to the PO LED panel the
Droid turbo 2 will be carrying now let's
talk about the SmartWatch that is
expected to be the finest-looking
Android wear device out there more
supposed images of the next generation
Moto 360 have just hit the web courtesy
of a reddit user that claims to work for
a company who makes phone cases and
pebble watch bands these new images
don't show off a finished version of the
watch rather the watches frame sitting
conveniently next to a ruler for size
according to the user the bezel seems a
bit thicker than last year's device
which should probably be taken with a
grain of salt since this isn't a
finished version of the watch we're
seeing here thanks for watching android
army my name is Jace and I really would
love to connect with you right here on
Google+ or Twitter and I will read you

my brothers and sister and Android we're
