Authority and with the Nexus 5x and Moto
X pure edition being offered at very
close price points it's almost a
no-brainer to put these two head-to-head
but which one is the better deal let's
find out with the Nexus 5x versus the
Moto X pure Edition even though there's
only a small difference in price between
these two phones there's a huge
difference when it comes to design and
build materials the Nexus 5x is meant to
be a direct successor to the Nexus 5 and
it definitely shows with the all plastic
build if you love the look and feel of
the original Nexus 5 then you'll feel
right at home with the 5x it's super
lightweight easy to use in one hand and
it's very comfortable to hold due to the
matte finish rounded corners and
slightly tapered back the Moto X is
naturally the larger device out of the
two because of its larger screen size
but it's also the more substantial
feeling phone it's metal frame gives it
a rigidity that you just can't get with
plastic and the curved body lets it rest
nicely in the hand it's not the easiest
phone to use in one hand but because of
its spin side bezels and small top and
bottom chin you might be surprised that
it's quite manageable and if you opt for
the textured silicone back you're
getting a phone that doesn't feel like a
slippery bar so Nexus phones typically
only come in the standard black and
white colors but this year Google threw
in a new blue color to spice things up a
bit for the 5x but this still pales in
comparison to the endless options that
are available for the Moto X via moto
maker on top of a variety of standard
colored backs you also have the option
of wood and leather but it doesn't end
there you can pick from different accent
colors and add your own engravings and
greetings to truly make it your own
the 5x and Moto X pier are both using
LCD technology for the displays with the
Moto X s screen is a half an inch larger
at 5.7 inches over the 5x is 5.2 inch
screen and it's also packing more
resolution at 2560 by 1440 over the
1080p panel of the 5x the five X's
display is no slouch with great viewing
angles and solid color reproduction and
overall is a pretty good looking 1080p
panel but it just can't stack up to the
Moto X is sharper more vibrant and
brighter display and the larger screen
real estate just makes it much more
enjoyable when it comes
things like watching video or playing
games the Nexus 5 X's display is by no
means a bad display but when you compare
these two side-by-side it's pretty clear
who the winner is taking a look at the
internals the 5x and Moto X are actually
very similarly expect the 5x is running
on a snapdragon 808 processor with 2
gigs of ram and on the Moto X you have
the same Qualcomm chip but you're
getting an extra gigabyte of RAM for a
total of 3 gigabytes even though the
Moto X has the slight edge here I
honestly don't notice much of a
difference in day-to-day use as both
devices are extremely fast and things
like gaming and multitasking haven't
been an issue on either one the fact
that both of these devices are running
stock Android well near stock Android in
the case of the Moto X also helps a ton
in terms of overall stability and
fluidity and because these two phones
are sold free of carriers they're not
having to deal with any carrier bloat to
slow things down either if you're
curious about benchmarks and Geekbench
you'll notice that there's not any real
differences in how these to score and
this pretty much falls in line with how
both of these devices feel in daily use
which is not a huge surprise considering
they're both being powered by the same
chipset running at the same exact clock
speed there's a couple new pieces of
hardware on this year's Nexus phones
with the first one being on the bottom
and that's the USB type-c port it's
reversible and that makes life a whole
lot easier of the standard microUSB on
the Moto X but until more devices and by
more devices I mean computers laptops
etc not just smartphones adopt USB
type-c it's currently more of a
disadvantage than an advantage over the
standard microUSB the second new piece
of hardware is on the back of the 5x and
that is the built-in fingerprint sensor
which the Moto X doesn't have either and
with fingerprint sensors being the new
smartphone trend it's surprising
Motorola has yet to join in if you're
into biometric security you'll love the
fingerprint sensor on the 5x it's
extremely fast conveniently located and
is one of the most accurate fingerprint
sensors that I've ever used even the
setup process takes very little time and
it's somewhat of a shame that when the
Moto X gets the marshmallow update it
won't be able to take advantage of the
native fingerprint sensor integration
the Moto X does however get the leg up
in storage capacity you're getting three
storage options on the Moto X with 16 32
or 64 gigs whereas with the 5x you only
the choice of 16 or 32 not only does the
motox come in a higher storage capacity
but it also supports microSD card
expansion a feature Google ditched on
the Nexus line a long time ago 16 gigs
is not a lot of storage and shouldn't
even exist in 2015 but with a microSD
card slot you can probably get by just
fine on the Moto X but with the Nexus 5x
you're honestly better off getting to 32
gigabyte version especially if you plan
on taking advantage of features like 4k
video recording
for the battery you're looking at a 2700
milliamp hour battery on the 5x and a
slightly larger 3000 milliamp hour
battery on the Moto X both of these
devices are capable of lasting a full
day in my experience but the 5x s
battery life can definitely be stretched
out further due to marshmallows battery
saving feature called doze which creates
for a much better standby time by
putting the phone in a deep sleep and
limiting app activity now the phone
comes with wireless charging but they do
support fast charging and while fast
charging is amazing it shouldn't be a
permanent crutch for less than desirable
or average battery life but it is very
convenient the Moto X charges rapidly
through Motorola's turbo power charger
whereas the Nexus 5x utilizes fast
charging through its USB type-c cable
and because of how quickly these two
phones charge it's very easy to get back
up and running even after just 10 to 15
minutes of being plugged in Nexus phones
have never really been known for their
cameras and historically they've been
some of the weakest cameras on the
market coincidentally the same can be
said for the Moto X line but both Google
and Motorola put their best foot forward
this year to make sure their flagships
could keep up with the rest of the
competition
the Nexus 5x has a brand new Sony made
12 point three megapixel sensor laser
guided autofocus F 2.0 aperture and a
very large pixel size of 1.5 5 microns
for improved performance especially in
low-light the Moto X has a 21 megapixel
sensor phase detection autofocus and
features the same F 2.0 Apter now they
have optical image stabilization and in
the five x's case google claims that the
larger pixel size should more than make
up for it the camera software isn't
spectacular on either one but the
dedicated on-screen shutter button makes
the Google camera app much easier and
more intuitive to use over the tap to
shoot method of Motorola's the five x's
camera can be quickly launched with a
DoubleTap of the power button which is
convenient but this trick isn't anything
new to Motorola and you can pretty much
do the same thing with a double twist of
the wrist both of these cameras are
capable of recording 4k video and
slow-motion video at 120 frames and
while the 5x produces better colors and
sharper looking video over the Moto X it
gets super shaky from doing something as
simple as casually walking while the
Moto X maintains a much more stable and
smoother looking image now we know that
megapixels don't determine overall
picture quality but if you're concerned
about zooming and cropping you do have a
lot more room to work with on the Moto X
but as far as actual image quality goes
both cameras are capable of taking some
excellent looking shots given the right
lighting conditions but in most
situations the 5x typically produces
much cooler images over the warmer tones
of the Moto X the same can also be said
about the front-facing cameras as well
whether you prefer a cooler or warmer
look is a matter of personal preference
but where the 5x truly shines is an
overall color reproduction and dynamic
range the colors aren't quite as overly
saturated as the Moto X and areas like
shadows and highlights hold a lot more
detail on the 5x and the difference is
especially noticeable in lower light or
high contrast situations the biggest
advantage of owning a Nexus has always
lied in the software and with the Nexus
5x you're getting one of the first
devices to ship with Android 6.0
marshmallow and since it's a nexus it's
the way Google intended it to be so no
skin and no extra bloatware the Moto X
is on 5.1.1 lollipop currently but has
never been too far behind with updates
the experience is about as pure as
you're going to get without being an
exodus and the Moto X historically
received updates very shortly after
Google rolled them out but we'll have to
wait and see if that's still the case
under the ownership of Lenovo
aesthetically the software experience
between these two are practically
identical because nothing really changed
in terms of looks between marshmallow
and lollipop with the exception of the
new vertical scrolling app drawer but
that change can be had on any device
running the Google now launcher what
really separates these two experiences
is the new features of marshmallow on
the 5x and custom motorola features on
the Moto X obviously all the
enhancements and features of marshmallow
like user-defined app permissions doze
and the contextually aware now on tap
will all be coming to the Moto X when it
gets marshmallow but until that happens
these are all features
currently make owning a brand-new Nexus
phone special the Moto X on the other
hand has its own features that make it
special and if you're a longtime Moto X
user that you'll know just how useful
many of these features can be you can do
things like call upon your Moto X with
any custom phrase of your choice
chop twice for the flashlight or peek at
notifications that are subtly pulsating
on the display some of these features
may sound really minor or trivial but
once you get used to them they become
features you don't want to go without
with the Nexus 5x starting at 379 and
the Moto X pure addition at 400 there's
only a $20 difference between these two
devices they're both very affordable
smart phones that do a lot of things
well and you can't go wrong with either
one but for me personally I would go
with the Moto X pure edition you're
getting a larger higher resolution
display better build quality microSD
card expansion a near stock android
experience with some very useful
enhancements by Motorola and endless
customization with Moto maker
of course the Nexus 5x has its own
advantages too like a fingerprint sensor
USB type-c stock Android and a great
camera but when you're looking at it
from a perspective of value the Moto X
pure edition is the better bang for your
buck as always thank you guys so much
