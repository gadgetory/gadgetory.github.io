2016 we got a look at well we could
pretty much describe as a bridge between
your phone and your computer it's Josh
regard from Android authority what's
going on everybody and this is the
Lenovo link now before we even get into
exactly what the link is what we just
get it connected to the computer what we
have here is a small little dongle that
on one end goes into the computer and on
the other end you use your
a smartphone onto there an Android phone
running Android 5.0 or above now what
the link will do then is connect using
the software that is installed on the
phone and then also installed on the
computer to virtualize your phone to the
computer yes that means that all inputs
on the computer whether it be the mouse
or the keyboard can be used on the phone
but it doesn't just end there you are
able to use the virtualized space in
order to do things on your phone like
for example even play candy crush in
this case but pretty much anything that
you can think of that you would do on
your phone when it's in your hand can
now be done in a window or in a
full-screen mode on your actual computer
inside the link there is support for up
to 1080p resolution when using the
screen virtualization and also 32
gigabytes of storage is available within
the actual link device itself and the
link is also able to extend the input of
the mouse and the keyboard as you can
see here we are typing on the actual
laptop a phrase that is then copied and
pasted into the Android device in this
case a moto X and if you wanted to save
some of the space on your actual desktop
you can make the phone a left or right
extended display and then the mouse will
actually travel across and to be able to
be used on the phone outside of the
desktop that you are using outside of
the screen that you have in front of you
on your laptop or your desktop
being able to virtualize or even just
control a smart phone using a computer
is already providing a number of
possibilities but we personally just
think that the lenovo link is just
incredibly cool it is a small little
piece of kit that provides a lot of
functionality and really it kind of
doesn't get old using the computer and
then moving over to the Android device
seamlessly and that is exactly the kind
of speed and the kind of experience that
you get with the link but perhaps the
best part about the link is that
provided all of its possibilities it is
a small piece of kit that really extends
the functionalities between a phone and
a computer and comes in at only $40 and
will be available in March 2016 this is
Joshua freghar from Android authorial
bringing you a look at the Lenovo link
here with lenovo at CES 2016 stay tuned
for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
