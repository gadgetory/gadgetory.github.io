Clayton Youngberg coming at you from the
one and only Android Authority calm
stead of bringing you a head-to-head
comparison between the US carrier
variant of the samsung galaxy s3 and the
AT&amp;amp;T Sony Xperia ion but the Xperia ions
a brand new phone
hot on the market so is the Samsung
Galaxy s3 these both have great specs
and they're pretty similar so we're
gonna be doing a head-to-head comparison
to see which one comes out on top now
mind you the Samsung Galaxy s3 is
available from anywhere between one
hundred and forty nine dollars online up
to two hundred with Sprint's two-year
contract and then the AT&amp;amp;T Sony Xperia
ion is coming in at $99 on a two-year
contract so the Xperia ion is a little
bit you know in favor of the good price
point anyways the specs on these two are
pretty similar we've got sixteen
gigabytes of storage here internal as
well as on the Xperia ion now the galaxy
s3 can be expandable with a 64 gigabyte
card and the Xperia ion only is capable
of being expanded with a 32 gigabyte
card but we do have a Snapdragon s4 1.5
gigahertz processor in each of these we
actually look at the two phones we can
see that there are almost just about the
same size the Xperia ion is rocking a
four point six inch screen and then
we've got the four point eight inch
screen on the samsung galaxy s3 but the
profiles are almost identical here we've
got a little bit more thickness on the
Xperia ion we've got our power buttons
here our volume rocker is right here on
the Xperia ion and it's right here on
the samsung galaxy s3
now we use micro USB to charge both of
these and the Xperia ion has micro HDMI
as well as well as a dedicated camera
button we don't have that on the samsung
galaxy s3 but we do have the micro USB
on both 3.5 millimeter head jet
headphone jacks on both now as far as
hardware such as cameras on both of
these phones the galaxy s3 rear facing
camera coming in at 3200 64 by 2448
pixels and then the sony xperia ion's
rocking a 12 megapixel rear-facing
camera
coming in at a resolution of 4000 by
3,000 pixels so it takes the cake in
that category now our front-facing
camera on the samsung galaxy s3 is 1.9
megapixel capable of 720 HD 720p HD
excuse me
HD video and then the Xperia ion has a
1.3 megapixel front-facing with 720p
capabilities as well now talking a
little bit about the software on each of
these phones you see will just pop open
the lock screen on each we have a little
bit of a customization going on in the
Samsung Galaxy s3 through the display
options and the lock screen options that
we don't have on the Xperia ion now the
Xperia ion is running the Timescape UI
by Sony and the galaxy s3 is running the
TouchWiz UI developed by Samsung now
neither of these are the pure Android
experience
they're both carrier overlays
manufacturer overlays more like and so
you're not getting the full experience
of Android but you are getting the added
features of the UI's included on the
phones now anyways the Samsung Galaxy s3
is rockin Android 4.0.4 which is Ice
Cream Sandwich and it's also slated to
get jellybean in the near future
while the Xperia ion is a little bit
behind the curve and it's rocket Android
Gingerbread 2.3 now it's slated for an
ICS update but even that's a little bit
behind the curve considering the galaxy
s3 will be getting jellybean in the near
future another fact is that the galaxy
s3 is already robbed well rooted it has
root methods and you can update the OS
to jelly bean via Sanjit mom 10 now
there's no root method and you can't
even unlock the bootloader on the Xperia
ion as of now Sony has it locked down
tight like Motorola and HTC but will
hopefully be seeing a root method here
in the future now anyways let's just
pull down the status bar get a good idea
of the differences in notifications here
do you see on our Ice Cream Sandwich of
course we can swipe away our
notifications just like that and then
clear all with the press of a button now
we can't swipe away notifications on
Android 2.3 operating system but we can
clear all of them simply by pressing
clear now there aren't any toggles such
as brightness or the GPS Bluetooth and
stuff like that on the Xperia ion like
there are I'm a gala
cs3 and you can't access the settings
via the status bar we will actually have
to click the Settings icon now as you
can see the Times API and the TouchWiz
UI both have their own themes within
them Android menus and we do have a lot
of similar you know customizations and
stuff like that now the Xperia ion is
running the sony bravia engine which is
a software layer that enhances pics and
videos and it's under the display
settings here so we'll go ahead and
enable that we can do some head to head
video comparison tests now we do have
our Bravia Engine enabled and one thing
about the Xperia ion is you can't change
the brightness well actually you can
change brightness but it's not you have
no option for auto brightness as you do
on the Samsung Galaxy s3 where we can
enable the auto brightness it is simply
at your discrepancy so anyways we'll
just go back a bit we can check out the
Timescape UI versus they TouchWiz UI so
despite running the Android 2.3
operating system anytime scape UI does
give you the option of creating folders
a little bit easier than the Samsung
Galaxy s3 you can simply grab the
desired icon and hover it over one and
then you can create a folder just like
that when the folders are made to have
this nice four image little display
there and then they come up like that
now on the Samsung Galaxy s3 what you
need to do is grab an item you would
need to bring it to create folder and
then you can drag other items to that
particular folder and it comes up in a
similar fashion where everything else
dims and you've got your little folder
segmented from everything else now
anyways both of these phones are running
the Snapdragon s4 processor so let's
just go ahead and do some quadrant tests
to see which one actually performs a
little better now on the Android Ice
Cream Sandwich operating system we can
kill our running apps for a better
quadrant score simply by holding the
recent app slash home key here while on
the sony xperia ion we would have to go
into the running apps under the apps in
the settings menu so we're just going to
not do that oh it will still be a fair
comparison the one gigabyte of ram is
not to hog DUP right now I barely booted
up the phone so anyways let's open up
our quadrant
standard here and see which snapdragon
does the best now the RAM on the galaxy
s3 is going to help it out a bit two
gigabytes we'll get a better score in
that category but lets us run a full
benchmark on each of these so we'll take
a look at our quadrant scores here you
can see on the Samsung Galaxy s3 we
scored a forty seven hundred and twenty
five now the CPU got seventy eight
hundred twenty-five and the memory got
sixty eight hundred ninety six and on
the sony xperia ion we got a three
thousand ninety five score
so a thousand you know sixteen hundred
better almost on the samsung galaxy s3
but our cpus were fairly similar we got
5751 on the snapdragon s4 in the sony
xperia ion and we've got the same
processor in the galaxy s3 but it was
better optimized with the ram we got a
bigger score by far in memory on the
samsung galaxy s3 so we'll just go back
to our home screen the sony xperia ion
does not have the same capacitive style
keys as the samsung galaxy s3 as you can
see they light up on the galaxy s3 when
they're used and they disappear when
they're not avi um icons or you know
buttons on the Xperia ion are not
backlit they're just are these little
reflective metal ones and when you press
them you get a small little light under
there but in the night time it's sort of
hard to use you're gonna have to
memorize where these are at in order to
use them but we do have four as opposed
to three on the samsung galaxy s3
anyways the screens on each of these are
both very very powerful on our Xperia
ion we do have the LED backlit LCD
display which is coming in at four point
six inches and as 323 pixels per inch
now the Samsung Galaxy s3 only has 306
PPI but that's because they're stretched
out across this four point eight inch
display now our resolution on each is
the exact same is 720 by 1280 and we've
got Super AMOLED Omni Samsung Galaxy s3
so it's up for dispute a lot of people
like the LCD and then a lot of people
like the Super AMOLED now they're both
very bright and beautiful so let's just
check out a video test on each to
actually see if the Bravia Engine can
help enhance the
quality so let's view these two as you
can see the colors are looking a little
bit more bright on the Samsung Galaxy s3
than they are on the Sony Xperia ion but
we do have our Bravia Engine turned on
these are both connected to the same
Wi-Fi network their buffering at the
exact same rate and of course we are
watching the same video but aside from
playing video let's actually get into
their video taking capabilities now the
12 megapixel camera with the higher
resolution on the Sony Xperia ion seems
like it would perform better so let's
just go ahead and test that out we'll
open up our camera app now on the galaxy
s3 with Ice Cream Sandwich we do have a
few more integrated features as far as
cameras go we do have our burst shot our
HDR mode and the sony xperia ion is
lacking those but we'll go through the
settings really quickly we do have our
scenes here our landscape we've got the
night portrait night scene beach and
snow party and then we have document
here's our options for like scene
recognition we've we're out our normal
mode we do have our front camera we can
do a 3d suite panorama or a 3d suite
multi angle as well as a regular sweep
panorama here's our exposure values and
then we have our flash options on the
Samsung Galaxy s3 we've got our focus
options here auto focus macro face
detection here are our shooting modes
with single shot burst shot HDR smile
beauty of the whole lot nine yards there
here's our flash options and this is
where we would use the front-facing
camera so let's just take a few pictures
here I'm going to go ahead and move a
case over and we'll take it some shots
of that and then we'll do the same with
you Sony Xperia ion now the focus does
not really respond the same way as it
does on the Samsung Galaxy s3 is touch
to focus but you sometimes don't know if
it's even doing it you kind of have to
watch and then um the images don't look
as high-quality when they're on the
Xperia ion screen now this does have
somewhat of fast it's just somewhat of a
fast shutter excuse me
but it does not have the zero lag
shutter that a lot of the Samsung
devices these days possess now we'll go
into our gallery here and check out our
images we took
you kind of have to load up on the
Xperia ion but you can see here are the
two images they look a little the whites
look a little more defined on the
samsung galaxy s3 but we didn't you know
screw with any of our white balance
settings or anything like that but they
both took high quality images and
they're both you know actually the ion
has a better resolution as far as the
images go and we do have our options for
brightness and stuff like that and then
our editing options in the samsung
galaxy s3s menu and we also have the
same options in the Xperia ions now the
GPU and the Samsung Galaxy s3 is in
Adreno 2 to 5 and the GPU in the sony
xperia ion is in Adreno 220
not that big of a difference we got the
same performance gaming and stuff like
that
viewing HD videos taking HD videos now
I'm a little bit more on the hardware we
do have the Corning Gorilla Glass 2 on
the screen of a samsung galaxy s3 and on
the sony xperia ion it just says it has
a scratch resistant screen now that's
not Gorilla Glass but it is you know
going to protect against some things now
we do have a specific apps native to
each of these UIs we've got our s voice
and our smart stay features for the
TouchWiz UI we've also got our Music Hub
and on the Xperia ion we have things
like the Timescape social integration
where a lot of the Facebook things and
stuff like that are integrated right
into your phone you can hook up your
Facebook sync it up to your phone and
it's kind of native in there now we have
the music unlimited by Sony to rival the
Music Hub app for the Samsung phones we
do have our same Google Apps now our
time scape here is where we integrate
our Facebook and stuff like that and you
obviously give you a quick demo of that
this is one of our time scape widgets
this is just our Facebook stuff here if
we scroll all the way through it also
integrates our Twitter and we can just
basically see what all of our friends
are doing in our followers and stuff
like that we do have our notifications
on the messaging there and basically
yeah they each have their own native
applications with their own user
interface so it's just up in the air
whether your preference is for better
social integration
or for more hardware-related native
features then both of these have their
own respective NFC tag capabilities
we've got our xperia smarttags for the
Sony we have our Samsung tech tiles for
the galaxy s3 they work in the same way
you can do the exact same things so
we're not really going to demo those we
do have a demo of the tech tiles on our
YouTube but we're not going to demo
those today so if you final thoughts the
galaxy s3 does have removable battery
where the Xperia ion does not but we do
have the HDMI out on the Xperia ion for
enhanced gameplay and stuff as well as
our Bravia Engine now both of these
phones are just great I love them the
Xperia ion is very sexy and sleek
looking it's got a very nice profile and
of course is the samsung galaxy s3 as
well
now um I don't really have a preference
over which phone I do like but the
galaxy s3 does have better developer
support as of now
it currently has Ice Cream Sandwich the
Xperia ion is lacking that it's also
lacking the developer support it doesn't
even have a root method but it's a very
powerful phone for those of you who you
know maybe aren't into robbing your
phone rooting it stuff like that they're
both very powerful devices and they're
capable of doing anything you want
experience got a 12 megapixel camera so
it's got a you know a little bit of an
edge there and then we do have our pros
and cons on each but they're both
awesome phones guys go ahead and pick
one up if you're in the market either
one and go ahead and drop us a comment
tell you which tell us which one you
think is better and maybe if you want to
see some more stuff done with each of
these phones let us know that but thanks
