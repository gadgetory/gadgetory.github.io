Authority what's going on everybody and
we are back at the Sony booth taking a
look at the Sony onami or what you
probably know by now as the Xperia z1
and we're going to take a bit of a
future focus and look at the camera I'm
also going to do our best to extract the
photos that we take from here and maybe
a quick video to show you what the
quality is of this behemoth cheap lens
which comes in at almost 21 megapixels
so if we go over then open up the camera
and like you probably saw in our video
already from before there are a bunch of
modes that are available now and they
also include excuse me they also include
downloadable app enhancements so if we
look at this right here
of course it's all in German right now
but we have certain things like AR
effects which allow for augmented
reality in the example that they showed
there was a dinosaur on the floor that
they had I guess we can try that right
now add a dinosaur in
t-rex coming in its walking on the floor
it's on the floor oh my goodness alright
so there are a couple other ones as well
social life is a very interesting one
where you're able to actually broadcast
what is coming from the camera on this
screen or on the screen you're able to
broadcast was coming through the camera
on this phone and broadcasting live to a
social website like Facebook which is
probably the main one and as its
streaming live to Facebook people can
comment on the stream and you can do
some real-time social networking so
going through some of the features on
here there are a bunch of scene modes
there are also some manual controls that
are available so you can change the
white balance there change the
the exposure compensation there is the
flash settings right here you can see me
right there what's going on everybody
all right and then we can take a look at
a few of the other the interface is a
little bit changed from other experience
but it's it's still intuitive it's still
pretty easy to go through so
back I'm gonna take a couple pictures
we'll start off with this and zoom in
all right another thing we'll do is to
take a short video so let's switch over
to the video mode right
right over there
look at the gallery you can see here
especially on mobile you can see that
the pictures are pretty well detailed
obviously this is a 20 megapixel camera
so the details are still pretty good
even when you zoom in but from my
distance it still looks quite good
all those all right
and so there you have it there are
definitely a lot of features that are
available to this especially since they
are downloadable you should the rest
assured that there are going to be a lot
of new enhancements available for the
Xperia camera that allow it to give you
even more creativity when it comes to
your smartphone photography so we are
live here at the Sony booth here at
Aoife in Berlin stay tuned for more of
our coverage here at the event so stay
tuned to Android 30 because we are your
source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
