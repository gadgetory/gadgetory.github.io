Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly this
week we're going to talk about apps maps
and mole wraps and China let's get
started first up this week root users
can rejoice because titanium backup is
officially ready for lollipop the app
received an update earlier this week
that gave an initial support for
lollipop and that's a good thing some
other changes include a couple of bug
fixes updated translations and the
update fixes an issue with Google Play
newsstand it's been a hallmark
application for root users as long as I
can remember and I guess it will
continue to be for at least one more
version of Android Google Play services
was updated to version 6.5 this week and
it brought with it a lot of changes the
four services that this affects the most
our Google Drive Google fits google
wallet and google maps apps will be able
to create both public and private custom
file properties in Google Drive and
there will be better controls provided
for device inking developers now have
better control over activity segments in
Google fit which allows them to better
see and control exercise segments which
are broken up when you take a break from
exercising in Google Maps provides
developers an easier way to provide you
with relevant maps in certain situations
and there is a new toolbar all in all
once it's implemented it should save you
some time for Google wallets there is
only donate to Google Wallet button
lastly it's also worth mentioning that
developers can be more specific about
which api's they need for their
applications and that should help create
better smaller apps with fewer
permissions and less battery drain the
ingress turned two years old this last
week and have released an awesome
infographic to show off their stats some
of these numbers are pretty intense
according to natick labs gamers have
deployed 64 million resonators visited
portals 178 million times and walked a
total of around one hundred and twenty
seven kilometers which translates to 78
million miles or 327 times the distance
between the Earth and the moon these are
all very impressive and congratulations
are in order can't wait to see these
stats again in a couple of years earlier
this week Google bought a company called
relative wave and that may eventually
lead to better development tools on
Android ok so related wave is known for
an application to do called form which
allows iOS developers to see how their
app looks and operates while they're in
the middle of making it it's currently
only available for iOS and Mac but you
can get form and the companion app
called viewer for free if you want it we
have no doubt this will work its way
over to android eventually and likely
even platforms other than Mac such as PC
or maybe even Linux this looks like an
interesting way to design an application
and it'll be fun to see what Google does
with it in our last bit of news this
week is the Google Play Store finally
gonna make its way over to China maybe
Google and China have been in informal
talks for years now so it's no surprise
that another rumor is popping up now
word around the digital water cooler is
that Google is in talks with huawei and
ZTE to get google play off the ground in
China this would be a massive
undertaking for Google that could
potentially make them a lot of money
because China is gigantic to support
that idea Chinese developers can now
make and sell paid apps in the Google
Play Store and that may very well be
that pivotal first step one wants to see
some trending applications as usual if
you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the written companion which is in the
video description below email is a new
email application that tries to
reimagine the email experience on mobile
it relies on a messaging chat bubble
style interface and has a few fun
features like voice emails redesigned
attachments management's and a really
good search function it's free in the
google play store right now if you want
to try it flexy had a big week they
managed to break their own Guinness Book
of World Records speed record and to
celebrate they have permanently lowered
the price of their application to a
dollar 99 if you've been on the fence
about buying flexi this is the perfect
time to do it but remember that they do
have a free trial version so you can try
it first to see if you like it the hunt
is a community-driven fashion
application allows you to snap pictures
of various outfits upload them to the
hunts and other people who use the
platform will help you identify what
those items are how much they cost and
where you can buy them their demo video
sucks but the app itself can be quite
handy for those who are fashionably
minded and it's totally free swiftkey
keyboard got a huge update this last
week that helps fixing number
performance issues and lag problems
they've also added some new languages on
top of that they also released a
material design keyboard theme pack for
two dollars and ninety-nine cents so if
you want the material goodness but want
it on a different keyboard this is
definitely the way to go nokia is highly
anticipated z launchers out on beta in
the google play store right now it's
received a slew of bad reviews because
of an activation thing they did and that
sucks for them however the launcher
itself is very simple and realised very
heavily on
gesture controls it's not ready for
primetime yet but if you want to check
it out it is free with no in-app
purchases if you want to check out the
