handy the Android authority app guide
Microsoft Office is now free to use for
everyone on Android which means it's
about time we took a closer look at it
ok so there's very little about
Microsoft Office that you don't already
know
you know what Microsoft Word spreadsheet
and PowerPoint are and how they work so
thankfully this part of the review won't
take very long as you can imagine the
mobile version of Office contains these
three things and you can use them to
create and edit documents presentations
and spreadsheets when creating and
editing you have the basic tools like
editing and control you also have some
basic formatting features should you
need them it's not nearly as powerful as
the desktop applications are the office
365 Web Apps that's really a shame and
we hope they increase functionality
eventually but aside from some tweaks
here and there it's going to be
difficult to prepare full featured
documents of presentations on the mobile
version it's a fairly simple application
and that's about all it does in terms of
pure functionality however there is more
going on under the hood using Microsoft
Office requires a Microsoft account once
you have that you'll automatically get
some storage for Microsoft's onedrive
service which you may know by its prior
name which is SkyDrive currently you get
7 gigabytes for free and there's a
promotion for now that gives you an
extra 3 gigabytes of storage if you
download the onedrive app and use it to
upload your photos from your Android
device so you can get a possible 10
gigabytes for free now that matters
because everything you do in Microsoft
Office is saved and drawn from your
onedrive account much like how every
document you create in Google Drive is
also stored in Google Drive there is
very little difference between the two
fundamentally and for that Microsoft
does deserve a little bit of praise in
terms of design office actually looks
pretty good moving around the
application is so simple that no one
should be getting lost it uses some of
the Android design guidelines such as
swipeable tabs and using the logo at the
top to go back to previous pages inside
the files it's easy to navigate around
your documents it automatically saves
every single file to onedrive so you
can't really go surfing around your
device storage so don't plan on being
able to do that the interface is overall
very simplistic and the controls in the
apps are pretty simplistic too really
nothing is difficult at all that doesn't
mean it isn't tedious because it
definitely is tedious in order to get
the full experience you'll have to
download the onedrive application as
well that's really the only good way to
navigate your onedrive account when you
open documents in onedrive it'll
automatically
opening Microsoft Office but the office
application itself doesn't surf onedrive
accounts very well and we thought that
was kind of a poor design choice okay so
here's what we liked about Microsoft
Office Microsoft is finally giving it
the old college try
their first attempt at an office app was
not the most popular option and it
didn't work all that well now that it's
free and it's been overhauled and
integrated with onedrive it is much
better than it used to be one of the
biggest complaints about non microsoft
office apps is how it wrecks the
formatting of Microsoft Office documents
with this application that should no
longer be a problem you are forced to
use onedrive for storage for this
application and that kind of sucks but
they do give you seven gigabytes for
free so it's not all that bad you can
also get three more gigabytes for a
limited time by downloading the onedrive
app and giving it permission to upload
your camera roll so you start with about
10 gigabytes and even though Google
Drive gives you more at least Microsoft
doesn't leave you in the dirt in terms
of cloud storage full integration with
onedrive means that if you download the
onedrive app on your PC and have an
internet connection you have full
control over the documents on both
platforms without any difficulty office
on mobile can open any document in
onedrive as can the PC office app as can
the office 365 web app multi-platform
integration is never bad ever
lastly the design isn't terrible
Microsoft has developed some
questionable mobile apps for Android in
the past and this does not fall into
that category it doesn't follow all of
the Android design suggestions but it
does follow a few of them and the app
design positively reflects that and
here's what we didn't like so much we
would have liked to have seen more
formatting tools you can do the basic
stuff like bold underline italics color
and size but things like adding images
advanced formatting and others aren't
present and that's disappointing
integration with onedrive is fantastic
and I really like it but knowing when to
use which app for which purposes is a
little hard to get used to like if you
need to open a document you'll find it
easier in the onedrive application
rather than the office app and that's a
little bit disorienting also your only
storage option is onedrive although you
can download files from onedrive to your
local storage if you have to despite the
good design the controls are a little
bit tedious when you open a document you
have to click the pencil icon in the top
in order to edit it that extra step kind
of screws with the brain because you're
kind of used to just being able to open
an application and go that along with
the way the app lets you see formatting
options can be tedious and even a little
bit frustrating to get used to here's
the bottom line with Microsoft Office
Mobile it's a lot better than I was
expecting it to be given prior
experiences with Microsoft applications
there really wasn't that expectation
that this would be directly comparable
to the best Android has to offer
as it turns out it is directly
comparable and Microsoft has a pretty
good app here that said you won't be
concocting epic documents with this
application you can edit them and create
some basic stuff but the hard work will
still have to be done with either the
web application or the desktop
application in any case if you're an
office user or a onedrive user and you
have Android I highly recommend you
