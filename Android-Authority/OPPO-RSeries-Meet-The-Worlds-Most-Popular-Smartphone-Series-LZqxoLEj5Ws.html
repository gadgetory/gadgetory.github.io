with Android authority and here in
western markets we hear a lot about the
galaxies and iPhones and how popular
they are but what if I told you that the
best-selling smartphone of 2017 wasn't
produced by what we traditionally think
of as one of the big players that's
right the title of the best-selling
smartphone of 2017 went to the Oppo r9s
but why what's attracting so many
consumers to opos our series of
smartphones well to answer that question
our friends at Oppo asked us to take a
look back at some of the most
significant our series smartphones
you'll want to buckle up as there's
quite a few of them it truly started way
back in 2014
simpler times I know but that's when
Opel launched the r5 the world's
thinnest smartphone at a time at just
four point eight five millimeters what
was most impressive about the r5 was how
it managed to avoid compromised despite
its thin composition instead the r5 was
an enticing phone for gamers especially
Opel went even as far as to create their
own mobile game to teach users about the
r5 s capabilities the Oppo r5 s 5.2 inch
Super AMOLED 1080p display 13 megapixel
camera and use of the snapdragon 615 set
it apart from a lot of mid-range phones
and that's what really caught people's
attention Opel was soon to become much
more popular than they could have
imagined two years later it happened
Lopo announced what would be the world's
best-selling smartphone the following
year the Oppo r9 s I actually personally
reviewed the r9 us shortly after its
release in that review I praised the
phone's ability to deliver excellent
battery life great cameras and
innovative fast charge technology I also
remember the fingerprint reader being
unbelievably quick which I wasn't
expecting from such a competitively
priced smartphone despite the hardware
improvements Oppo managed to keep the r9
s pretty thin and perhaps most
importantly affordable it's one of the
best mid-range smartphones of 2017 it
should come as no surprise that people
ended up loving it especially in opos
hall market of China this thing sold
like crazy on singles day which if you
are familiar is like China's Black
Friday occurring on November 11th each
year Plus Oppo further gain customers by
offering the phone in a special new year
right edition oppa had clearly built up
a lot of momentum at this point
expectations were high and the pressure
was on customers wanted to see Oppo
deliver an even better mid-range phone
and well Oppo delivered just that with
the Oppo our 11 in mid 2017 I actually
flew out to China to see this phone
launch and be one of the first to get my
unit before the general public and as
you may have guessed I was very
impressed what's truly mind-boggling is
just how much the smartphone appealed to
the everyday user it ticked all the
right boxes and became the world's top
Android smartphone in less than four
weeks once I spent some time with the
r11 I put out a review where I once
again praised opposed work the r11
featured even better cameras a refined
body in the same great battery life it
was an all-around steal that I knew
would appeal to the masses at this point
Oppo knew they were onto something great
in order to continue their successful
journey they went back to the drawing
board to come up with a fresh design
that would further differentiate them
from other big players after all you
have to change it up every once in a
while in order to keep customers excited
about your products the Oppo r15 pro was
what they came up with released in April
2018 the r15 pro introduced an all-new
glass design a larger display with less
bezels and improved overall user
experience this was a clear departure
from oboes previous work and while there
were some criticisms of the phone we'll
carefully listen to user feedback and
just recently Opel revealed their latest
addition to the our series the Oppo r17
pro with more than 5 years of research
and development under their belts as
well as deep insights and how they might
improve their device strategy following
the arc-15 Pro the r17 Pro has impressed
many one of its standout attributes is
its unique raindrop display not somehow
Opel managed to significantly cut down
the display notch size in just a matter
of months not only does the r17 pro
feature one of the smallest notches on
an all display smartphone it also
features one of the coolest most
natural-looking the front isn't the only
part that changed here though for the
back Oppo embrace neon colours to create
beautiful eye catching gradients with
growing confidence Oppo took a risk and
revealed one of the bull
smartphone designs we've seen to date in
our review we praise the Oppo r17 pro
for it's absolutely gorgeous design
awesome cameras and its implementation
of a cutting-edge in display fingerprint
scanner with the r17 pro opal one
against the trend of mediocre mid-range
smartphone cameras even further
especially for low-light shots I mean
just check out some of these sample
images the r17 pro represents opos
dedication to relentless improvement not
only did they deliver some exceptional
hardware but they also worked very hard
to make the software experience more
appealing to a wider audience
oppose our series of smartphones has no
doubt been one of the most influential
smartphone lineups in history and now
with a phone that goes against the tide
while still being great for pretty much
anyone looking for a great smartphone
without having to give up an arm and a
leg
opal looks to build upon their past
successes
