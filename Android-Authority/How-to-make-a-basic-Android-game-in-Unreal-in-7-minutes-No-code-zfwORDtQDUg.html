Android but I don't actually recommend
that you use Android studio instead it
makes a lot more sense to you something
like unreal or unity those being game
engines that already have lots of the
physics and lots of the behavior of
different game elements in place for you
and have a nice graphical interface to
make things really nice and simple
I've touched on this channel a fair bit
about using unity for game development
it is the preferred method it's the most
popular game engine on the Play Store
but Unreal 4 is the biggest competitor
to unity either way whichever one you
choose both of these are great tools for
Android game development and make
everything really simple and easy and a
really flexible you can create anything
you can think of pretty much of course
you need to get started somewhere though
and the first time you boot up Unreal 4
it's kind of like oh it's got a lot of
Windows a lot of stuff going on it's
quite confusing there are lots of
tutorials out there but quite a lot of
them involve a lot of preamble of
setting up a lot of technical jargon you
don't really need to know right away
ain't nobody get down put it and so in
this video I want to once again show you
how to get something quite impressive up
and running in just seven minutes
there's not going to be a full game you
probably won't want to sell this it
won't even have enemies or levels or
anything like that but you will have a
basic platform that you can control with
touchscreen controls you can jump around
have your own animations your own
sprites and my hope is that this is
gonna serve as enough of a starting
point so that you can get a bit excited
about Unreal development and also so
that you can understand the big picture
of how everything works then you can
build from there by using those other
more granular tutorials so without any
further ado let's get started and build
an android game using unreal in just
seven minutes to get started first
you're going to need to create a new
project you'll see we have lots of
options available to us which will be
suitable for different types of game we
want to choose to the side scroller then
set it from mobile or tablet with
maximum quality and including the
starter content the top tab should say
blueprint rather than C++ as this means
we won't need any coding in order to get
things up and running once that's
finished you'll see that you already
have a playable platform game
you've got character you've got
platforms hit play and click on the
viewport and you'll be able to run
around jump and watch the pretty
animations using the spacebar and arrow
keys and so there you have it your first
2d game in just 20 seconds lulz ok so
obviously we going to be doing a bit
more than that more specifically we're
going to customize all these elements
that are already here so that you can
turn this generic prototype into the
basis for your unique game with your own
graphics and animations to create new
actors for our game the generic term for
any game object I'm using the existing
sprites folder drop a PNG or other image
file into there using the File Explorer
then right click on it and go to sprite
actions create sprites now head to the
blueprints folder right click again this
time anywhere in the folder then select
the create basic asset blueprint class
and finally actor this is a class that
will allow us to create lots of
different iterations of the same object
say a platform if you're familiar with
unity it's the equivalent of a prefab
call this floor tile or tile or
something like that now a double-click
on that new blueprint class to open up
the editor in the top left select add
component and then choose sprite you can
search it's quicker now select that new
element in the components window and
then drag and drop your platform sprite
into the sprite box you can now see that
the tile is part of your platform don't
forget to adjust the scale if your
sprite isn't already the perfect size
click Save then return to your game
once you've done that you can simply
drag and drop this new element anywhere
into your game when you drop your
platform into the level make sure that
the y-coordinate which for some reason
behaves like a Z coordinate is set to 0
otherwise it might be in front or behind
the player and the player won't interact
with the collider you'll notice your
platform already has a Collider that's
the yellow box which tells unreal that
your player shouldn't be able to pass
through the item copy and paste this
tile around a little bit drag it and
that way you can start designing your
own level and of course delete the old
platforms as well of course you can
create many more actors and drop them
into your levels like this by using
different sprites different settings and
different logic via graphs many of which
can easily look up online you'll be able
to create a whole host of challenging
obstacles and rewarding collectables
to further customize the level we might
also want to change to the background do
this simply by selecting background
sprites in the world outliner and then
changing the source sprite to one of
your own making in details I'm using a
starry sky I created the last and
possibly most important thing we need to
change though to make this generic
platformer into our platformer is the
main character to handle this we're
going to need to use some more sprites
which we're going to turn into animation
now create two new sub folders idle and
walking into each we're going to drag
and drop our character sprites instead
of using a sprite sheet we're adding
individual images and naming them in
ascending numerical order to keep things
nice and simple drop these into the
relevant folders right click on them and
then select sprite actions create
sprites once again we'll make our idle
animation first I only have two images
for this which is meant to simulate kind
of breathing in a low frame pixel art
manner a quick tip if you choose pixel
art you have far less work to do to set
this up right-click in the folder and
choose animation paper flip book flip
books is just the term that unreal uses
for its animations name your new
animation idle and then double-click to
open it up now in here you're going to
head over to where it says sprite then
you're going to add two keyframes by
hitting the plus button or you can just
drag and drop your images into the kind
of timeline down the bottom this will
add two members
you'll see the animation begins to cycle
through those frames immediately right
now though this is CG inducing so turn
down the framerate to something like
five and it looks a lot more like
breathing save and an exit and now you
can do the precise same thing with your
walking animation keeping the framerate
higher of course and adding more
keyframes save that and once they're
both done you can head over to finally
2d side-scroller character actor or porn
over m 2d side-scroller
VP blueprints double-click on this and
you'll open up the editor again but this
time you might see something a little
bit different a graph remember that we
chose graphs instead of C++ when we set
up the project basically this means that
we're using a visual flow chart of sorts
in the place of actual code which is
great if you don't know a lot of
programming zoom out find the box that
says handle animation and then finally
drop down menus under select these will
look a little familiar idle animation
and running animation all you need to do
is to click those buttons and swap them
out for the ones you created finally
flick over to the viewport window and
find the box that says source flipbook
on the right once you've selected the
player-character switch that for your
own idle animation and make sure to edit
the scale under the transform heading on
the right to match your character to the
size of the original one remember to hit
compile and save once that's done and
with that done you should now see that
it's your own character running around
using your own animations unlevel that
you designed the look of and the layout
of to run this on your device simply go
to file package project and Android
you'll then be able to create an apk
which you can pop onto your device to
test you should have a working basic
platformer with touch input and
animations it's a pretty exciting start
bearing in mind we've only spent seven
minutes remember though you'll need to
have set up all of this correctly to
begin with that means setting up unreal
in order to work with Android my advice
is to remove Gradle support for the
build as at the moment that isn't quite
working correctly I'd also advise using
code works for Android to install all
the necessary elements like the Java SDK
thanks time for watching guys hope fans
really useful and interesting if you did
then please share around please leave a
like please comment down below all that
stuff helps us out immensely
