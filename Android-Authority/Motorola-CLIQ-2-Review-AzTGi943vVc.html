Android authority my name is Darrell
doke and this is our review for the
Motorola Cliq 2 on t-mobile the Cliq 2
is a direct competitor to Verizon
stroyed two Sprint's EVO shift 4G and
t-mobile zone g2 and that they are all
landscape QWERTY sliders they have
approximately the same screen size of
3.7 inches and lack a front-facing video
camera we're going to do a quick
overview of the device and then we're
going to get to the user experience
really the pros and cons of using this
device on an everyday basis the clip 2
has an all plastic body that has a
chrome bezel around the front as well as
a stylized back to increase grip and
increase style the top of the device has
a power button as well as a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack the left side
has your charging port and an LED
notification light to tell you that the
charger is plugged in the bottom has a
little hidden microphone port right
there the right side of the device has a
volume rocker a silent switch and a
2-stage camera button the rear of the
device has a five megapixel camera and a
dual LED flash this video camera however
only does 720 by 480 it does not do 720p
like most handsets there are two speak
reports on the back here on the front of
the device we have four touch capacitive
buttons in a standard layout a 3.7 inch
display that is fw v g at 854 by 480 on
the top left there is a proximity sensor
and light sensor on the top right corner
there is an LED notification light one
of the only issues I have with a clip -
is that the recessed earpiece tends to
collect Pocket lint
like the Kliq xt dip this device
supports a ten-point one megabit down
HSPA as well as having a five point
seven six megabit upload speed I in
reality I did notice a four to five
megabit download speed as well as a one
and a half to two megabit upload speed
the formal QWERTY keyboard is pretty
nice with its raised honeycomb design it
does seem a little small though with a
lack of any usage of this
1/2 inch space on each side but that
area is used for the slider the slider
on the click - is very nice and gives
you a lot of confidence in its design
the battery uptime of the device is
pretty good if left and standby it
lasted easily a few days if I was using
it lightly I would only have to charge
it once in the evening if I was using it
heavily I would have to go to a charger
at least once in a day one of the issues
I did have with this device that might
be my review unit is a non-responsive
power button if you pull the battery
from the device you have to hold this
button for 5 seconds in order to reboot
it and if what sometimes would not
detect that I was pushing it one of the
features that click - does lack is touch
to focus the only way to focus is with
the two-stage camera button so some of
your pictures are going to be out of
focus if you're trying to focus on
certain areas of the screen web browsing
on the click - was pretty fast even with
flash enabled as you can see
pinch-to-zoom works pretty good as well
as double tap to zoom one of the
features I do like is using the shift
button that is the way you copied of
your clipboard and then in a situation
of where you're going to paste you touch
and hold say paste from clipboard and
there's a history of everything that you
have copied recently another feature I
found pretty cool was if you're viewing
your bookmarks in thumbnail view and
landscape they're on a carousel
if however if you go to portrait they go
back to list view another cool feature I
thought was if you add a shortcut to a
bookmark on your desktop it's actually a
little thumbnail of the website itself
instead of being a icon of a bookmark
another feature that is cool well web
browsing and hit the menu button hit
more and hit save page and you can
actually save a copy of a webpage to
your SD card for later viewing it one of
things I didn't really care for was the
unpredictability of sometimes if the
device is lagged out these touch
capacitive buttons if you touch them
haptic feedback wouldn't kick in because
the device was
lagged and so I'd end up double-clicking
it which opened up a different
application instead of just bringing in
to the home screen or would bring it to
the home screen and then when you hit
the home button a second time it would
pop up the application tray
the device does come stock with seven
desktop screens which is quick
navigatable by this little navigation
bar navigating I clicked you did work
out very good the location was found
very fast upon him putting a new address
as well as the speaker was able to be
heard over road noise and a stereo on
medium volume now going into the
settings of the device there are a few
things that are pretty nice one of them
is battery manager it's able to change
your sync settings in order that save
some of your battery power another thing
that is interesting here in the settings
menu is that cut in the call settings
there's a voice quality option which
essentially changes the way the voices
are heard through the earpiece another
feature here in the display settings is
in Pocket detection which uses the
proximity sensor to detect when it's in
your pocket and allow it to not be
accidentally unlocked not all devices
have it but if you go on location in
security this does have a digital
compass that you can calibrate in order
to assist with augmented reality apps as
well as navigation the feature that
assists on multitasking is if you go
into applications you can change what
double tap on home does it don't really
comes with doing nothing it's set on
none I set it up to Gmail so when you
double tap on home it brings you
straight to the Gmail application being
that the quick to goes with all touch
buttons and has no physical end button
another option is going into
accessibility you can set it up so the
power button ends recalls one thing I
was curious about what the Motorola Cliq
2 is how many touches this touch screen
was able to support at one time this one
is maxing out at only two touches in
comparison the mytouch 4G is able to do
up to four touches and so in application
later on that supports more than two
touches on the multi-touch screen
click two is only able to do two versus
the mytouch 4G s for an application that
was pretty nice
was this Motorola phone portal and here
you're able to connect to the device
using the IP address in a web browser
and then you're able to open a file
manager window in order to copy files to
and from the device as well as manage
contacts and things like that one of the
bonuses I did find in the quick series
and motoblur was using their visual
voicemail that's built in you are able
to listen to your voicemails over your
mono Bluetooth headset which you cannot
normally do with t-mobile's visual
voicemail application thanks for
checking out our in-depth review on the
Motorola Cliq 2 and the user experience
