I'm April
sharing forms an important part of our
human experience in fact as a smartphone
user I've been sharing pictures music
and videos wirelessly your Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi direct sometimes it works at other
times it doesn't another technology near
field communication or NFC lets you
share stuff too just by tapping your
device's back against the back of
another NFC capable device how do you
share stuff via NFC in this video I'll
show you how to use NFC to share data
and files anti program NFC tags I'll be
using various Android devices all of
which have NFC the steps I mention here
may or may not work for your device so
that you can use NFC your device needs
to have NFC capabilities how do you
check your device for it one way to
check it is by looking at your device's
backplate some devices like this one
have an NFC certification sticker on the
back plate here's another device with
the NFC logo another way is to go to the
settings menu under Wireless and
networks tap on more you should see NFC
and Android Beam among the other options
once you've confirmed that your phone or
tablet does have NFC you also need to
activate the NFC chip to be able to
share data through it just tap the NFC
option on the menu Android Beam will
also automatically activate both options
need to be on otherwise you will be
unable to use NFC properly both the NFC
chip and Android Beam allow you to swap
data between two capable devices just by
tapping their bags together through NFC
you can share certain types of data such
as photos contact information website
URLs videos and apps
you only need to beam the data to the
recipient device to successfully beam
data both NFC and Android Beam should be
active on the sender and receiver
devices next select the content that you
want to share ideally the receiving
phone should be on its home screen put
the devices back together like this on
the sender phone you'll see the display
shrinked into a thumbnail and the words
touch to beam shown at the top tap the
thumbnail to beam it when beaming is
successful you will receive a
notification
like this or an app will launch on the
receiving phone like this this is the
typical procedure when beaming files and
content you'll notice this procedure
used repeatedly in this guide now that
you have an idea of the general way to
being content via NFC let's try it out
by sharing an image sharing a photo or
image via NFC is extremely easy first
open the image this is usually done in
the gallery app then place the back of
your device against the back of the
recipient device like this both devices
will make a sound and vibrate slightly
indicating that the devices have made
contact on the sender device you'll see
a thumbnail of the image window and the
words touch to beam on top your image
file is now ready for beaming tap on the
screen to beam it don't separate the
devices until you've tapped to be the
receiving device we'll get a
notification that says incoming beam no
need to do anything here just wait for
it to complete once beaming is complete
you can access the image by pulling down
the notification shade and tapping on
beam complete or by going to the gallery
app unfortunately not all NFC enabled
devices are cooperative for example some
phones like the Xperia T refuse to share
images with phones like the HTC One X
this leads me to believe that NFC may
not be the best way to swap images and
photos I've had better experience using
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi direct you know
through NFC you can also share apps not
the actual app files themselves just the
apps page on the Google Play Store to
share an app just launch the app then
place both sender and recipient devices
back-to-back until you feel the familiar
vibration and hear the familiar NFC
sound I'll show you how to be my
favorite game app arcane legends to my
One X just launch the game tap both
backs touch to beam and voila the other
device opens the arcane legends page on
the Play Store that was quick right you
can also share an open web page easily
with other devices you can do it right
from your browser window I'm going to
share this android authority article so
all I have to do is this touch to beam
and voila make sure that both devices
are connected to the Internet you can
share both YouTube videos and local
videos to sharing a YouTube video is
similar to webpage sharing just open the
video in
the YouTube app tap device backs like
this touch to beam and there it goes
both devices need to be connected to the
Internet of course beaming a local video
file is done in a similar way just open
the video file usually in the gallery
app tap both devices touch to beam
wonderful contact information is also
one of the most frequently shared
content type you can beam contact info
through NFC to it's super easy open the
contact info page tab the devices backs
like this tap the screen to beam the
contact card tada
aside from beaming small chunks of data
to another device NFC introduces another
world of convenience through locational
NFC tags or stickers such tags or
stickers contain microchips that store
information readable by NFC capable
devices just tap your NFC device on a
tag and it will read the instructions on
that tag tags can contain website URLs
contact information and even device
setting profiles that can be activated
on a device so you can stick such tags
in various places for example stick a
tag to your office desk and tap on it to
activate your devices office profile
settings or stick a tag to a poster and
tap your device on it to quickly open a
website to read data from or write data
to such NFC tags you'll need an NFC tag
reading or tag writing app the Optimus G
for instance comes pre-loaded with such
an app known as the LG Tag Plus app tags
programmed using this app can only be
read by devices that have this same app
installed I have here several MMC tags
these are programmable tags that came
with my Optimus G I can program an NFC
tag to open a web page configure my
phone settings or even send a text just
by tapping my phone against the tag so
for instance I want this NFC tag to set
my phone to vibrate mode turn on Wi-Fi
and turn off Bluetooth this
configuration is perfect for office use
so I can just stick this tag to a corner
of my desk and tap my phone on it upon
arriving I'll need to program this NFC
tag first for that I'm going to use a
free app called the NFC task launcher
app from the Google Play Store it's very
flexible in NFC tags management it's not
bad specific either unlike LG
Algie tag plus a poor so nice Xperia
smart tags here's how the NFC task
launcher app looks like essentially I'm
going to use it to save on to this NFC
sticker a set of instructions that I'd
like my phone to perform whenever I'd
have my phone against this NFC tag B AB
has default configurations grouped
according to potential use locations
such as inside the car at home and so on
in my case I'm most likely to find the
closest configuration under the office
profile so I select it and configure the
actions under it first I want the phone
to use vibrant mode so I set the sound
profile to vibrate then enable Wi-Fi
I still need one more instruction for
turning off Bluetooth but it's not here
by default so I need to add a new action
like this and define the new action for
turning off Bluetooth there let me just
review this list quickly vibrate phone
and able Wi-Fi Bluetooth off great
everything's ready now tap the save and
write button then touch the tag with a
phone's bag to save the data to the tag
you'll get a confirmation on the screen
if the data writing succeeds time to
test it now let's check my phone's
current settings first Lu tooth is on
Wi-Fi is off and my sound profile is set
to ring at full volume now I'm imagining
that I just arrived at the office and I
want my phone to go into Office mode
right now so I tap my phone against my
NFC tag here and tada
instant office mode according to my
personal specifications all I need to do
now is confirm that I want to apply the
changes will this break on another phone
let's find out yep that works and it
will work on any other device just as
long as it devices NFC capable and the
NFC task launcher app is installed on it
let me show you another example using a
tablet this time for now let's set aside
this office profile tag and create a new
one for use at home when I get home I
want my tablet to open the Android
authority website connect to my home
Wi-Fi and set the sound profile to
normal I'll program this other tag using
NFC task launcher I'll be lucky with the
home profile I guess so I'll select it
here I'll set the sound profile to
normal and the Wi-Fi to enable since I
also want to open a URL I need to enable
this option and provide the Android
authority
URL here as before save the instructions
to the tag and touch a tag with the
tablets back there let's go home and
switch from office mode to home mode
currently my tablet is using office
settings with my Wi-Fi off tap my tablet
against my home profile tag and voila
the settings are set now I don't have to
worry about setting my profiles manually
when I reach home I can create such
profile tags for use in various places
like in the car in my bedroom - these
NFC tags provide a lot of convenience
Near Field Communication Technology
isn't new technology and developers are
still exploring the many ways to use it
in the world of Android tablets and
smartphones it has already found some
usefulness in the form of quick sharing
of content as well as secure bills
payment the technology still has a lot
of possible uses and it's only a matter
of time before those other uses can be
fully explored and implemented in this
video I've shown you how to share
content on your device to another NFC
capable device I hope you find NFC
useful on your Android device for more
