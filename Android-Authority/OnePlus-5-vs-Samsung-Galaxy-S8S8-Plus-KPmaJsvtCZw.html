authority and oneplus has always managed
to deliver a flagship Android experience
at a much lower price point than the
competition but how does it compare to
one of the best from Samsung and
arguably one of the best Android phones
available right now can it really
compete at every step this is the
oneplus 5 versus the Samsung Galaxy s8
even though the 1 plus 5 and the galaxy
s 8 / s8 plus are separated by a good
hundred to 200 dollars these phones are
closer than you might think but that
doesn't mean there aren't any
compromises with a cheaper price tag of
the 1 plus 5 there's quite a few
advantages that the s8 has over the
oneplus 5 the s8 has wireless charging
expandable storage and is water and dust
resistant none of these are really
make-or-break features with the
exception of maybe the s8 protection
against water and dust and with ingress
protection being so much more common on
smartphones it's getting to the point
where it's becoming a standard feature
and we just sort of expect phones to
have it
sort of like we expect phones to have
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth speaking of Bluetooth
both e1 plus 5 and s8 come with
Bluetooth 5 onboard which puts both of
them ahead of other phones in this
regard since there aren't that many
phones with Bluetooth 5 at the moment
that's one of the few things that these
2 phones have in common but for the most
part they're radically pretty different
experiences one of the biggest and most
obvious differences is the way they look
and feel c1 plus 5 features an all-metal
build that does bear some similarities
to the iPhone with 3 shaped antenna
lines and dual camera but it is a
good-looking design and comfortable to
hold because of the slightly curved back
and rounded corners with the Galaxy s8
you have a mostly glass design that's
held together by a metal frame which is
pretty typical of Samsung both the front
and rear glass panels are curved for
aesthetic reasons and for comfort but as
good as the Galaxy s8 looks it doesn't
stay that way for long once you get your
fingerprints all over it this isn't a
big problem on the oneplus 5 but despite
these two phones having some really nice
designs they're both pretty slippery in
the hand so it's sort of a toss-up as to
which one you may like better
the main attraction to the Galaxy s8 is
hands down the display and it just
mosy 1+5 display out of the water don't
get me wrong the 1080p panel on the one
plus five is a very good-looking screen
in its own right but when comparing
these two side-by-side the screen of the
SI is just infinitely better in every
way no pun intended the screen
practically goes edge to edge and by
getting rid of the Samsung logo and
physical home button they were able to
shrink down the bezels and stretch the
screen vertically to give you more
screen in a smaller body both the Si and
si plus offer larger screens and the si
+ + 1 + 5 are very similar in size
despite the si plus having a screen
that's over half an inch larger it's
just an incredible screen to look at and
nothing on the market right now quite
compares to it
the thinner bezels did mean that Samsung
had to relocate the fingerprint sensor
to the back which is really the biggest
downside to the s8 design rear facing
fingerprint sensors are fine if they're
properly centered like a g6 or the pixel
but Samsung chose to put it next to the
camera eventually you do get used to it
but it's still not the most intuitive of
locations and it's honestly quite slow
and inconsistent with unlocking the
phone you do get other unlocking methods
like the iris scanner and spatial
recognition but even those are 100%
reliable or completely secure the
oneplus Fivefinger first sensor is much
more convenient and significantly faster
and it's easily one of the fastest
fingerprint sensors I've ever used that
speed also translates over to everyday
use the si and e1 plus five come with
the fastest processor available from
Qualcomm right now with the Snapdragon
835 and the s8 comes with four gigabytes
of RAM while the oneplus 5 comes with
either six or eight gigabytes of RAM
depending on the model both of these
phones perform very well with your
regular everyday tasks like launching
apps playing games and browsing the web
but the oneplus 5 just feels much more
fluid some of this has to do with the
software and the faster animations but
the extra ram definitely feels like it
makes a huge difference
the oneplus 5 can hold a lot of apps in
memory and this phone has been
incredibly difficult to slow down and
that's a good thing the s8 does provide
a fluid experience as well and the
animations while they are longer do make
the experience feel much more refined
but I will admit the s8 does stutter
from time to time throughout the day
it's not a deal-breaker but it is
something you will notice after having
the phone for a while Samsung software
isn't bad by
for the most part it's really enjoyable
they've made a lot of improvements with
a over the last couple of years and this
year it's been tidied up even more with
the cleaner icons and a tone down color
scheme Samsung has a bunch of software
tricks of their own like the game
launcher for managing all your games in
one place the theme engine that lets you
customize virtually every part of the OS
and be super useful always on display
that's also highly customizable and can
show important information like 'hey
time date and notifications the biggest
problem with Samsung software till this
day is all the extra bloatware and
duplicate applications the addition of
Samsung's AI assistant bixby only
further adds to the redundancy
especially when the phone already comes
with Google Assistant Samsung even went
as far as adding an additional hardware
button to encourage the use of bixby but
so far I don't think it's really paid
off but maybe that will change when
bixby voice gets out of beta and becomes
available for everyone as far as battery
life goes you've got a 3300 milliamp
hour battery on the oneplus 5 3000 on
the s8 and 3500 on the s8 plus I haven't
used a regular s8 but I've had plenty of
experience using the si+ as my daily
driver and the size of the battery
doesn't necessarily tell the whole story
here both are capable of getting me
through a full day but I usually have a
lot more left over on the 1+5 and
there's been several instances where
I've even gotten a day and a half which
has never happened on the s8 plus you
can definitely tell that having a 1080p
screen makes a huge difference to the
phone's overall battery life I also
prefer oneplus as - charge over
Samsung's fast charging method -
charging is just insanely quicker and
it's still one of the fastest charging
methods available if not be fastest the
biggest change that oneplus made this
year is to the camera the oneplus 5 has
dual cameras with a 16 megapixel F 1.7
main sensor and a 20 megapixel F 2.6
secondary sensor the second sensor is a
telephoto lens that allows for 2x
lossless zoom not optical and the
ability to emulate a blurry background
or bokeh effect with its portrait mode
Samsung on the other hand stuck with a
more traditional camera setup it's a
single 12 megapixel sensor with F 1.7
aperture and has optical image
stabilization which is available on
either sensor of the 1 + 5 the lack of
optical image stabilization on the 1 + 5
makes a big difference especially in low
light
in comparison to the s8 the oneplus as
photos are noticeably softer in detail
less sharp noisier and tend to have very
orange e color tones that don't look
very natural oneplus is able to close
the gap in well-lit conditions and
aren't that far off and what the sa is
able to produce but once you look a lot
closer you can easily spot the
differences the oneplus 5 tends to ever
so slightly overexposed making the
colors shadows and blacks look much more
washed out and again when you zoom in
you can see that the photos are just not
quite as sharp or as detailed as the sa
for a flagship that's being delivered at
a lower price point than the s8 the
oneplus 5 can certainly hold its own
very well but you can definitely tell
where the compromises are and where it
falls short if you can live with those
compromises in the 1 plus 5 is a solid
option there are things that I think the
oneplus 5 does better than the SA
especially in regards to software and
general performance but for me the sa is
the more well rounded package when you
take everything into consideration even
if it does come in at a higher price tag
as always thank you guys so much for
