when you sign up today I love how it
looks like dr. Lloyd had some kids in a
week that saw the Moto X finally get
officially announced we also sell
samsung getting quite a bit of trouble
hey it's Josh of a guard from Android
thority what's going on everybody and
it's time for another dose of the week's
top Android news it's android authority
weekly if you were jealous of new Nexus
7 owners because your old one was
starting to show its age Google seems to
have already had a plan in place for the
aging tablet and it has to do with
software apparently the slowness that
many people have seen over time using
last year's nexus 7 occurs because when
blocks of the flash memory get used up
android has to try to clear some out
when it needs to write more data this
whole process really slows things down
well in android 4.3 something called the
trim command was added in that performs
a large-scale wipe of unused blocks in
the flash memory in order to circumvent
this process it happens over the course
of a couple hours and happens when the
tablet has a good charge is idle and the
screen is off so rest easy original
Nexus 7 owners because if you're
anything like the people in our comments
you're going to start seeing a speed
increase when Android 4.3 finally comes
your way Samsung gotten some real hot
water this week when anandtech caught
wind of a user's peculiar discovery a
forum user found that his ex enos
powered galaxy s4 would kick into high
gear when benchmark programs are run and
only then and in tech investigated and
found code in the architecture of the
galaxy s4 octa that wraps up the
production of the GPU and cpu when
specific benchmarking programs like n22
are trigger simply put they were gaming
the benchmarking system when we all know
that scores and benchmark tests tend to
have a bit of importance since all these
accusations were made Samsung has
released statement stating that this is
simply not true and that all apps have
the ability to access this increase in
process of production we don't quite
know who to believe but anateck is one
of the most reputable sources for tech
and to be fair these questionable
practices are nothing new
at least in the computing world we'll
have more on this as more information
comes in the coming days if you're a
heavy Microsoft Office user on your
Android device then first of all what
the hell are you doing and second of all
you must have been pretty happy when off
has finally made its way to the Google
Play Store it is a free download but
that's about as far as you can go users
still have to be office 365 subscribers
and even then the app just lets you do
simple edits and creations of Word Excel
and PowerPoint files if you still use
say PowerPoint for all your presentation
needs then by all means go nuts and now
we get to the news that you've probably
been waiting for mostly because you've
become accustomed to hearing about it
all the damn time but luckily the Moto X
has finally been officially announced
and guess what those leaks and rumors
they were all pretty much right the
motorola flagship does support a 720p
4.7 inch display that perpetually
displays your notifications so you never
have to even unlock the phone the
processor is indeed the dual-core
Snapdragon s4 pro coupled with the
audrina 320 and both are part of the
motorola x8 computing system features
include a 10 megapixel clear pixel
camera that can be accessed by flicking
the device twice and an always-on voice
recognition service that allows you to
trigger google now at any time by saying
okay Google now customization rumors
were also true as moto maker was
unveiled as a way to cater your device
to your style you can change the color
on the back the front and the accents on
the various buttons and the ring around
the camera and graving zar available for
the back of the phone and you can also
put a custom phrase in the boot
animation all Moto X devices will be
assembled in Fort Worth Texas and thus
sent to you within five days of purchase
the moto maker catch though is that for
now it is only available for devices
bought through AT&amp;amp;T versions on verizon
and US Cellular will currently only be
available in the stock black or white
colors all US moto x's will cost you a
pretty hefty price of one hundred ninety
nine dollars on 2-year contracts a price
point that has actually been a pretty
big point of contention so that's the
Moto X a somewhat mid-range device on
the inside that boasts individuality on
the outside well we won't know how
stacks up against the rest of the
competition until we spend ample time
with the device but our own Joe Hindy
looked at the specs on paper and
pondered the battles even given just the
specifications the Moto X definitely
came out on top against last year's
phones but more importantly it lost by
only small margins against current top
devices head to android authority for
the full feature now Joe wasn't the only
one that was doing some major thinking
though i'm sure you've gotten at least a
little bit tired of all of the Moto X
news leaks rumors that have come out in
the last few months but now that the
device has been officially announced do
you think it lived up to all of the hype
and the massive train of leaks and
rumors our own Derek Ross took a hard
look at this hypebeast phenomenon that
surrounded the Moto X and if it honestly
kind of ruined it for us head to android
authority calm for this great piece on
the Moto X and let us know what you
think our final piece of news will
please all of you forgetful people out
there if you ever lose your phone or
tablet Google now has its own version of
locator software to help you find it
later this month Google Play services
will get the Android device manager a
way for you to locate your phone or
tablet make it ring even when silent and
remotely wipe it if you need that's
great and all but some people might
scoff at the idea I mean I pretty much
never lose my phone I just got back from
the crowded streets of downtown LA with
my Oppo find 5 and it is still in my

who as always a written companion for
