Authority Google and Apple have both
recently released new mobile computers
although the two machines are quite
different they have one thing in common
they both include USB type-c connectors
so what is USB type-c well let's find
out
I guess you're already familiar with USB
if you have a PC you've probably used a
flash drive or maybe you have a printer
via a USB cable if you have an Android
phone you'll be familiar with it as the
way that you charge your phone was where
you can copy data to and from your phone
over a cable USB has been around for a
long time it first gained mainstream
popularity when Microsoft included
support for it in Windows 98 and Apple
used it as a way to remove the keyboard
and mouse port on its iMac well that was
almost 20 years ago and things have
certainly changed since then the first
mainstream USB specification was USB 1.1
and it could transfer data at 12
megabits a second that's 1.4 megabytes a
second back in the day when a floppy
disk could hold 1.4 megabytes
that was considered fast USB 2 was
released in the year 2000 sporting a
theoretical throughput of 480 megabits a
second recently you may have noticed USB
ports with a blue interior these are USB
3.0 ports the USB 3.0 standard was
published in 2008 and allows for
theoretical speeds of around five
gigabits a second
USB 1.1 2.0 and 3.0 all use the same
type of physical port the standard USB
type a plug and socket on the pc end and
then either a micro or mini B port on
the peripheral end that's on your phone
end on the camera and physically all the
ports are backwardly compatible so you
can plug your Android smartphone into a
blu USB 3.0 port and everything will
work as expected however this has
changed with USB 3.1 as you'd expect USB
3.1 is faster than USB 3.0 in fact it's
fast enough that it can drive 4k
displays that means that laptops and PCs
of the future won't necessarily need
HDMI or VGA sockets but the big
difference that consumers will see is in
the
use of a new type of plug the a and B
type connectors are now old history the
new connector is called USB type-c so
what does a USB type-c connector give us
that type A and type B connectors can't
first of all the type-c connector is
small that means we don't need to have
any more mini USB or micro USB
connectors the type-c connector can be
used on everything from an Android
smartphone all the way up to a server
secondly it's rated at 100 watt that
means the cable can be used to charge
more than just Android smartphones or
tablets it can also be used to power
much larger equipment maybe in the
future a single cable will be used to
connect your printer to your PC to
provide with both electricity and as a
data connection thirdly the type-c cable
is reversible that means it doesn't
matter which way around you connect it
no more trying to plug in a cable find
out you're at the wrong way around
trying again and then realizing that in
fact you had it right the first time
finally the type C cables have a Type C
plug at both ends they will no longer be
a socket a plug and a socket B type plug
they'll be truly interchangeable you can
get the cable whichever way around you
like and however you like and it will
still work the two most prominent
devices with USB 3.1 support right now
are the new Google Chromebook pixel and
the new MacBook however USB 3.1 and
type-c connectors will become the
de-facto standard over the next few
years since its backwardly compatible
you only need a passive adapter to
connect an existing USB to device and it
will just work as expected that means
that companies adopting this new
technology won't alienate their existing
customers
Google's also made it clear that we'll
be seeing the type-c connector in lots
of products coming up in the future
that means the type-c connectors not
only going to change the way we use our
PCs our laptops and our Chromebooks it's
also going to change the way we use our
Android smartphones and our Android
tablets so there it is USB type-c truly
one size does fit all my name is Gary
Sims r-and-r authority I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please
don't forget to give it a thumbs up
also please use the comments below to
tell me what you think about this new
type of connector also don't forget to
subscribe to and roth auratus youtube
channel and as for me I'll see you
in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
