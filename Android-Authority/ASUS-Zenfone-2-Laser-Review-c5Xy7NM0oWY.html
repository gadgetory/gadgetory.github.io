our favorite mid-range smartphones of
2015 thanks to the unprecedented value
it brought to the table with yet another
variant Asus is maintaining its focus on
affordability while still offering very
respectable specifications this is
Bailey Stein with Android authority and
this is my full review of the Asus
zenfone 2 laser the zenfone 2 laser
looks a lot like the original it has the
same 5.5 inch screen size same organ
amelie pleasing curve and overall could
be easily mistaken for the original
that's not to say that the phone's
design is without a few minor
differences of course in addition to the
unsurprising addition of a laser
autofocus you can now swap out the
battery there's also access to dual
micro SIM card slots as well as a micro
SD card expansion slot
although the zenfone 2 laser is
certainly still in phablet territory
it's dramatic curved and flat edges make
it both easy and comfortable to hold
with a single hand despite this Asus
estab Center power button placement is
still well annoying to say the least
thankfully double tap to wake and sleep
are still here as part of Zen motion
among other gestures the power button is
undeniably difficult to reach
nonetheless but it does feel more
tactile than it did on the original
oddly enough this comes at the expense
of feeling cheaper which is also
extended to the volume buttons on the
top of the device you'll find a 5
megapixel front facing camera on the
right as well as a notification LED to
the left there's also three
non-illuminated
standard capacitive keys on the bottom
just above the Asus signature metallic
chin the zenfone specials are a bit
large compared to other devices but
that's not that big of a deal once you
actually start using it overall the
zenfone 2 laser is one of the best built
and designed devices in its price
category Asus has no trouble pulling off
a premiumness often reserved for more
expensive devices even with the lasers
all plastic construction well some may
frown upon Asus use of a recycled design
we feel that the design here
is more than adequate the zenfone 2
lasers 5.5 inch 1080p IPS display looks
about the same as it did on the original
it has excellent viewing angles great
color reproduction and overall just
looks really good we do wish that the
panel was a bit brighter however as
sunlight readability is sadly just as
poor as it was on the original auto
brightness also tends to be a bit
conservative even with the adaptive
brightness slider set on maximum the
splendid color settings that asus has
added are definitely a nice touch
despite the displays already great color
calibration it's also nice to see a blue
light filter toggle available straight
from the notification shade which makes
the display easier to read in darker
environments finally Asus hook the
opportunity to upgrade the displays
glass from Corning Gorilla Glass 3 to
for a seemingly small but very welcome
change especially for the price powered
by the Snapdragon 615 the zenfone 2
laser makes a somewhat surprising switch
from x86 to arm as expected the
benchmark scores are a bit lower on the
zenfone 2 laser but day to day
performance is about the same most apps
launch fairly quickly and there's
minimal length route while the laser
does have a marginally less powerful
processor it does receive a bump up to 3
gigabytes of RAM from the original base
models 2 gigabytes that's great to see
especially when we still have some $200
phones shipping with just one gigabyte
of RAM coupled with the audrina 405
gaming performance was pretty good on
the zenfone 2 laser I was able to play
games like asphalt 8 airborne with
little noticeable lag even on high with
support for 802 11 m Wi-Fi GPS and
Bluetooth 4.0 the zenfone 2 laser offers
all the connectivity options you'd
expect it is missing NFC however which
is a bit unfortunate considering that
the original zenfone 2 had it what the
original didn't have though was band 12
support for t-mobile 4G LTE users this
time around asus is launching their
unlocked dual SIM device with full HSPA+
and full 4G LTE support within the US
the zenfone 2 laser is available with
either 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal
storage but you can always expand that
with a microSD card up to an additional
128 gigabytes
Asus seems to have used the same rear
speaker found on the original for the
zenfone 2 laser while some quality is
about average the maximum volume is
still too low for some environments
battery life was also close to the same
on the zenfone 2 laser with the same
3000 milliamp hour battery capacity I
was able to get an average of about 3
and a half hours of screen on time with
18 hours of usage when I did use it more
heavily however I was able to get just
over 4 hours of screen on time with 14
hours of use while there doesn't seem to
be much of an improvement over the
originals mediocre battery life asus
does now give you the opportunity to
swap out the battery if needed the 13
megapixel rear camera on the zenfone 2
laser is now accompanied by a laser auto
focus the laser autofocus does seem to
help the phone focus on specific objects
and some images were noticeably sharper
on the laser in comparison to the
original with the exception of better
sharpness and detail however images
appear to be about the same there's
still a lack of dynamic range but unlike
with the original HDR now often makes
things worse the camera is certainly
capable of producing great images but it
is held back quite a bit due to this
issue low light performance on the
zenfone 2 laser was also similar to the
original and that we were able to get
some decent looking images even in
darker environments well there is still
a lot of digital noise added with a
sis's image processing it's one of the
best low-light cameras that we've
encountered for the price Asus has low
light mode also helps quite a bit at the
expense of resolution but we should note
that additional digital noise seems to
be inevitable Zen you eyes camera app
offers a good amount of manual control
in addition to over 8 dozen individual
shooting modes they're fun to play
around with and the professional mode is
excellent for those wanting a bit more
control the zenfone 2 laser is running a
CSS Zen UI over Android 5.0 lollipop the
software experience remains primarily
unchanged from the original but that's
not necessarily a bad thing well we
can't cover every aspect of the software
we will say that Asus has done an
exceptional job and adding value through
the software experience virtually
everything is well thought-out and Asus
has been very good about filling in the
gaps in stock lollipop
it definitely follows a design language
of its own but the overall experience is
one of the best you'll find
from the customizable quick access apps
on the lock screen to the many
customizable gestures available with Zen
motion Zen UI offers a good amount of
room for customization there's also many
features like RAM cleanup play to
support several power saving modes with
automatic or scheduled switching an auto
start manager an audio equalizer a
built-in backup and restore app that
actually includes app data FM radio a
surprisingly good mobile video editing
app a quick memo app a sound recorder
app a themes manager with support for
custom fonts and icons within the
default launcher thank you very much
mazie mode a kids mode a one-handed mode
a glove boat and finally frequent Asus
app updates through the Google Play
Store speaking of apps we can talk about
as anyway without talking about
bloatware well asus has reduced the
amount of pre-installed apps by a fair
amount there's still a lot of
unnecessary and redundant additions apps
like clean master doctor safety zen
circle and zen talk are included out of
the box with the latter two being unable
to be uninstalled
with that said Asus has made some of
their apps most notably their link
Series installable through the Google
Play Store
rather than pre installing them out of
the box there's also a good amount of
apps which have been moved into the
settings menu reducing the amount of
scrolling required and app launchers
although it does ship with Android 5.0
lollipop we're nearly certain that this
device will receive Android 6.0
marshmallow sometime during the first
half of 2016
Asus has one of the best track records
for keeping their products updated for
example the zenfone 5 which launched in
early 2014 shipped with Android 4.2
jellybean was updated to Android 4.4
KitKat
and then to Android 5.0 lollipop that
kind of software support is difficult to
find in even some flagship Android
smartphones nowadays it may just be the
key selling point for some Android
enthusiasts starting at $1.99 the
zenfone 2 laser is priced competitively
if sixteen gigabytes isn't enough
there's also a 32 gigabyte model
available for 249 just to be clear the
model that we're reviewing here is the
ze551ml z-- of the zenfone 2 laser
available depending on the region so we
suggest that you carefully review
specification lists before making any
purchases although the zenfone 2 lasers
display could be brighter
battery life could be better and speaker
could be louder
ASA still offers a very competitive
option in the sea of cheap Android
smartphones
the great display exceptional software
experience and support and bonuses like
Gorilla Glass 4 and 3 gigabytes of RAM
are enough to make this one of our
favorite smartphones for under $200
