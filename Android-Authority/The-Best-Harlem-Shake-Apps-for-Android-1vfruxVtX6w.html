Joe handy the resident app guy from
Android Authority comm we're pretty much
all familiar with the Harlem shake by
now if you happen to be a fan we've got
a short list of apps that you may be
interested in and we'll dive right in
after the intro the first app we're
going to show you is called Harlem shake
Android this simplistic little app
features in Android dancing - the Harlem
shake when the song kicks in a number of
randomly selected app icons will join in
this is not a useful application
whatsoever and it has no real features
however fans of the Harlem shake can get
a good 30-second kick out of watching
Andy do the dance with your application
icons also it's free in the Google Play
Store so while it may be a waste of time
for non Harlem shake fans it's
definitely not a waste of money but
still it doesn't really do anything
other than the Harlem shake which makes
it useless if you don't like the Harlem
shake and a novelty at best if you do so
we gave it a 3 out of 5 stars the next
two apps perform roughly the same tasks
the first one we'll talk about is called
Harlem shake maker as the name implies
it's an application that's used to
create your own Harlem shake videos
quickly the only downside is this app
has been reported as not working with a
number of devices so here's how it works
you shoot video 1 which is the pre
Harlem shake where everyone is standing
still then you shoot video 2 where
everyone is actually doing the dances
once both videos have been shot to your
liking you click the Create button that
combines the videos as the music and has
all the usual special effects as stated
this one has problems with some devices
but when it works it works pretty well
so we gave it a 3.5 out of 5 star rating
the second of the two we're talking
about is called Harlem shake maker slow
motion at its core it performs roughly
the same function as Harlem shake maker
however it's compatible with more
devices and has more features and that
makes it a little more preferable to use
like the first one you record the pre
Harlem shake and the post Harlem shake
videos separately unlike the last one
this one features a countdown so you can
set your device somewhere to record you
and still have time to get into the
video itself once done shooting the
videos you click the magic wand at the
top and the videos are combined as
special effects are added and the music
is laid over top this one seems to work
with more devices than the first one and
it has a few more features so we gave it
a 4 out of 5 star ranking there is a
third one
during testing we couldn't get it
working on the Nexus 4 so we decided not
to include it while the first three apps
dealt with creating the Harlem shake in
some way yourself this last app is more
of a culmination of everyone else's
efforts
it's called Harlem shake ultra and this
is definitely an app that every Harlem
shake band should check out using the
app you can change your phone's ringtone
and notification tone to the Harlem
shake as well as have your phone for for
some Harlem shake ish tasks while it
rings you can also choose from a very
small selection of Harlem shake
wallpapers perhaps its best feature
though is the ability to browse and
watch over a hundred and ninety Harlem
shake videos from within the app you can
have the app randomly play one or go
through the list and select one yourself
the video selections seem to be the best
at Harlem shake has to offer so you
probably won't have to comb through a
bunch of crap to find the good ones all
videos will take you to the YouTube app
so you can watch them there overall we
gave this a 4.5 out of 5 stars in a
world of Harlem shake we can't imagine a
hardcore fan walking around without an
app like this one on their devices
it's literally hours of Harlem shake
available and a couple clicks of the
screen once again I'm Joe hindi the
resident app guy here at Android

Harlem shake these are the apps we'd
