phone from the contoured edges to the
glass finish this thing is definitely
gonna cast some looks in your direction
from the form-factor alone still color
is important to a lot of people and
while we made sure that customers are
gonna be satisfied by offering a number
of different finishes that fit your
style while he's offering the regular
p20 in black champagne gold pink gold
midnight blue and probably the most
interesting of the bunch
Twilight's the pro model is offered in
all the same color variations saved the
champagne gold for some reason they did
only have three colors for us to check
out at the event we've got an
opportunity to showcase the black
midnight blue and the Twilight models
here the black berry isn't all that
special well a lot of people might
prefer this models and it's gonna blend
in with your other accessories a lot
easier I found that the glass back made
it reflect other colors in the room ever
so slightly so I ended up looking like a
toned down version of whatever color
your walls are still it's a simple
option for people who like black phones
and I can't really see while we're not
offering a black version of this device
midnight blue is a little bit more royal
the reflective flash back makes it seem
deeper and more fluid than other phones
and the finish almost reminded me of the
HTC u 11 if you're holding this phone in
Sun lay it'll probably look white and
that's really just do the glass finish
they use on the phones so it's not
really specific to this blue color still
the blue feels nice and understated and
if you really just want a single color
that's different from the black model
this is probably gonna be the one to get
finally we've got Twilight Twilight's a
smooth gradient between midnight blue in
this royal purple color and I personally
think it's awesome if you're not using a
case you're definitely going to get some
looks in your direction and people are
definitely going to ask what phone
you're using the interesting thing about
this color is that it looks pretty
different depending on what kind of
lighting you're in if you're in a really
bright area this phone seems almost
uniformly
but indoors it's much more obvious that
you're holding something much more in
your face if I bought this phone this is
definitely the option I'd get but I also
really love uniquely colored devices
what colors your favorite we're guessing
the twilight options gonna sell like
hotcakes but even the most simplistic
colorways look pretty great on this
thing
