show is brought to you by cloud tasks
hello bogan ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe
Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to android apps weekly this
is episode 1 of 9 let's get right into
those headlines nvidia has announced
geforce now a netflix style game
streaming service for seven dollars and
ninety-nine cents per month this is what
nvidia grid was meant to be and it was
launched in october first and select
markets obviously it's for the Nvidia
shield series of devices only it comes
with over 50 games to start with and the
first three months are free if you want
to try it out Google now on tap has been
unleashed for the second time on Android
marshmallow preview this is a feature
that allows Google now to surf your
phone screen and give you information
based on what it sees we've done a
hands-on and we'll have that link for
you in the video description below if
you want to check it out chainfire
announced this last week that he is
selling his legendary root application
super issue to a group of developers
called coding code mobile technology LLC
or CC mt for short chainfire will remain
on the project for two more years as the
transition occurs after which the new
startup will take over we don't know
much about this new startup just yet
google has announced that they're
raising the app size limit to 100
megabytes it was previously at 50
megabytes in many applications including
Chrome browser and Facebook have come
very close to that maximum size now as
will be able to expand to include more
functionality I'm sure we'll see apps
are passing the 50 megabyte barrier very
soon word around the grapevine is that
YouTube will be in offering a site-wide
subscription service it's rumored to be
called YouTube bread and costs a
surprisingly low ten dollars per month
of course this is a rumor so take it
with a grain of salt but I guess we'll
know for sure here in a few weeks for
even more Android apps and games news
don't forget to check out this week's
newsletter there you'll find all of the
app news updates and releases we didn't
have time for here if you're so inclined
you can sign up with your email address
and we'll send this info to your
doorstep every single Friday hey while
you're at it don't forget to subscribe
to our twitch channel we hang out we
play games and we have a nice time every
now and again i'm planning on hopping on
there with some new games this upcoming
week so click that subscribe button and
don't miss out ok folks is take a look
at the apps and games that made a big
splash this week as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find those links in the video
description below
world-renowned king of clickbait article
titles have released their first android
app to the Google Play Store
surprisingly the design and
functionality of this application isn't
half bad and BuzzFeed bands can
definitely find a decent selection of
news posted here it does focused more on
the new side of things than the
clickbait nonsense articles the site is
known to produce it's free to download
and worth a shot and I guess sky safari
2 is a 2d downhill infinite runner where
you must ski your way to success you'll
be followed constantly by an avalanche
that will eat you up if you go too slow
there are a variety of power-ups and
animals to show up and help you along
the way you'll also get to choose
between two playable characters and two
modes of transportation there is also
online multiplayer customizable gear and
more it's free to play and
family-friendly drive mode is a newer
application that tries to give you an
ice-free interface so you can use your
smartphone while driving without taking
your eyes off the road there is a bit of
a learning curve at first but after a
while you'll learn the various controls
by touch alone and you'll be able to do
things like answer phone calls control
your music and answer text messages it
does this by using voice commands and
bright color so you know your way around
it's worth a shot if you're interested
the latest Need for Speed game was
released late last week to mixed reviews
on one hand the game is beautiful with
intensely good graphics decent gameplay
controls and plenty of stuff to do and
cars to customize on the other hand
naming the game note limits may have
been a misstep as the game does
occasionally limit you with a fuel gauge
that needs to refill before you can race
again it's free to play so there's no
harm in trying it out but keep the
expectations in check computa pie legend
of the brofist is a new game based on
everyone's favorite YouTube gamer it's a
2d platformer with fret Rostow graphics
and simple enough controls the game is
filled to the brim with gaming history
references and memes you can also unlock
other youtubers like markiplier cinnamon
toast Ken marzia and many others it's
actually not half bad of a game as long
as you don't mind the silliness there
are also no in-app purchases thanks
again for watching the android apps
weekly show everybody but let's get down
to some serious business this week's
episode is sponsored by cloud tasks this
beautifully done to do list application
focuses on both organization and design
it has plenty of material design
inspired elements and enough
customization to really let you make
this app yours it comes with the ability
to create your own custom lists and all
of this stuff syncs with google tasks
each task has its own set of reminders
subtasks notes due dates priorities and
more
really help you plan everything out it's
intensely easy to use and really one of
the most beautiful to-do list
applications that we've ever seen it has
support for 500 pixels if you use that
you can pick it up for free and the
premium version costs two dollars and
forty-five cents it's also directly
integrated with its sister application
cloud cowl give it a shot and show your
