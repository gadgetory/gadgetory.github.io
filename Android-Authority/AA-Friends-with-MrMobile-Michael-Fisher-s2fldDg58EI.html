as Chris Davies oh no that's not
possible
I want to get the two of them together
200 your ass got sacked
Oh wonderful hi everybody let's not say

already swore once I read a lot of swear
on the show well we're on now
Oh terrific wow this is great no no like

there we are
I believe where we are every single live
stream always starts at night are we
this we on the Internet
well we have a very special guest on our
live today I am a poor judge of agar
what's going on everybody and I'm being
joined by Michael Fisher aka the mister
mobile you know I always okay I've had
you on for podcasts for live streams for
videos yeah always a part of me is
always like I don't need introduced and
people already know who you are hot
garbage friend I always like a good
introduction I like hanging out with you
too thanks for having us at likewise man
Josh ad has a great taste in tacos fun

taco okay by the time I wanted to count
there were already like 10 gone
yeah how many how about Oh anyway we
love yes is one of main times that we
get to hang out and you wanted to have
mr. mo-mo I'm sorry
now mr. mobile is the correct round I
said the URL by accident I'm sorry there
we go we have mr. Mobile mr. mr. mr.
mobile micro Fisher I was at mr. Fisher
mr. Maira Michael Mobile on our life
from here at the Android 30 booth at CES
2018 okay we're just gonna be chilling
here if you have any questions for us I
am checking on the live stream here and
before you guys even ask yes I do have
my phone on a brand new DJI Osmo mobile
too so look forward to a little bit of
talk about this in a bit and I drove my
vlogging rig there's a reason why I have
these here in any case I have a coffee
that I got from the front and there's a
reason why that's there so speaking of
what should be the start of the day
which is coffee but what did you do
today
I remember you saying you were gonna be
excited to talk about this on our on the
camera I am but only very briefly
because it is only the most tangentially
related tech thing ever
Huawei basically said sup you want to
come on a helicopter ride and take some
photos at the Grand Canyon with a mate
10 Pro and I'm like yeah I guess that
sounds fine I'm so jealous it you should
be I I would not gonna lie to you
there's a beautiful day for flying there
was a very low ceiling so we were over
the clouds in a helicopter which is kind
of a rare thing was a lot of overcast or
no just the perfect amount to make the
photos really pop and I'm we we landed
at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and
had ourselves a little picnic what took
some more photos it's had a small amount
of champagne and then got back in the
bird and took back off and the only
price I had to pay for any of this of
course was leaving the watermark on the
photos with the huawei phone you can eat
what they actually told you to yeah so
with the like of photos you with the
like of branded Huawei phones you drop
the watermark on there in the retail
software this isn't even just like a
review unit they up normals can do this
like watermark on it's like like a code
Huawei whatever and I was like yeah
that's fine
oh that's very very small price to pay
for a wonderful time and you know what
the phone did pretty well and yes if you
see his photos Huawei from them that
would be shady they're up on Instagram
actually their head the mr. mobile on
the Instagram there you go
well how long did it take you get to
drive out there oh we just got the limo
to the airport waited we played Jenga
while we were right yeah it gets to a
point where the word humble leaves the
word humble bhrastika just got a we got
the suitcases full of gold bars and put
him in now
that sounds awesome it was it was really
terrific and what did they have you used
for the pictures so was the mate 10 Pro
ok the recently announced for the US not
announced on a carrier but I guess
that's not something we're talking about
today I have to talk about that it's
still gonna be available in the US like
are you excited to see the may 10 Pro
make it to these shores yes not as
excited as it would have been if it was
going to sell in the volumes that it
would if it were in a carrier store it's
true because it's always more and I was
thinking about this at the the keynote
right where it was sort of there was a
carrier announcement that was very
absent yes and we all expected it and I
was thinking why am I so bummed out and
or angry about this because I was I was
like and I shouldn't I'm not on
anybody's side I'm not I'm not a
spokesman for anything you know the
horse of the race right but I think it's
because it's more fun for me to cover
stuff that's going to get into a lot of
hands and get into a lot of pockets
because you can start the dialogue with
people who are actually owning the phone
yeah like normal people not that I don't
love talking to other phone nerds like
me but but it's really nice when you're
covering something and people are like
what is that I'm like oh it's this and
they're like oh I've heard of that yeah
I was thinking of it and you can have
that conversation rather than like yeah
the how wait what how do you say that
you know yeah well we we've obviously
given the May 10 Pro plenty of accolades
I did win smartphone of the year from
from 2017 are you serious lol that's
awesome
but right above I guess we'll call them
honorable mentions what the 1 + 5 t was
in the running and then of course the
Galaxy Note 8 so why was it fun of the
Year fun of the yet well cuz all around
an hour because we did a lot of very
stringent testing it was more data
driven so on data driven had great
battery life they had a wonderful camera
and it was just basically was like okay
and the camera testing it was basically
neck-and-neck with the pixel if I
remember oh man yeah principle
difference being that the pixel gets
better the more photos you take Google
photos get smarter every whatever you
know it's not necessarily something that
that testing actually sort of takes into
account that's the trouble yes with the
lab testing right because yeah and and
this is the thing right like I get some
heat sometimes for not doing almost any
lab stuff it's almost entirely really
here they give you they give you flak
for that on occasion and and rightfully
so because if people come to come to
miss trouble looking for a review.com
style review they're not gonna get it
yeah
and I go to like I go to reviewed labs
and they've got intense amounts of
equipment that I'm categorized stuff
down to like the micron and this sub
nits and all this kind of and I'm like
this is amazing
and that's entirely a different format
from what I usually do and what you
usually do yeah so that's cool they
changed up the format yeah well I mean I
actually don't have too much of a hand
in it because what I wanted to be was
right yeah well on a personal note we do
have that kind of testing but I did want
to make sure that we including myself
would be giving our opinions as to what
our picks of the year were yeah yeah may
10 my temper would have been a would
have been at the top of my list I feel
like the top I'd like top 5 but I have
to admit something I couldn't do that
because I did not review this this is
actually the most I've held this phone
really yeah I haven't had a whole lot of
time with the mates in pro what a shame
yeah and you have the blue one which
everybody is so enamored with it does
look great doesn't I now I don't want to
I feel like cuz I'm already like coming
from the helicopter thing so I'm already
feeling a little like I'm like oh he's
just he's such a shoe for free well I'm
not gonna talk about any more I'm going
to review it in a week though Oh a
weaker said okay there you go yeah cuz I
haven't held the review until us
availability Oh fair and I thought it
was gonna be a much bigger splash okay
yeah ahead Richard you on the other day
and he my one of my favorite speakers
yeah well obviously it wasn't really
able to talk about even the word carrier
was like kind of a kind of a thing there
yeah but we can tow it like it was it
seemed genuine to him that he was he's
upset that you know absolutely and
rightfully so I mean anybody out there
who hasn't tried a huawei phone I mean
you're probably seeing a lot of the ads
all around the place what's the campaign
that they're running away the phone that
you never the best phone you've never
heard of which you know what there's
there's a tiny bit of claim to that I'd
say it's a it's a rather clever campaign
it is and it should come as no surprise
because one of the people heading it up
or possibly the person heading it up
came from Samsung back when they were
doing the next big thing is here yes and
that was a very memorable campaign as
well so you know well you know it'll be
exciting to see what happened not to
keep on while wait for to mark where you
are you are formerly known as captain
two phones yeah you basically are still
about yeah well yeah at least yeah so
your other phone the pixel 2x pixel do
you except I'm gonna call away that I
wanted for so long
yeah I do quite like it mainly of course
for the camera and David David Cogan has
a meeting and can't come we knew that
before we went on the air
yeah I'm Locker and we were hoping to
have him on David Koch in his name
unfortunately not the case can I
complain about my picks up to excel for
Tuesday aren't you going to ask any of
these because I'm using it it's on the
mall on the Osmo I don't want to take it
out yet but yeah I was gonna ask if you
had any of these issues that have been
was talking about what display issues
yeah not really I mean I do but I don't
care about them my issue is I have a
busted OAS module on the camera so
occasionally I'll be shooting and you
know the pixel is known for that epic
image stabilization especially in video
but I'll be shooting with this one and
something will make the oh I addressed
that will address the OAS module and all
of a sudden it'll get Wiggly eyeball for
like three seconds so I'm like what we
should I I want to see an example of
this not necessary right now I'll show
it to you oh yeah I have plenty of
examples of it but otherwise it's it's
it's my favorite phone camera ever okay
yeah I agree as well I think I've been
taking so many selfies front-facing
camera is just bonkers dude I
intentionally tried to defeat it in
Hawaii right where I had the Sun behind
my head yes and I took a selfie and I
was like no way are you gonna get any
color out of this and the other phone I
was using at that point did not make
anything of it I was a silhouette and it
was a white blown out sky the pixel made
a photo that I actually wouldn't have
minded sharing exactly I did the same
thing last night with my girlfriend
who's here we went to the Las Vegas sign
it was like 1:00 in the morning
yeah and it's it's blown out like you
you tap on the sign you can't see us you
tap on us the sign is just like it's
like God is looking down at us yeah but
it still made a photo that I'm gonna
share probably tomorrow or the next day
after we leave that's the amazing thing
right you take your shot with the pixel
then you go into the gallery and it's
like processing hold on and you're like
oh this is gonna be crap and then it all
of a sudden makes yeah a beautiful
painting that you're in the middle of it
alright so speaking of more recent
things
sorry go TX
I just made a comment about your Mamata
watch Oh No and said that it's stunning
and I remember you saying it's pretty I
love it
thank you even though I had no hand in
designing it and it's not even mine my
company bought it but it's I I adore it
it is my favorite Android wear watch in
terms of design and I I wear it all the
time did you get a look at Skagen no
somebody told me to go look at it though
is it beautiful I do like it a lot that
minimalistic design and there's
something that Skagen did to the
software what they would say is they
stripped away a lot of the pre-installed
stuff they didn't want it to have
bloatware of any cons Android wear to
that oh okay
and there were watch faces or very
Spartan and it's just like align with
the time and just like your next
appointment very very Danish like that
they said very Danish very Danish design
yes and it's also incredibly smooth how
much as if it's $2.99 don't call me on
that I need to double check we do have a
video on it I just so you can check it
out that's my thing with this this is a
giant bouncing around nonsense
tornado that you get caught up and if
you try and look at the logic of it cuz
this is 595 start right and anyone who's
gonna pay that much for a SmartWatch
first of all it's like these don't age
well yeah secondly it's Android wear 2x
which i think is a really garbage
platform and I think it's really broken
Android wear needs a huge makeover
here's the thing it was going it was
kind of an okay platform sorry and then
it got it got a makeover into something
much worse I think well what made it
worse there are just these tiny little
usability things like if you're
listening to a podcast or a song and you
want to check the time you will see the
time for two seconds no not even two
seconds before the album art for what
you're listening to eclipse is the time
if the timer goes off and you're not you
don't have a rotating side button the
timer zone notification logo gets in the
way of the style for the time I do
remember that
mind blowing Lee kind of kind of not
smart and what the design of that watch
it does like hardware almost makes it oh
okay I know you know and I'm sorry the
end of the logic tornado is this isn't
meant to compete with a fossil at 250 oh
it's meant to compete with like Louis
Vuitton at 2990 no you know like it's
it's it's that kind of thing and you can
argue which one looks better but I this
is I do think it looks pretty great move
Otto did you see any other smart
wearables at all while here I don't
think that I did know most of my stuff I
even branched into smart home a little
bit with that Google that Lenovo smart
display yeah what did it take on all
that like because smart displays are one
thing I mean they're two different
stories here smart displays are kind of
a quote unquote new category right but
we also have Google assistant and Alexa
just going nuts on everybody so we're
getting assistance all over the place
also I just found out that Alibaba has
an assistant really yeah
doesn't doesn't doesn't understand
English which is why we've never used it
you know what's so funny is my initial
thought so that was like well that's
absurd they're a retailer right they're
a massive retailer but then of course
that's what Amazon it exactly I don't
know I guess I don't think that's weird
anymore yeah yeah no I think I've never
plugged in any of the Google homes that
I have I have never used them wise
because while I have come to become
comfortable with the phone always
listening for a key phrase that ok
Google sorry an ok G key phrase we're
hey G now yeah I don't know I just
didn't really see the need for it I'm
really mobile cheeky yeah but I at home
as well like I said this when I was
reviewing those Bose wearable speaker
things like even at home I don't stay in
the same room for like five minutes um
let's just run it around all the time so
I'd have to have like five Google homes
in my place and I'm just I always have
my phone on me
we've just already done them for me we
also have a ton of wearable tech that is
getting Google assistant oh yeah I'm
gonna feel like I'm one of the only
proponents for the pixel buds and what
they do like I know a lot of people kind
of crap on them a little bit
they don't sound like other headphones
or the design might be odd yeah the
execution is just not very good but the
execution of Google assistant on it I
think it's the best of any Google
assistant ever why because when you're
holding on there one of the most
annoying things about Google assistant I
have to say and I'm happy I'm saying
this on camera is um when you say Haji
or something like that and it's
listening for your voice it also has to
do the work of figuring out when you
stopped talking oh yeah sure and and
maybe half the time it doesn't do a good
job of it right so you want to push the
talk you don't want to push the talk and
is that what the pixel but zero you do
really and it's great so I think you
there's a service that I think you would
really like it's called Samsung Bixby
you gotta you gotta keep holding the
button down while you're talking to it
yeah but I do like that about are
genuinely speaking okay fair Bixby is
the butt of a lot of jokes yeah I do
like that you just push the child having
a tactile response being able to let go
of the pixel bud and then it does the
chime he knows exactly what I said
because it's not trying to figure out if
someone next to me you're still talking
yes and if you have if you live with
someone or have someone in your life who
is who is good at this you kind of know
it I think it's maybe 5% of the audience
but it's like that person who when
they're around picks the exact wrong
moment during your google key phrase to
start talking to you about something oh
yeah so it's like what time is Star Trek
on tonight oh did you see the thing
about that other thing that in the food
what do you want for dinner
yeah we're starting to see that more
often that a Google assistant is going
into headphones so this is merging of
the two
yeah like you see their device yeah well
yeah speaking of CES 2018 I do want to
ask the question that we've asked pretty
much I'm sure you've asked a lot of
people this question what happened or
highlights of this show
oh man everyone's talking about it we
don't have to talk about it forever the
thing that the takeaway the thing that
sticks in my mind the most is the under
display fingerprint scanner open
synaptic I do on the repo fund you like
it right I mean
it's going to change the way these are
designed and maybe not a way that's
immediately noticeable to to most folks
but it's gonna let manufacturers put a
ton more display on the on the front of
the thing yes unless they would have
formerly put their fingerprint sensor on
the back and now since that doesn't have
to be there you got more space for
battery you've got more space for you
don't have to do what Samsung didn't put
it in an utterly unreachable location
yeah right now cameras yeah so like it's
it's it's fantastic that way and it's
just so cool from a sci-fi perspective
you know it's like projects the thing on
the screen I get that a lot of people
were hoping that the entire screen would
be a sensor of course my eCourse just a
small portion on the bottom again we
have another video on this as well I'm
sure you do is what I do as well
um so just that little section on the
bottom that shows a fingerprint well I
thought would be funny is what if that
was your actual fingerprint was showing
there would be savage that would be bad
when we get it up could it gonna no LED
screen I don't think you get the
resolution right not quite as much yeah
but I did think it was a good concept
and I love that the vive phone that they
put it on like this it's like a concept
phone like no one can talk like what's
the name of this one they're like yeah
but it is coming to market yeah anything
else eh you are really into it uh you
know I don't want to talk about the
razor thing because it's just like I
feel like it's been talked to death it
probably suck but it is really cool that
well how about the concept itself the
concept itself is still never not going
to work in large volume because if you
build a dock like the the razor duck
where you drop your razor phone into
this laptop dock and it becomes the left
satisfying sound oh yeah push a button
and it actually drills the USBC board
like into the phone so flat so there's
no margin of error but here's my thing
like that concept is has been tried over
and over again and until Android is
really good and you can make that stuff
for really cheap so that people don't
want to just buy a $500 actual laptop
and you know it's never gonna work but
the execution of this one is so smart
yeah
the speakers on the razor phone were so
loud already several reviews maybe me
included said this is louder than some
laptops yeah so there are no laptops I
don't want to leave their small
Bluetooth speakers makers yeah oh you
speak
small Bluetooth speakers behind you
don't need the little pill anymore you
can just bring that phone blast it
yeah and so you know that the doc
doesn't have speakers you drop it in
there it doesn't have a fingerprint scan
it scanner because that sticks out the
side of the laptop thing because it's
already on the phone it's just such a
well engineered cool thing old friend of
mine and Julian do you think razor is
shooting itself in the foot if the next
major phone doesn't have the exact same
size that's the first one right and I
think that's only a concern if this
thing actually comes to market yes and
what we know about razor is that like
CES is where they come to play and
they're like we need something that's
gonna get a big crowd around the booth I
just hope they don't have the same story
that they had last year you remember
with without the three yeah that was the
one where the the triple display laptop
got actually stolen
yes it lifted all of them from the booth
yes well I probably haven't actually
seen it on that and you know it was
utterly impractical and huge it was but
I did love checking it out like then
that's what they think I think sometimes
you and I will will cover like what we
perceived to be a boring trade show like
he'll be an off-year and there's nothing
really cool so when companies come like
this and they even if they never bring
it to market they're just like we build
this crazy thing you want to see it yeah
I think that's a lot of fun yeah I
definitely agree well you know what
playing around with that razor project
windows what's called yes laying around
project Linda it just made me want a
razor blade to be honest because I'm
really I'm kind of in the market for a
new laptop and then when I was using
that with the chroma keyboard in the way
it was just very well made I was like
huh man that yeah Iseman do I wanna
spend $1400 or $2,900 on the laptop
right now yeah there is a lot to
consider there I am susceptible to the
to that like multicolored key thing that
is the chroma system it's so anybody
who's in the PC game right now is like
I've been done to death though I know I
know but I've never had I've been on Mac
books for seven eight years and I'm used
to edit on the air I did and I ran that
thing into the ground that thing I'd
like black soot marks where the fan was
oh yeah yeah but I'm I don't want to
talk about the nude I don't want to talk
about that as I hate my new MacBook so
hard really yep
well we don't alert Bob it's the worst
minutes worst like whatever he did here
here first
yeah all right well I mean for myself I
do agree with those two and we did take
a look at this humongous a Seuss that
that huge 65 inch Android TV yeah it
doubles as a gaming monitor because it
has 120 Hertz
yeah refresh rate on it uh-huh yeah quad
HD I mean like 4k sorry it was 4k but
it's quad sync I'm try remember what the
actual term was and remember these
buzzwords are the buzzwords but supposed
to be like it's just a pull double time
you would be able to have it as your
gaming PC or gave me a PC monitor you'll
be able to have it as your PC monitor in
general you can use it as a regular TV
and it has a video shield built in oh
really
yeah I love the video shoe I have never
touched it or seen it in the real life
yeah ever get into putting Android TV
like okay this way this way if you can
spare the money from a chromecast to an
end to us to an Nvidia shield get the
shield the shield Howard it has
chromecast on there and it's already
beautiful so
but I also wanted to ask you a couple of
things about your your setup I have a
couple of things here because your
Instagram actually kind of shifted a
little while back yeah someone recently
and you're also you're also kind of
impeccable on social we've talked about
this before like your snapchat game is
always so fun no you're not really
honest I'm Jonny mom don't say that you
know cuz cuz you sitting in then tonight
I'm gonna do something stupid I'm gonna
tweet to the wrong account that I'm just
that's it scandal I'm not really on
snapchat as much as I used to be but I
remember when I would see him on
snapchat there's always fun stuff he's
it's actually humorous oh and now I drew
story is this kind of where you kind of
have that that content lane but his
Instagram is now sort of like I don't
want it's a news channel but it's yeah
but it's a sub news channel right it
kind of is it's like well it's just a
fun tech stuff channel right and I've
been watching Reggie stories so that's
why I wanted to ask what your opinion
might be on a tool like this oh yeah so
we have here the DJI Osmo mobile - and I
know you love the Osmo mobile first even
some of your actual content on your
channel loved it yeah so I want to have
you played with it I have not played
with this yet thank you
yes I can instantly feel why it's
cheaper it was made lighter and I do
really appreciate that the plastic
though like the old the first gen has
this rubber grip that reminds you that
you're using a piece of camera equipment
and this feels more like a I buy at a
store that's a toy yeah but you do have
the battery indicator on the stock now I
see yes is the app any better or is it
using a beta version of the app because
it's not released yet for the Osmo -
mobile right okay so it is a beta app
the active tracking goes a little nuts
I'm not gonna lie yeah if I had it
tracking you right now and then you
walked away it would follow you but then
it would have like separation anxiety
and start shaking right see I mean I I
like this a lot I like that the price
point is down I think that's that's much
more reasonable yeah but that's that
that's kind of the thing for me is that
that's the DJI story like amazingly
great hardware software
someone asked me just even like 20
minutes ago right before we streamed
yeah that would just be vlogging Rick
I'm like nah this is more like my ig
stories ring sure so showing all that
because after all this is my yeah yeah
yes it's a lot more cumbersome but this
is great for social that's what I it is
but here's the thing menu with a phone
you have in that is a pixel and the
pixels video stabilization is so good on
the rear sure Oh first for the village
yeah it's in portrait mode right now
would you the original Ozma was not able
to do uh is that true well you weren't
able to go like that yeah you could like
switch it yeah but this is you know go
like yeah gangster style uh social yeah
well you can have it this way and it's a
lot more it's more convenient it is yeah
yeah and it did they do it in a hardware
way it's not part of the app or anything
you just unscrew this and then you can
rotate that's nice so one one fewer
point of failure yeah exactly and it's
also a spring so you could just it's a
clamp USB see charging that no it's
micro again micro again
can this stop can we stop with the micro
USB stuff it's gonna get to a point
especially later in 2018 where you don't
have USB see it immediately makes us
think a little less of it no it's not
going to get to that point it got to
that point and now we're past it it's
January what generate twelve I don't
have a minimalist watch face it's not
telling levin eleven yes it's been 11
days since I'm over microUSB I'm sorry
and I asked every manufacturer and
they're always like yeah well component
costs and stuff and I'm like cool if
you're making something super cheap I
get it mm-hmm but let's stop yeah well I
mean we do have about a half hour slot
but we also have a buffer for like 45
minutes so if you want to stay on for a
little bit longer let's hang yeah well I
would love to do that
I was warning you I was not indicating
you should answer questions was warning
me about your battery under pixel oh is
that right yeah I feel like I have I
have a charger here somewhere I have
like a power delivery power bank clear
yes so do I but I didn't bring it today
because I didn't bring a bag and because
I didn't want the gimbal is it what I
think and because I because of this like
I just I don't want to do one go back to
the pixel to Excel but video
stabilization if other manufacturers
could pay a lot of attention to it and
maybe approach the quality of this that
would be amazing
let's see when does the house were to
mobile coming out now we are we are
talking about it um yeah I don't have an
actual date yet I want to say like q2 is
what they were saying but I do have a
price it's 149 and 149 that's an
incredible price wait for all of us who
bought the original one I'm a little bit
easier yeah I know it just sell the old
one for $100 yeah I feel like that's
what we should be doing yeah good call
so 2018 CES 2018 because the start of
the year we obviously have Mobile World
Congress coming up which is when we're
gonna finally hear what the actual specs
on the Alcatel phones are sorry yes
because they were like oh you can take a
look at the phones and film them all you
want but we can't tell you anything yeah
it was that little tease you know like
they did for the they did that for the
BlackBerry key one too so I was sitting
on that for forever I'm not gonna share
the piece of information but I remember
looking at the phone and I was like how
many megapixels is the camera and they
were just like can't tell you suppose
like okay it's settings yeah
are you gotta watch out though because
some of Em's throw a fake setting screen
in there if you haven't heard this it's
hilarious because like you I mean do we
have like phones last year that still
said they were on KitKat yeah yeah yeah
you look at it up as like Android
version 4.2 what am i that doesn't seem
right at all exactly well man CES is
obviously at the beginning of the year
so I'm curious what you might be
thinking you you have your ear to the
ground for a lot of stuff it's not just
I mean mobile kind of it's it's an
umbrella term so while we are Android
Authority we try to dive into some other
stuff as well you know you get to do
that on mass yeah what do you think is
gonna be the trend of 2018 oh god man
well
I don't know what was the trend of last
year was it smart home was it wasted
over the Smarties the smart stuff yeah
right you know and everyone like there's
all this really never less buzz worthy
stuff out there like 5g and could the
connected lifestyle and all there's a
you know like and it's all very exciting
but it is kind of impossible to make
exciting for someone like me who's like
because it's so early yet for so much of
this stuff that I'm just like okay fine
when we have a product that's shipping
and then I can actually experience it
myself and comment on it and that'll be
great I don't know man I mean it's
speculative stuff it's just yeah
Casillas itself one thing that I'm
noticing about CES is that it's not
quite the microcosm of the year that it
used to be there's almost too much going
on here that you can't really pinpoint
the one trend in let's say mobile or
even Android yeah it's happening and
that's because in part because like
Mobile is maturing right I mean you've
got there is too much happening but
there's also a lot less happening in
like tablets which we can now agree are
like sort of sort of gone lost
convertibles and phones oh we did this
year there will be a little something
happening in laptops in that we will see
whether the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835
always connected pcs are going to
succeed or fail in the market it was
still confused about that because they
were talking about the Snapdragon 835
powered laptops that are going to have
such long battery life and I was like so
what did you do to the battery or you
know isn't there gonna does no GPU in
there or like no it's like well I mean
the 8:35 is already optimized for mobile
right so it's like it's power
consumption is is really really low and
then they've got all the space of a
laptop now to spread heat dissipation
through which is great and then they can
just throw in a huge battery and you
know and then it doesn't have to have a
separate LT mantra sudo seems really
promising but here's the thing we've
only seen demos exactly we don't have
retail you know it's out in the wild and
frankly are you excited about the one
that Lenovo announced her any of them
are HP or Dell not quiet or not to hell
sorry
oasis it doesn't really know not yet
because like the use case scenario is
what I'm worried about because while a
laptop that can go for 20
or whatever the number might be might be
great the what is it the adrenal that is
with the Snapdragon a 35-year it's not
gonna be able to handle premier it's not
gonna be able to handle final cut well
they could lend some fun it'll run III
asked that specifically don't when I
yeah when I interviewed there was some
stuff like there was one question in
particular I wanted answered any
answered it I'm like can you run
premiere can you run Lightroom on this
thing and he's like absolutely you can
and I'm like okay it's not gonna run
great wait stop this is why we need to
check it this is why we need to be able
to like have these units in the real
world and use them because if it does
work out for one or more of these
devices these could be these could make
me react sighted about laptops you know
what I mean but not yeah go ahead
speaking of speculation yeah and we're
not gonna talk about because we don't
know anything we want if we want it i
know i and i believe yourself we've had
this discussion before we don't really
we're not we don't really take leaks too
seriously you know like it's it's hard
it's hard to actually take it seriously
because speculation only means so much
until the actual thing comes out yeah
that's why we have a few questions about
the galaxy s 9 of course you know what I
let's hit him and then let's talk about
why I don't empty what says what do you
think about the or MT rather says what
do you think about the Galaxy s5 I think
it's probably gonna be a smartphone
launched in 2018 like I think it's gonna
probably come out around MWC yeah you
know like it usually and I don't mean to
be like you know it's like a jerk about
it it's just that I I think leaks leaks
are really cool because they get
everyone everyone whipped up and fires
up the imaginations absolutely it gets
companies names out there when they when
they want to ramp up to you know
advertising a new product but for me
like I'd rather be surprised yeah I
agree I mean don't get me wrong I'd
rather have the briefing beforehand so I
don't need to be surprised at the event
and go like you know
well Bose in the demo area you know but
like I wanted I want to walk in and be
like what have you guys got have them
open a box and show me something that
I'm like oh
Wow rather than like walking and being
like yeah that comports with the leaks I
hate it whenever we do an article
because like I do the YouTube side I do
write some of the reviews and I mean I
do write the reviews but I do write some
stuff for the website is what I meant to
say yeah and I hate it whenever I read
anywhere not just ours but you know any
of their publications well it has this
which the leaks did confirm yeah I know
the leaks did confirm anything yeah
right because not a confirmation yeah
but we might be excited for this year
first I want to say did you meet with
blackberry here or did you have time
with the Blackbird yeah very briefly
yeah their new colorway for the key one
yeah
the bronze edition it's I still want a
Black Edition yeah you and I are like
the the BlackBerry key one fanboys of
the universe right despite the fact that
neither of us is carrying one at this
show I was actually gonna say earlier
what's your Excuse well I don't carry
two phones I would carry a pixel two and
a blackberry if I could got a two
founded up I want to it's a great time
well okay being a little bit meta up I
do have two SIM cards it's just one of
them as being used by my girlfriend got
two back pockets you get two phones man
well I was actually gonna ask what your
holsters are yeah so I used to wear this
product called the LD west original
holster indeed and I loved it especially
for shows like this and but it had the
effect of making you kind of look like a
detective which was great until I came
into a restaurant at one point and was
informed that several months ago when I
was in wearing my holster the entire
staff thought I was packing heat which
in my state of Massachusetts is alarming
to a degree well this is a Nevada an
open carry probably seal carry rather
with the amount of ads I've seen around
town for shoot a real machine gun it's
true yeah I imagine it might be so what
is your solution for that then because I
was trying to find one I haven't I have
a tiny messenger that I'm still on the
fence about because I feel like it makes
it I feel like it doesn't quite go with
my look well funny you should ask Josh
this broadcast is brought to you by
Scotty bass no JK we need to try it yeah
they're actually really cool I like I
like their stuff
no no I I've just gone to back pocket
model already hate to give you a boring
answer but back pockets are inside suit
jacket pockets okay it's it's not the
holster gets you remembered but it was
time to move on to something else I had
I had a phase for a while there I think
it was two years ago when I was in like
my gym rat mode I used to a gym yeah
yeah I would use gym bags those
drawstring bags oh that's right you did
it and I'd walk around looking like I
just came from the gym you had that
whole look down like you would what
you'd have the sweat pants good like the
hair was tied everything was athleisure
which is a term I hate whoa is not that
important mom - yeah it should be called
fitness casual because athleisure is a
term that implies that you go to the gym
and wear those same clothes everywhere
else yeah I don't like that at all yeah
our clothes that are made by fitness
companies that you can wear in places
like I've worn Under Armour before and
it's fine yeah so it's okay sorry
mini-ramp but I know maybe that I think
that would be cool if that were a bit of
a theme in 2018 because at the end of
2017 we saw finally project jacquard by
just by Google and I got to like oh you
did you get the I got the project
jacquard jacket from a local retailer
Google didn't send me one but I bought
it anyways I'm told denim jackets don't
look up don't look at me denim jackets
you would be surprised really
I wore it and I put it on him like this
ain't gonna be me and I was like whoa
wait cuz it was like slimming yeah but I
couldn't do enough for me okay right
it's just got the one interface area
where it's like smart woven fibers in
the sleeve and you can skip tracks and
your headphones awesome but maybe this
will be will see more shoes with the
embedded step counter stuff the personal
area network stuff - Fitness oh I saw a
ring ads showstoppers or whatever one of
the little mini shows that like you know
it reads your heart rate and count steps
I'm gonna be so triggered right now if
it's who I'm thinking more Ora
no it is not motive may be okay because
Ora I wanted to see Ora is sort of like
the pioneer I don't want to go to a far
as a pioneer but they were one of the
first really popular ring trackers
really the probably ever ship yeah and
was like fad or was it like a Rick fad
that I know what you're talking about
remember that your new one is much more
streamlined I said this isn't them this
is a separate coming in their first
product is so light it's titanium and
it's so lightweight I thought it was
fake but then he turned on the little
tiny LEDs on the thing and I was like
wait and so you track it with like it
tracks your sleep but tracks your steps
it tracks here I don't know if it has a
heart rate sensor I may have misspoken
there's one more sensor I don't know
about and the app is so streamlined and
lightweight and cool and I'm like this
is something I could get into yeah and
so do you you don't really wear trackers
in general though no just a SmartWatch
like you know but it's one the nice
thing about CES is you hit your 10,000
step goal and like just like at 11:00
a.m. it's lunchtime yeah exactly but
yeah I would love one of those rings I
think that'd be a perfect way of doing
it without like it being intrusive yeah
if you don't want to wear what I wear
enough stuff already look at that watch
oh yeah the Skagen blue yarn
I remember seeing a hybrid smartwatches
are my favorite category right now got
no use we were just talking about how
Android wear and use a makeover
good dog I just ripped it out all
completely you just gave up yeah I gave
what okay I don't want anymore
I want mine I have a few buttons that
allow me to control my phone when I wish
yeah but I don't need notification ship
because the amount of time I would have
looked at my watch as time I know you
don't think it's not about that it's
about oh it's an Instagram comment who
cares
well this oh it's that email I was
waiting for okay grab the phone okay now
that's that's where I want to go with
this I want there to be a semi hybrid
SmartWatch that has maybe a small really
cheap looking panel on there okay all it
does all it does is it mirrors your
notification tray get a Martian go ahead
it's a Martian do that yeah cuz all I
want is these icons at the top and I
have too many I know but I like what
you're saying you don't even want words
no you want it to be like an email
envelope yeah we're a Twitter bird or at
yeah I just wanted that display on the
watch maybe in the bottom room or even
just in the middle yeah but there are a
lot to do that already like we're there
yeah there are there like they have they
don't even have LCDs they have like
literally silk-screened email envelope
phone thing text like there's like an
LED behind yeah but I guess like seeing
the icon is something or whatever it
might be I don't know if it has to be
that way but yeah get on it I really
want to see something like that on
innovators all I really want us to
realize that in the fringes of this very
room there's probably 80 of those
watches we should just go look for them
I agree I mean you've had a lot of time
to run around I feel like I have it yeah
yeah I have and and it's I think when
you come to a show like this it can be
really easy to after doing this for a
couple years to be like I don't even say
this crap I gotta I saw though the
important stuff in the meetings but just
do yourself a favor if you covered these
things and just walk around them and
absorb this stuff there is a lot of
stuff that's not gonna apply to you but
it's it's so fun it's just to see how
much stuff is being built yeah and how
much of it is kind of cool Wow
I think MT is having some fun with us
right now because he's like speculation
what do you think I'm glad they thought
of six it better be seven Boston
yeah that'd be fine that would be fun
okay did you okay one last question only
because I want to see if you've seen it
cuz I have it Samsung's micro LED
displays no I heard about the technology
a like I mean the bigger the bigger a
display gets the further I walk away
from it I just don't like I like TVs
mm-hmm
the only TV that I'm that excited so so
whatever so sorry I'm rambling no I
haven't seen it what's it like I
actually haven't seen it either I just
know that the the micro LED is supposed
to be made for okay this is my I heard
one of my colleagues say that there's
modularity involved because in order to
have what I'm thinking you know you have
a micro LED display and you're able to
pack them on and have
more and they all become one huge
display or you can even have other just
other things displaying like one that is
just for let's say smart assistants or
for other things it could be a concept
that makes it into other devices I think
that's the reason why they were kind of
excited about it okay so that's the only
thing I was just wondering cuz one of
our we got a question from here whom are
Kadir so that was the one oh okay yeah
sorry about that I'm not much of a TV
guy yeah lissa runs webOS I'm gonna go
ahead and ask
I need a gimbal for my smartphone badly
so please what's looking good out there
I mean I kind of talked about it earlier
already I'm not saying this is the only
one out there but it is a great one so
you know what's crazy about this though
is that like this is sort of the effect
that DJI has it's it's a big enough
mover and can ship stuff like this
that's presumably of pretty fine quality
I don't know this is brand-new so it
might be garbage but it doesn't seem to
be and they can move it at a really
reasonable price so I'm guilty of this
I'm like I need something that meets my
needs and I don't need to review this
category let me just buy that and see
how well it works exactly and in my
experience with the first one that's all
I'll speak to my experience with the
first one is that I loved it initially
over time it didn't really age well I
beat it up it forgot what zero horizon
is so now it's at like a permanent three
degree tilt you know it's good but
considering the app I've never liked
it's it's priced right now yeah it
wasn't priced right at 300 oh yeah and I
didn't get one yeah I'm just gonna try
to sell it yeah but I think one last
thing I'm gonna leave it off with a
compliment one of our Sean Heron says
Michael Fisher I bought the Star Trek
love how communicator you were for you
for my uncle and he loved it I'm glad
the combadge Nobel Committee go home man
they recently remade that I heard cuz
when I first reviewed heard it was bad
and I was so sad because I've wanted a
combat since 1991 one of those I mean
we're really good friends this is one of
the places that we like separate because
I've never I've never watched Josh as a
deep space 9 guy
oh no JK I've never watched any of them
I've never watched any Star Trek so I
know I need to catch up you've told me
already that the current one is pretty
good discovery is really good
yeah this broadcast is brought to you by
CBS all access C six dollars a month
gets you unlimited the reference CBS
caves
all right well on that note I do want to
make sure we're not taking too much of
your time well yeah I've got so much
stuff to do so the live stream went for
the entire time so I'm pretty happy
about that yeah but Michael thank you so
much for having perfect coming on not
having me thank you for coming welcome
