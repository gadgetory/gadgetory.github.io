we're with Huawei device speaking with
Craig jaycox CEO of Huawei CS 2013's
android authority so we had a couple of
cool and assets from Huawei at CES so
I'm just going to pass it over you and
just tell us especially go yeah great we
have a couple of really great
announcements here this week of CES the
first one is the ones you're holding
right now that's our new huawei ascend
d2 it's about the device is getting a
lot of positive reaction here at the
show in fact it's been nominated as one
of the finalists profession show for the
smartphone category couple key things
about this device 5-inch screen that you
notice on the device is a full HD
display 1920 x 1080 so full full HD
really ground the student really good
viewing angles very good architecture
design metal frame if you want to the
baccarat the camera on the back 13
megapixel camera on the back with a
flash 1.3 megapixel camera on the front
so very powerful cameras quick with
another good key piece of this device is
equipped a 3000 milliamp battery so it's
the six days of standby time its power
to really be able to handle all your
heavy heavy use in this category couple
other things we can't leave out on this
device water-resistant dust resistant
very very popular feature we could do a
demonstration during the show we doused
ousted in water lovely
so in terms of the actual processor
inside what are we looking at yes the
processor and both of the devices we're
going to show you share with either day
it is a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
processor hi silicon the house chips /
Huawei nice a k3v2 is there expandable
memory he's a handsome man this
particular device has a 2 Giga ticket 2
gigabytes of RAM and as it has 32
gigabytes of Rama does not have
expandable memory on that once okay so
waterproof dustproof in terms of the
display and stuff is impact resistant
shatterproof is is equipped with the
second generation of Gorilla Glass
corning gorilla glass and the
front-facing camera 2-megapixel town
this particular one is 1.3 1.3 okay good
to know yeah or and of course i have
another device share line in the room
this is the one that's been getting a
lot of fanfare here at the show this is
our new huawei ascend mate 6.1 inch
screen world's largest screen currently
our largest screen this one's an HD it's
a 1080 x 720 so 720 HD great experience
home for gamers you know with it with a
big screen we can we can go to sorry 12
probably 1280 by 720 yeah that's 1280 by
720 mais yeah sorry about that 12 anyway
x 720 i'm great experience some on the
gaming side this packing quad core as
well 1.5 gigahertz it is also pack in
the 1.5 gigahertz quad-core processor a
little different 8 megapixel camera on
the back ok don't see that and the 1
megapixel camera on the front on this
particular one and this one has
expandable memory and this one does have
expandable memory has one gig of ram 8
gigs of a rom and expandable motor 32
gigabytes expandable memory and also I
believe the battery was massive I was
kind of massive battery 4050 milliamp
battery on that the nine days of standby
and if you feel the weight it's less
than 200 grams in weight so it's really
a fantastic nice is good you guys see me
wearing the white glove yeah we're not
doing it for a style favorite like
little Michael Jackson but what this is
we had this device is equipped with
something called magic touch okay we all
know when cold winter time hard for us
to navigate our device with
gloves on or you know this one can do it
whoa so that's magic touch lovely done
so also larger phone one hand use is
always a very popular feature for
devices this one curvature in the design
you seen the back same as this one
really really designed to be able to be
able to be held in one hand so I figured
into messaging if i'm going to send an
email to somebody you notice that the
keyboard i can slide it over to the one
side okay and i can use my thumb the
type so you know larger device but
really built with the in mind of UL
using one hand okay so that's the new
yes and mate this beautiful looking
device a little bit big but i'm sure i
could get used to it so if just speaking
of a huawei and their brand philosophy
you know the appliances you know to hit
the North American market big into
that's 13 he talked about yeah yeah
absolutely so 2013 the US market is you
know very very strategic market for
huawei so we have a lot of initiative
going forward to help build that brand
we've had some success in 2012 we had
our first co-branding with a Tier one on
device the huawei summit with t-mobile
so we're gonna continue that momentum in
the 2013 hope to continue building Billy
down brand here in the US and hopefully
resonate globally as well do you really
think you have what it takes to thrown
the incumbent in the room Samsung well
you know competition is good and I can
tell you we are innovation is what we
pride ourselves on we are going to
continue being innovative and competing
in this market and we feel we have the
right team in place and they're right
I'm just know in order to be successful
in this mark always a lot of expertise
making infrastructure for Darius on
international
you guys blown open the 4g market LT
market over in Asia and also I believe
in Europe as well but these funds going
to be LCD cable we're going to expect to
see shemale TV I should be determined on
these particular device you have in your
in your hand we did launch our first LTE
device in 2012 here in the United States
with metro pcs huawei active up you know
new announcements right now to share
what we have an LT coming up but we're
going to continue working with a mess
from that technology platform and
hopefully we'll have some you know news
in the future on that nicely done any
idea release dates on any of these guys
no no no release statesman show we now
so they're here I believe the the d2l
start in China first and then we'll have
more information following after that
but no dates no specifics on the on
those two devices no last thing I want
to say is why 6.1 inch to see you guys
going to make a bigger phone 7 inch
phone 8 ish phone well I'm helical you
know I think what we're seeing in the
industry I think is that that
convergence of the tablet and the
smartphone market I think consumers and
our carrier customers both are asking
you know for bigger faster devices ones
that can be a true all-in-one so I think
they're really kind of planning that
niche arena try to find out what is that
that sweet spot that Optimus optimus
optimal size for all one device we think
the 6.1 with the one hand operation is a
great great design pretty cool form
factor if bucks one say thanks for your
time sorry i don't have tougher
questions for you this time i know the
next time no problem shailesh guy cute
just like we may hear from a droid
authority CES 2013 here with Huawei
