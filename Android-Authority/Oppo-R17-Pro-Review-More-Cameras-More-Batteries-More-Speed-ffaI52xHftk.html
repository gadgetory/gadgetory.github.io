Android Authority and this is a phone
that you may or may not have heard of
it's the r17 pro from Oppo and oboes
been doing a lot of really cool and
innovative stuff with their smartphones
this year and this is another one of
those phones and just like a lot of
other opal phones this phone will most
likely not be coming to the US but in
the u.s. we have something that's pretty
identical to this it's the oneplus 60 it
actually offers a lot of the same stuff
as the r17 pro so if you want something
that's pretty equivalent to this the 1
plus 60 is gonna be your best bet but
the r17 pro is sort of this high-end
mid-range smartphone it has a snapdragon
17 processor 8 gigabytes of ram a
hundred and twenty eight gigabytes of
internal storage
there's no micro SD card slot for
expandable storage but I think 128
gigabytes is gonna be enough for most
people it also has a 3700 milliamp hour
battery and it's running color OS
version 5.2 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo
now there are a handful of things that
makes this phone really interesting one
of those things is the water drop or
tear-shaped knotch
and this is not the first time that
we've seen Oppo use this particular
style of knotch
but I like this notch way better than
any other notch on other smartphones for
a few reasons one it's smaller - it eats
up a lot less of your screen and three
it just visually looks more appealing so
even though I'm not that big of a fan of
notches I really don't mind this one
that much at all and the secret behind
this notch is it only houses a
front-facing camera and then the other
sensors like the proximity and light
sensors are actually hidden underneath
the display and then the speaker or the
earpiece is just this tiny little slit
of a speaker grille that sits on the
outer bezel above the knotch
the screen itself is a six point four
inch AMOLED panel and it's really
vibrant really colorful and of course
you get those inky deep black so you
sort of expect from an AMOLED screen so
it's a really good looking panel overall
I really have no complaints about it the
second thing that makes this phone
really cool is the in screen finger
sensor and we're starting to see this
technology crop up more and more on our
smartphones and it's definitely come a
long way since we saw it back at like
CES and MWC this year and the in screen
fingerprint sensor on the r17 Pro Oppo
says it will unlock the phone in just
point four seconds which is pretty fast
and it definitely does feel pretty quick
but it's still a step behind the
traditional fingerprint sensor I think
the biggest thing for me here is just
the overall consistency it's fast for
the most part but then there's times
where it ends up taking a full second or
two to actually unlock and not only do
you feel it but you also visually see it
because the fingerprint sensor animation
ends up happening more than once when
it's trying to read your fingerprint but
I think like traditional fingerprint
sensors which got better and faster and
more accurate over time I think the same
thing is gonna happen with these
n-screen fingerprint sensors as more om
start to adopt this technology and I
like the in screen fingerprint sensor it
feels very futuristic and it also makes
the design of the phone look a lot
cleaner you don't have a physical
fingerprint sensor on the front or the
back and the r17 Pro is already a really
good looking phone it's a very sleek
phone very curvy it's really comfortable
to hold in the hand it also has really
excellent build quality it has Corning
Gorilla Glass 6 on a front and back and
metal rails on the sides so it's a very
high quality feeling phone and I also
just love the way this phone looks
especially in this fog gradient color
the way that it transitions from the
purple to the blue is just absolutely
incredible I never really get tired of
looking at it this might remind you a
lot of the Twilight color on the Huawei
p20 pro but I like oboes implementation
a little bit better because it's not
reflective and because it's not
reflective it doesn't show fingerprints
and smudges quite as easily there's also
no headphone jack on this phone so if
you care about headphone jacks you might
be a little bit disappointed in that but
it is what it is this next one is gonna
sound a little bit weird but the battery
on this bone is actually worth talking
about because it's a little bit
different from batteries on other
smartphones it actually has two
batteries inside instead of just one for
a total of 3,700
milliamp hours so it's to 1850 million
fire batteries and OBO says the
reasoning behind this is so that it can
charge the phone faster and more
efficiently and this phone does support
super vooc flash charge which gets the
phone 40 percent in 10 minutes and I
actually tested this claim from a
completely dead oboe r17 Pro and sure
enough after 10 minutes I was at 40% and
I even took this test a couple of steps
further and after another 10 minutes I
was at 74% and after 30 minutes I was at
96% so basically after about 30 minutes
you can get a completely charged hour 17
pro which is pretty impressive it
doesn't have wireless charging if you
like wireless charging but with super
vooc flash charge being as fast as it is
I don't really care that much that it
doesn't have wireless charging the last
thing that I want to talk about is the
cameras and this phone has three cameras
on the back but they may or may not be
what you're expecting the main camera is
a 12 megapixel camera with 1.4 micron
pixel size and optical image
stabilization and it also has a variable
aperture of f15 and f2 point for a la
samsung galaxy s 9 / galaxy note 9 the
second sensor is a 20 megapixel camera
and this sensor is basically designed
for creating these 3d portrait lighting
effects on the rear camera and it's a
cool feature I think it's a little
gimmicky to be honest but it's meant to
make your portrait mode photos look a
little bit more artistic and
professional the third camera is not a
wide-angle or telephoto lens it's
probably not even a lens that you would
even guess it's actually a TOF or
time-of-flight 3d camera and this camera
allows you to create 3d scans of objects
or people and it sort of reminded me a
lot of the 3d creator app that we saw on
Sony Xperia phones and it sort of works
pretty similarly you just circle the
phone around the object or person and it
creates a 3d scan but I didn't find this
feature to be particularly useful I
don't know if I ever
would I think I would have much rather
preferred a more traditional wide-angle
or telephoto lens but as a camera itself
it does take really great photos I was
pretty impressed with the quality it has
excellent color reproduction really
great dynamic range and the ultra night
mode that's on this phone is pretty
impressive it does take a couple of
seconds to process and take the image
but the results are actually pretty cool
so here's an image with the night mode
turned off and here's the image with the
night mode turned on and you can see
there's a pretty big difference between
the two you get much more dynamic range
and better highlight and shadow details
when night mode is enabled and you also
just get a brighter image overall the
only downside to these photos is I think
they over sharpen them a little bit to
give the illusion of more detail but
otherwise I really like what this ultra
night mode is capable of doing so that's
really it for the Oppo are 17 Pro I go
much more in depth about it in my full
written review so if you guys want to
see more camera samples benchmark scores
screenshots all that good stuff is
linked down in the description below so
check that out but thank you guys so
