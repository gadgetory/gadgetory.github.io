brought to you by domain.com so does
Google actually manipulate your search
results hell yeah when you do a video
search on google com how often do you
find videos from other platforms that
are on Google owned almost never they
are favoring their own content now some
of you may be thinking of course they do
that chase YouTube completely dominates
online video they're justified in doing
so well then look at this the FTC nearly
sued google a few years back for
allegedly scraping content from Yelp
tripadvisor and Amazon and then sticking
it into their own search results and
then threatening to remove those
companies from the results when they
complained so let's unpack that for a
moment let's say for example that I am
searching google for toronto temperature
and they scrape their content from the
weather network for example and they put
that information at the top of the
results so why don't have to actually
click on the Weather Network and go to
their site Google gains all the benefit
from scraping that content and doesn't
have to give anything to the source for
creating the content now you may also be
thinking hey Jase they've pulled back
from that practice and they've also
correctly stated that they are not a
publisher they are a search company
therefore there is no conflict of
interest that argument would make sense
if it were 1985 for example android
authority is a publisher we create an
owner on content and sell ads on that
content YouTube is saying that we're
just the platform to host the content
but that's semantics we make money when
YouTube makes money there is still an
inherent conflict of interest when
Google favors their own platforms now is
Google a monopoly well yes but being a
monopoly is not a legal what's illegal
is when you use your monopoly to
unfairly advantage another product so
for example if you're trying to create a
competitor to youtube and google does
not allow you to be indexed in the
search results or significantly
disadvantages you in the search results
that would be considered
anti-competitive and is very illegal and
can get Google into some hot water just
the other week a new press release from
the European Commission laid out a
statement of a
Jackson's which focuses on Google
favoring its own google shopping
comparison product in general search
results but it's pretty difficult to
decide exactly where to draw the line
when it's Google's job to decide the
results as a mirror Friday points out at
the information the idea that Google is
not providing the most relevant results
doesn't make a great deal of sense
Google is deciding what's relevant and
what is not in the first place there is
no objective standard the internal memo
response from google published a tree
code makes for very interesting reading
and lays out google's defense starting
with the idea that quote competition is
just a click away the bottom line here
is that the European Commission is
coming after Google again and when it
comes to android they're looking at
three key issues one whether Google has
illegally hindered the development of
rival mobile applications and to whether
Google has illegally prevented
manufacturers from creating so-called
Android Forks and number three whether
Google has illegally hindered the
development of rival applications by
bundling certain Google applications on
Android there by illegally
disadvantaging rival applications it
seems perfectly plausible that Google
will be found guilty here when Google
insists that specific things are
pre-installed or that you can't use
google apps and services on Android
Forks it's opening itself up to
antitrust issues but don't you worry
about mother google google is probably
going to come to an agreement with the
EU because if they don't you could find
them ten percent of their 2014 revenue i
don't think that's going to happen just
think what would have meant to own
broadcast calm in 1998 mark cuban sold
it to yahoo for 5.7 billion in 1999 woo
why because no domain name extension
tells your story with the same level of
trust as a dot-com or dotnet domain name
dot com and.net domain name extensions
and Jack credibility and your online
presence and who doesn't want more
credibility you can say fifteen percent
on domain name and web hosting when you
use our coupon code android at
domain.com check out don't forget
fifteen percent off when you use our
coupon code android when you think
domain names think domain.com thanks for
watching edward army
my name is Jace you know where I am
right here on Google+ or Twitter I also
read all the comments don't forget about
my brothers and android Josh Jonah tech
