everybody and we hope you have enjoyed
all of the Samsung Galaxy s8 and si plus
coverage that we brought to you so far
however we wanted to give back to you
about big speed the assistant that
Samsung is adding onto their Samsung
Galaxy devices now and I can all be
triggered using the big V button that is
found on the left side underneath the
volume rocker simply press the button
and then a big splash screen will come
up which is listening for your voice and
you will be able to say a bunch of
different voice commands all of which
will trigger something in the phone
anything from even turning down the
screen brightness to pulling up the most
recent take in photo and even to taking
a selfie but there going to be a ton of
other applications that will be
supported by Bixby and the number of
them will be available out of the box if
you are watching the unpacked event you
also saw that there was an external
voice and touch essentially the fact
that you will be able to trigger a
function with your voice and then finish
the action using some sort of contextual
item that is brought up on the screen
this is what kind of integration you can
expect with Samsung applications and
hopefully that later will also be made
available to third-party applications so
you don't have to be beholden to
Samsung's own applications bigsby will
be layered into the cameras however
making the Samsung Galaxy S eight
cameras even more powerful a small icon
will be made available so that you can
trigger the scanning application not
only can you scan words and translate
from dozens of different languages but
you can scan pretty much any item or
even place to get contextual information
based upon its the big speed database
will be pulling from places like Amazon
and it will be able to tell you product
information about different items or
some information about a place that it
recognizes as you have it inside of the
cameras frame this icon will also appear
in pictures that you have already saved
in your phone as a big sphere icon will
appear in this gallery so that it will
be able to scan the photo and do a sort
of reverse image search and then
new information about the thing that you
show big scoop now a lot of these
features sound kind of familiar it's
because they probably are to you because
we have a lot of capabilities that are
very similar to Google now and Google
now on tap especially the fact that the
Bigsby button can be made contextual
however hitting the Bigsby button is
really just the start of it all because
Bigsby will also integrate into the main
home screen swipe over from the left and
you'll be able to see a Bigsby splash
screen where a lot of contextual items
will be shown there's no denying that
this year 2017 is going to be the year
of assistance and artificial
intelligence and Bixby is just another
foray into that particular world so we
will see if Samsung is able to create an
assistant in big speed even if it
doesn't quite roll off the tongue that
is incredibly useful on top of what has
already been a pretty useful google
assistant after all google assistant
does come built-in on the samsung galaxy
has eight devices so when will you be
able to use big speed
well Korean Samsung devices will get its
capabilities at launch and then the US
will follow shortly after from there
Bixby will continue to get updates so
all of its capabilities should be able
to evolve pretty exponentially over the
next year or so making bigsby a pretty
good competitor to Google assistant even
though it sits alongside it so we just
wanted to recap the big suite features
and then also make announce to you the
integration that it has with a lot of
Samsung applications Samsung official
applications that is if you want to see
all of these details in a poll written
feature you can go over to Android or
EECOM and Robert Trix has a wonderful
article that will tell you all you need
to know about big speeds that we were
told at the unpacked event so keep it
tuned to Andrew 30 for all of the best
about the exams on Galaxy s8 and the si+

York City where the unpacked event was
