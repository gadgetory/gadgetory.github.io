away
with android authority we're here in the
asus suite in the Trump Hotel these guys
know how to do it this is not a babe
regime anyway we're looking at Tegra 3
shadow on gaming here on the device and
as you can see it is really smooth we're
looking at I think probably over 40
frames a second yesterday actually at
the nvidia booth they had a connected
through hdmi up to a 55 inch LED TV and
it was just amazing so this is the asus
transformer product 700 this is a 1920 x
1200 resolution display it is just
phenomenal I PS plus ice cream sandwich
on board really nice beautiful thin
profile as you can see now this is a
quad-core Tegra 3 nice and thing lighter
than the original transformer it comes
with the mat back as you can see and
we're looking at an 8 megapixel camera
with the wider aperture than most
cameras on tablets these days it's got
SD card hdmi and right over here to my
left we're looking at the keyboard dock
now these things together make this
really special place all right let's
just click it in its end nice thin
profile I had for anyone that's ever
worked with the netbook this is like a
netbook on steroids you can have nice
relaxing video or you can get productive
if you're looking to so this is the Asus
Transformer Prime from from Asus but
this is the 700 rain and of course the
thing that we have to remember is that
this has almost double the resolution
this is a true 1080p display it's a
gaming powerhouse it's going to come in
16gb white 32 gigabyte and 64 gigabyte
variants and what we're looking at here
this is the champagne grey champagne
gold ugly either way it's um it's very
beautiful so this can be a in the market
in q2 and it's going to come with ice
cream sandwich android 4.1 board no
alright everyone thanks for checking in
i have a wonderful two thousand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
