Android authority and last year's moto
II was arguably one of the best budget
smart phones you could buy and it was
pretty incredible what Motorola was able
to put together for such a low price
this year they're back at it again with
a successor that brings a lot of new
features and enhancements most notably
LTE connectivity but is it still the
same bargain of a smart phone as it was
last year well that's what we're here to
find out with the 2015 Moto e motorola
has created a very distinct design
language for their smartphone lineup and
when looking at the Moto e there's no
mistaking it for anything else other
than a Motorola phone the Moto e
features the same rounded corners and
sloping curve along the back with
Motorola signature dimple that can be
found across the entire Moto lineup the
back is made of a soft touch plastic
material while the outer frame features
a ridged texture that goes all the way
around giving the Moto e plenty of grip
in the hand the outer frame can also be
easily removed allowing you to swap in
different colors for a little bit of
customization which is something
motorola has become very big about over
the last couple of years I decided to go
with this black and blue combo here and
personally I think it looks pretty sleek
what I really love about the Moto e
though is its one-handed usability it's
so small and compact that I can easily
grip the entire phone from top to bottom
in one hand and I can also easily reach
every single corner of the display
without having to do even the slightest
bit of shuffling in the hand in order to
do so and one-handed usability is one of
those things that often gets overlooked
quite a bit nowadays so it's always a
really refreshing feeling to be able to
use a phone of this size going around
the device the power and volume keys are
comfortably placed on the right side
which are both very clicky and tactile
and the power button features the same
Ridge texture that is on the Moto X and
the Nexus 6 so it's very easy to locate
by feel other ports are in their usual
places with the headphone jack up top
microUSB port along the bottom and the
entire left side has been kept
completely bare up front of the usual
sensors along with the earpiece /
speaker and a newly added front-facing
camera also on the front is the display
which has received
a slight size increase this year from
4.3 to 4.5 inches the resolution however
remains the same at 960 by 540 resulting
in a slight dip in pixel density but the
difference is most likely negligible the
resolution is fairly low and yes if you
look close enough pixels definitely are
noticeable especially when gaming but
for general everyday tasks like reading
webpages and keeping up with social
media it was more than adequate you do
lose out on HD video playback which is
probably the biggest drawback to having
a non HD display but everything else
about the display like color saturation
outdoor visibility and viewing angles
are all quite good with very little
color shifting when viewing the screen
off axis the internal specs of the Moto
e will vary between the LTE and 3G
models but the LTE version is packin a
snapdragon 410 and Adreno 306 whereas
the 3G model utilizes a Snapdragon 200
and Adreno 302 both however clocked at
1.2 gigahertz and feature the same 1
gigabyte of RAM for most tasks like
navigating through the OS web browsing
and opening up applications the Moto e
performs without much of a hiccup gaming
is also possible on the Moto e although
load times can get a little bit long and
drop frames will occur from time to time
on more intense games also with only one
gigabyte of RAM you'll definitely notice
some stutters when trying to multitask
and touch responsiveness was also an
issue as I often found myself having a
swipe or tap the screen multiple times
to do whatever it was that I was trying
to do besides the inclusion of LTE and
the usual slew of connectivity options
the internal storage has also been
upgraded to 8 gigabytes which is double
that of last year's model it's still not
a lot but underneath the removable frame
next to the micro SIM slot is a micro SD
card slot that will allow up to an
additional 32 gigabytes of storage the
earpiece on the front now doubles as a
speaker and it automatically gets points
for being on the front but otherwise
it's fairly run-of-the-mill it's
decently loud and produces a clean sound
but since it's just a single driver at
the top of the phone it does sound
lopsided especially when the phone is in
landscape
the camera on this year's Moto e for the
most part remains unchanged from last
year's model it's still a 5 megapixel
sensor and it still lacks an LED flash
but it does feature autofocus this time
around the camera UI is very simple and
easy to use and if you've ever used a
Motorola camera before this will be very
familiar terra-tory taking a photo is as
simple as tapping on the viewfinder and
swiping inwards from the left side will
reveal what it's mostly basic camera
settings by shooting modes like HDR
panorama and 720p slow motion video are
also available picture quality is
exactly what you might expect from such
a basic camera they didn't receive much
of an upgrade the addition of autofocus
is nice but it doesn't do much to
improve the image quality color
saturation and sharpness is pretty
underwhelming providing for some very
muddy looking images noise levels are
also very high and noticeable in even
the most well lit of environments if
this is the only camera you have it'll
certainly get the job done but I think
it's pretty safe to say the camera is
the biggest weakness on the Moto e
selfies are possible now though on the
Moto e because of the new front-facing
camera but the quality is VGA so if
you're looking to step up your selfie
game this isn't the phone to do it with
the battery on the Moto e comes in just
shy of 2,400 milliamp hours and while
this may sound small compared to all the
three thousand plus milliamp hour
batteries were seeing current flagships
it's actually more than enough for the
Moto e the display makes a huge
difference here as it draws very little
power due to its low resolution leading
to some very high screen on time numbers
even with a lot of gaming and
picture-taking screen on time never
dipped below five and a half hours on
lighter days where my usage consisted of
mostly just texting and keeping up with
social media battery life salt upwards
of six and a half hours of screen on
time which was pretty incredible so a
day to a day and a half's worth of
battery life was very easily achievable
in software the Moto e is running what
it's mostly a stock version of Android
5.0 point 2 lollipop and a near stock
something motorola has committed
themselves to over the last couple of
years it's not the latest android 5.1
but considering Motorola's recent track
record with updates we assume it should
get it fairly quickly to enhance the
experience the Moto e this year bring
some of these staple features that can
be found on Motorola's flagship the Moto
X you now have moto assist to keep your
phone quiet during meetings and when you
sleep moto actions to quickly launch the
camera by simply twisting your wrist and
moto display for those subtle
notifications when the screen is off one
thing to be aware of though is since the
Moto e has an LCD display these
notifications do not continuously
pulsate like on the Moto X because if
they did it would quickly drain the
battery they do however show up when you
pick up the phone and when the
notification is initially received and
just in case you're curious you can't
wave your hand over the display to wake
it like on the Moto X because the Moto e
does not feature any IR sensors on the
front when it comes down to it the best
part about the Moto e is the price it's
extremely affordable with the LTE
version coming in at a hundred and
forty-nine ninety-nine and that's
without a contract if you want to save
an extra thirty bucks there's also a 3g
version available for eight hundred and
nineteen ninety nine but it is
definitely worth the extra thirty bucks
for the LTE connectivity as it makes the
overall experience on the Moto e that
much better all in all I've really
enjoyed using the Moto e and when you
put everything into perspective it's
another very solid entry-level phone for
Motorola
it's small compact lightweight and for a
smart phone with 4G LTE Android 5.0
lollipop and a sub $200 price the Moto e
is won bargain of a smart phone motorola
is proving once again how dominant they
can be in this price range and that you
can get a lot in a smart phone while
paying very little
