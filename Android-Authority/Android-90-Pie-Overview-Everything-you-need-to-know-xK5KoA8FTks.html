hindi from android authority comm and
today is the day we finally get to talk
about android pi Google's big keywords
this year are AI well-being and
simplicity we'll see that and a lot more
an Android Pi so strap in folks this is
gonna be a long one the UI is as good a
place to start as any the core UI
experience remains unchanged from
previous versions of Android the home
screen settings notifications quick
settings and app drawer are still in
their usual spots they look more or less
the same with some minor tweaks like
more rounded UI elements and more
colorful icons in both the settings and
the quick settings menus the big change
this year came with navigation and the
recent apps Android now has a simpler
gesture based navigation system instead
of the traditional three soft keys
across the bottom don't worry you can
change it to and from the new navigation
system if you want to under the gesture
settings in the settings menu
it keeps the home button and back button
and they function as normal including
long pressing the home button for Google
assistance you now access the recent
apps menu with a quick flip up from the
home button swiping up closes
applications and there's a clear all
option all the way to the left
multi window is still accessible in this
layouts by long pressing the icon at the
top of the card
another quick swipe up opens the app
drawer and you can skip the recent apps
and open just the app drawer by using a
longer swipe upward from the home button
finally a swipe right on the home button
immediately opens the most recently used
application and you can hold right to
scroll through all of your various
recent apps this has been one of Android
PI's most polarizing new additions but
after a few days of use muscle-memory
kind of takes over and it's really not
that big of a deal I've been using this
feature since its launch in an earlier
beta and honestly it doesn't take long
at all to get used to again though you
can change it back to the regular old
three button layout if you want to some
other tweaks include a revamped power
menu with a new a screen shot option
that means no more holding the volume
down and power to catch a screen shot
and Android Pi finally comes with a
native screenshot editor the power menu
now pops up next to the power button and
the
goes for these software volume controls
they now show up next to the volume
rocker the software volume is now
defaulted to media volume instead of
call volume like in previous versions of
Android you can also silence your phone
more quickly with the new icon at the
top of the software volume controls
additionally there is now a dirt theme
option in the settings it only seems to
theme a very small percentage of the UI
making it functionally useless however
it's a positive sign that a dark theme
made its way to a stable released this
year the text selection tool also got a
bit of a revamp you now get a magnifying
glass function when selecting text in
Android Pi and it works well enough
additionally the web search and
translate functions are now on the main
pop up instead of the overflow menu
finally Android Pi includes native
support for the knotch we were able to
play with it in a previous beta release
so we turned it off for this video the
support is still there though buried in
the code and visible in parts of the UI
for instance when you get notifications
from more than four applications you get
it dot urging you to check your
notification shade for more this happens
even on devices without a notch and
that's a little frustrating the clock is
also on the left side of the status bar
freeing up more of the space in the
middle for the proverbial notch it's
subtle but it's all there and that's
about it for the UI changes really there
are a few additional tweaks animations
status bar changes and other small
things here and there but aside from the
new navigation system and a few
reworkings of some other elements most
of the UI is the same with some minor
adjustments for uniformity and style
Android Pi didn't have any hallmark
features like in previous versions of
Android indeed the biggest change was
the new gesture UI stuff and we already
talked about that still there are a
bunch of little things in Android Pi
that do add to the experience even if
it's just a little bit the first new
feature is the ability to manually
rotate the screen at will you simply
turn the phone on its side and a little
icon will appear in the navigation bar
at the bottom of the phone press it and
the screen will rotate into landscape
mode and of course this action does work
in Reverse notifications got a few new
features as well there is a manage
notification shortcut at the bottom of
notification cards for quicker access to
more options
additionally Google brings its AI into
the mix with notifications if you swipe
away a notification
enough times the UI eventually asks you
if you want to silence those particular
apps on silencing those apps is a bit of
a pain but nothing too horrible
messaging apps also now show more
content than they did before there are
also two new app features in Android Pi
they include app actions and app slices
app actions uses Google's AI to predict
what applications you want to use and
when most of the time for me it was just
sending the occasional message however
my fellow editors noticed prompts for
things like phone calls messages emails
and more you can disable app actions by
searching for suggestions in the
settings menu selecting actions and then
turning them off if you don't want to
use them app slices is another feature
but this one didn't make it into the
stable release of Android Pi at least
not yet we believe it'll be launched
alongside the pixel 3 later this year
slices let you view certain parts of the
application when you need them instead
of launching the entire app for instance
you can search for lyft and Android pi
will show part of the application where
you can Hale a ride it's neat but we'll
have to wait a little bit longer to
actually try it ourselves
Android PI's AI makes a couple more
appearances in the new adaptive
brightness and the adaptive battery
features for adaptive brightness it'll
change the brightness based on the
ambient lighting as it always has
however it'll also remember how you
manually adjust the brightness in
certain situations and try to learn how
you do it in order to predict it in the
future
adaptive battery works in a similar way
but for applications the apps that you
use most often will get the most
resources and the apps you use least
often will have their resources limited
by the OS there are some bugs with this
like delayed notifications for your idle
apps but it should help battery life a
little bit along with the already
included those mode there are a few
other minor features in Android Pi as
well the do not disturb mo was vastly
simplified it's still customizable but
slightly more restrictive than the old
one the battery saver mode got some
slight visual tweaks but it operates the
same as before location settings are
also streamlined you can now only have
it as on/off or GPS only and we're sure
gonna miss battery saver mode finally
let's talk a little bit about digital
well being a new function and Android PI
this feature shows you your phone usage
and that includes the number of times
you unlock the device the number
notifications you receive which apps you
use and how often you use them this
helps you identify how you spend most of
the time in any given app from there you
can manage your usage in a couple of
different ways there are shortcuts to do
not disturb mode and manage
notifications additionally you can
access to more new features in Android
Pi winddown and app timers app timers
helps you restrict how often you use
applications simply set the timer and
the operating system locks you out of
that application when your time is up
it's a method of keeping you from using
your most addictive apps on your phone
too often winddown starts at a certain
time that you set it makes your phone
grayscale over time and eventually
engages do not disturb mode
automatically as sort of a sign that
it's time for bed or right now digital
well-being is in beta and you need a
beta invite in order to use it Google
doesn't make you wait very long most of
us here at Android authority got our
invite after about 8 to 10 hours or so
we'll have that link for you in the
video description below if you're
interested of course as per the norm
there are plenty of changes that take
place under the hood we won't spend a
lot of time with this because it's
impossible to show them and it'll make
this video quite boring really fast
Android Pi now supports dual cameras
natively something that apparently
wasn't available before applications
should have an easier time using all the
cameras on a phone with the newer api's
Android Pi is also coming with a bunch
of new image audio and video codecs
including HDR vp9 video
hei f image compression and some
additional stuff as well
Wi-Fi RTT is a new positioning API it
allows your phone to ping multiple Wi-Fi
hotspots inside of large buildings so
that applications can better tell you
where you are within that building that
should be really neat when it rolls out
there are also new animation api's
improvements to Kotlin client-side
encryption api's and a lot more
of course many api is like the neural
networks api received fairly large
updates as well if you want to see the
full list we'll have it linked up in the
video description below so you can see
all of the under the hood stuff for
yourself finally let's talk about
Android PI's new security features for
starters Android Pi restricts access to
sensors camera and microphone to
applications that are in an idle State
you will get notified when an
application requests
these permissions through a regular
notification and you can say yes or no
from there
that means no applications can spy on
you or listen to you in the background
additionally Android Pi now scrambles
MAC addresses so it'll be more difficult
to track your device over Wi-Fi each
time you connect your phone will show a
different MAC address we still recommend
a VPN for public Wi-Fi but this is a
positive step forward a few other minor
security additions include better
protection for your device ID better
transmission of sensitive data and you
now get warnings when applications
aren't using the latest Android SDK
levels since those can post security
risks Android Pi also improves on
encrypted backups and it blocks non
HTTPS traffic by default overall Android
Pi is a decent update in my opinion it's
a bigger jump to go from Android Orio to
Android Pi than it was to go from
Android nougat to Android Oreo if that
makes sense the UI saw much larger
changes than usual and the new features
are smaller in scope but feel more
useful in day-to-day use the magnifying
glass in the text selection and the
screen rotation button are things I can
see a lot of people using every day even
if they aren't overly exciting of course
everyone's been clamoring for new UI
elements and bigger changes after all
material design is almost half a decade
old now however Google is finally taking
an approach where if it's not broke
they're not really fixing it and after
that Fiasco with their messaging app
ecosystem
I'm all for them leaving well enough
alone for right now Android pie looks
demonstrable a different than Oreo and
you can definitely tell the two apart
with a cursory glance however it is not
as big of a change as many would have
liked if I had one complaint about
Android Pi it would be that another
theme this year seems to be restriction
do not disturb mode was simplified but
functionality was removed in the process
and the same goes for location services
and their removal of OMS digital well
being is cool and all but its main
function is to help to restrict yourself
from using your device more often this
is by far the most restrictive version
of Android to date and while some of it
is for your own good some of it is a
little worrisome in any case I want to
hear what all of you think Android Pi is
what it is and I'm interested to see
what you think about it and that about
does it for this one folks if you like
this video you know the drill and if not
well you still know the drill we have
some source
in the video description below along
with some older videos if you want to
check those out and learn more details
thanks again for watching everybody and
have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
