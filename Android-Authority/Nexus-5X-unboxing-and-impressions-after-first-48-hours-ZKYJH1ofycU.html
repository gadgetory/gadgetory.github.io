is the true successor to the original
Nexus 5 that came out a couple of years
ago and the Nexus 5 was probably one of
the most popular Nexus phones ever made
and two years later here we are with the
5x which is also made by LG and I've
only had this phone for a couple of days
now which is not enough time to do a
full review or anything but it is enough
time for me to give you guys my first
impressions and I want to start with the
design so the first thing that struck me
with this phone when I first got it out
of the box was how small and compact it
feels in the hand and how light it feels
and I don't know if it's just me and
maybe I'm just used to using phones that
have been made of metal or metal and
glass which are typically a lot heavier
but this phone just feels incredibly
light and really easy to use in one hand
so I do like the overall size and I like
the weight of it the plastic build it
doesn't feel cheap by any means but it
doesn't have that same sort of luxurious
or quote-unquote premium feel that you
would get from a metal or a metal and
glass phone but it does feel very sturdy
and solid and I do like the matte finish
as well the matte finish provides a lot
of grip and it also does a really great
job of detracting finger prints and I
love the way that the corners are
in the way that the back sort of tapers
down on the sides so overall I do like
the look of the Nexus 5x I think it's a
great looking phone and it really
embodies the look and feel of a nexus
one new addition to the Nexus 5x and
also the Nexus 6p is actually on the
bottom and that's a USB type-c port and
I'm pretty sure within the next six
months to a year USB type-c is pretty
much going to be everywhere and probably
every single smartphone that comes out
next year is going to be USB type-c
at least I would think so but as of
right now because USB type-c is not all
that prevalent and it's only on a few
devices you could probably count on your
hands how many devices are using USB
type-c it's a little bit more of an
inconvenience than it is a convenience
and because it uses USB type-c if you
don't have any other devices that use
this particular port the only cable that
you're going to be able to use is the
one that comes with the 5x and the cable
that comes with a 5x it's actually USB
type-c on both ends so that means the
wall adapter is also a USB type-c port
so not only is the cable reversible but
it's also reversible so I do love the
fact that the cable is reversible but
unless you happen to own a 12-inch
MacBook or one of the new Chromebook
pixels you're not gonna be able to use
this cable for data transfer and if
you're looking to charge this phone you
pretty much have to lug this cable
everywhere that you go especially if
you're traveling or even just moving
room to room within your own home
another really nice thing about this USB
type-c port is that it actually supports
fast charging and I have to admit the
Nexus 5x charges extremely quickly I've
been able to go from 0 to full with the
phone on in about an hour and 20 into an
hour and 25 minutes which is pretty
quick and actual battery life is
actually pretty good too I've been able
to get through a full day without any
issues whatsoever but I don't think
you're gonna be able to get to much more
than that with the 5x here but if you're
just looking for a good full day's worth
of battery life the 5x should do the job
just fine another standout feature on
the 5x is the dual front-facing speakers
and for a sub $400 smartphone they
actually sound pretty good I don't think
that the best front-facing speakers that
I've ever
hurt on a smartphone but because they're
on the front they're automatically
already better than any other phone out
there with a bottom mounted or a rear
mounted speaker so I do like the
speaker's quite a bit I think they lack
a little bit of low-end punch but
otherwise they sound really great and it
makes for a very awesome experience when
watching videos or playing games also on
the front is the 5.2 inch screen which
comes in at a resolution of 1080p so
it's not quad HD or anything it's still
the same resolution as the Nexus 5 from
a couple of years ago but I've really
had no problems with the screen at all
it's plenty sharp it has great colors
great viewing angles it is a little bit
difficult to see outdoors but if you
crank up the brightness all the way
you'll really have no problems with it
at all so I really enjoyed the screen it
might be a little bit too small for some
people but if you like that one-handed
usability you're really going to enjoy
the screen on the Nexus 5x now just to
recap some of the specs really quickly
you're looking at a Snapdragon 808 and
two gigs of ram which some people might
find to be a little bit low especially
for 2015 but I've really had no issues
with the performance of this phone at
all everything has been really smooth
really snappy very responsive I haven't
encountered any lag whatsoever whether
I'm multitasking or playing games or
just generally using the phone everyday
I have had no problems at all so I
haven't found the two gigs of RAM to be
an issue whatsoever now I want to move
on and talk a little bit about the
camera which is supposedly a much
improved experience so what you're
looking at is a twelve point three
megapixel Sony made sensor and it
measures in at one point five five
microns in pixel size and Google says
that these larger pixels are going to be
a lot better for low-light and you don't
need optical image stabilization because
of it but honestly I would have liked to
have seen oh is anyways just because it
makes for more stable footage when
recording the video but as far as the
actual picture quality goes I've
actually been pretty impressed with them
in daylight it takes some really
great-looking photos and the dynamic
range looks to be really good it doesn't
over blow the highlights or crush the
shadows or anything like that but as far
as actual low-light and nighttime photos
go I haven't been overly impressed with
them it seems to be very aggressive
in noise-reduction especially in the
darker parts of the images and the
camera tends to take on the white
balance of these surrounding light
sources so a lot of the photos tend to
come out a little bit yellowish but I
don't want to fully assess the camera
just yet I still want to test it a
little bit more and take a few more
photos but that should give you an idea
of the results that I've been getting
with this camera lastly I want to talk a
little bit about this software so
because this is a brand new Nexus phone
you're obviously getting the latest
version of Android with Android 6.0
marshmallow right out of the box and
aesthetically you're not going to notice
too many differences between lollipop
and marshmallow because many of the
improvements are actually under the hood
but you're also getting some really nice
software features as well and I'm not
going to go over all of these features
in this particular video I'm gonna save
that for the full review but one of the
biggest highlight features of
marshmallow is now on tap and if you're
not familiar with this feature already
it basically makes Google now
contextually aware so it can actually
analyze the information that it sees on
the screen no matter what application
you're in or if you're on the web
browser it can analyze that information
and give you what it thinks is pertinent
to what you're looking at so for example
if you're texting a friend about going
to see a particular movie if you trigger
now on tap by long pressing on the home
button it will give you suggested
applications to apps that will give you
movie times or applications like IMDB
that will give you information about the
actors that are in the movie even though
I've been playing with now on tap for
the past couple of days now I've only
actually had one real life scenario
where I was able to use now on tap and
that was when I received a text message
with an address that I needed to
navigate to and instead of copying the
address opening up Google Maps and then
pasting it and starting my navigation I
was actually able to just trigger now on
tap and it saw the address and instantly
provided me with Google Maps as a
suggested application and I was able to
start my navigation right from there so
it definitely makes things a lot simpler
and quicker and easier to do another
really awesome feature of Android 6.0 is
built-in fingerprint support which
Google is calling Nexus imprint and this
is going to allow third-party developers
to tap into this and build in
fingerprint support into their own
applications and the 5x can also tap
into this as well use the built-in
fingerprint scanner on the back and the
fingerprint scanner in my experience so
far has been very reliable and very
quick it probably takes about a half a
second from when you place your finger
on the actual scanner itself to the
phone unlocking so it's not the fastest
that title still belongs to the huawei
mate s but it's fast enough that you're
not going to have any problems
whatsoever and I've really enjoyed using
the fingerprint scanner but there you go
guys this has been my first impressions
of the Nexus 5x after 48 hours obviously
I will be going more in depth in the
full review so make sure to stay tuned
for that and subscribe down below so you
don't miss out on that video when it
goes live and also give this video a
thumbs up if you did enjoy it and also
