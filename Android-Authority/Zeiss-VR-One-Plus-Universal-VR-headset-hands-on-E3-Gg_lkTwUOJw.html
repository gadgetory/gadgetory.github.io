source what's going on everybody
and I'm here to bring you a look at
these size VR 1 plus now here at e3
might be a little bit odd to see a
company like science here for a VR
platform but they already had a VR one
in the past and now they have a VR one
plus it's a brand new peripheral that
allows for a somewhat Universal almost
completely Universal rather platform for
VR headsets and what you have are these
little trays that slide right into the
VR headset and in the VR one plus you'll
be able to have any phone from 4.7 to
5.5 inches in the case of this phone
right here which is already playing a VR
game what we have is the iPhone 6s plus
so the tray with the phone that is
already playing VR content slides right
in quite easily and after that we have
the eyepiece or the eye box rather which
is just large enough or actually large
enough to accommodate eyeglasses so what
you have with a company like science
that makes lenses is a great way of
magnifying into the VR content and even
if you have prescription glasses like I
do it'll fit perfectly inside but being
length the length between
and the actual banker fires themselves
is actually perfectly fine so that even
with prescription glasses you're going
to get a very clear image and right here
at the booth testing a couple of games
out on this particular headset I find
that the image is actually really sharp
it looks really nice and as long as you
have really high pixel density in the
phone that you're using you won't really
get that screen door effect but with the
iPhone 6s plus obviously has a somewhat
lower resolution display than plenty of
Android devices so of course it'll have
a little bit more of that screen door
effect so you can actually see the
pixels inside of the headset size has
partnered up with Google to make sure
that this headset is day-dream
compatible but until drain cream
actually happens on Android 10 and
Beyond this is primarily a great way of
writing the cardboard content that is
already available in the Android
ecosystem on this headset you can take
off all of these different straps here
and you are able to move around the way
that you would normally with cardboard
and of course there's this little button
on the left side here that works just
like the magnetic button on a cardboard
device overall the best part about the
VR one plus the most exciting part
rather is the fact that it is pretty
much Universal with any smartphone that
you might be using there are very few
smart phones that won't fit in here
because the Universal tray that the one
plus will come with has the ability to
put in anything from 4.7 to 5.5 inches
in a particular type of phone so no
matter what phone you have or even if
you upgrade your phone in the future
you'll be able to slide it right into
this headset quite easily without having
to buy a whole new headset in the market
today we have a lot of companies who are
creating a VR headsets just particularly
for their own smartphones and it's nice
to see a company like zayats which has
some forward-thinking ideas in terms of
the optics of this headset to create one
that is actually pretty much Universal
those iose vr1 plus is going to be
available later this August again at
that price point of $129 so it's an
affordable way of getting into virtual
reality and it has probably one of the
best platforms available so that you can
use pretty much any phone that you want
keep it tuned to VR source and to
Android or D from time to time for VR
related content and you can member to
keep it tuned here because we are your
source for all kinds of reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
