primarily on ultra affordable
smartphones but their latest entry is an
undeniable exception with flagship level
specifications and is still affordable
$349 price tag
the Pier XL is one of Blues most
intriguing phones yet this is Bailey
Stein with Android authority and this is
my for review of the blue pur XL the pur
XL is a big phone actually it's huge
it's about the same size as the Nexus 6
and while its curves do help with
handling there is no getting around the
fact that this is one large device
that's not necessarily a bad thing
depending on what you're looking for but
do keep in mind that you'll probably
find one-handed use a bit challenging
the back cover has a matte plastic
finish and while it does resist
fingerprints quite well I noticed that
my unit collected scuffs when I set it
on a xiaomi power bank which was odd and
unexpected unlike many other comparable
devices the blue pur excels back cover
can be removed revealing dual micro SIM
card slots and a micro SD card slot the
aluminum band running along the edges of
the phone contributes to a more premium
feel and makes the sides easier to grip
the corners do feel a bit sharp and had
an unfortunate tendency to dig into my
hands what is both on the thicker and
heavier side at 9.3 millimeters and 207
grams it does feel like a very solidly
built device with even weight
distribution
unlike the Moto X pure edition which
feels more so top-heavy in my opinion
the power and volume buttons on the top
right side of the device are positioned
perfectly an offer excellent tactile
feedback there's also a camera shutter
button which can launch the camera app
even when the device is locked one minor
detail that I did notice was that
although the device does vibrate briefly
when pressing the button while the
screen is on it does not while the
screen is off that would have been nice
when the phone was in my pocket giving
me a heads up when I've accidentally
launched the camera app coming to the
front of the phone you'll find three
very lightly outlined capacitive keys
there's also a notification LED on the
top to the left of the eight megapixel
front-facing camera
the phones six inch quad HD Super AMOLED
display looks very sharp with deep
blacks and saturated colors my units
display does seem to be on the cooler
side but thankfully blue has included an
option to change the color temperature
to be a bit warmer sadly that does make
the display look a bit too warm and I
really wish that the color temperature
would have been correct out of the box
well it's generally bright enough for
indoor use it still can be difficult to
read in direct sunlight in comparison to
similar devices when it comes to
performance the pure XL shines with a
mediatek helio x10 octa-core processor
collect at two gigahertz overall the
phone feels very snappy with little egg
it's easily one of the fastest phones
that I've used in recent memory in
addition to its powerful processing
package the pure XL also includes three
gigabytes of RAM gaming performance was
also good on the pure XL thanks to the
power vrg 6200 I was able to play most
games with minimal lag which hasn't
always been the case with other devices
using the G 6200 included is support for
802 11ac Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth 4.0 and
unlike on the oneplus 2 it also has NFC
while there is us 4G LTE support do keep
in mind that it's missing support for
band 5 for AT&amp;amp;T and then 12:14 Mobile
which may be a problem for some users I
was unable to receive 4G LTE in my home
coverage area with 18t for example those
wishing to store large and/or many files
on their phone will be happy to know
that Blu has included 64 gigabytes of
internal storage a number that we rarely
see at this price point even if that's
not enough you can always expand the
storage via a microSD card up to an
additional 64 gigabytes the pure XL does
have high fire do and DTS surround sound
through the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack while the audio does sound good I
didn't really notice a difference when
compared to other phones the dual stereo
speakers on the back of the device are
plenty loud with little to no Distortion
they are rear facing which is a bit
unfortunate but the quality of the
speakers is still above average for this
price
with a 3,500 milliamp hour internal
battery you would think that the pure
Excel would provide excellent battery
life unfortunately
my battery life tests showed slightly
below average results likely due to the
larger six inch quad-hd display when I
set the screen to about 50% brightness
with Wi-Fi off for the majority of the
day I was able to get the phone to last
for an average of about 15 hours with
about 2 hours and 45 minutes of screen
on time well those are far from terrible
numbers I was expecting a bit more
considering the battery capacity the
pure excels rear camera is the best
camera in a blue smartphone to date it's
a 24 megapixel shooter with optical
image stabilization phase detection
autofocus and a two-tone LED flash
although the megapixel count isn't
necessarily a good indicator of image
quality the pure XL performs very well
in good lighting conditions well it may
not be as good as the cameras found in
the galaxy s6 or iPhone 6s I think it's
a great performer for the price low
light performance was where things
started to fall below average delivering
unsatisfactory results if you're in the
right lighting conditions though you can
get some very sharp images with great
color reproduction on the surface the
camera app looks pretty basic until you
open the modes menu and switch it to
professional that grants you access to
exposure compensation ISO white balance
shutter speed and focus settings all
available from a single menu overall
it's a very nice app that lets you shoot
quickly in automatic but also one that
allows you to drill down into more
specific settings when you want more
control out of the box the pure excel
runs a semi stock build of android 5.1
lollipop some of the UI elements are
unchanged like the lockscreen volume
controls Notification Center and
multitasking view but other areas have
seen sharp departures from a material
design language the pre-installed the
carefree launcher sadly does not include
an app drawer the touch pal 2015
keyboard is rubbish and most system apps
have seen complete redesigns I'm quite
honestly unsure of the direction that
blue is taking when it comes to software
as it seems that each of their phones
has an entirely different experience
it's not all bad however
as the software does include nifty
features like smart gestures app
permissions and a few general setting
options for adjusting things like the
notification LED with that said there's
also a few bugs
for example the notification panel seems
to flicker when pulled down every once
in a while the multitasking cards do
seem to have some preview scaling issues
and the fingerprint reader on my unit
doesn't even work when trying to unlock
the device
I've tried emailing blue about this
issue but I haven't been able to get it
working even after following their
directions I'm thinking that it's just a
software bug as the fingerprint reader
works pinewood adding fingerprints and
using it when the device is unlocked my
biggest concern for this device is
whether or not it will be updated to
future versions of Android like the
recently released Android 6.0
marshmallow
although Blue has said that they are
making software updates a priority the
jury is still out on whether they will
decide to update this device in the
future when they released the life--one
and life 8xl in june they promised
lollipop updates in july even publishing
renders showing lollipop screenshots but
failed to deliver they haven't provided
an updated timeline and it's still
unclear whether they are working on
these updates or not regardless it
worries me greatly on whether or not
they are actually committed to
supporting their products beyond release
at $349 the blue pur XL is entering a
perhaps unfamiliar market for blue one
that is much less forgiving than the sub
$200 price category
despite this the pur XL is still a very
solid option available now on Amazon in
either black or gold while the pure XL
does have its flaws limited 4G LTE
support disappointing battery life and
software that may never be updated
I generally enjoyed my single month with
the phone of course it's great display
excellent performance and very good
camera are all very good reasons to buy
this phone if you're looking for a phone
with a better software experience and
support however you'd be much better off
by purchasing a nexus 6 Nexus 5x ZTE
axon or a Moto X pure edition or style
for all around 350 to $450
