surprise in the form of an actual unit
that was announced at the event and then
the storm of phones and announcements
rolled in shortly after but now we can
finally bring you our thoughts and what
has turned out to be a pretty great
phone it's charged with a car from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the huawei ascend
mate 7 Huawei has succeeded in design in
the past and this time continues to do
so with a larger offering in the mate 7
it's hard to get past the 6-inch screen
but once you browse around the device
you'll find a very well-constructed
metallic frame with a nice industrial
look and feel the buttons are nice and
media on the side with the power button
below the volume rockers this time for
easier access and there's a decided lack
of elements used solely for decoration
there's no capacitive keys on the mate7
making for a very nice screen to panel
ratio and on the back where you'll find
the main addition to an otherwise
metallic body is the fingerprint scanner
this is the press type rather than a
swipe and it rests squarely below the
camera optics which do stick out just a
little bit all in all this is a very
attractive device and Huawei has once
again proved that they have a good
design language when using one hand it
is simply unwieldy however good luck
getting around the top elements of the
phone even if you have larger hands
sometimes thankfully there are some
software features that help to alleviate
this but we'll get to that later metal
really seems to be the trend in this
flagship smartphone season and it does
help the mate7 score some good style
points we've already mentioned the six
inch screen and its implications on
handling but make no mistake this is a
very good panel 1080p resolution on this
display brings a pretty awesome
experience larger screens often get a
bad rap for size but then are equally
heralded for bringing a nice media
experience and that's exactly what goes
on here contrast is where it should be
where the brightness keeps everything
quite visible throughout any condition
you can change what the color
temperature of the display is but the
default setting is already good enough
and I never needed to tamper with it one
bit as far as performance goes Huawei
tends to make performance their own
responsibility with in-house packages
and that's what we get in the mate7 as
well a high silicon Kirin 925 as it is
called brings a 1.8 gigahertz quad-core
cortex a15 together with another
quad-core
sex-ay seven clocked in at one point
three gigahertz both working in
conjunction to bring very optimized
power it doesn't slip off the tongue as
easily as let's say Snapdragon but it is
certainly as fast as one getting through
the various elements of the emotion UI
is a breeze as we're all app experiences
including gaming I seriously don't see
much lag at all when doing my general
multitasking with the only hiccup being
in the recent apps screen but that's
okay because we know that it has to load
the screen previews before actually
presenting the grid in hardware there is
one main story to the mate7 but we'll
touch on that last pun intended
as far as internals ago this is still
the phone available primarily outside of
North America but my unit was still able
to connect to LTE networks on t-mobile
and AT&amp;amp;T it does struggle with keeping
the connection from time to time but
otherwise the mobile network experience
has been pretty reliable call quality is
also good with calls coming in quite
clear for both ends a microsd card slot
does bolster the included 16 or 32
gigabytes of storage and as far as ram
goes the respective storage options will
get you either two or three gigabytes of
memory respectively include all of the
usual smartphone goodies like Bluetooth
and NFC and you'll find the standard
package underneath the hood battery life
proved to be worthy of the big phone
stereotype as the mate7 survived two
days before clocking out with above
moderate usage if my screen on time was
doubled a solid day and a half of heavy
usage would still be possible but
nestled right on the body on the back is
probably always biggest claim to fame
with their newest flagship the
fingerprint scanner similar to the HTC
One Maxx is iteration the mate7 requires
a touch input rather than swipes and
it's setup does look familiar to that of
iOS but what makes the fingerprint
reader on the mate7 so lovely is the
fact that once you have it set up you
can use it at any time to unlock the
phone
otherwise you'll be sticking with the
traditional four-digit code even from
the prone standby position holding a
finger to the area for just a second
will wake and unlock the device making
access that much easier for a while now
I've talked about fingerprint scanners
being an even easier and faster way of
getting into your device with some other
iterations if it takes twice as long for
me to get into the phone when I'm using
my finger that I'm probably not going to
use it but Huawei really did get it
right here by allowing you to just use
the fingerprint
to get right into the phone and I think
that a lot of other manufacturers can
really learn a thing or two from
huawei's implementation a 13 megapixel
shooter adorns the rear while another
five megapixel iteration now graces the
front of the made 7 a few nice modes are
available for either shooter all focus
is another take on the depth of field
snapping that takes a few pictures at
different focus levels that you can then
pick from a great panorama mode stitches
together an entire scene quite well and
yield some large files HDR is available
but in my shooting I found it to do
pretty much nothing to enhance most
photos and finally there is a future
where you can quickly DoubleTap the
volume down button in order to get a
really quick shot off it's more about
speed than quality here though so focus
will almost always be off and you can
only hope that you framed your shot
correctly so what the phone will go out
of its way to tell you was a 1.2 second
capture time will probably turn into
four times that when afterwards you work
to get the right focus and then finally
take the proper shot and then on the
front to the usual beauty mode found on
asian camera apps returns bringing real
time blemish hiding and for a better
looking self-portrait a small box
appears in the top left to help you
actually look in the lenses direction as
far as quality goes I found them eight
seven to have a more than decent shooter
details are well captured and noise
levels even in night settings don't
destroy most images the interface is
pretty simple to navigate through so I
wasn't fidgeting too hard for what I
wanted and in most cases just picking up
and shooting yielded a pretty nice shot
even the front facing camera proved to
be a good shooter though I'm still wary
of the beauty modes nonetheless having a
higher megapixel count for
self-portraits seems to be the trend now
and the mate7 does not disappoint in
that department as I get into the
software portion let's get one thing out
of the way right now
no there is no app drawer however given
how much the emotion UI has matured that
actually doesn't matter as much emotion
has kept its flat simple interface and
as such you'll be making use of folders
a lot but I get underneath the home
screens and you'll find a plethora of
small yet useful additions for one thing
using a phone this size has helped a bit
by a one-hand interface that can be
moved around by holding a finger down on
the screen and then tilting the phone
left or right it's definitely not a
perfect implementation but it has come
in handy in a pinch
a button made just for bringing down the
notification shade became an immediate
and lasting addition to my navigation
bar small details consistently made me
say oh that's cool in the interface like
the gallery where you can drag down to
open a quick camera interface or the
notification drop-down which has a nice
way of presenting chronologically you
received notifications and if you think
about it for a bit
elements of the emotion UI look like
what we will probably find in the
upcoming Android L forward-thinking on
Huawei's part makes this KitKat powered
Android one of the nicest iterations
even if it doesn't have an app drawer
and all of this is thema both roue built
in application though only a limited
number of themes are available in mine
at the moment of all the asian
iterations of the Android interface
emotion might be one of the best we've
used with a few key features included
that actually proved useful it's snappy
minimalism is undeniable the mate7 will
cost you a pretty penny I'll be at an
expected one of around $700 especially
when imported from the markets it is
currently available in North American
users still have to wait for their
release but Huawei has expressed a
strong desire to move into more Western
markets obvious competitors for the
mate7 are large form factor phones but
we have to put into consideration the
quad HD behemoths that simply overpower
the mate and screen resolution but in
all other respects Huawei has proven
that they can stand elbow to elbow with
the rest and so their habits the huawei
ascend made 7 the biggest offering from
Huawei in more ways than one
after some really solid mid-range
offerings we're happy to see while we
succeed in the flagship space showing
off how they do fingerprint scanning in
particular but their Android iteration
is certainly no slouch and proves to be
a snappy pleasing experience as well
even the in-house processing package
brings the performance you want with a
battery life big phone where users
require if you want to get the most out
of the mate 7 setting up the finger P
reader is a must and then you'll find
that it's quickness and ease of use
permeates throughout the phone well -
the large size but given the direction
the smartphone flagship market has been
going we're not surprised that while we
put everything into their latest and
greatest and their success is exactly
why we give it the editors choice award
for making it crystal clear that Huawei
is actually a real threat to the
current smartphone Kings in the game
today as always thank you guys very much
for watching and I hope you enjoyed this
review of the huawei ascend mate 7 I
still feel the same way today as I did
back at Aoife in Berlin when I first set
up that fingerprint scanner I think it's
a wonderful iteration and I wouldn't be
surprised if we see it on more phones to
come in any case stay tuned to Android
