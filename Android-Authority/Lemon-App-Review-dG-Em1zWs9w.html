Authority and today we've got an app
review for you and this is a pretty
simple app it's called lemon and it
scans receipts and stores the
information from the receipts one main
feature of this is that it will take the
data from their seats and just basically
categorize them so it it's like a
scanner think of as a scanner it will
scan the information all those smart
scanners that are understanding
information and actually digitally input
it into the memory here so you can
create an account for you so you can
store secured receipts one thing is
lemon has a pricing plan it's free to
get the app but it's also $7.99 a month
if you want if you want personalized at
lemon calm shipping let me calm shipping
address unlimited storage like that
stuff you can only have a hundred
receipts a month on the freshmen and you
can have unlimited and the sixteen
dollars a month for it I think it's kind
of irrelevant to have 16 oz a month just
for scanning receipts ok that's kind of
a little too far-fetched I mean what do
people take a world of warcraft that
money i mean come on but enough about
silly games let's get into the app I've
got a I've got a few on here but I'm
going to show you something when I scan
the receipt here though you will see
black for you because I am doing a
screencast which it doesn't allow me to
use my camera at the same time but you
will be able to see the overall picture
when I'm done with it here we go
all right I'm just gonna get my receipt
ready no he's going on right now I'm
gonna kind of cheat on this because I
got a few and I get a little bit of
information on here that would not
really love to share with people as you
can see here's an image and just make
sure your thing your your part is on the
edge you see where the blue lines were
before it will say you make sure you're
on the edge of the receipt and if you
get a longer seat you can add something
called parts which will be on the bottom
here but if you have a shorter receipt I
had a longer seat but if you destroy
receipt just click the finish button
it'll be brought to a page where you can
add labels I'm use it for personal use
cash pay with cash and you can do a new
label one downfall of this app is
creating a new label like a custom label
for me it really glitches my app up and
it's really unstable so they really have
to do fix this app there's a few bugs in
it when that's one of them after you're
done with that you can save it and okay
so finally it did something it will take
a long time for it to store the
information so it will basically take
the the information from the app and add
it to the device so here's one that it
got from Best Buy and it gives me
information on that's cool and it will
see your receipt is being processed the
image is available now and so will be
check back in a few it will say this
okay so see on a couple of my things
it's this check back in a few minutes it
will then turn is it like the thing just
like Best Buy and then it will do
something else where it scans yet so it
does take more than a few minutes to
check product half hour 45 minutes for
me on that one and as you can see am i
automatically went back to the homepage
because on the lemon app because it's a
glitch that's on here the about that
thing to fix
as you can see there's my app right
there I'm in my a mercy anyway
but this app is really good the
downfalls of it I was gonna say that it
wasn't storing the app but I guess I
mean the receipt if wanna keep it same
out I guess it wasn't storing the
receipt and that's why I was gonna say
it was bad app but I actually think that
it's doing well just the one downfall of
it is it takes a long time for destroyed
the receipt probably cuz I had a lot of
information on there probably takes 10
minutes tops for a small and small
receipts but that took around 25 minutes
20 minutes so what would I get this out
of 5 stars
whole D 3.5 wouldn't give it quite a 4
yet takes a long time for the receipts
to scan and the bugs in there are pretty
ignorant and the labels are cool but
besides that I think it's a great app so
if you're doing taxes or whatever you're
organizing receipts it's a great app for
you and I really recommend this app for
anybody that's looking for that type of
capability now once again my name is
