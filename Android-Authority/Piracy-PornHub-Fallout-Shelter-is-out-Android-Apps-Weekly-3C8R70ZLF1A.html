show is brought to you by space climb
hello bogan ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe
handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to another episode of
Android apps weekly let's get right into
those headlines a few weeks back we
talked about how google map maker was
making a comeback this week we're
finally starting to see it roll out to
select markets along with the new
moderation tools put in place to prevent
pranksters from messing things up once
again piracy has been a problem on
android for a while and occasionally
developers like to fire back against
those that are stealing their property
this week noodle cake decided to take
action and upload a tweaked apk that
made the third-level
impossible to beat if the game was
pirated despite the 89% piracy rate
noodle cake is taking it all in stride
and you know what good for them nyan
techlabs the development team
responsible for the hit game ingress has
announced that they are becoming a
company independent of Google and
they're taking ingress and their other
application called field trip along with
them this doesn't mean much for players
and users of the applications but hey
congratulations to Niantic labs pornhub
one of the premiere porn streaming sites
out there is thinking of going legit
they're working on a streaming service
akin to Netflix which will include a
paid subscription service along with a
few applications the application will of
course never make it to Google Play so
parents will have to worry about their
kids stumbling onto that one last up
this week Google has announced a new
initiative called Android experiments
this is a little thing where app
developers who do something special and
unique can be promoted directly by
Google there's a website and the whole
nine yards and it should yield some
interesting results for even more
Android apps and games news don't forget
to check out this week's newsletter
which is linked in the video description
below there you'll find all the
headlines updates and new releases that
we didn't have time for this week if
you're so inclined you can also sign up
using your email address and we'll send
all of this information straight to your
inbox every single Friday well we're at
it you can also find us on twitter i'm
proud to announce that my replacement
shield tablet is in and i can stream
normally again we will be streaming
Sunday Monday and Tuesday at 4 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time we'll have that
link to our twitch channel linked in the
video description below and I hope to
see all of you there ok folks let's take
a look at the applications that made a
big splash this week as usual if you
want to check any of these apps or games
out we'll have those links in the video
description below
last passes a world-renowned password
manager and this last week the
application got a huge update before you
used to have to pay a subscription just
to use it on mobile those days are now
gone as LastPass is now free to use for
all mobile users there's still a
subscription if you want cross-platform
syncing to your computer but if you want
something just for your phone this is an
amazing option for password management
give it a shot
focus is a new gallery application that
is no joke it's smooth and clean with an
easy access to literally every single
image on your device it has a host of
organizational options to keep your
photos inline and provide a truly smooth
experience if you fork out the money for
the premium version you'll have advanced
tagging so you can organize all of your
photos even more a dark theme and plenty
of other features I have it on good
authority from the developer that Google
Photos will also be supported eventually
in an upcoming updates it's definitely
worth your time if you want to try it
out dream the fly is a new application
that warps your photographs it's based
around the deep dream project that
Google had going to show people how
neural networks actually work and using
that premise it terms your photos into
something that looks like it belongs on
the cover of the next tool album it's
really quite entertaining although your
results will vary as there are some
release date bugs that have been quite
ironed out yet at least it's free to use
tunnel vision is one of a few new
applications out of Google creative labs
that came out earlier this week this one
is an application that allows you to
record your surroundings but instead of
taking pictures or video it adds a
number of filters to the images to give
it a little bit of flair it works pretty
well and it's an open source application
so developers can contribute to it as
they please it's free and it's a fun
little application last and certainly
not least this week is fallout shelter
Android fans have been chomping at the
bit to get their hands on this one since
it was announced at e3 and it has
finally been released this game is
closer to a simulation that an actual
Fallout game but Bethesda has managed to
make it a whole lot of fun and
entertaining enough to where we don't
really care you'll build a vault play
matchmaker to your dwellers and explore
the wasteland it's a lot of fun and it's
free-to-play
thanks again for watching the Android
apps weekly show everybody but let's get
down to some serious business this
week's episode is sponsored by space
climb space climb is a fun little time
waster game that's difficult and the
same kind of wait flappy bird is the
idea is you drag your finger across the
board to move the little icon and hopes
to avoid hitting the balls while also
collecting coins it is tougher than it
looks
and you can keep going if you fail if
you don't mind watching and video ad or
paying
some coins you can also earn more coins
by connecting to Facebook and there are
Google Play games achievements which is
also really nice it's free to play so
why not give it a shot and show your
support for the Android apps weekly show
