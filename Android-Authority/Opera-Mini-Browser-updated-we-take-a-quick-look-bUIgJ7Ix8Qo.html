handy the Android authority app guy
Opera Mini browser received a huge
update recently that seemed to change
just about everything about the
application and we're gonna take a quick
look at it in this video
opera minis new design is both clean and
functional although it does take a
moment to get used to the omni bars at
the top along with a plus symbol for
adding bookmarks the bottom houses the
menu button which is just the Opera
tab controls any button to take you to
the speed dial feature and back and
forward buttons inside the menu you'll
see data savings but more on that here
in a minute
below that you'll see four buttons for
history find in page functionality a
share button and a button that closes
all of your tabs you can also access
your downloads and app settings below
that in the settings you'll be able to
change the app layout depending on your
preferences determine new tab behaviors
change text size access full screen
features and some advanced features like
cookies text wrap protocol and network
test to see if you have a functioning
connection overall it's actually quite
nice as opera puts a lot of controls in
a relatively small amount of space and
made them large and noticeable enough to
find easily that's something that other
browsers could definitely learn from
along with the application comes a data
compression feature that attempts to
minimize how much data you use when you
browse the web in many cases it's highly
functional and we managed to use about
ten percent of the data we would have
using other browsers operas data
compression system is very aggressive
which should help those who live in
areas with slower network connections
because they will be loading pages that
are a smaller size the compression
almost certainly helps those uncapped
data plans to save more data the speed
dial feature has been president operas
main browser for a while and Opera Mini
is no different the speed dial allows
you to set up sites you go to frequently
she can get there very quickly you can
also find your bookmarks sites you save
for offline reading and even a somewhat
customizable newsfeed to keep you caught
up on whatever kind of news you enjoy
during our testing we visited 50 web
sites in total and all 50 of them loaded
relatively quickly if you had some
graphical and text formatting issues
that are likely a result of hoppers data
compression but at no point at the
website ceased to function as they
should if you larger web sites may load
more slowly than expected but there were
very few instances where it was so slow
that it was annoying also included in
the update or private tabs similar to
Google Chrome's incognito mode you can
also swipe to close tabs swipes delete
bookmarks and swipe up to search here's
what we liked about the new Opera Mini
the new UI
revamp is clean and functional and even
somewhat customizable the data
compression feature actually saves you
quite a bit of data bookmarks can be
synced across devices and that also
includes computers so it's up-to-date
with other things like Chrome and
Firefox
the speed dial feature is as useful as
ever and here's what we didn't like so
much the occasional graphical glitches
on websites likely from data compression
can get a little annoying sometimes some
of the larger sites may still load
slowly despite being compressed and
there doesn't appear to way to turn data
compression off if you want the full web
experience overall this is a positive
update for Opera Mini it brings a lot of
the features and looks from operas
full-fledged browser and the performance
is still very good the data compression
is fantastic and very well may help
those with limited data plans and
connections with the new features and
looks Opera Mini is now brought up to
date with current browser options which
is only a good thing if you want to
check it out so we'll have the link for
you in the video description below
