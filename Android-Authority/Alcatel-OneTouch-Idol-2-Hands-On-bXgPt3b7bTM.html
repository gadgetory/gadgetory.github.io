by bitdefender mobile security we don't
often present a lot of budget devices
but we definitely have them on our radar
and at MWC one of them really caught our
eye a charge of a guard from Andhra
Authority what's going on everybody and
this is the Alcatel OneTouch Idol to
perhaps what struck us most about the
idol 2 was its decisive look you may not
be able to tell that this phone comes in
at the sub 200 range but it exudes good
style and build quality right off the
bat the 5-inch screen makes for a device
that can sit right alongside many flag
ships and with what we can call a
classic shape in its form factor the
phone rests easily in the hand without
much fuss at all the plastic on the back
is not glossy helping it keep from
getting riddled with fingerprints
overall it's a slightly understated look
which helps with its overall charm the
fact that this phone is incredibly light
is also a big plus as well the display
is a 720p performer that makes the
colors pop out quite well and as an IPS
screen its brightness is more than
adequate underneath the surface a
quad-core MediaTek processor helps the
phone perform with its 1.2 gigahertz and
one gigabyte of RAM helps with
multitasking now these are definitely
lower specs than we might be used to
these days with all of the snapdragons
out there but while we might have seen a
little bit of a difference in the
performance comparatively it wasn't a
deal-breaker as the phone is still
capable of getting plenty done without
any problems a gigabytes of internal
storage are available but a micro SD
card slot makes up for the lack of space
and with the lower overall
specifications we would not be surprised
if the two thousand milliamp hour
battery is able to power the idle 2 for
a whole day and perhaps more now 8
megapixels is what you get to work with
on the rear camera and though the app is
pretty simplistic without that many
bells and whistles it's sure to work for
anyone just looking to get a quick shot
or even just a simple Instagram post as
was mentioned before there were no real
problems with lag in our time with the
idol 2 software and with an update to
Android 4.4 KitKat in the works we are
sure it will only get better for this
nice budget offering coming in at sub
200 euros the price in the West will
likely be around 200 as well whenever it
finally makes it stateside hopefully
that will be sooner than later as this
budget phone deserves more attention for
its a good build it's good looks and
more than adequate performance thank you
for watching our MWC coverage and stay
tuned to andrew authority because we're
