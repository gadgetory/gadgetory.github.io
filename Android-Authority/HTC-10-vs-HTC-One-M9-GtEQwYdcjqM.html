a company has made in a while hello
everybody I'm crystal Ora and this is
HTC 10 versus the HTC One m9 there's
only been little changes made to the
flagship of HTC this year but these
small tweaks really go a long way both
phones are made from a very high-grade
aluminum and have a nice curve on the
back but we no longer have a brushed
metallic finish on the HTC 10 which
makes it look a lot cleaner and sleeker
there's a huge chamfered edge running
around the border which has been a
little controversial but once you see
the 10 in person chances are you'll end
up loving it because it reflects light
and adds a little pop to it the camera
on the temperatures a bit more than the
one found in the m9 but it ends up
taking less space overall and there's
also a lot less branding and text going
on thanks to the new FSC guidelines
which helps a10 look even less cluttered
as we turn the phones over to their
fronts once again you have a much more
simple design with the HTC 10 yes the
HTC One m9 that we have is a gold model
but even if you were to get the phone in
a different color the front top and
bottom bezels are never a true black but
this year HTC decided to make the top
and bottom bezels black regardless of
the style of the back and that really
just helps blend everything in and give
a bigger focus to the display the one m9
had a large black border around the
display along with a black HTC bezel
wedged between the screen and the bottom
bezel and even though the TENS bezels
are similar in size the unified coloring
almost makes them appear smaller than
the m9 s the buttons on both phones can
be found on the right side and even
though the m9 had a great textured power
button the tens power buttons texturized
pattern is much more exaggerated and
really helps the user find the button
just using your finger all the buttons
on the m9 set a little too flush to the
body but with the 10 they have much more
tactile feedback and they need a good
push to be triggered other than that the
phones feel almost identical to one
another the 10 is ever so slightly
taller and wider but this is to make
more room for the point 2 millimeter
larger screen the 10 is also a little
thinner at 9 millimeters versus 9.6
but it's a little heavier both phones
have some of the best build quality and
they feel great in the hand but when it
comes to aesthetics the 10 is miles
ahead when it comes to display it has
been greatly improved on the 10 this
year and on top of that we get a
slightly larger one too at 5.2 inches
versus the 5 inch on the one m9 both our
LCD panels but with the 10 we have the
newer Super LCD 5 technology over the
Super LCD 3 found on the m9 the panel
itself is a little tougher too thanks to
the Gorilla Glass 4 instead of 3 and of
course
HTC has finally given quad HD a chance
with the HTC 10 but it does make sense
at the one m9 stuck with only a 1080p
display with a smaller 5-inch screen and
you won't really notice any extra
sharpness really with a 10 over the m9
but what you will notice though is the
overall quality of the displays the tens
is much more enjoyable the m9 display is
very cool and almost has a greenish hue
to it which looks very unappealing the
TENS is much more warmer and is able to
get a lot closer to true White's colors
are also crazy vibrant on the HTC 10
almost as close as a saturation of a
galaxy phone and with the m9 not only is
a much more dull than the 10 but it's
one of the dullest displays of a 2015
smartphone with the 10 being one of the
best LCD displays we've seen and the m9
being one of the worst it's very easy to
pick a winner here now it's hardware
this is an area where HTC has removed a
lot of key features in order to help
with the HTC 10 design first it's not
really a feature it's more the way the
hardware's design but the vibration on
the 10 is crazy loud it's one of the
loudest vibration motors on a phone you
can love within most volume settings the
m9 s is much quieter but very strong
it's definitely worth noting now if you
take a look at the top of these phones
you'll see the absence of an IR blaster
on the 10 which is a trend that we've
been seeing on recent smartphones with
the m9 you can control televisions sound
systems cable boxes and more right from
your phone but a lot of people use this
which is why it has been removed and
remember how I was saying that HTC tends
front is much cleaner and nicer looking
than the m9 s well there is a major
downside to this being the boom sound
front-facing stereo
speaker grilles on the m9 these speakers
are one of the things that made HTC
phone stand out the sound quality is
incredible with the m9 they're very
crisp and clear while still having a lot
of bass to them they're dual
front-facing as well which creates a
very balanced listening experience when
watching videos and they're aimed right
at you know better speakers are found on
the phone the 10 also has what HTC calls
boomsound speakers and they do sound
nice but they don't come close to the
quality of the m9 there is one huge
hardware Edition though with the 10 and
that is a fingerprint scanner it's
located at the bottom of the device
under the screen and it's actually one
of the best scanners I've used it's very
fast but more importantly it's reliable
it's a great way to secure your device
without adding any extra hassle like on
the m9 you'll have to resort to
passwords patterns or other ways to keep
your phone secure which can get annoying
when you're doing it dozens of times per
day on either side of the scanner we
have capacitive back and recent apps
buttons instead of on-screen buttons
like on the m9 which gives you just that
much more screen real estate performance
is a huge step up on the HTC 10 which is
expected with your typical 2016 flagship
specs we got a Snapdragon 820 versus a
10 Adreno 530 versus 430 and 4 gigs of
ram vs 3 now the one m9 is using the
a-10 which is a great processor but
unfortunately it uses an older version
of it allowing the m9 to get
uncomfortably hot at times which
cripples performance even more with both
phones at low temperatures I threw some
Geekbench benchmark tests on them to see
how they rank up with one another and
the 10 scores much higher in single and
multi-core rankings games load way
faster on the 10 they have smooth
playback you're just going to be a lot
less frustrated using the HTC 10 with
this fast performance now a battery life
is actually pretty similar on each
there's a slight boost with a 10 with a
116 million power larger battery but
that larger battery has to deal with the
higher resolution display so on both
you're looking at an average of about 4
to 4 hours and 20 minutes of screen on
time per day you should easily expect
both phones to last you an entire day
now when you charge at the end of the
day you'll have a better time with the
10 thanks to the addition of USB type-c
software is another night and day
difference between these phones both
phones are running Android marshmallow
however just by looking at the m9 you
would think this was a phone running
Android 4.4 KitKat the HTC 10 follows
almost all material design guidelines in
fact the entire pulldown menu is the
same pull down menu find on the stock
Android device with some added features
the recent apps screen is also almost
similar to stock Android and so is the
settings menu now yes a lot of users
love a stock Android look and feel but
of course not all users are going to
like it and a lot of om skins on Android
look nothing like stock but are still
quite good however with the HTC One m9
it's the opposite HTC Sense on the m9 is
a great skin and it's loaded with
features but aesthetically it looks very
cluttered and unappealing and the
pulldown notification shade looks the
same but with huge shortcut icons with
text and all capital letters which
actually makes some of the settings
names cut off the recent apps screen on
the m9 looks to be pretty much the same
when we found an Android KitKat and it
works very well but it definitely looks
outdated
Sense is also a lot less bloated with a
10 there's no silly games or other
sponsored apps which are things that you
will definitely find all throughout the
m9 but feature wise both phones are very
similar with lockscreen shortcuts theme
store and blinkfeed
which is a page for all your social
media lists all in one neatly organized
page or you can quickly see what's going
on in your world HTC Sense overall is a
great take on Android on both phones but
design wise the HTC 10 once again is
miles ahead camera was one of the most
disappointing features of the m9
especially when it came to lower lit
photos we got 20 megapixels with an
aperture of 2.2 and no optical image
stabilization the 10 goes with the 2016
camera setup that we're seeing on almost
every flagship now of 12 megapixels with
larger pixel size 1.8 aperture and
optical image stabilization in outdoors
there are some great improvements with
the 10 adding some extra color a bit
more contrast and images appear to be
sharper with more detail even with less
megapixels the m9 appears to be a lot
softer smudging away those details and
there also seems to be a bit of a haze
on top of the
Nine's photos with the n9 also being
prone to overexposure the HTC ten does
overexpose in certain areas though but
compared to the m9 it's much better at
handling bright areas HDR is also much
better with the ten even if it looks a
little unnatural now there's a huge
difference when it comes to low-light
photos the n9 has a slower shutter speed
and that mixed with the lack of optical
image stabilization creates very blurry
photos human with the studies of hands
it loses all detail has a lot more grain
and its colors suffer as well turning on
HDR usually helps phone cameras take
better low-light photos but it gets even
worse with the m9 it takes a long time
to stitch together the shot so every
time you'll end up with an even blur
your image and the image will be way too
bright interesting enough the HTC One
m-9s front-facing four megapixel camera
is actually a lot better than the tens
five megapixel one you'll get a lot more
detail on the m9 and that's thanks to
its ultra pixel technology with the
pixel size on this sensor being very
large it exposes a lot better has a bit
extra contrast and its colors are very
vibrant the 10 selfie cam does have one
thing going for it though and that's
optical image stabilization which is a
first for smartphone selfie camera so
video recording is much smoother which
is helpful for things like vlogging the
TENS video also destroys the m9 mostly
thanks to the addition of optical image
stabilization this shot is very study
compared to the jerky video of the m9
also the m9 s-video just seems to be a
little too dark to enjoy now the HTC 10
isn't going to blow anybody away it
lacks that one huge feature that most
other flagships have but in almost every
department the 10 blows the HTC One m9
out of the water the screen has better
colors brightness and resolution the
design is much sleeker the software is
toned down less bloated we have a new
fingerprint scanner and the camera
produces pictures you can be proud of so
sure you lose a great quality of the m9
s front-facing boomsound speakers but
I'm sure the majority of users won't
mind if that's what it takes to create a
phone that's years ahead of the m9 well
that is it for this comparison video
