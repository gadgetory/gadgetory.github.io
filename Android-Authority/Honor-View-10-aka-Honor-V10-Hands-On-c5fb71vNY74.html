update to the 6x which helped them make
a name for themselves in the US well
that device is more than a little
compelling if you thought that was the
best honor phone that you could get your
hands on you'd be mistaken meet the
honour v10 the v10 looks pretty similar
to the 7x on the outside there's a lot
going on under the hood it's using
Wally's flagship Kirin 970 octa-core
processor and a 12 core Mally g72 GPU so
it's gonna tear through any
multi-threaded workload that you throw
at it it's got six gigs of RAM and 128
gigs of storage standard and those are
respects you'd normally only expect to
see on something like the huawei mate 10
that's pretty impressive for an honor
phone Oh that'd be in the name yeah
apparently that stands for view we asked
them what the naming scheme actually
meant while we're at the event and they
told us that that five point nine nine
inch 18 by nine display symbolized a new
view for both the consumer and the
company seeing as the honor 7x also has
an 18 by 9 display this confused me a
little bit but I digress still that
screen looks good and I'm not turned off
by 1080p the bigger screen does demand a
bigger battery but I feel like honor
really hit the mark with this one it's
packing at 37 15 milliamp hour battery
which should help last a full day and
hopefully some more but we'll have to do
some more in-depth testing in our full
review the cameras are also
significantly improved over the 7x it's
using dual 16 and 20 megapixel shooters
with an ultra wide aperture range let's
go from F point nine five two f-16 this
should let you get some really nice
depth of field out of this thing the
front-facing camera is actually pretty
good too it's got a resolution of 13
megapixels and we're gonna do some
further testing down the road to see
just how well it compares to other
flagships on the market today the
cameras got all those fancy effects just
like it's got in the 7x like moving
pictures monochrome slow-motion just to
name a few we haven't had enough time
with this to really test out its
capabilities but it seemed like we got
some pretty good shots with it at the
event the i/o is not really slashing
either you've got USB see a rear firing
speaker front-facing fingerprint sensor
and yeah a headphone jack that's rare
for flagship these days
it's also got dual SIM trays and a micro
SD card slot so you can always get more
storage if you fill up those 128 gigs
the v10 is gonna ship running emui 8.0
which is based on android 8 for you
you're not gonna have to worry about
missing out on the latest and greatest
Android has to offer it's gonna be
available in navy blue and midnight
black so yeah no gold this time around
at least I launched honor hasn't
announced pricing or availability for
this phone but we're guessing it's gonna
be pretty competitive considering honors
history and we think it'll probably
launch in q1 of 2018 make sure you stay
tuned to Android authority for all the
latest on the v10 as it hits keep tuned
to our social sites for all the latest
on Android Google and beyond because of
course we are your source for all things
