android authority and i'm coming to you
live from e3 2015 and today is day 2 and
as you can see behind me the show is
basically wrapping up for today but what
i wanted to talk about today was project
morpheus it was my first time trying
this VR headset by Sony obviously it's
been around for a while now but this is
my first time being able to use it and
my prior experiences with VR have
included things like the gear VR with
oculus rift and just the lgb our headset
so I've never really tried a VR
experience as immersive as project
Morpheus so I just sort of wanted to
give you guys my thoughts on it but
basically the game that I got to play
was called rigs where you're inside a
giant robot sort of like titanfall on
xbox and you basically get to walk
around and shoot other players or the
missiles and guns it's really awesome
you can run extremely fast jump
extremely high so a lot of really cool
stuff you can do it was a awesome
experience with private Morpheus the
resolution isn't that great that's the
only downside I would say but it's still
a really awesome experience to be able
to just sort of look around be inside a
giant robot and just shoot other players
and the whole point of the game was to
collect a bunch of different orbs and
you basically take those orbs and jump
inside a goal and that's how you score
the majority of your points and
obviously the other players on the game
will try to stop you from doing that so
they will shoot at you and you obviously
will have to defend yourself it's one of
the best VR experiences that I've had to
date so I sort of wanted to give you
guys with my thoughts on project
Morpheus I'm so happy that I got to
check it out it was fantastic I had to
wait in line a really long time it was
about an hour maybe an hour and 30
minute wait but it was totally worth it
for the five minutes of gameplay that I
had and somehow I don't know how I did I
managed to come out in first place so
that was really cool managed to kind of
beat up a bunch of other players and
score a few goals so that was really
awesome and another part about project
Morpheus I just want to mention
quickly is that the experience with this
particular game all the aiming and the
movement was actually done with your
head it took a little bit of getting
used to to be able to aim with their
head because it was extremely sensitive
it only took maybe a couple minutes to
sort of get the hang of things though
but other than that it was sort of very
smooth and seamless experience and I
really had a lot of fun with it so
hopefully I'll be able to check it out
and get a little bit more experience
with it but this is just my reaction to
project Morpheus and there's definitely
a lot more to come here at e3 we also
have tomorrow and we also have a ton
more content to come from today so make
sure to check that out and again thank
you guys so much for watching I keep it
soon here to Andhra thority because we
are your source for all things android
and e3 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
