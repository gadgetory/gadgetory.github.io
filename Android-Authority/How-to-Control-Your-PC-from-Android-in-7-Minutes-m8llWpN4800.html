a gtx 1070 graphics card so it can play
all of the latest games on Ultra
settings and it has a terabyte of
storage so I can keep all of my music
and videos in one place the only slight
problem is it's upstairs
and I'm down here fortunately technology
is all about finding creative ways to be
lazy as it would happen there are a ton
of different ways you can stream your PC
to an Android device that means you can
access documents it means you can play
games and you can do all this from
anywhere in the house or even outside of
the house and it's much easier than you
might think - in fact I'm going to show
you how you can do all that in just
seven minutes so yeah in just seven
minutes I'm going to show you how you
can access any app or file on your PC
via your phone I'm gonna show you how to
constrain Steam games so you can play
The Witcher 3 from anywhere I'm gonna
show you how you can use your phone as a
controller a media controller so you can
pause and stop your playback and I'm
gonna show you how you can wake your PC
from anywhere in the house or even
outside of the house via an app that's
right seven minutes let's go to the
first and most basic thing you're gonna
want to do is to stream your desktop to
your android device there are a few apps
that can help you do this such as
TeamViewer but the one I'm gonna be
recommending is called Splashtop remote
- so to get this up and running it's
actually very simple and easy first of
all you need to take the host device
that's the computer and you need to
navigate to the website and download the
streamer then on your Android device
you're going to head over to the Play
Store and you're going to download the
Splashtop remote - app and once that's
all installed open up the app on your
phone and make sure it's also open on
your PC and you should be able to see a
list of all your devices on your home
network click the one you want to
connect to and that way you can remote
stream your desktop or even access the
camera for a little bit of spying
so Splashtop remote 2 is great for
streaming a range of apps and media but
what about for gaming for gaming lag
becomes more of an issue and for that
reason you might want to try a different
app called remote rrah or remote or
remote and then are this is basically an
app that allows you to stream from Steam
so as long as a game is added to steam
or you installed it through Steam then
you'll be able to stream it straight to
your
not only is it quicker and lower latency
but you'll also have access to on-screen
controls or you can use an additional
controller so you will need a Steam
account but as long as that's installed
on your computer then the process is
very simple to setup in fact it's very
similar to Splashtop you need to
download the software on the host side
on the pc and you need to get the app on
the Play Store for your Android device
once you've installed both those things
it's just a matter of connecting to the
home network and then you'll see a list
of your computers that are available
through the app click the one you want
to use select the game from the game
library and you're good to go okay so
how about a different scenario let's say
you're enjoying a bit of Netflix and
chill on the sofa downstairs with your
partner and you're casting from your PC
upstairs you want to pause it so you can
go and make a cup of tea but that means
going all the way upstairs and hitting
pause on the computer and that is just
far too much hard work wouldn't it be
great if you could use your Android
device to just pause play resume skip
etc well if you might have guessed there
is an app that let you do this it's
called unified remote and setting it up
couldn't be easier in fact it's pretty
much the exact same process as it has
been for the last two basically you just
need to navigate your PC over to the
unified remote website and download this
server on the host side and for the app
you'll get that from the Play Store and
install it on your Android device okay
so we're doing pretty well but you
haven't achieved full laziness just yet
because at the moment whilst we control
our PC for my phone
we still need to turn it on manually we
still need to go all the way upstairs
turn on the power button and then come
all the way back downstairs and that's
just not okay fortunately there is a way
around this and it's called wake-on-lan
and basically what this means is that as
long as your computer is plugged into an
Ethernet port and in a low powered state
it can listen out for a magic packet
sent over the home network and use this
as a trigger to turn on when we want it
to first of all like I say you're going
to need an Ethernet connection the
computer needs to be plugged in to a
wired internet connection if you don't
happen to have an Ethernet port in the
same room as your PC don't worry there
is a way around this you can use
something called a powerline adapter I'm
using one called tp-link and it works
just fine for wake-on-lan you can even
get a USB type-c adapter for Ethernet so
that you can plug your smartphone
straight into the wall for a much more
stable connection and this
is great for better performance when
you're using something like core imatra
so to set this up on the PC side first
need to boot into the BIOS once in there
you can normally find the setting to
allow wake-on-lan fairly easily it
should be under security or advanced or
something like that okay next we're
going to need permission from Windows to
do this you're going to open up your
device manager now expand the network
adapters section right-click on your
network card and select properties then
go to the Advanced tab then scroll all
the way down and click enable on wake on
magic packet finally click power
management and then make sure you've
ticked the boxes that say allow the
device to wake the computer and only
allow a magic packet to wake the
computer once you've done all that put
the computer in sleep mode and then
you're going to head over and download a
wake-on-lan app on your mobile device
just install that app open it up and you
should see all the computers connected
to your home network listed click the
one you want to wake and if everything
has gone well your computer should boot
up from sleep as if by magic as if by
magic packet but some of you might be
wondering if there's any way you can do
this remotely let's say that you're in a
coffee shop or at work and you realize
that you've forgotten an important file
that you need for the day ahead so using
the Wi-Fi in the coffee shop or your 4G
connection is there any way that you can
wake your computer up back home and then
send that file over via Dropbox or Gmail
well of course there is otherwise that
would have been a pointless bit of
schpeel so this is going to use
something called port forwarding with
port forwarding what you're basically
doing is sending a message to your
router back home and you're reto is then
forwarding that magic packet on to the
computer that you want to wake so to set
this up you're going to need to access
the advanced settings of your router
normally you do this by pointing your
browser towards a specific address and
you should be able to find that address
on the leaflet that came with your
router if you've lost this and why
wouldn't you have then give your
broadband provider a call because you
might also need a password or if you
just need the address then look online
so each of your devices have their own
private IP addresses and then your
router has a public IP address and
that's the address that the outside
world sees every now and then your
Rooter will change the IP address of the
private devices on your network and it
does this via a process called DHCP or
dynamic host
configuration protocol of course if you
want to wake up your device then you
can't have its address changing all the
time because you wouldn't be able to
find it and that's why we need to set it
as static IP so find the DHCP section of
your control panel and then you're going
to want to set yourself a reserved rule
for the device that you want to wake up
so find your device listed and then tick
it and then normally you'll just click
Add rule or something like that and then
you should see it listed with a static
IP address and MAC address and at this
point I also want you to write those
down because you're gonna need them
later on okay the next thing you're
gonna want to do is to set up the port
forwarding and this basically means that
your Rooter is gonna listen out for the
specific message and it's gonna send
that on to the correct IP address so
find the port forwarding section in this
control panel and then enter the
following details so for the local IP
address you're going to enter that IP
address that you just noted down for the
local start poor and port an external
start port end port you're going to
enter nine for the protocol you're going
to select both and where it says enabled
you of course want to set that to on
once that set up you just need to find
an app that supports one wall I'm using
one called wall on to open up the app
and then hit the plus button to add a
new device so if the computer name just
use a computer name for your own
reference under the MAC address just use
the MAC address that you wrote down
earlier under route to IP or hostname
you're going to use your public IP and
if you don't know what that is then go
to Google and search from what is my IP
it should be the first thing that comes
up for port you're going to choose 9
again and then just click Save and
you're done
and with that done you should now be
able to wait your computer from anywhere
