a lot of mid-range phones for a lot of
these companies and LG in particular had
the big form factor small and then the
tiny and now we're at the Samsung booth
and we're like taking a look at the
smallest of the galaxy line this is the
galaxy young so to charge of Agartha
mentoring authority what's going on
everybody and as I said this is the
Samsung Galaxy young I suppose young is
a nice way to put it because this is
actually the smallest one that they have
on display over here it is a 3.2 7 inch
display and look how cramped that is I
did do a review of the s3 mini the
galaxy s3 mini and it was honestly a
very nice phone but it looks like
they're even going a little farther or
further with the size of the galaxy
young and the specs underneath not a
whole lot to really be excited about
when it comes to the hardware underneath
you have a 1 gigahertz processor with
always 768 megabytes of RAM the battery
is 1,300 milliamp hours and if the
Galaxy s3 mini was any indication you're
gonna get quite a lot of battery life
out of this because the in the internals
don't need to be powered by such a large
battery there's a 3 megapixel camera on
the back not necessarily the best that
you're going to find on any phone but
then again that's kind of what we expect
here one cool thing about it though is
that we're seeing that a lot of these
mid-range to lower tier phones have
Android 4.1 jelly bean on them which is
actually pretty cool
you don't have to settle for an earlier
version of Android you can still get
some of the best that Android has to
offer in the slightly slightly older but
still new version of jelly bean so
that's just the Samsung Galaxy young let
me just show you what it looks like in
the hand this is my left hand even and I
have no problems gripping this or even
feeling like it's going to be slipping
out of my hand it does still have that
pretty pretty trademark Samsung classic
you feel this silver lining over on the
sides
easy to get to literally any part of the
phone just from a neutral grip so
there's really no problem on the
handling there so if tiny phones are
kind of your forte that the samsung
galaxy young kinda has what you need and
jump cut to the Samsung Galaxy fame
which is the very slightly larger
version of the Samsung Galaxy young it
really does look like they're trying to
fulfill every single sort of size of
smartphone so Samsung is really going
all out to make sure that every single
person out there has a phone for them
that being said you have a 3.5 inch very
minimal increase from the Samsung Galaxy
young here in the galaxy fame it is an H
VGA screen just like the spread just
like it's the little brother which makes
it 480 by 320 resolution what kind of
going through the screen there as you
can see you just get a little cramped
but to each their own again you have the
one gigahertz processor underneath this
time only 512 megabytes of RAM which is
a little odd because this is the site of
our gerb phone but the samsung galaxy
young the smaller one has more RAM which
is a little bit weird but anyway coming
over to the back here you have the 5
megapixel camera it's a VGA on
eg a camera on the front as well and a
13 million power battery inside so this
is a little bit more akin to the this is
this is getting closer and closer to the
Samsung Galaxy s3 mini that we saw a
little while back but nonetheless this
is a sort of the second of four
different phones that take the galaxy
name and all our other different size so
kind of taking a look at these phones so
once again this is the Samsung Galaxy
fame alright alright so we're taking a
look at these two phones and we're going
to move on to the other two so stay
tuned for more of our coverage from the
Mobile World Congress in Barcelona Spain
it's the final day so we're trying to
get out quite have got quite a quite a
bit quite as much as we can on this
final day of MWC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
