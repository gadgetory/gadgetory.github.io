what's going on everybody and every
photo and video that you're seeing in
this feature focus was taken on the
oneplus one all right and let's go ahead
and just get right into it what we're
working with here is the 13 megapixel
Sony Exmor IMX 214 sensor that provides
a F 2.0 aperture and you're going to be
seeing that kind of coming into playing
some of the pictures here but I was out
in Venice Beach just taking pictures of
the wonderful scenery around there and
you're going to see a lot of people
walking around but also the palm trees
and the sands it was just a beautiful
day out in Southern California that I
was able to use the oneplus one in order
to capture what we're going to be seeing
also are the 100 crops for here and let
me just say right off the bat that I was
actually really impressed with the
detail that is in all of these photos
especially one in broad daylight you can
really see how the noise level is at a
very acceptable level to the point where
it almost doesn't seem there at first
glance and that's a real achievement of
the oneplus one in terms of its camera
and as you can see the color
reproduction is actually quite good you
don't really see too many blown out
images in terms of the just the sheer
brightness that was coming with the Sun
bearing down on the beach but also this
is pretty much what everything looked to
like it's so it's there's a little bit
of saturation in terms of the coloration
but there really isn't so much that it
looks fake and as you can see here the
detail in this bike right here is
actually really great and it really does
justice to the scene
let's talk settings for a quick minute
the all of the photos that you're seeing
on here we're taken at the full auto
setting now the camera app provided by
CyanogenMod 11 as it does give you quite
a bit of freedom to tweak the settings
of your photos and video captures but
you are also able to cater your quick
menu swiping up and down in order to get
to the settings you want to use the most
however in this case I wanted to cater
basically to the general user that will
probably leave the camera on full auto
and just start snapping away and I think
the results really speak for themselves
these 13 megapixel 4x3 photos all have
great detail at least so far and we're
gonna take a look at some low-light
shots a little bit later but for the
most part you're gonna have a great time
just getting capturing the moments
especially in broad daylight photos like
these and you'll be really happy with a
lot of the photos that you get out of it
and putting a little bit of effort into
just a composition of your photo and one
that will really give you an even better
experience because the power is already
there and as you can see here the detail
is great you can see people behind me
are actually really clear also in that
100 crop and the 100 crops continue to
show that the detail is still there now
talking about video the intro video was
taken at 1080p on the front facing
camera and the rest of the videos that
you're seeing in this future focus
camera shoot outs were taken at 4k as
I'm always going to do the 4k to really
show you what it can do using obviously
the rear-facing camera but one thing
you'll notice on the videos is that it
sounds like only the left channel is
capturing the audio and that is true for
the life of me I can't really figure out
why but every video that I've taken with
the oneplus one only has really the left
channel available in terms of the audio
so it's a bit of a bummer there and the
audio is decent but it's only the left
channel which is something we still have
to figure out but real quick I did want
to just try to do some quick capture
there's just a cute little dog right
here you can see that the shutter speed
is maybe not fast enough to be able to
capture motion so quickly and again this
is on the auto so whether or not it was
using a sports mode is unclear here but
basically I was trying to just capture
the dog and it was a little bit tough
until I finally got him to just stand
still and then I got a decent photo of
him but it is still a little bit blurry
because we were moving
not so much
Oh light test well the night before I
went to a childish gambino concert and I
thought what better place to test out
what a low light situation would be like
I imagine if a lot of people are going
to be buying this phone they'll be using
in a bunch of different situations and
going to concerts I'm trying to capture
that moment is definitely on that list
the low-light capabilities on here are
pretty decent and I'll show you a better
example a little bit later but in these
there is a higher level of noise which
is to be expected but it does perform
pretty decently if not perfectly clearly
in capturing gambino
so for more low-light shots I was able
to get a la street dog right after the
show which you should if you ever go to
LA and watch a show or go to a concert
but you can see here that the level of
green is kind of shooting up because of
the low lights the detail is not quite
there and then I took a few last shots
back home here's an indoor shot showing
my post-its and when i zoom in yes you
can still make out what the details are
but they are just really fuzzy and
finally here's a picture of dr. oil
essentially the low-light capabilities
of the phone or the camera rather are
really decent but you're not going to be
getting too many great photos from it
and you might use the flash more often
than not but in the end it is pretty
decent but that's the most that I can
say about its low-light capabilities and
so there you have it for this camera
shootout using the cameras of the 1+1
more often than not I enjoyed the
pictures I came out of this camera and
even without the tuning rice point I
would have mini with that but then when
you think about that super affordable
price point you realize that this phone
really packs a wallop and the camera is
certainly a part of that
after that's when it comes to video you
can click the video on the left here
that you're already looking at in order
to link straight to the 4k video sample
that I have already uploaded and you can
see what the video quality is like for
yourself as far as the audio goes yes
only the left channel was was recorded
but I have a feeling that this is just
one of those kinks that they'll figure
out before the actual general release
later on it might have just been my unit
and I really think that that's the case
but until such time keep it tuned to
Android authority for all of the
coverage of the oneplus one including my
full review which is coming soon and
