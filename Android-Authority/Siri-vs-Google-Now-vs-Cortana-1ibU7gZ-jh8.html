handy the Android authority app guy and
in this video we're gonna compare
Cortana Siri and Google now before we
get started I wanted to tell you a
little bit about what I'm about to do
here I could have post-processed this
and made it look all pretty but you know
what real life isn't pretty and what's
the point of testing these things if I'm
gonna keep trying until I get the
perfect responses if it seems a bit
rough around the edges it's supposed to
be that way you don't get the
opportunity to try 20 times in real life
and pick the best one so I didn't give
them that opportunity here okay folks
this little test is going to go down in
five rounds round one is academics where
we ask some questions regarding things
like stats math and history round two
with some quick real life questions like
asking about food percentages of prices
and the news round three is real-world
interactions with music identification
directions and vents round four is
real-world tasks including reminders
emails notes and calendar usage finally
round five is a personality test where
we ask a few random questions to get
something akin to a human response
alright folks let's get right into it
okay folks this is Google now round one
okay Google what is the population of
Los Angeles California the population of
Los Angeles was three point eight eight
four million in 2013 there we go it
actually shows the source their sources
include United States Census Bureau so
that's kind of nice you know showing the
source and all that jazz I mean the
stats are a couple of years old but it
couldn't have changed that much okay
Google what is planck's constant--
no showed it for a second but I don't
know what it's doing right now keep in
mind I am running the developer whatever
software what is Planck's constant and
there it is
okay who discovered the United States
according to CNN iReport who first
discovered the United States of America
was Christopher Columbus an illegal
alien so if the question is then who
discovered what is now known as North
America then the question needs
clarification holy that's a really
good answer all right well done Google
now round wyman alright folks here is
Syria one how many home runs did Mark
McGwire hit in 1998 let me check on that
it looks like the answer is 70 all right
there we go
nice easy sports related statistics
question and it also shows a source
there from a Wolfram Alpha for those who
can't read that alright question 2 what
is the Pythagorean theorem
here's some information ok so I feel
like Google probably would have just
told me this because this is not
something that's difficult to do it's
you know a squared plus B squared equals
C squared so that should not have been
something that Siri needed to go to
Wikipedia to find out ok so for the
third question I was gonna ask a random
history question but given how good
Google now's answer was I'd like to hear
what Siri has to say about it who
discovered the United States
okay give me a moment here's weather who
discovered the United States alright and
uh it's weird cuz Google now literally
just gave us all a history lesson took
us all to school but Siri you know
brings up the the good old Wikipedia you
know yeah who answers and stuff like
that although it does say another
question is flawed you know but a little
blah so um you know discovery history
United States a subject concentrate on
remaining story so it does eventually
give you the same information though it
makes you read it yourself as opposed to
you know as opposed to doing something
else so alright so it's not too terrible
it's the end of round one for Siri okay
and here's round three with Cortana now
I don't have a Windows 10 phone but I am
given to understand that Cortana works
on all platforms evenly so I'm just
using my laptop here so we're gonna give
this a shot all right first question
what is the population of Moscow Russia
eleven point nine eight million in 2013
awesome alright so that was a better
start than expected lets us get a math
problem what is the Pythagorean theorem
alright I guess we're opening up a beam
website for that and yeah I know you're
gonna have to enter in a website to
actually see anything so that was kind
of disappointing about the same as Siri
did though so I guess I can't say too
much all right who discovered the United
States
okay so it's about the same kind of
stuff that Siri gave just some Wikipedia
links and stuff like that nothing too
fancy there a Google now definitely won
that question out of the three of them
Google now had the best answer without a
shadow of a doubt so that is round one
and let's continue to round two ok so
round two is a some real life stuff and
I still have it from the last test up
there see you guys can see that I record
this frontal Ashly okay Google what is
twenty percent of forty seven dollars
nope alright so again I'm willing to
developer something what is twenty
percent of forty seven dollars the
answer is nine point four US dollars now
this can be used for a wide range of
things you know you got 20% off a sale
at a store or you're looking to give a
decent apparently a very decent tip
little things like that you can see
right there is the tip calculator right
there includes a tip and the total
afterwards so that's kind of nice show
me some recipes for dinner
all right nothing to a special just to
web search they're showing some some
various places show me the latest news
on the Columbus Blue Jackets there we go
they gave me a web search which is good
enough you know you can go to the Blue
Jackets official site or we go whatever
have you alright so not too bad for
round two now goo again I'm running a
beta software so Google now might be a
little screwy but it you know it is
getting all the way there it is showing
me good results okay round two for Siri
let's take a what is twenty percent of
sixty seven dollars let me have a look
it looks like the answer is about
thirteen point four zero u.s. dollars
okay so it does give you the answer
again through Wolfram Alpha um now
Google now actually did a little bit
better because it did put it in context
like say you wanted to leave a tip or
something like that it does give you
that kind of context but you know if
you're shopping around you see 20% off
sixty seven dollars you know you're
going to
a $13.40 so good enough can you please
find me some recipes for dinner okay
give me a moment here's what I found on
the web for some recipes for dinner okay
pretty much right it's almost exactly
what Google would have given us so there
we go can you show me the latest news
about the Detroit Red Wings the Red
Wings Blackhawks preseason game is
September 22nd 2015 at 8:30 p.m.
it's kind of cool I did not know that it
doesn't give me any news but it does at
least show me the next game so I guess
that's kind of something not exactly
what I was looking for but it's not
terrible either okay this is round two
for Cortana we are going to ask some
sort of real-life scenarios what is 20%
of $83
all right well it does give the answer
I've had to open up a web page in order
to do it but that is the correct answer
and again like Google now still gave the
tip thing in case you wanted to use it
as a tip and I guess if you're like out
shopping or whatever you're just going
to subtract $16.60 from 83 but in either
case it still did give the answer show
me some recipes for dinner all right
same kind of stuff just some websites
that show some recipes you know all
recipes have shown up in all three
search results so that's nothing new and
uh alright on the last one what is the
latest news on the Columbus Blue Jackets
alright and once again we are opening up
a website although the first web link
there is the latest headlines from the
Blue Jackets as per their NHL their
official NHL page so that's at least
good you know Siri just gave me a game
date for the troit red when asked about
that so you know Cortana did about as
well as Google now did and Siri you know
didn't do as well there okay folks we
are in the third round now this is the
extra function just little things that
it can do that are outside of his
general purview so let's get started all
right so for the first one I'm gonna ask
it to identify a song and I'm gonna ask
it to give me lyrics that song give me
one sector to find a universal verse in
311 that's always a good
there you go alright so I might take a
couple of tries ok Google ok Google all
right so I guess I have to find me the
lyrics to beautiful disaster by 311 and
they are fantastic alright question
number two
okay Google find me a restaurant that is
nearby here are the listings for
restaurant within 5 miles okay Google
get me directions to Hunan house on 161
Hunan house is six minutes from your
location by car and light traffic here
are your directions and there it is so I
found me some place to eat and then
waited all right so final question let's
back out of here
ok Google show me some events that are
happening nearby alright so it doesn't
have anything built into that but it
does have a couple of websites that can
help me
including a life hacker article on how
to do exactly what I just asked Google
now to do so um you know two out of
three ain't bad and I guess we'll see
how the other ones do ok this is a round
three four series some real-world
application stuff people might actually
use this service for what is this song
listening
I think my mother all right it did get
it right that is the correct answer it
was in fact dig by Mudvayne it is giving
me the option to buy it I assume as
through iTunes all right so let's up on
lyrics for it can you find me the lyrics
to dig by Mudvayne let me check bad ok I
found URLs on the web for lyrics to dig
my muddling Siri talks a lot but yeah
same thing that google gave us when we
when we did that show me restaurants
near me searching ok here is what I
found
holy crap alright so this is actually
way better than what Google now did I'm
sure Google now you know has a thing to
show me more than what it showed me but
this is still way more right off the bat
than Google now did show me all right
let's pick one here uh tap speed so
there we go can you please give me
directions to taps Pizza getting
directions to taps Pizza all right and
then it opens up the Maps application um
I don't want that too but it's going to
show me directions to it you know I'm
sure it's done it around in here
somewhere by the way this does scrolling
is actually kind of nice but hey go just
opens the maps app straight out and give
it to you I mean Google now it just show
me the directions although I did tap
that it would have opened up maps
exactly the same way all right final
test what are some events that are
happening nearby
let me check bad here's what I found on
the web for what are some events that
are happening nearby all right more or
less what uh Google would have given us
so there we go that's the end of round
three for Siri
can you please identify a song for me
all right so round three is not opening
up rather well for Cortana
that functionality is I guess not
built-in yet so that is something that
the other two do have the Cortana does
not have I was going to go with the Bad
Religion song actually so I'm going to
ask for the lyrics anyway and see if the
lyrics come up what are the lyrics to
bad religions punk rock song I will note
I know it's probably kind of hard to see
in this camera angle but it did get all
of the words right
you know bad religions with apostrophe s
denoting ownership and there is the
lyrics to punk rock song right there so
at least I got that part right
can you find me some restaurants nearby
all right this is expected opening up
the Bing search and there are some
restaurants that are nearby it's got
some Yelp ratings here in there wow I
really live next to some really crappy
restaurants huh all right so we're going
to take a China buffet
we're going to ask for directions to
that at three o'clock in the morning
please give me directions to China
buffet here are five locations for China
buffet all right which one do you want
the first one
all right getting you directions to
China buffet all right that is actually
really fantastic well done and this
opens up Microsoft's Maps application
wants to know my location and it's a
there it is caution please be safe
always pay attention to the road and
obey posted traffic signs that is so
nice thank you so much Cortana see at
least one of these damn things cares
about my safety
well done can you show me some events
nearby all right we are opening up the
web page same kind of thing one
direction with a kona pop on August 18th
actually this is better than the other
two did because I'm actually getting web
results for some events that are near me
you know you see my zip code right there
and that's that's not something kind of
different right up here these things
right here these were not present in the
other searches so this is actually done
rather well and that would be the end of
round three okay folks this is brown 4
this is kind of like the app integration
to see the kinds of things that Google
now can do in other applications on top
of what it can do normally so all right
let's get started with this okay Google
take a note to remind me to do a video
okay saving alright as you can see that
saving and Gooper in Google keep so I
can access that through the Google keep
application and through its interface
online for those who don't remember
that's a drive.google.com slash keep so
I do have multi-platform access to this
note if I need it
okay Google send an email to my friend
Eric
all right
friend Eric not found that's because
it's spelling his name wrong his name is
actually a Ric so I not surprised that
that couldn't be found but you can send
emails directly through Google now
assuming that you have your contacts
that don't have weird spellings of their
name
okay Google I have a doctor's
appointment in one week
okay do you want to save this yes yes
saving event all right well it took a
second but it does have the event saved
in calendar now on Android most calendar
applications have access to Google
Calendar and then you can also access on
the website or on the website too so
this is saved everywhere it does have
cross-platform support you can access it
in the calendar application of your
choice assuming it supports Google
Calendar which like I just said most of
them do so pretty much anything you do
in Google or in Google now you can
actually do in other applications also
and that's kind of nice alright guys
this is a round for for Siri this is
kind of real-world functions part to
accept was going to deal with
applications outside of Siri we're going
to see how that works
take a reminder to remind me to eat in
20 minutes and it's really I'll remind
you all right there it is
and it's going to remind me right there
look so there you go Bing Norah Jones
really oh is I'm going to show that
again
right yeah there it is reminder okay
folks and there's the reminder right
there you know you can play with it and
do stuff with it right there you know
show completed I don't know what tapping
that's going to do cuz I don't know iOS
that well but there is the reminders you
can in fact find them outside of Syria
okay next up we are going to ask Siri to
send an email Siri send an email you
don't have an email account set up yet
just launch the mail app it will guide
you through the setup process all right
so she would have sent an email if I had
bothered to set up the email account
first that's Mia Copa but you know she
would have sent the email had I not been
so short-sighted and stupid all right
let's up her ask Siri to take a note and
see if we can find it anywhere
Siri take a note shawshank redemption'
with it I can take that note for you
just tell me what you wanted to say
Shawshank Redemption was a hell of a
movie here's your note well it was wrong
but it does take a note or do see if we
can't find that note
and there's the note right there in the
notes application so it does save it
although I wish it did say shawshank
redemption' was a hell of a movie
because josh a production is not a movie
at all bad serie okay we are in round
four for Cortana first thing we do is
ask it to take a reminder remind me to
go to bed when would you like to be
reminded 4 a.m. sure I'll remind you to
go to bed at 4 a.m. today sound good yes
great I'll remind you you can also see
it in your reminders list anytime that
was really nice actually that was really
well done I am very impressed with how
well that went um really personable but
still got the job done maybe a little
bit more talking than was required but
that's not too bad okay we're gonna go
right into the second one um send an
email to my friend John who's the email
going to Joe handy at gmail.com who did
you wanna email joe hindi at gmail.com
who did you wanna email alright so I
guess I'm have to type this one in um
it's still something yeah alright so I'm
gonna type that in same thing that kind
of happened with uh oh I really need
this to stop I'm talking not getting
sobbing you're ruining my video Cortana
below sorry guys but yeah same problem I
had with Siri you know I don't have
anybody in Mike Microsoft contacts but
if I did they probably would have popped
up right there and I would've been able
to send an email okay final one they're
going to take a note and see how it goes
but you know what it did the reminder
which is kind of like a note so we're
going to just go try to add something to
the calendar this time I have a doctor's
appointment next week
okay what time does it start 9:00 a.m.
all right I can add doctor's appointment
to your calendar for Monday at 9:00 a.m.
sound good yes great all right now that
is actually available in my Outlook
calendar and something really cool about
this is it Outlook is available on all
platforms like literally um you can get
to it on the web on Chrome OS it's on
Windows and iOS and Android and all that
jazz so you know I can pop this open
yeah I don't have a hope hook calendar
installed on my phone right now
otherwise I'd show you but this is now
available in my outlet counter the same
way it is with the Google Calendar when
you schedule things on Google now so
this is right on par with how Google now
does it and that concludes round 4 for
Cortana all right guys last round is
personality we are going to see exactly
how personable these things are I mean
after all we do talk to them all the
time so you know it's kind of nice to
have something that maybe talks back to
you a little bit isn't so bland and dry
so we're in see how Google now does okay
Google
tell me a joke nope Google now will not
be telling us any jokes today I think it
knows what to do about that
how are you doing today yeah nothing all
right last one okay Google what is my
name
got one more time okay Google what is my
name
all right so you can see Google now has
very little if any personality I mean
the voice does talk to you based on
which questions you ask it and what have
you but when it comes to anything
personal like assigning yourself a name
or you know telling jokes or interacting
with Google now in any way it really is
more of an output only kind of thing
where it doesn't really take too much
input and you know I just sounds
ridiculous but it doesn't really care
what you say to it it just does things
for you so that's kind of the way Google
now is and we're gonna see what the
other two were like okay so number five
round number five four see we're gonna
ask it some you know personal questions
just to see just to see how it responds
tell me a joke I don't think you'd
understand a joke in my language they're
not so funny anyway whatever the hell
that means
at least she answered the question now
how are you doing Siri I'm fine thanks
for asking see you guys nice polite is
it so hard for Google now to include
that IV nice okay so uh I'm two for two
so far my name is Joe I don't know who
you are but you can tell me in Siri
settings tap on my info and then choose
yourself from your contacts okay I don't
know what that means but I don't have
any contacts because I've not set this
up yet so I guess you have to add in
your contour huh I'm gonna try something
else instead call me Joe I don't know
who you are but you can tell me in Siri
settings tap on my info and then choose
yourself from your contacts okay so
here's the thing you know if I had
bothered to set up everything in advance
I didn't think about adding myself to my
own contacts in fact I didn't think
about adding contacts at all because you
know I was just testing Syria but if I
had done that then I would you know be
able to do all of this stuff too so you
know Siri does Siri did very well you
know a lot of Polish a lot of extra
stuff and now let's try Cortana
alright guys round five for Cortana we
were going to see how personable Cortana
can be tell me a joke please oh really
all right
the thing is I actually got her to do an
actual joke earlier tell me a joke how
do you catch a runaway laptop with an
Internet hahaha alright so something I
wanted note here is the inflection in
the voice like it sounded like she was
excited to tell me the punchline there
and I know that something small and
probably doesn't matter to a lot of
folks but when you've been listening to
a computer talk to you for 12 hours
having a little bit of emotion in there
is actually kind of nice so I do
appreciate that that's how that went
all right let's ask it another question
how are you doing today
great thanks awesome so you got a little
bit of a little bit of Siri polish there
so we're nice alright so I'm going to
last I'm gonna do is ask it to call me
by a different name can you please start
calling me Joe
nope I believe that's another one of
those things I have to do like in the
settings i actually have it set right
now to call me chief and see you get it
cuz Cortana is calling me chief hey
Cortana alright so there's no buzzword
what is my name
alright so I'm not going to get her to
do that two out of three ain't bad
though
and that concludes the test let's take a
moment to talk about it okay so clearly
if you want the personal assistant
that's going to do the most stuff you're
gonna want to go with something like
Google now it performed admirably and
pretty much all of the tests and there's
a ton of functionality we didn't go into
such as the ability to show you the
weather give you reminders based on
events and even grab news based on stuff
that you search for it's a great option
overall even if it lacks a little
personality and overall polish Siri on
the other hand has a lot more of a
refined field thanks to its more natural
speech and friendly demeanor it doesn't
have as much pure functionality as
Google now but it does make up for it
with additional polish which does matter
to some people and still makes it a very
strong option Cortana is kind of a wild
card because it is so new and Microsoft
hasn't had time to get a lot of that
functionality or refinement in place
that said it still had a fairly good
showing and we imagine that most of the
shortcomings will be addressed in future
updates it probably isn't topping
anyone's list right now but when you
take into consideration the
cross-platform support for Android and
the OS level integration for Windows the
world's two most popular operating
systems
Cortana definitely has a ton of
potential if you want to keep talking
about it feel more than free to leave a
comment telling us what you think which
one you think is the best and why once
again I'm Joe Andy the Android authority
app guidewire here you might as well
subscribe to the Android Authority
YouTube channel and check out those
awesome videos we have linked up right
over there and in the video description
below
also don't forget to check out all of
these applications on their various
platforms because they are all really
really good and I hope you have a better
grasp of which ones will work best for
you as always thanks for watching
everybody and have a wonderful day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
