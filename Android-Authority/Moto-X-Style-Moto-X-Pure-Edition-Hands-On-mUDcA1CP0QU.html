Android Authority and Motorola just had
their event here in New York City where
they just announced a few new devices
and we're taking a look at their latest
flagship the Moto X pure edition also
known as the Moto X style Motorola is
not one for dramatic departures in the
design department and so the latest Moto
X style or Moto X pure edition retains a
lot of the design languages of its
predecessors and in a lot of ways it
looks like a smaller version of the
Nexus 6 with a solid metal frame and a
sloping curved back and all the buttons
and ports are in identical places with
the headphone jack up top microUSB port
on the bottom and obviously the power
button on the right side and volume
rocker on the opposing side and
obviously the most important part of the
Moto X experience is the ability to
customize so users will be given the
choice to change the color and materials
of the backing to suit your liking and
also the accent colors as well and
there's also a gold and white version
that's going to be available but there's
a ton of different new colors there's
going to be green a red leather a
charcoal black wood version just a bunch
of different new options to pick from
now in this new edition of the Moto X
one significant change with the design
is the new metal strip that now houses
the rear camera dual LED flash and the
Motorola logo and the dimple is a lot
smaller now than the one that was on the
2014 version so it's not quite as
in-your-face anymore and it's a much
more subtle more classier looking logo
motorola has never strived for offering
the thinnest and lightest devices around
and this current generation Moto X has a
significant amount of thickness to it
but it doesn't feel all that heavy and
it actually feels extremely comfortable
to hold in the hand despite having a
large 5.7 inch display it actually feels
in some ways a lot smaller than the 2014
Moto X so the screen has also been
bumped up to a much larger 5.7 inch
screen over last year's model and the
resolution has also been improved 2 quad
HD so 2560 by 1440 and it's an extremely
sharp looking panel just like you would
expect and so far it looks fantastic it
gets extremely bright and it looks like
a solid looking screen for pretty much
anything that you're gonna want to do on
this phone under the hood motorola chose
to go with the qualcomm snapdragon 808
and three gigabytes of ram so it's a
similar setup that we saw on the LG g4
with the 808 and so far performance
seems to be extremely snappy and
responsive in the short time that I got
to spend with it and it also helps that
it's running a near stock version of
Android so you're not dealing with a ton
of bloatware and pre-installed apps that
could potentially bog the experience
down so you should be able to do pretty
much anything that you want on this
phone without any issues whether that's
multitasking jumping through a bunch of
different applications or playing
graphically intensive games now as far
as hardware goes the Moto X comes in
three different storage capacities you
have 16 32 and 64 gigabytes of internal
storage but you now have the option to
expand via microSD for up to an
additional 128 gigabytes which you
couldn't do on last year's model another
big highlight with the hardware is the
addition of dual front-facing stereo
speakers which was sorely missing from
last year's Moto X and they have this on
the Nexus 6 so they're essentially
bringing this feature over to this
year's Moto X so you're gonna get a much
better audio experience any much better
media consuming experience overall for
the battery you're looking at a pretty
large 3000 milliamp hour battery so you
should be able to get at least a full
day's worth if not a little bit more and
Motorola is also touting its quick
charging capabilities they're saying
it's the fastest charging phone over the
competition but obviously we'll have to
wait and see if that is actually true
one of the biggest weaknesses of the
Moto X line has always been the camera
and Motorola is looking to change that
with a new 21 megapixel rear shooter and
dual LED flash so much to what we saw on
the droid turbo now obviously it's not
always about the numbers and we'll have
to wait and see how well this 21
megapixel camera actually stacks up to
the competition the front-facing camera
has also been improved and it's now a 5
megapixel wide-angle lens so you should
be able to easily fit yourself and a
couple of your friends into the frame
and there is now an addition of an LED
flash to help you easily take photos in
dim lighting conditions the camera UI
has pretty much remained unchanged you
can tap anywhere on the viewfinder to
take a photo and if you swipe in from
the side this will reveal all your
different options like HDR panorama
video recording and all the typical
modes
you would expect from a smartphone
camera for the software it's running on
android 5.1.1 and it's a near stock
version of Android so you're not getting
a ton of pre-installed bloatware or
pre-installed apps and this is something
that motorola has been really good about
over the last couple of years I do
however still get a lot of the motorola
features like moto connect moto actions
moto voice motor display so you can do
things like twist your wrist to open up
the camera app and even chop the phone
to turn on the flashlight all these
features are extremely useful and really
enhances the Android experience
price-wise you're looking at a starting
price of 399 for the base model which is
an extremely competitive price over the
competition and the nice thing about the
Moto X pure Edition is that is
compatible to virtually any carrier here
in the States
whether that's t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T Verizon
Sprint or any of their MVNOs you can
virtually take this phone to any carrier
but this has been a quick look of the
Moto X pure edition also known as the
Moto X style and Motorola really
surprised us today and it looks like
they have an extremely high quality
flagship device on their hands and we
can't wait to check it out even further
