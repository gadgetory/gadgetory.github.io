authority here it's sunday january the
13th and these are our apps of the week
to start things off we're going to look
at a game called oscura where you plays
an imp who's trying to bring light to a
world filled with darkness as you go
along your journey you have to pick up
all the glass shards that you see and
all the gears in hopes of rebuilding a
lighthouse that will illuminate the land
buyer beware everything out there is
trying to kill you and includes but is
it limited to giant scary monsters with
antlers on their heads flying spiked
balls and giant cogwheels I will crush
you if you get caught between them on
the ground there's a pretty cool slow
time ability that helps you navigate
some of the trickier puzzles but
otherwise gameplay is pretty
straightforward collect everything you
can don't die and reach the giant
crystal at the end the art style is
definitely reminiscent of limbo on the
PC so if you've ever played that you'll
probably notice them direct parallels
otherwise limbo is 99 cents in the
Google Play Store if being an imp isn't
your thing maybe you want to fly like a
Falcon Falcon pro that is Falcon pro is
one of the newest twitter clients to hit
the google play store and has had almost
a universal acclaim from anybody that's
used it sleek slick and gorgeous you can
do anything you need in just a couple of
tabs tweet reply retweet direct message
it's all there and it's very very nice
there's also a very cool swiping gesture
or if you swipe once to the right you
can see lists and anything trending both
globally and locally with one swipe to
the left you can pull up your own
information like your profile who's
following you and see who you're
following it's very very gorgeous and
well done Falcon pro is 99 cents in the
Google Play Store however if that didn't
impress you maybe you'll be impressed
with press press is one of the newest
google reader clients to hit the google
play store and like Falcon purple for it
it's already made quite a splash sleek
slick functional and above all very easy
to use press lets you sign in with your
google account and then displays all of
your google reader feats you and one
nice easy to read format tap an article
and you'll see it rendered in a quickly
loading beautiful easy-to-read font it
also loads images so if there's an image
at the top of the article
you'll see that as well if there's a
read more link the articles are actually
loaded in an in-app browser so you never
have to leave press with beautiful holo
styling read unread and starred you can
swipe left to right to get to them all
press is 199 in the Google Play Store
and this finally takes us to Fun Run
which is our app of the week where you
plays a furry woodland creature that
dies dies dies again all while trying to
beat other furry woodland creatures to
the finish line the controls are
deceptively simple what the animals
always running forward so all you have
to worry about is the jump in the item
button the items are usually a weapon
that is meant to slow down the other
players and otherwise that's it it's a
really really easy game to get into with
quick matches so even if you only have a
couple of seconds you can usually get
one done once you cross the finish line
you're given a player rating and money
that you can use to buy vanity items
with otherwise that's it if you do join
add me Josh the munos and otherwise
those are our apps of the week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
