generation but we know it as the Moto G
2015 whatever you call it
Motorola smartphone bumps up the
features and keeps the affordable price
tag but should you buy it hey what's up
guys this narrow pair for Android
Authority and this is our Moto G 2015
review the Moto G design hasn't changed
too much since the first generation and
this year's edition keeps the familiar
design with a few little changes the mid
plate detail makes the handset look a
little bit more premium while the
metallic accent around the camera adds
contrast and comes with Motorola's
favorite dimple the removable back also
has a textured finish providing more
grip in the hand while the curved design
of the phone makes it comfortable to use
on the outside
this year's Moto G keeps a familiar
designed to past models but adds one key
feature ipx7 certification the Moto G
2015's removable back cover snaps into
place to keep the hands it protected but
it's not easy to see when you've missed
one and this may lead to water damage
claims for Motorola
one of the biggest changes however is
moto make up which is available for the
first time with the Moto G 2015 this
year motorola are launching the handset
in black or white but as you can see
I've got a blue version here with a
rather nice red accent around the camera
moto maker lets you customize the
handset design in colors to something of
your choosing
and you can make the hands are truly
unique with all the available options
the plastic finish around the display
feels cheap in the hand while the volume
and power buttons provide poor tactile
feedback the handset vibration motor is
also weak meaning it's not the most
useful for notifications and the display
itself has poor saturation and viewing
angles on the subject of that display
motorola has kept the same panel as last
year meaning you have a 5 inch 720p LCD
display that offers an average 294
pixels per inch density Gorilla Glass 3
protection does a good job keeping the
handset free of scratches but sunlight
legibility is average
best the disappointment with the display
is the lack of full HD or quad HD
resolution and this definitely shows
with a low pixel density resulting in a
below average viewing experience it's
questionable whether they could have
chosen a full HD panel and kept the
price affordable but if they had it
would have definitely helped with the
overall experience given those
smartphones like the Vodafone smart
logistics cost less but actually offer a
full HD panel we've got to say we're
definitely disappointed with the meagre
720p resolution then again if you want
full HD and you don't mind paying a
little more for it the Moto X plays
definitely Hansard to consider it's
likely that Motorola kept 720p on the
new Moto G to differentiate between the
two devices but also to ensure that the
Moto G's price tag remained affordable
when it hit the shelves what the new
Moto G lacks in the display it more than
makes up for in the hardware the
Snapdragon 410 processor is the 64-bit
answer to last year Snapdragon 400 and
comes clocked at 1.4 gigahertz with
either one gigabyte or two gigabytes of
RAM the two variants also affect how
much storage you get the model with one
gigabyte ram comes with eight gigabytes
internal storage which is quite low
while the two gigabyte ram variant
doubles the storage to a slightly more
acceptable 16 gigabytes you can also
expand the storage using a microSD card
slot and at first use the 16 gigabyte
model has around 11 gigabytes available
to use
although motorola has included a
removable back cover the 2470
milliamp-hour battery isn't unremovable
but it does deliver quite good juice a
400 milli amp hour upgrade over last
year's model we found the answer easily
able to deliver a full day's usage over
the past week we've had between 16 and
18 hours battery life with around four
to five hours screen on time and two
days standby however a lack of quick
charging means topping up an empty
battery takes over two hours so you'll
definitely want to plan your charging
accordingly overall the hardware is what
you might expect from a mid-range device
but in actual use the performance is
definitely a surprise given it's quite
low price tag from mid-range hardware
you'd probably expect
average performance but the Moto G
delivers so much more than this the
first thing you'll notice is moto
display which shows you waiting
notifications all the time automatically
when you pick the handset up or pull it
out of your pocket moto display is very
useful when you consider how many people
don't actually carry a watch and instead
check the time on their phone and it
definitely helps improve the battery if
you're one of those people beneath moto
display we've got a mostly stock like
Android experience with Motorola opting
for the Google now launcher peg to the
left of the home screen sticking with
stock Android has another Motorola to
deliver the fast responsiveness found on
other Google Nexus devices and while it
may feel bare-bones for some the slick
performance is definitely refreshing
motor suite also adds motor assist which
lets you set custom behaviors for
specific locations as an example if the
phone detects you're at the cinema it
can automatically silence the ringer or
if it detects your driving you can
automatically speak your messages to you
and let you reply using your voice these
little tweaks are definitely useful as
they help make the smartphone experience
be what it should be your phone doing
simple tasks automatically just so you
don't have to by far my favorite
features quick gestures which lets you
accomplish simple things quite easily a
double flick of the wrist turns the
torch on or off while a double twist of
the wrist launches the camera this
latter feature is a little too
responsive for our liking and often
we've activated the camera just by
picking up the phone from a table the
Moto G software is essentially a couple
of additions to the pure Android
experience and as such it delivers the
fast responsiveness you normally
associate with the Nexus range from
general multitasking to heavy gaming and
all the tasks in between the handset is
more than capable of handling whatever
you ask of it despite its mid-range
processor
unlike other Android lollipop powered
devices we've not experienced any RAM
management issues and during the past
week we've noticed that even added
several apps and filling storage doesn't
impact the responsiveness too much
overall performance on the Moto G is
certainly impressive
especially when considering the
mid-range specs and it clearly shows
that motorola has learned from working
with Google on past Nexus devices for
those lamenting on the lack of a cheat
Nexus the Motorola MOTO G definitely
delivers a performance you'd be looking
for now to the camera and despite the
entry-level price tag Motorola have
still stuck a large camera on the back
and it's the same Sony mx2 on full
sensor found in Google's flagship Nexus
6 that gives you 13 megapixels
resolution f20 aperture and a dual tone
LED flash while an IR filter helps to
reduce glare there's no optical image
stabilization however meaning photos and
videos can come out shaky and the
viewfinder is bare-bones and simplistic
just like on past Motorola devices given
the price tag the camera is very
impressive on paper and it certainly
delivers as long as you have enough
light in the scene in daylight the
camera produces colors that are vibrant
and captures an impressive amount of
detail in particular high dynamic range
mode makes a big difference to images
and while some other phones do very
little in HDR mode the Moto G does a
really good job in lighting up those
shadows daylight performance is
definitely impressive but sadly as the
Sun drops so does the camera performance
daylight images have very little noise
but a lack of light results in focal
problems and digital noise and this
camera captures so much noise given the
price tag the Moto G camera is
definitely very impressive in daylight
but in low-light conditions this camera
needs a lot of work overall you can
definitely take impressive shots with
the new Moto G if you have enough light
that is Motorola is dubbing the Moto G
as the hundred and eighty dollar
smartphone but the version we reviewed
came by the higher price tag the
entry-level 8 gigabyte version starts at
just 179 dollars but the 16 gigabyte
version will cost you $40 more looking
at the Moto maker website you're able to
change the colors and accents on the
phone without extra charge but adding an
engraving or additional accessories can
increase the total price and if you opt
for the 16 gigabyte version the total
cost can rise to over $250 personally
I'd much rather have this really nice
blue and red version compared to all the
other standard boring colors but what
options would you pick
let us know in the comments below so
should you buy the Moto G it's not as
simple an answer as when the first moto
G came out as we're now in a completely
different era when the first handset was
launched he introduced the concept of
premium entry-level smartphones but
since then plenty of handsets have aimed
to take the Moto G's crown on paper the
specs list isn't the best you can get at
the price point but in actual
performance the Moto G is definitely up
to the task the many positives of this
handset definitely outweigh the few and
if you can handle the shortcomings in
the display in the camera the Moto G is
definitely the one for you thanks for
