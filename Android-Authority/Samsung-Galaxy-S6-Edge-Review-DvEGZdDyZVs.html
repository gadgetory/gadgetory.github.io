authority and the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge
is one of the most eye-catching and
uniquely designed smartphones that we've
seen from Samsung in a long while and
now they've gone and done what a lot of
other manufacturers have done and given
their flagship smartphone what I like to
call the plus treatment let's go ahead
and take a look at the samsung galaxy s6
edge+
so at this point whenever we hear the
word plus in the name of a phone we
already know exactly what to expect it's
a phone that already currently exists
except bigger and that's exactly what
you're getting here with the s6 edge+
it's the same beautiful design that we
saw with the s6 edge with the all metal
frame glass front and back panels and
the sloping curved sides on the display
that gives the phone its name for those
that filthy regular s6 edge was sharp in
the hand that feeling has been
alleviated on the s6 edge+
due to the side rails being slightly
thicker and the chamfered edges aren't
quite as prominent anymore it definitely
is a big phone so one-handed use is
manageable but not always easy and it
certainly doesn't help that the phone
feels pretty slippery in the hand it's
also quite the fingerprint magnet and if
you have any other color besides the
white version it's going to be very
noticeable and you'll probably find
yourself clean the phone often the phone
still looks great though and if you love
the design of the original s6 edge then
you'll love the edge plus just the same
on the right side of the phone you'll
find the very convenient and easy to
reach power button and on the left are
the volume buttons but these aren't
quite as easy to reach and can be a
little awkward to get to with your
fingers due to how high they are up on
the chassis up top Samsung chose to do
away with the IR blaster for whatever
reason so there's not too much going on
except for the microphone and SIM card
slot and finally on the bottom is the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack micro USB
port speaker and secondary microphone up
front the edge plus features a much
larger 5.7 inch display over the five
point one inch of the s6 edge the
resolution however remains the same at
2560 by 1440 or quad HD but the screen
is still absolutely fantastic and
Samsung somehow always manages to outdo
themselves each and every year when it
comes to display tech it's still an
AMOLED screen so it's got all the
characteristic they would expect like
vibrant saturated colors great
viewing angles inky dark blacks and it
gets extremely bright so outdoor
visibility isn't much of a problem even
in direct sunlight at 5.7 inches the
screen is awesome for games and movies
and anything else you want to do so if
that's what you're looking for you'll
love this screen because of the dual
curved edges the content that you're
looking at will also be curved and
creates for a very cool looking effect
when swiping between screens some people
say it looks distorted but it definitely
doesn't look distorted to my eyes and
personally I love the waterfall effect
of the curved glass creates in regards
to performance Samsung decided to go
all-in this year with their own in-house
processor and the s6 edge+ features the
same Exynos 7420 that we saw on the s6
and s6 edge earlier this year but this
time around you're getting an extra gig
of ram for a total of 4 gigabytes it's
extremely fast in day to day use from
general navigation web browsing and of
course handles gaming and multitasking
like a champ
especially with 4 gigabytes of RAM
speaking of RAM the aggressive Ram
management issues that plagued the s6
and s6 edge seems to have been scaled
back on the s6 edge+ with many more
applications being able to be loaded and
ran simultaneously before running into
any unwanted app refreshes much of the
performance improvements for Samsung
this year also had to do with the
scaling back and optimization of these
software and while the experience is
mostly snappy Samsung still has I
figured out a fix for these scrolling
stutters when jumping between Flipboard
and the main home screen it's not a huge
deal and it's a rather small blemish in
the grand scheme of things and can
easily be avoided if you use a
third-party launcher but if you don't it
is something you're going to notice
quite frequently you've got the usual
bells and whistles for a Samsung
flagship like the heart rate monitor on
the back and the standard home button up
front that doubles as a fingerprint
scanner it's still just as fast reliable
and accurate as it was on the s6 and s6
edge with just a simple press and hold
of the home button and its usefulness as
a security measure is only going to
improve when Samsung pay launches here
in the next month
multiple fingerprints can be added and
the process of setting it up requires
repeatedly pressing on the home button
which takes only a minute or two at most
the edge plus comes in either 32 or 64
gigs of storage and there's still no
microSD card slot and Samsung opted not
to make a 128 gigabyte version
time around so these are the only two
options you have when it comes to
storage as far as speaker quality is
concerned it's fairly standard obviously
being mounted on the bottom isn't the
most optimal position in the world but
it's definitely far from the worst it
does sound pretty good and gets loud
enough they can hear in noisy
environments but otherwise it just
simply gets the job done now one of the
biggest issues with the original s6 edge
and even the s6 was the battery life and
it was pretty difficult to get through a
full day that problem however seems to
haven't fixed with the edge plus and
even though 3000 milliamp power still
sounds a little low for a phone with a
large quad HD display I've had no
problems whatsoever getting through a
full day that's typically about as long
as the phone would last for me on
average so I wouldn't expect too much
more than that but it is very easy to
top off because not only does the edge
plus come with fast wired charging it
also features fast wireless charging
this only works with Samsung's wireless
charger but Samsung claims that you can
charge the phone in two hours time which
is 33% faster than normal speeds that's
still not extremely fast but it's pretty
impressive for wireless charging the
camera on edge plus remains largely the
same as the s6 edge and you can still
double tap the home key from anywhere
just like before to jump quickly into
the camera so what you're looking at is
a 16 megapixel sensor F 1.9 aperture and
optical image stabilization and the
front camera is a 5 megapixel shooter
also with F 1.9 aperture that makes for
some pretty great looking selfie shots
even in low-light the camera interface
is where you'll notice the biggest
change with the camera experience you
still have many of the same modes as
before like selective focus panorama
virtual shot and your typical auto and
manual modes but Samsung has now added
the ability to create video collages
that allows you to stitch for six second
clips together into one video for those
of you who really want to get creative
the most notable addition is the live
broadcast button which links directly to
your YouTube account to allow you share
moments right as they happen with your
followers similar to what you would find
on something like periscope samsung also
made a pretty big deal about the
improvements to the video side of things
they've added what they call BD is or
video digital image stabilization that
works in conjunction with oh is for more
stable footage and in my experience the
video recording is very stable and
smooth without any sort of warping or
Distortion
so it seems to be doing its job well
now as far as picture quality goes the
edge+ takes very excellent looking
photos which is really no surprise
considering Samsung's track record with
cameras and the fact that this is again
practically the same camera that we saw
on the regular s6 edge and daylight
photos are sharp in full of detail with
great contrast and dynamic range and
very vibrant saturated colors that's
become pretty typical of Samsung's image
processing HDR works well to bring out
some extra detail especially in high
contrast scenarios and if you don't want
to fumble around with HDR you can always
set it to auto and let the camera decide
for you the F 1.9 aperture not only
helps to produce some great looking
depth of field but it also makes for
some very good looking low-light shots
and the images retain these same vibrant
colors with noise only noticeable in the
most extreme low-light conditions it
honestly doesn't matter whether you're
in daylight low-light indoors or
outdoors this is a camera that anyone
can take out of their pocket and start
taking great-looking photos
software-wise looking at samsung's
touchwiz interface running on top of
android 5.1.1 and many of the
improvements i was made earlier this
year have made their way over to the
edge plus it's a much cleaner tighter
interface with a lot less bloatware that
makes for a much snappier experience
it's still a very brightly colored
interface but you can easily change it
to look however you want
through Samsung's theme store and even
make it look more like stock Android if
that's what you prefer you can expect
all the typical Samsung staple features
like split-screen multitasking via multi
window and various motion based gestures
but the biggest differentiator is the
edge specific software which Samsung has
made a few improvements to on the edge
plus you still have people edge night
clock edge lighting and information
stream from the s6 edge but Samsung has
added a new apps edge that lets you
handpick several of your favorite
applications for easier access the
people and apps edge can now be accessed
from anywhere on the phone and not just
the home screen anymore and the pull tab
can be relocated anywhere along the left
or right sides of the display to make it
easier and more comfortable to reach all
of these changes are very welcome
additions but the edge features still
don't feel extremely useful or as a
whole lot of value to the edge design so
if you're considering the s6 edge+ get
it because you love the way that it
looks but don't expect too much outlet
features that come along with it
the s6 edge+ is available now in all
major US carriers for a starting price
of 2 $99.99 on a two-year contract for
the 32 gigabyte version
and we'll run you an extra hundred
dollars for these 64 gigs if you decide
to go the off-contract route you're
looking at 815 and nine hundred fifty
dollars respectively
just like the s6 edge before you'll have
to decide if those dual curved edges is
worth that extra hundred dollar premium
over other flagships if you loved
everything about the s6 edge but which
had a larger screen and better battery
life
well the edge plus solves both of those
problems again the value here is in the
beautiful hardware and not so much the
software and if you're perfectly okay
with that then the s6 edge plus we worth
your hard-earned money
