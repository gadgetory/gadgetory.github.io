tablets has made it onto my doorstep so
let's see what it's all about because
it's Joshua Garvin and Roy Thornton
what's going on everybody and this is
the Sony Xperia z2 tablet alright and
here we are with the Sony Xperia z2
tablet it is the update to last year's
tablet that we thought was one of the
best ones out there with its slim
profile and it's very blocky design
which was something that Sony only
really did last year so we're excited to
see what comes in this new version of
the tablet so let's go ahead and open it
up alright and there we are if I'm not
mistaken I have the black version of the
Sony Xperia z2 tablet which is a little
bit of a bummer because the white one
that we saw at the Mobile World Congress
in Barcelona Spain was really sexy but
in this case we are working with the
let's confirm here the black one yes
this is very much like the one that we
had last year and it has the same design
around with the corners that are just a
little bit more rounded off so that it's
not quite as rigid and it's not really
poking into your hand when you're using
it but we're just going to go ahead and
put this aside for now and take a look
at the content underneath ok so here we
are with just some documentation here
including our startup guide on the left
side and all the information that you
need under there the legal information
essentially and this advertisement that
we see at the front essentially is just
advertising the SmartWatch a couple
other peripherals and also the the
fitness band that they have so nothing
on the back there and then when we get
into the right side we have just the
simple plug adapter for the wall and the
micro USB cord that it would obviously
come with so that's pretty much
everything that comes into this box with
the tablet itself we'll just go ahead
and take the plastic off of there
ah yes very nice let's go around the
tablet a little bit you here is what the
thinness is like and you'll see what the
actual figure is right over there
you do have the headphone jack right
here on the bottom and if we come over
to the right side you'll see it's just a
slab right there really nothing to talk
about here because there is literally
nothing there
and then on the top here what we have is
the IR blaster along with a micro SD
card slot that is covered in a small
piece of plastic yes this particular
tablet is waterproof like many of the
other products in Sony's camp and right
there you get to see all of the ports
that are available micro SD card slot as
well as the micro USB charging port
right there in the middle so this is
where the charging happens on the Xperia
Tablet the Xperia z2 tablet rather and
finally on the left side we have the
classic button layout of the big silver
power button next to the volume rockers
that Sony is so well known for these
days so that is just look around the
tablet and now we are into the operating
system so we can go ahead and get
started with that it's not glass on the
back which is what you probably expected
from the last couple iterations of the
Xperia tablet and phones but yeah this
is a really really attractive sort of
material choice here that allows it to
have a little bit more grip and it's
also not going to be fingerprint prone
so this thing is going to look really
nice unless of course you have really
oily hands but it's just a attractive
device all around so we're super excited
to put this tablet through its paces and
be able to show you what it really is
all about it might be one of the best
ten inch tablets available on the market
then it's coming from a company that
always has great build quality and also
some really unique style alright and
here we are we're finally into the
actual operating system itself it had to
go through a couple of reboots but here
it is the Xperia UI or Timescape at is
some as it is sometimes called works
really well on this and the Xperia z2
which I'm really excited to get my hands
on but it does show its capabilities
here we have the small abs as is a usual
trope of the Xperia UI where we can get
small overlay apps right here and then
as far as the app drawer goes there's a
little button up here on the top that
you will be
- go - there's a pullover for you to
just get a little bit of extra stuff
done like changing the order and also
going straight to the play store as you
can see down here but it looks very nice
very easy to use and like I keep saying
when it comes to at least this operating
system
Sony understands that if you keep it
simple you keep it fast and that is
exactly what's going on here you are
able to get to the Sony experience area
right here and Google now if we go to
the Sony experience area you'll pretty
much just get a lot of advertisements
for various pieces of media that you can
get from the Sony store this only
unlimited stores and that is a
subscription-based service I hope that
you have to sign up for and from there
we're just taking a look at some of the
elements notification drop-down we have
the the power widget over here on the
right side but we also have the actual
notification drop-down on the left so
it's a pretty standard fare in terms of
the operating system but that's
something that we come to expect from
the Xperia UI and so there you have it
for this unboxing and first impressions
on the Sony Xperia z2 tablet this is
again the update to last year's great
tablet Z that was just a wonderful
offering one of the best 10-inch tablets
out there not only because of its
simplistic operating system that makes
getting to the work and fun easy but
also because of its great profile it's
great style and its ease of use then
that seems to continue in this
particular version that has come out
very recently and should be on sale
already so keep it tuned to android
authority for all of the best coverage
on this tablet and also on future
coverage for things like the Sony Xperia
z2 and for all of the phones that are
coming out in the coming weeks keep it
tuned to Android thority drop us some
