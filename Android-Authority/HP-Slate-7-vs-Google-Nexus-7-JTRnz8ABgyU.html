Android authority what's going on
everybody and we have another verses
here for you
HP is coming out a little bit from left
field with their new Slate 7 tablet it
is a seven-inch tablet so they're going
into that market and of course the
logical verses here would be with
Google's own Nexus 7 it's Google's baby
it's their number one it's one of their
best-selling devices ever and it really
is still one of the most popular devices
out you a 7-inch market however HP is
looking to make some waves with a few
extra features inside of their tablet
that they're hoping to compete with the
Nexus 7 you can see a couple of them
right here on the back already you have
Beats Audio so if any of you have ever
used Beats Audio and any other devices
like HP or HTC phones or anything like
that you'll know what to expect there a
lot more clarity a lot fuller bass a lot
richer mid-tones and high range in the
audio there so if you're a music
listener then this might be a pretty
good device for you also however one of
the big differences here is that you can
see is just a flat back on the Nexus 7
however on the Slate 7 by HP you have
the 3 megapixel camera on the back a 10
megapixel it's Hambly rather a 10-inch
tablet may not be the most ideal device
to take a picture with but at 7 inches
it's a little bit more acceptable so a 3
megapixel camera on the back might prove
quite useful to some of you on the other
hand you have VGA camera on the front
whereas on the Nexus 7 you have the
camera of
as well so one of the other aspects that
makes the slate 7 different from the
Nexus 7 is the fact that it will be
priced a little bit cheaper at 169
you're looking at 8 gigabytes inside of
the slate 7 or as the $1.99 on the Nexus
7 will give you 8 as well so you're kind
of looking at two different worlds here
it looks like let's look real quick it
looks like we're running the version
with 4.1.1 for Android of Android on the
slate 7 however on the Nexus 7 of course
we are about as updated as we can get I
have an update to 4.2.2 but you see as
well playing same jelly bean on the
Nexus 7 so you're looking at two
different worlds there one other thing
that I'll notice here is that the build
quality is pretty good on the slate 7
you get you look you have what kind of
looks like a middle but a metal lining
around the sides
the bezel however on the front seems to
be a little bit wider on the sides of
the slate 7 it seems to be just a little
bit thinner over on the Nexus 7 so let's
display while the r7 inches you will
have a little bit less real estate on
the slate 7 by HP over here one of the
important differences between these two
tablets however is the performance
you're looking at the very popular Tegra
3 processor by Nvidia inside of the
Nexus 7 which has a lot of performance
however there is a dual core of cortex
a9 inside of the slave 7 giving it a
little bit of a dip light a disadvantage
rather in terms of performance when
compared to the Nexus 7 also there's
another disadvantage inside of the Slate
7 when you have a 1024 by 6600 display
however the Nexus 7 takes full advantage
of its screen by having a 1280 by 800
display so as far as the actual
resignations of the displays are both of
these tablets you are getting a bit of a
disadvantage with these slave 7 that
being said however it is a lesser priced
tablet so you can decide for yourself
whether you want the slightly more
premium Nexus 7 which has been very very
popular and we're going to see just how
popular the slave 7 is and it's 100
69 price point $30 less than the Nexus 7
so thank you very much everybody its
