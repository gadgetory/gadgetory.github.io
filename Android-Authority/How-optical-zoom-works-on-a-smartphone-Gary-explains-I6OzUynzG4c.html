today I would like to talk to you a bit
about cameras specifically about optical
zoom and digital zoom and the question
before us today is is how can a
smartphone which has a fixed focal
length lens offer optical zoom well let
me explain so let's start by talking
about the difference in optical zoom and
digital zoom now if you have a compact
camera or a DSLR camera you may well
have a zoom lens on it now when we're
talking about zooming what we're really
talking about is moving the focal length
from one setting to another setting and
inside the lens housing you actually
find the different parts of the
mechanism are moving closer and further
apart to change how the light moves
through the lens and when it arrives at
the sensor now basically when you're
using optical zoom there is no change in
quality because the light is being
manipulated before it hits the sensor
and the sensor still takes the photo
using its full resolution and using all
of its full color and light capabilities
and nothing is Olga digitally it all
happens in the lens housing before the
light actually gets to the sensor and
when we talk about one time zoom 2 times
zoom 3 times then what you're talking
about is going from one focal length to
another that's twice as large if you go
from 50 millimeters to 100 millimeters
that's 2 times zoom so for example here
I have one of my Canon DSLR cameras and
I've got a 55 to 250 zoom lens on it and
as I start to rotate the zoom part here
the mechanism inside is moving the
different parts of the lens closer and
further apart and if you go from 55 to
250
well 255 by 50 is five times so it's
roughly a 5x5 times zoom lens now
digital zoom is different digital zoom
happens all inside the camera and is to
do with how the sensor is taking the
photograph if you think about it if you
take a nice 18 megapixel photo of
something that's quite far away if you
crop that down to maybe only a three or
a four mega pick
or photo you can actually bring some of
the objects much closer as they would
appear in the photo but doing so you
lose resolution or of course you could
crop it down to the smaller area that
you want to zoom in and then kind of
resize it back up to a full 18
megapixels and then of course you lose
some of the quality but that's basically
what digital zoom is the camera
basically either cropped it down and
produces a smaller photo or actually
cropped it down and then kind of
magnifies it again in software doubling
up the pixels so that you get a bigger
picture zoomed in picture but actually
you've lost a lot of the quality and of
course that also means a lot of noise
can get introduced now there are some
very clever algorithms that can be used
inside of the camera inside of your
phone for doing this kind of digital
zoom but at the end of the day what
actually happening is the same amount of
light the same large picture is being
presented to the lens and then in
software it's being manipulated so that
only a part of that is shown and because
it's only a part it seems as if it's
bigger now smartphones come with a fixed
focal length lens there is no mechanism
for twisting the tube and making the
lens go closer and farther apart it's a
fixed focal length so how can phones
offer optical zoom when there's no
optics that can actually zoom
well obstacle zoom is an option that you
find on dual camera setups now there are
two main types of dual camera setups
available today one is where both lenses
on both cameras are exactly the same
they're both exactly the same focal
length but maybe one has different
properties so maybe one focus is more on
monochrome or light gathering while the
other one focuses on color and of course
taking the detail of the picture the
alternative setup which you find on
phones likely 1+5 and you find it on the
iPhone 7 plus is it actually the two
lenses have different focal lengths so
if one of them for example has a focal
length of 24 millimeters and then the
other one has a focal length of 48
millimeters that would give you the
option of having a 2 x optical zoom now
on the recently announced one plus five
there is a difference in the focal
length between the two lenses of around
1.6 and so what the one plus today will
do is that when you go to zoom in
digitally beyond 1.6 it can switch over
to the other lens and then give you that
optical zoom further on using the second
lens now actually they claim a two times
optical zoom on what they're really
doing is from 1.6 to 2 they're actually
just doing some cropping not for
magnifying some cropping so that the
picture of the resulting picture
although it might be slightly smaller is
actually giving you 2 times oon without
using any digital magnification now it
was an interesting question is what
happened if you want just one point
three time zone or one point four times
ooh we eat in between the level of these
two lenses well here there's probably
two things going on this probably some
distal digital zooming going on on the
smaller lens until you get closer to the
bigger lens and then there's probably
like all dual camera setup there'll be a
combination or the light coming in to
both one picture and the other to
perform some kind of processing to be
done on the isp the image signal
processor on the smartphone to produce
the best results now while we have a
slightly different solution with their
hybrid zoom because what they have is
the same fixed focal length on both
lenses however one would be maybe a 20
megapixel sensor and the other might be
they say something like a 12 megapixel
sensor that's roughly what while we're
doing and they again using both sensors
with different amounts of information to
kind of give you that zoom effect but
it's not an optical zoom and they're
quite rightly calling it a hybrid zoom
so to recap optical zoom is actually
only available on a smartphone when
there is a dual lens setup and one lens
actually has its optics
set to be a greater magnification than
the other lens and then using clever
software the phone is able to interpret
between those two and give you this kind
of optical zoom from one setting to the
other and of course this is one of the
great advantages of using a dual camera
setup with two different focal length
lenses and we're seeing dual cameras
becoming the standard now for flagship
smartphones now if you want more detail
about how optical zoom and digital zoom
works inside a smartphone there's a
great article over at yangon or for GOM
