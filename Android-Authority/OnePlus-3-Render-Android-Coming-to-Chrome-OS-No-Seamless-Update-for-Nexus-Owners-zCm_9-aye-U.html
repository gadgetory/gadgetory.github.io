thin one plus three and a bit more the
one plus three just leaked again in a
glorious press render courtesy of Evan
Blass the high-resolution image reveals
an attractive metallic device that takes
design cues from competitors like the
HTC One and huawei mate series according
to evan blast the metallic unibody isn't
the only major upgrade the one plus
three is getting while the 1 plus 1 + 1
+ 2 featured IPS LCD panels the one plus
3 is moving on to AMOLED the technology
that most consumers and experts
recognize as superior now if that turns
out to be true the one plus 3 will join
the ranks of a growing cadre of devices
equipped with oh el d panels supplied in
large part by Samsung it's a shift that
we expect more manufacturers to make the
one plus three will be equipped with
three thousand million power battery
according to evleaks the one plus three
is actually a downgrade in this regard
the 1+1 rocked a 30 100 million power
unit and one plus two moved to 3300
milliamp hours looking at the press
render it looks like the device is super
thin which explains at least in part the
decreased capacity but one plus may have
a hard time selling this compromise to
hardcore one plus users the one plus
three will probably feature a Snapdragon
820 processor coupled with 32 gigabytes
or 64 gigabytes of storage and 4
gigabytes of RAM the frontal fingerprint
reader and the USB type-c charging port
are making a return but the presence of
NFC is still up in the air many of you
will be happy to know that android apps
are coming to Chrome OS early on in
google i/o a post was set live on the
android developers blog explaining that
developers will now be able to bring
their android apps to Chromebooks later
this year this news is pretty great for
anyone involved developers will be able
to expand their applications
availability and users will get to use
their favorite Android apps in their
Chromebooks some of the benefits are
having Android apps that can be shown in
three different window sizes to allow
for a better experience you can also use
multi task with multiple Android apps in
movable windows along a full desktop
browser within the familiar Chrome OS
interface not only will you have the
benefit of using a keyboard
with Android but touch input will work
as seamlessly together and performance
of demanding apps such as games and
design apps are expected to improve and
bad news for all you Nexus owners
Android n will not receive updates on
any nexus devices one thing we learned
from google i/o is that android will be
starting to initiate seamless updates
that allow the file to not only be
downloaded to your device in the
background but also install it you see
Android n has two system partitions when
an update is found the update is
installed on the secondary partition
once you restart your device the
secondary partition switches over to
becoming the main one here's the problem
however according to android police in
an interview with the Android team they
learned that the Android ends seamless
update feature will not be introduced to
any current Nexus devices including the
unofficial Nexus pixel see now when I
clarify something very carefully here
this just means that current Nexus
owners will not have that seamless
automatic update feature you will still
be able to get Android and however now
why would Android do this well let's
hear from android police and i quote
implementing seamless updates on the
Nexus 5x or 6p for example would require
repartitioning the entire phone and
wouldn't be possible for an end-user to
complete without hooking the phone up to
a computer it would also just be a pain
while references to seamless updates
have been found in the latest Android
and developer preview it was confirmed
to us that these have no bearing on
existing devices getting seamless
updates thanks for watching guys today
was hard to shoot because it's May 24
weekend here and fireworks are going
berserk happy me to forward all of you
who are celebrating it see you later on
this week
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
