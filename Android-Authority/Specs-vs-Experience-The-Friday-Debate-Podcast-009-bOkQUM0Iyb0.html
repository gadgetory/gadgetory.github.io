Friday debate podcast by android
authority discussing topics in android
every single week i am of course your
host for the fdp Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody and I'm joined this
week by Joe Hindy Jonathan Feist and
andrew grush had to step out for this
particular episode so we brought back
lawn when so we could talk about the
age-old debate of specs versus
experience now I thought this was a very
interesting topic and thank you andrew
grush for creating it for this week and
we recorded it on friday which is why i
had to bring you this episode a little
bit later again i'm sorry about that but
we were busy this week with a lot of
great content one in particular the
samsung galaxy s6 review the device that
actually comes up in our debate this
week as an example of what could be a
loss of specs but an upgrade and
experience we talked about that and also
the HTC program that was announced
earlier this week the program as another
possible way that companies could create
an even better experience for users and
then we talked about what we will want
out of our phones if we were thinking
about the idea between specs and
experience but before I get into the
episode as usual I want to get some
housekeeping done thank you very much

different podcast networks we're on

podcast but even then remember to head

best coverage everywhere and you can
find us on our youtube channel in the
forums and on our website and android
authority calm after all of that this
nice little canned intro for you guys i
do want to jump into this episode number
nine of the aaf DP and don't forget to
tweet us out or give us a shout out
using the hashtag fdp as some of you
already have so you can let us know what
you think of the podcast and give us
your thoughts on the topic without any
further ado
here is episode 9 specs versus
experience of the Friday debate Mahad
cast and that's how lon saved Christmas
it's very thanks Santa by shaving a
Christmas tree into the side of his head
all right you should totally make that a
thing along you should start shaving
seasonally appropriate shapes into your
hair when people can tell what time of
year you made the videos yeah was funny
I like maybe I'm wrong here but wasn't
the first thing well actually you were
with Darcy already at mwc before I even
showed up with you guys did Dorsey ask
for the mwc in your hair like right away
was he expecting it no you didn't say
anything at least I don't remember him
saying anything but I don't know I I
didn't want that I don't know what make
that like a routine thing is just too
much work didn't he has like I oh and
yeah my favorite one would probably be
like I'll be great if you get like the
packs logo yeah that would be really
good uh so I am a little bit tired not
gonna lie after all earlier this morning
I released or we rather release the
galaxy s6 review and I was met with a
lot of tweets and a lot of messages
directly after for what was the longest
review i had ever done and one of the
best good job well thank you for that I
take it all of you guys I've been able
to check it out oh yeah I watched it
this morning it was a it was really it
didn't feel like a 17 minute video you
know and it now it's totally sounds like
you know we're kind of all was the
phrase you know we're kind of promoting
ourselves in the in the podcast but no
it really didn't feel like a 17 minute
video my is well paced yeah I got to the
end I was like man I cannot believe I'm
six minutes away from watching an
episode of dragon ball z here 17 minutes
that's uh the daily show without
commercials that's
sure but yeah I mean it's going to be
interesting going into what at what
topic we do have for today because the
s6 I think school like it falls squarely
in in this topic about this whole idea
of user experience versus just specs and
it's an interesting topic because I feel
like they go hand in hand which is funny
because the argument is always for one
or the other so you know before we even
got into that I just wanted to do like a
quick check in with everybody as we
usually do i mean we keep it loose here
on the friday to be a podcast you know i
just give everyone a little glimpse into
what we do for our daily lives sometimes
you know and obviously it's been a long
week at least for me i'm ready to
disconnect from the world right after
this podcast to be honest and then i
have to come back and edit the podcast
but that's okay so has everybody been
doing this past week oh man alright so
Jace is on vacation this week so I've
been kind of covering all his stuff and
let me tell you guys Jace has an
interesting job because uh I've just
been all over the place you like
answering questions like various
questions about updates and talking
about all the various things like he has
a lot of stuff he has to cover I kind of
have a new respect for him you know
especially since he deals with more
sponsors than I do mm-hmm well a holy
cow he's just he got a lot of work I now
know why he does like two or three shows
a week and that's it because like I've
done all two or three of those shows
this week on top of my normal stuff but
I'm like I'm like Josh right now I'm
beat I'm dead tired yeah but I am
working on something that's making me
really happy I'm revamping my entire
best android games list and there's
gonna be over 60 titles on it oh man
yeah do a lot of great games out there
that's awesome yeah let me tell you it
best job ever testing 60 of the best
games ever give us like right give us
like a some of the highlights you don't
have to give us like top five cuz I
don't ruin the video but like what are a
few of the ones that are that are that
are in that list um i'm just gonna
scroll down and just list some stuff
here at all right so when i added in was
bloons td and you guys have heard of
that one it's a tower defense game or
you blow up balloons every time i do any
kind of best
games list or best tower defense games
or whatever people yell at me because I
did not put balloons td5 on it and so I
finally downloaded it and played it and
it's actually really good it's a little
childish but still really good like it's
really great for kids and you know
simple graphics casual gamer kind of
stuff but I was really impressed by how
good it was um and then I have some
stuff that was on the last list like
clash of clans and CSR racing those
clash of clans really that good because
I've never touched it I see it on TV
more than I care for there is a lot of
content I've been playing the game off
and on for like two years now and I'm
still not at the end no way I think I've
been playing it for almost a year now
it's it gets updated like real
frequently so there's always like you
never it's hard to ever like reach the
end because they're always constantly
adding new things so yeah and like right
when you start getting sick of where you
are now they go ahead and add something
new like you know you've always been
able to get into clans and like donate
troops and stuff like that and I got
sick of the game and I put it down in
like a week later they're like now we
have clan wars where clans can go
head-to-head and I got right back into
the game and then like I started getting
tired of the game again a little bit and
they're like now there's a new troop
that flies and draws damage and I was
like flying tank I have to try it so you
know and not and then I made the mistake
of getting all of my friends into it so
now you know I get to play with them all
the time see but yeah nice what I like
about it is that like they actually like
give you what you want like they will
add little things to the game that we're
missing before and things up like the
ability to opt out of clans and stuff or
whatever it was that they recently added
and that's just something that like was
kind of missing for a while those I like
the opposite of destiny or so what did
they give the fans what they want and
suppose yeah and yeah then another thing
they added along with that was a clan
levels where your clan gains levels and
based on its level you get like little
perks like you can ask more often and
you can discard troops and you get more
storage space and it's it's you know
that they do like lanza they do a whole
lot of stuff pretty much all the time
um I also have out there on this list
and that was something that um Taylor
Martin actually reviewed before he was
at android authority and I watched his
review and I love the game ever since so
I put it on there no good um I'm trying
to think of one that's like a surprise
were like I'd say it every was like what
that's gonna make the list well I really
is actually gonna say everyone I was
actually gonna say like where do you
stand as the the app review of the game
reviewer on games that have been adapted
from other systems like a pc game like
like star wars kotor for example it's on
that's on the list is on the list that
in a grand theft auto and xcom enemy is
an enemy unknown or is it enemy with its
a ats enemy within XCOM really messed
with me because I went out and went
through all the trouble of doing this
big huge review for xcom enemy unknown
and then they trashed it and came out
with enemy within which is exactly the
same game with a little more content
like you guys couldn't just done an
update the reason why i love the adapted
games associated with the ones from pc
like like right now I'm playing
shadowrun dragonfall two directors cut
and I love that game yeah I just got
into it it's really great the learning
curve is kind of steep but once you get
into it it's actually really fun and I
love that they keep it they keep a
tabletop in the sense that if you put in
like I'm at that part I'm still early in
the game where you get these dvds and
you have to watch them and it basically
gives you the story that's going to lead
the rest of the game on instead of
actually showing you a video of what's
on the DVD it's actually a big block of
text describing what you're watching is
so tabletop it's maybe laughs because I
was like yeah this is definitely
tabletop roots um the reason why i like
those games far better than all the
other ones is you not to pay for
basically progression because like even
with Sky Force I paid for the power-ups
and I paid a couple times for the five
thousand stars in order to buy new stuff
and I don't wanna have to pay just pay
for something for progression in a game
and I feel like the adapted ones don't
do that yeah um that that's something I
was really aiming for with this list
because I had to list before was about
35 games but I included a lot you know a
lot of popular games also along with
that
I had candy crush on the last one and
it's one of the things were most people
hate that game but like a butt like a
billion people love that game so it's
one of those you know like well it's
it's good because it's popular and a lot
of people don't like that that that
mindset but I mean it's true if you can
get 500 million people to download your
game and you know eighty-eight percent
of them like it it's a good game it
sucks to say it but it's a good game did
you use a flappy birds is that what you
said nope I now say crappy birds okay
okay can goodness gracious that game was
bad you remember when I will not be a
journalist remember when all of the
variance of that came out like I
remember when Android wear was first a
thing someone made like the floppy droid
or something for Android wear I have
that installed in my watch for a little
while I was kind of I don't know it's a
good time waster for when we were in
line and someone looked like what the
hell are you doing your watch it's just
like tap tap tap tap well yeah that's
good really looking for tile is show
let's move over to feisty feisty what he
been up to this past week since our last
episode which finally is in our in house
you know rather than the live ones from
the show certainly uh you know this last
week kind of bold down to it of course
there was tabtimes and everything that
that pertains to but my android
customization series i took on a project
that i thought would be fairly simple
but it kind of consumed most of my week
what I did was a hands-on tutorial how
to do a factory reset on your device now
of course the actual factory reset is
just a couple buttons but but going
through all of the steps the things that
you should do before you do that you
know backing up your apps how to back
them up all that sort of stuff and it
turned into quite the adventure yeah
backing up apps is not an easy thing to
do like if forgive me I didn't get to
read the article yet but what were your
solutions for backing up apps what what
what it's funny you use an app to backup
your apps but what did you uh what did
you use for that X I broke it down for
the users gave them three basic options
first of all obviously just uh you know
the apps so helium backup for non rooted
rooted
users and titanium for a sort titanium
backup titanium root folder whatever
it's called I forget the name already
that's terrible but yeah so apps of
course from there also suggested just
installing a file explorer and just
manually going through and just copy and
paste those files out of course from
there I got to you know reference a USB
OTG connector just you know if you don't
have a micro USB port alright sorry
micro SD card slot is what i meant to
say you know just OTG you hook up a
flash drive and copy your files off and
and then copying back on ok and then of
course put everything up to the cloud
same sort of thing of course but last
what would Dan helium do that wasn't it
doesn't have an option to put everything
in like a dropbox or something or it
does yeah dropbox or your google drive
but you have to pay for the premium
version for that and i try and keep it
free on our android customization series
mmm other than tasker but yeah whatever
yeah yeah backing up everything and
trying to keep everything safe I've had
to do that multiple times for like my my
parents s5s and as mostly because of
their pictures cuz they went on a couple
trips this past year so they filled up
their memory so quickly and eventually I
just broke down and I got my mom like a
64 gigabyte micro-sd card ozik just use
this and it exactly and it's not even
like a fifth filled and they went to
like frickin Budapest like a couple
months ago so much in there alright cool
well um are our what's I'm trying to
think of the term i almost said non
regular but i mean obviously andrew
grush is not with us right now though he
did come up with the topic for this week
but in replace of andrew graham macphail
in he's a fill-in I was trying to think
of like our non regular i was i was
gonna say but it doesn't sound right
sounds like you need some metamucil or
something substitute teacher our temper
lon hasn't begin this past week I saw
you came out with a couple of key
reviews this past week yeah I mean I
wish I could say I was as busy as you
guys but I mean this I mean I had a
shammy review last week and then
the Moto e this week but than that like
I haven't really had too much going on
so well until it just tell us about that
moto e cuz I saw the videos a great
video and I I thought its I thought it
was a good way of encapsulating white
this budget basically budget phone was
able to bring it's about time they put
LTE on that thing I'm just saying yeah
yeah yeah well good I I actually really
like this phone i think it's i mean
obviously it's not like you know super
powerhouse of a phone and it does get
slow every once in a while but for what
it is like you know 150 bucks LTE like I
think the Ltd like makes the difference
like I think because that was kind of
like the kinda like the drawback for me
like for the last year's model so i
think the LTE really makes a huge
difference on this one and i don't know
i like it's like a nice little phone
that you can just like grip in your hand
easily and use in one hand i don't know
like it's what i love most about it's
kind of refreshing to just be able to
hold it in one hand and just reach every
corner of the screen and it's you know
it's pretty good for most things but
obviously if you're trying to like
multitask like crazy it's going to like
get a little bit choppy but ya know it's
it's it's nice for what it is so I think
motor did a good job okay well I think
that's a great jumping off point for
what we're going to talk about this week
basically we are going again to this
this oddly named warranty program that
HTC unveiled this pathway called uh but
the it was sort of the jumping off point
for what we're basically an you'd be
talking about here which is the the
debate between what's more important the
user experience or the specs features
what is really required for a phone to
sort of be successful I suppose at least
in our eyes we're jumping off the Moto e
lon so here's my questions here you have
the moto e that obviously doesn't have
what many would probably say raw power
but it's experience is still adequate
enough what what's important to you in
the Moto e is it the fact that it is a
very accessible package and doesn't does
it really sort of is it a bummer for you
that it doesn't have those
specifications I wouldn't say it's
necessarily a bummer because I mean you
have to sort of put the
whole package into perspective and I
mean when you look look at what you're
paying you know you're getting you're
paying a hundred fifty bucks for it so
it's I mean it's your kind of just you
have to really think about you know the
price and I think it delivers pretty
well for what it is it's not obvious not
a powerhouse but it does perform well
and like the overall experience is good
so I think that's really the only thing
you can really expect from it for for
the price and and the LTE totally makes
it worth it i think because that makes a
huge difference in the overall
experience because like you know you
don't want to have a phone thats 3g and
then you have to deal with slow load
times on top of you know some random
choppiness here and there so the LT just
makes a huge difference I think in the
user experience so so I mean we just got
back from mwc where lon well I mean well
on was there at CES so you got you know
you got you got the chance to deal with
some pretty high end devices like the G
flex 2 and just this past month he had
the s6 edge and lon will be the one to
do the review of the s6 edge when the
time comes so given that you know
especially for the two of us we've been
able to use so many different phones
across so many different companies and
user experiences and different design
languages so what what what is more
important to you then in a general user
experience not talking about just the
Moto e or anything after that but just
in general if you're going to buy a
phone but your hard-earned money down on
something and let's say well I was about
to say a price is no object but I don't
think that that should be a factor here
but what is important to you is it is it
raw power specifications as it features
or is it design because some people are
harping on that recently I think for me
it's like it's it's kind of a
combination of things but at the end of
the day like I I want a good user
experience I'll take I'll take a good
user experience over you know the
greatest specs out there and I'm not
saying that I don't want the great
aspects like I'll take it if i can get
it but like I like a user experience
that works and that's why I'm like I'm
such a big fan of like the Moto X like
it's not like a powerhouse of
phone it didn't it didn't come out with
the latest specs when it came out but
the user experiences is great and you
get like you know i mean motorola really
nails it with you know all their
features are not gimmicky they actually
work like motor display or the motor
display and motor action and all that
stuff it all works really well and then
you know it's running basically we're as
a pure version of Android so I mean I
and I love pure Android basically so
that's why i love the Moto X so much and
it has like to me it has a good looking
design I love design of the moto
accidents it's premium but you know it's
again it's not the best spect phone but
I think it delivers a good overall
experience and that's what I love about
that phone so much ok feisty how do you
how do you feel on that on that subject
are you aspects person or are you a
features / experience well see this is
this is the weirdest questions to kind
of put into one side or the other
there's so many different angles to this
so I'll just put it this way what is
more important to you want to what is
most important to you when it comes to a
phone and my answer is as complicated as
the question it just like you said in
the beginning here Josh it you know one
is kind of the other so when I look at
the hardware of the device design is
very important to me not so much for
looks but for how it handles you know
you get the flat back devices sometimes
they don't fit in the hand very well but
you got these motorola devices and
actually I like the htc's as well where
they just they have that curve back and
they feel really nice and more
importantly they stick in your hand I
find I've yet to find i should say an LG
device that i haven't dropped on the
floor just slides right out doesn't fit
right just the slippery backing so in
those regards it's it's important to me
that the design provides the function
but I you know for me that the big thing
really is I live in a multi multi device
world so for most of my devices I'm not
looking for high-end specs you know I
keep referencing these two little
devices that LG realm the HTC Desire 510
I you know they're very low-end devices
but that's why I bought them you know
they for the most part they've both
turned into mp3 players just for
different positions in my world and and
so for those I do not need high-end
specs and the same thing goes I mean my
daily driver has been the first gen Moto
G and it's been that way for over a year
now I am looking to upgrade but again
the distribution of all my devices so
I'm okay with the Moto G you know being
in my pocket relatively low end it's
powerful enough basically if I had to
sum it up it's powerful enough to supply
wireless hotspot so that my tablets
which you know I've got an HTC the nexus
9 sitting in my lap right now that's my
high-end device it's made for
productivity it's made for the you know
entertainment stuff my phone and I can
live with the low-end phone because I
have a high-end tablet the handles
mother feisty with his glass of cognac
and all of his money have all I want at
all well Ian and that I don't know how
to put this yes it does take some money
to have multiple devices but then again
does it the HTC nine was 400 that they
you know I got the Moto G at the most
expensive 200 that's still a couple
hundred less than buying a you know a
galaxy s6 straight out yeah that's fair
so I mean it is a it is true that if you
are able to have the same exert
experiences across multiple different
devices and I guess you would be able to
sort of skirt the the issue you know and
perhaps that's what's going on there and
to be fair to feisty that some of the
phones that you said he's had for years
now so it's not like he dropped all that
money at once um so here's where I think
I was wondering what what Joe was gonna
say here because I mean you are apt guy
and you've got you you need to have a
powerful device I'm assuming I don't
like assuming but this is where I'm
coming from here you need to have a
powerful device to be able to
run all of these games all of these
applications sometimes at the same time
and you have all these apolis so the
phone needs to be able to hold all of
those applications supposedly if you're
going to be using one phone for
literally all of them so where do you
stand on this particular question we're
going to hash this out a little bit
later but where do you stand on specs
versus experience let's put that way um
well I think like three out of pretty
much everyone said so far but one kind
of baguettes the other doesn't it i mean
you know when lon was talking about the
Moto e earlier he was talking about how
it slowed down sometimes you know it's
good phone you know for what it was for
the price point but you know it slowed
down sometimes you know struggled a
little bit here and there and it's it's
one of those things where you know if
you did a direct spec by spec comparison
with a flagship phone you know not
thinking about cost whatsoever the Moto
e is clearly an inferior device that
offers an inferior you know user
experience in comparison to say a
motorola x 2014 edition you know same
manufacturer pretty much the same
software but the specs matter vary
greatly in both price and you know price
and experience so that's it you know I'm
I lean toward specs because you know in
virtually every instance specs almost
guarantees a at least a more smooth user
experience even if the user experience
itself is not optimal like you know i've
been using TouchWiz for two years now
I've had my note 3 for 2 years I am NOT
a huge fan of TouchWiz but the
Snapdragon 800 the three gigs of ram you
know the 32 gigabytes of storage you
know that that's the hardware package
that at the time I really wanted and
I've been able to kind of disregard the
things I dislike about TouchWiz in order
to have that kind of you know device
that has that kind of power to as you
know you say the one phone that i use to
review all of the apps tonight all the
apps that i do um and that's why I got
the Nvidia shield tablet / say the Nexus
9 because you know it's the quad core
over the dual-core you know they're both
pretty much stock Android so it's not
like that matters at all but you know
it's just I like having a lot of power
cuz I know that its software can be
fixed hardware cannot so you know I try
to tend to lean towards something that's
gonna make me happy hardware wise and
then either hope that you know the
software gets better or root my device
and install a rom with software that I
prefer okay I mean I love that you
brought up the spec idea where where you
stand on leaning towards specifications
just a little bit because I i think i
think my tastes have really evolved over
the past year or so because while i
would love to say that you know oh all i
need is a moto g that's all I need you
know it gives me what I it gives me the
ability to use the apps that I want and
blah blah blah I don't play dead trigger
on the highest level of graphics quote
unquote you know like I don't do stuff
like that but now that we're coming into
this new crop of flagship devices you
know we have HTC here and I'm holding my
m9 that that's being reviewed currently
I'm holding my m9 right now and it's got
a great design on it and it's it may not
have changed a lot from before but it
kind of refined it it's not as slippery
as the m8 which kind of would have made
sense to me last year if they came out
with this uh-oh campaign I hate saying
that but if it came out with this little
warranty warranty program where
basically if you drop your phone and I
mean that if you drop it it says free
one time phone replacement within 12
months of your purchase of the phone for
carrier switching or damage and now
that's a pretty interesting III ideas
the fact that you know I could drop this
phone well not this one I didn't buy
this one but yeah I could drop the phone
i buy from HTC crack the screen go to a
store and say hey I new one please and
basically they would say okay no
questions asked that's that's
essentially the ideal part of this so
which kind of brings me to this other
question that I had where user
experience doesn't necessarily mean just
software it doesn't mean the congruence
of the hardware with the software with
the specifications but there are also
those perks that you get with a phone
and an HTC started at last year with the
crap i'm linking on the name but they
had a warranty programs
advanta vonage you see advantage they
had last year within now they have this
even better version I suppose you could
say with this uh which they really need
to change that name the doo doo perks
like this have any any any uh any step
what's the term looking for done does it
help at all in terms of how you feel
about a phone before anybody answers
this can I just get it out of the way
that we're assuming that this new
warranty program is not related to the
HTC CEO stepping down well I was
wondering if we were gonna bring that up
because yeah the CEO stepped down and
then cher Wang who when I was at HTC
frequencies and she came by and spoke to
all of us press in that room she you
know I have to say and I'm just putting
this out there for the record it's great
that she is not a CEO we have more women
in higher positions across the board and
HTC is going to be one of those shining
beacons for stuff like that if she's an
incredibly smart woman graduated from
Berkeley and she's she's she's I think
she'll do fine there but my question to
you feisty since you brought it up why
would they coincide oh well there's two
ways of looking at it first of all mr.
CEO steps up and says you know what
let's give everybody a free phone so to
speak you know and then the board steps
in it says now you're fired the flip
side he knew he was sleeping but studies
the flip side of course is you know he's
disgruntled he knows he's leaving so
he's like you know what I'm gonna give
everybody a free phone now we're gonna
laugh both of these off but you know you
always have to wonder if something like
that is legitimately at play or if this
is you know obviously it's going to be
how it is moving forward and I hope that
that is HTC's policy but that's why I
brought that up just almost for the
laughs yeah almost and you're right it
does sound laughable both of those
situations really but oh man I hadn't
thought about it that way I I always
maybe I'm naive but whenever something
happens in the company I just see it for
what it is
you step down and now cher Wang is uh is
the CEO rather than thinking that
something very nefarious is going on
which is almost always the case e oh but
yeah so back to our question there and
yes that's it that was this very
interesting point to bring up so thanks
for that feisty and the where was I
going before oh um do the perks of what
a company is doing for a phone actually
help in terms of its experience overall
cuz maybe looking outside of the phone
itself let's think outside of the box um
you know do do you think that people
would buy let's say the HTC One m9
solely not solely but partially because
of this program um in this case with the
HTC One m9 I think so because you see
all of the uh you know the overheating
rumors that are going around and you
know people are legitimately worried
that they're gonna get this phone and
the processor is gonna blow up out of
the back of the phone because it's
overheating and you know so you see
something like HTC stepping in like look
if the phone screws up we're gonna give
you another one you know so you don't
have to worry about it you know at least
if you don't have to worry about at
least the first one and I think that's
gonna help you know alleviates a lot of
the trepidation that goes into buying a
phone that you know pretty much all the
way up to let's launch is gonna have to
deal with these you know overheating
rumors you know until you guys you know
until all the reviewers you know all you
guys get the final software and can show
one way or another if it is going to
overheat I mean like HTC One devices
have been you know hot forever the the
one m7 was a really warm device I assume
the One m8 was I mean it's made out of
aluminum it's a natural heat sink but
you know like looking at the you know
the that one report that showed the HTC
One m9 is like bright orange and
everything else is like dark red showing
the super hot and you know could burn
people you know having you know a
something in place having a backdoor to
you know to fix a problem like that um I
mean at least you know I'm gonna buy the
HTC One m9 regardless of whether or not
it overheats and I like knowing that I
can get that protection plan and be
totally okay with it so I think that it
does the outside peripherals do in you
know help with the customer experience
at least make them feel more comfortable
with the
potential flaws of the phone that they
might be getting okay um lon let's say
you're a klutz let's say you drop phones
all the time like you you you go to the
restroom you do your business and the
thing falls in the toilet like let's say
stuff like that happens from time to
time Deadwood with that would something
like this program make it easier for you
to have that peace of mind is it because
let's put it this way the HTC One m9
when you compared to the other phones in
the genre in the flagship space i should
say you don't get all of those
specifications you don't get let's say
the 16 megapixel camera of the s6 which
i gave a pretty rave review on in my
review we have yet to see what HTC has
in store for this 20 megapixel one now
that we have you know final software
coming out and stuff you don't get a
quad HD display you do get an aluminum
body which is nice but then the s6 does
have a metal frame also so is that it is
is a program like oh actually enough to
sort of alleviate those holes in the m9
s philosophy I don't I don't know if
it's enough to really likes way users
one way or another but i think it is
like a really good incentive for like
what they're doing because like i think
at least for like the average consumer i
think this is something that they would
want as far as being able to carry their
phone and not have to worry if they're
going to damage it like they're just
going to be stuck with it forever not
that they've broken it or whatever and
but now they can just replace it because
this program and like that's one thing
about android phones is you can't like
you don't have the option to just walk
into like a carrier store and be like my
phone's messed up and you get a
replacement like on the spot but this is
like kind of the next best thing with
what HTC is doing so you know i mean if
you break the screen or if it gets the
water damage or whatever like you can
just send it in and you get another one
so it's like it's no questions asked
which is to me it's like it doesn't
appeal to me personally because i i'm
not like a klutz like I'm pretty careful
with my phones and stuff but I mean if I
if I wasn't that type of person then
like this would be like I think it would
definitely sway me into getting the
device and uh and I hate to like you
know pull like a company like Apple into
the conversation but you know like like
all my friends are like own iPhones like
one thing when their phones get messed
up they just walk into the apple store
and they just get another one no
questions asked and this like type of
incentive like it's pretty close to that
pretty much because you don't really
have that same advantage with android
phones are also I think they're doing
the fact that all the iphone users I
know have had replaced their iPhones
like so many times yeah they just walk
into apple store and like they just get
another one like I've even had friends
that like faked that their phone was
messed up just so they get a different
one because there they had a ding on it
or something so it's this is like kind
of the next best thing and there I don't
think there's any other company that's
doing anything to like it so and it's
kind of hard to do with android phones
there's so many of them yeah for sure so
I mean it there might be a little bit of
incentive coming from HTC with this
program whether or not because one of
the first things you have to do is and
this is how it's always been HTC's
problem it's this is no secret to
anybody who follows the industry but HTC
basically has this main problem of they
have a great idea they have a great
product but they just cannot market the
thing like well enough so that everybody
knows i agree with you it would be a
good swaying option for people to say
you know i can get a really great phone
and then if i drop it in the toilet or
something i can get a replacement i keep
saying drop it in the toilet because i
knew somebody who had that chronic
problem it was always dropping in the
toilet for some reason so i'm just
harking back into that but anyway uh
yeah if HTC is going to offer something
like that how good is it even going to
be unless people know that that's a
thing and yeah that's that's something
that I was wondering too like how are
they going to market this thing because
I hope like they're actually going to
advertise it and not just like put like
a piece of paper and the best advantage
was right it wasn't that what that was
its yeah yeah it's just a piece of paper
in the box but they never really said I
don't think there was ever any
advertisements for it so I think they
would have to really push this if they
really want to
sort of throw it out there as like sort
of almost like a feature I guess the
phone well I mean didn't you see those
you know those Robert Downey jr. videos
i'm pretty sure the third one where he's
woken up in a firefight in a military
uniform I think that was supposed to be
about the Oh plan because you know he
had the grenade as an O and he plugged
it into the wall socket or the light
socket which totally embodies the Oh
experience totally I'm being sarcastic
guys if you could figure say you made
sense of any of those videos I am
impressed I just I we've been talking
about HTC marketing for like you know
going on five minutes and no one has
brought up the Robert Downey jr. videos
yet so I felt like I had to well for
sure we will add frequencies we got a
glimpse at did they show because I
didn't see the entire the entire
presentation was that South by Southwest
right or am I wrong well I don't know
okay I'm trying to word they they posted
them I knew that at South by Southwest I
think HTC was inviting people to come by
and they were going to show off all of
the videos that he did was it did you
guys see that one with a buddy no I've
only seen the first three the first 30
I've I've not seen a single one okay
that wasn't sure if they showed that one
because I had seen that one so if they
didn't show it I can't talk about it so
there you go yes yes they did show
caught a clip of all 10 of them assuming
that's that's all there is but the 10 of
them yeah the bunny shows up at least
twice oh okay there you go so I was just
curious of you if you guys saw I would
like that was probably the oddest one of
the bunch of my opinion this is what I
was saying um yeah but in any case this
will be a nice way for me to transition
into actually I do want to bring up the
s6 I mean obviously I just got done with
the review we lord knows I'm I'm through
talking about it for hours on end 17 to
be exact inside 17 minutes to be exact
inside my video but it's the so we're
going to look at a different perspective
when it comes to user experience so HTC
is putting out this this warranty
program and you know maybe you're not
getting all of the specifications that
lets say the s6 has quad HD display the
metal on there but I'm going to circle
back a little bit to where we were Joe
and I were basically on the same
age where we were saying that
specifications really do drive the
experience and if you are going to be
the spec or let's say then it could it
could pretty much they can pretty much
mean that you're going to get a great
experience on the phone because they
should go hand in hand but that hasn't
been the case for the past like couple
years especially when it comes to phones
like let's say samsung galaxy s5s for
you get the best processor in there but
then it's still a stuttery experience
dropped frames everywhere and it's it
gets slower over time but speaking as
the person who has been using the new
flagship so far we're not we're finally
passed that point for this year the
great specifications are coming up and
the s6 is a great example of how I mean
they are using the XE knows from their
in-house processing team but man this
thing flies I've had no slowdowns
whatsoever now we finally did we finally
did get a great software experience a
great user experience in the s6 but it's
without a couple of key features like
the replaceable battery the expandable
storage how do you what do you guys
stand on this never-ending debate of
whether or not Samsung brought
everything that they could do you think
that the replaceable battery is
important or do you think that
expandable storage is more important
considering that the phone has a great
freakin experience underneath um I'm
yeah I don't have a whole lot to say
about Samsung because I haven't used the
s6 yet but um you know I've thought
about you know the expandable storage
being a big deal that they got rid of it
but then they turned around and gave us
what was it like 32 64 and 128 gigabyte
options yeah so I think that you know
that the problem that that that caused
the rise of expandable storage to begin
with is kinda like not there with the
Samsung Galaxy s6 you know cuz back then
you know like back in the day you used
to have like what you know for 8
gigabytes sometimes less than that of
internal storage and if you wanted
anything on your phone you had to have
you know expandable you know expandable
storage and i remember when i got the i
had a nexus floor for app testing for a
long time and it was an 8 gigabyte model
and I hated it I hated the fact that I
owned it
phone in this day and age our smartphone
this day in age only had eight gigabytes
of storage and there was no way for me
to expand that but you know if you're
walking into the store and you know you
have 50 gigs of music and you buy a
hundred twenty eight gigabyte samsung
galaxy s6 you're not even hitting half
of your storage you know you still have
half of your storage left so I think
that you know like that the people that
you know still want the SD card space on
top of the hundred twenty eight gigs of
storage those people are there not a lot
of them you know people who actually
need you know a hundred and eighty
hundred ninety 256 gigabytes of storage
on a smartphone those people are
extremely few and extremely far between
well I'm so excited to agree with you
but on or twenty eight gigabytes you
know I mean Apple kind of proved it here
you're not going to get everything
without paying everything and Samsung is
going to have that model now the 128
gigabyte version is probably going to be
through the roof in terms of what its
price is going to be all two words there
bud carrier subsidies that solves all
problems like it's gonna be what two
hundred and ninety-nine bucks on Verizon
and t-mobile and i know i don't know how
carrier subsidies work you know overseas
so I'm sorry to our European and Asian
and you know African listeners good i
don't know how your paradigms work over
there but at least here in North America
you know we're gonna be able to get this
phone for three hundred dollars or less
I assume anyway like it seems like
they're gonna be able to do something
like that so you know when you look at
it that way you know like if I can walk
into a store and spent three hundred
dollars on the you know the LG g4 note
or whatever the hell they're doing this
year or walk away with a galaxy s6 with
what amounts to my laptop's SSDs worth
of storage for 300 bucks and they're
both the same price like I'm you know
I'm gonna go with 128 gigs like it it
went from being a deficiency to being
almost a feature because I mean how many
other phones out there that offer that
much space even with expandable storage
because you know 128 gigabyte microSD
cards that they aren't popular yet and
they're still really expensive so you
know assume you get a 64 gig card and
pop it into a 32 gigabyte phone you
still have less than 100
now so even with you know it's the 128
gigs you know you don't have to buy the
64 gig card and you still have more than
pretty much everybody who's not willing
to spend you know a hundred bucks on 128
gigabyte you know card you know you're
not more than everybody still even
without the expandable storage so I you
know battery is an entirely different
thing altogether but in terms of
expandable storage I think the point is
almost totally moot like I don't think
it matters because they do have that
option for people who need that much
storage okay so cold hard numbers for
jogging knee and house todo yo you still
don't have honor in 28 you don't even
have a hundred but it's very true if you
have a 32 gigabyte what the 64 gigabyte
card in there but I guess where I was
coming from with it is if yes to the
people who are the super power users who
install every single game in the in the
play store and have absolutely no space
on their on their phones I mean I've had
a 64 gigabyte one plus one and it was a
pretty sublime experience I could
download every single podcast there ever
was and still be ok but for the for the
s6 if I'm using it just for on the daily
for the very things that I need I don't
even use half of that storage and it
doesn't really matter to me that there
are those holes in the specifications
like the battery and the SD card because
the experience as a whole is amazing and
technically it's half because of the
specifications because of how good that
processor is on top of a good experience
on the software long you use the you use
technically both phones but you focused
on the edge back at mwc was it not
already a greater experience and touch
with and it has ever been to you yeah I
mean absolutely i mean it was so much it
felt I mean obviously a pit played with
it you know for a short amount of time
but it felt so much faster and it was
such a lighter experience I mean you
could see right off the bat that it was
cleaner it was lighter and it's just all
the animations seem just half a step
quicker than before so it was just a
much better it just truly feels like and
let me preface this by saying the m9 the
same way it's
it screams it absolutely screams it
flies through everything we have a user
experience versus specifications to me
in the flagship space of course they're
going to be one in the same which is why
I thought that this debate question was
so interesting because I felt like we
were going to end up in this in this
space it's when you factor in the
mid-range devices that things get a
little bit more convoluted and I and I
and I think that's also expected from us
but so for free lon do you use micro SD
cards or any of those extra features and
all of your phones i mean we could even
talk about the edge are you going to use
the edge if you get that boat i mean i
don't know like i'll find out once i
actually get it but I mean I'm just the
thing about the edge that I'm so
enamored with it's just the swiping
experience I just like swiping along
those edges it just feels a lot nicer
especially with all the elements that
come out from the sides like from all
the apps and stuff it just it just seems
to kind of make sense more with those
edges so but as far as like you know the
features like the people edge like and
night clock I mean I'll have to find out
once i actually get it and use it as a
daily but as far as like you know like
I'm removable like removable batteries
and like micro SD cards and stuff like I
don't know maybe I'm in the minority but
I'm not a fan of moving parts so for me
like the less moving parts the better so
I've never really been a fan of like
micro SD cards and and removable
batteries like even when I had like
phones that had those features like the
galaxy s wand galaxy s2 I never really
took advantage of them like I never you
know bot like spare batteries just so I
can have spare batteries and just swap
it out on the go like I didn't feel like
you know like I'm that much of a nerd
I'd like to do that lookups care like
Carrie like spare batteries in my pocket
like and like nowadays like like power
packs like a dime a dozen so like why
don't just carry a power pack like Oh
guys the only advantage that I really
see from like having a removable battery
now is that you can swap it out if it
goes bad but that's I don't really see
anything else that you're gaining from
that so
I don't know I don't understand the
argument behind it but again like I
guess I'm in the minority and then I
don't know micro SD cards I just I just
never used them I don't know I just I
prefer just internal storage and like I
remember like that big hoop law that
like everybody made a big deal about
when Google like got rid of micro SD
cards like on the Nexus 4 and beyond and
like I was all for that change because I
under because basically the what they
said was that it created a a more
confusing user experience because when
you plug your phone in you would have
two windows that popped up and if you're
like tech-savvy you understand those
windows obviously but if you're not like
you're going to be confused as to which
one's your internal and what's your once
which one's your external so I was all
for that change like I was totally fine
with it but I began for me less moving
parts the better I just prefer to not
have that I and I feel like Samsung's
sort of you know they they sort of
alleviated that by offering 32 64 and
128 so I I don't know i don't think
there's much room to really complain
here because at least they did something
instead of still offer you 16 and 32 and
that's it at least they still did
something they took some sort of action
well that was like the evolution that we
needed right because even 16 a year ago
was starting to feel a little bit slim
and for whatever reason all the
companies were too stubborn to realize
that for the general user but yeah we're
coming up on our last let's say 15
minutes or so i want to make sure we
hear from feisty on that's on this
particular one using the s6 as a scope
we have those two main features now
Samsung has finally doubled back on what
they used to do with all other phones in
the past focused on the user experience
in the s6 but we're losing two key specs
and features using that as a scope but
you can always go off the rail a little
bit if you want to elaborate feisty how
do you feel about the replaceable
battery feature in the expandable
storage feature let me say no you guys
are all wrong need these things you are
my jerk and finally we have a debate yes
I know we
been getting that a lot in our youtube
version of it so it's not really a
debate guy this is like my hey ready to
be topic okay alright so I'm going to
give you my personal opinion and
experiences and then I'm going to play
that devil's advocate here and stand up
for the people who want the cards and
exchangeable batteries as a personal
opinion i'm also not using any of the
micro SD card slots or external
batteries for any of the devices that
support them sorry i do have external or
micro SD cards in some of those those
devices but there's absolutely no
substitute for internal storage and i
don't care how much for example music
you can install on an SD card and plug
in if you can't install the app to run
the music you're toast doesn't matter so
that no substitute for internal storage
same thing with batteries like lon said
power packs are cheap so our USB cables
I've got them everywhere doesn't matter
where I go in my world house car the
backpack there is a power supply and
there's a USB cable I can plug in keep
my devices one hundred percent all day
long who cares about the battery life
now playing that devil's advocate now
the microSD card Joe you brought up a
great point in that you know these do
we're gonna be able to buy the s6 for
example for 300 or less subsidized but
what how much would it be if you got the
lower end one and purchased your own
micro SD card my question not so much
question but point is internal storage
seems to be triple the price of micro
sd's right now yeah so to be able to get
a 32 gig device and plug in 128 gig SD
card would still be a hundred bucks 200
bucks whatever the price is less
expensive than just straight up buying
128 gig you know device in the first
place well you got to remember bud that
you know the internal storage on a
device is you know it's a different
storage system you know an SD card is
you know it's just your standard little
flash storage you know chip but you know
that the stuff that goes into android
especially the Galaxy S series
you know they have the the whole new
storage thing that they're doing this
year that's supposed to you know
increase reliability and increased
ability increased performance all that
jazz you know of course will we won't
know until the future if any of those
things are true but it's it's not like
they just you know took a 128 gigabyte
you know sandisk uh SD card and soldered
it onto the motherboard you know I mean
that this is is it's a different system
entirely and it should my experience you
know I've had infinitely number you know
I've had several uh you know micro SD
cards fail on me just outright fail
where you know I've never had the
internal storage go bad and you know
I've you know rocked my internal storage
the last three years since I started
working at android authority you know
I've downloaded 60 games in the last you
know 10 days and you know my my internal
storage is still going strong but the
last 64 gigabyte card I bought is in the
trash so you know i think it's it's not
just you know you're paying for its you
know cheaper stores you're also getting
something that at least as far as i know
at least as far as i know i don't have
any size to back this up you're getting
something that's more reliable and
something that works better with you
know the other internals of the system
and if Samsung's claims are correct
something that's actually faster and
more reliable I zari with you personally
but devil's advocate at devil's advocate
says why are you abusing your internal
storage with things like mp3 files and
JPEGs when those could just be you know
they do not need the high speed just
dump them off on the micro SD card
distribute that performance and you know
the wear and tear on your storage yeah
that's that's a good angle because i
like i mentioned much earlier in the
podcast i had to give my mother a 64
gigabyte card just for all the pictures
that she was taking there's nothing else
on that thing she won't even know how to
put anything else on there it's just the
picture so that's interesting angle well
i mean again it's it comes from the
standpoint of reliability like me
personally I've had every 64 gigabyte
microSD card I've ever owned has died
um I'm I I currently have a 32 gigabyte
and my in my note 3 right now because my
64 gigabyte died and eight on the face
of it you're right assuming zero percent
chance of failure you win I can argue
that however given the fact that you
know SD micro SD cards generally at
least anecdotally in my experience fail
a whole lot more often than internal I
mean I've never had an internal internal
storage go bad on me once never and I
have owned well over a dozen Android
devices for going on five years now but
I have had about half of the micro SD
cards that I've bought eventually died
on me so you know I put all my mem p3s
on there i put all the wear and tear on
the SD card and then the SD card dies i
have to go buy another one i have to
sync everything all over again hopefully
i backed up my picture some wire damn
and you know rebuild the experience that
I was you know hoping to avoid by not
using the internal storage which
probably would have lived through the
experience anyway you know agreed agreed
ok and final point on micro SD cards
again this last week did the factory
reset what was actually was my wife's
nexus 7 that you know halfway through
the process of backing up all her files
and transferring her pictures onto a
laptop so they were stored for later she
was like can't we just pull out the card
so here she is she's not she's not with
us she's not one of us our level of
users here she just wears the simple
answer and to be honest I think a micro
SD card is a simple answer again for the
mp3 files the JPEGs exactly what Josh
was saying with his mother and the
samsung phone they're just you know the
simplicity of it for those external
files is I think not having it on the
new galaxy s6 is and you know it is a
loss at do I care personally now but it
is a loss I can see where people would
be angry um I can't even argue that
point that's that's right because you
know getting stuff off of phones on two
computers is probably
the most difficult you know common user
experience that Android has to offer and
being able to pop out the card and put
it in the old you know SD card reader
and slipping it into the computers way
easier than you know finding the cable
plug in and transferring everything
sinking everything uploading it to the
cloud and then downloading it to the
computer now you're absolutely right on
that point um especially if you're doing
a factory reset or frequently you know
be able to just pull the carb reset put
the card back in and you're essentially
done is that's magic yet definitely
there's one of the arts of tech that
we're never going to get that that that
easy way of doing it like I mentioned in
the last podcast I wait printers are
still the worst thing to troubleshoot
all time be right I am I was laughing on
the inside so hard there because I can't
we just take the card out and make so
much sense does it like exactly that
sorry I think I dinner up did you Joe
are you gonna say I was gonna say the
writ on the battery excited and say
anything about the battery side of
things on the battery side of things I
am a root user and I acknowledge as a
root user that I am a fantastic minority
when it comes to android as a whole but
there you know when my nvidia shield is
messing up and i want to restart it
really quick i really miss being able to
just tear off the back and pull the
battery out you know the pull battery
reboot you know method that has been the
I mean it was almost a catch phrase in
the root community for like two or three
years with the phone oh it's not working
pull the battery pull the battery pull
the battery and now you know it with the
with non removable batteries it's like
all right well now hold power for like
30 seconds if that doesn't work kind of
tap it a few times and hold power for
another 30 seconds and maybe it'll
restart try holding one of the volume
rocker buttons you know and I have once
SAT here for 45 seconds you know my i
was updating my Nvidia shield tablet i
forgot to wipe my cash and thing was
boot looping on me so I was just sitting
i SAT here for almost two minutes just
holding the power button down until the
damn thing turned off so you know like
for in terms of like troubleshooting and
engaging in probably the most successful
IT it you know advice of all time which
is turning it off and turning it back on
again you know by not having
removable battery you have literally
killed that like you know who's gonna
want to sit around for you know 90
seconds holding the power button going
why isn't this just working you know so
I especially if something goes wrong
like your display quicksand you can't
see what's what's happening and you just
want to make sure that device is off
until you can get it to the shop or you
know in for placement you can't tell if
it's on or off anymore but like you say
if you could just be yanked the battery
you know it's off young yeah for sure I
remember doing that a lot with my galaxy
nexus which by the way was the only fun
I ever have spare batteries for it
because the battery life on that thing
was horrendous yeah it was and I hate
the whole 30 seconds thing you need do
these people not realize 30 seconds is a
long time no I don't think really don't
alright great well we have gone at
length hear about our ideas behind the
debate between specifications which
could encompass a lot of things and user
experience which in this case we focused
on not only software and how you use the
phone on the daily but also some of the
perks that you might get since HTC was
our jumping-off point here I want to
thank all of you guys again for for
being on a lawn thank you for filling in
with fur for Andrew and and Rec she had
a great idea that we should just have no
prob just have everybody on like one big
one big phone call and were and we're
gonna have though the worst time trying
to get that thing edited and then one
day I do like seven people or something
like that but in any case I definitely
want to oh well Joe just messaged in our
chat that he was gonna talk about 64-bit
stuff so I mean definitely you can do
something quick this is gonna be like
less than three minutes um you know I
was talking earlier about you know how
I'm I lean more toward specs than user
experience now that Android has it now
that there's 32-bit and 64-bit devices
getting a 64-bit device right now is
almost kind of future proof proofing a
little bit because you know application
is going to eventually start coming out
that can use that 64-bit architecture
and you know if you know even if you
know your Moto X 2014 can't use it you
know and your Moto e even if the user
experience is fantastic
dick you know when the 64-bit apps are
coming out and people start using
Android for you know much larger much
more you know immersive applications and
games you know I mean 64-bit has a lot
of possibilities and pretty much all but
like what four or five six Android
devices are totally left out of that
because they're under spect so it's just
another really quick argument leaning on
the side of specs / user experience and
how specs can drive the user experience
is that one day um you know like after I
get my HTC One m9 anyway I'm going to be
able to say all your phones are going to
be useless eventually whereas mine is
going to be you know it's not gonna run
the latest Android or anything but I'm
going to be able to run 64-bit
applications for a good long time on
that thing and uh yeah that's something
that I'm at least personally is it cuz I
know it people are like Oh 64-bit who
cares you know people said the same
thing when Windows did 64-bit now look
who has a 32-bit windows computer
anymore feisty if you have one do you
have one I don't have two of them on my
okay so as either feisty in his a
cornucopia of unusual over there um
antiquated working on it but yet no one
has 32 bit uh computers anymore and just
like one days no one's gonna have 32-bit
android devices anymore and you know
getting in on that ground floor you know
eventually is gonna be a point where
it's like oh yeah I can get this budget
32-bit phone people going to go you know
that's us an inferior user experience
just based on the antic eight antiquated
specs or have you say that word is
antiquated yeah yeah all right I said
quiz yeah um but yeah when a student
orbit app start coming out and they
start adding so much more to the Android
ecosystem yeah it doesn't matter right
now I realize that and it might not
matter next year the year after that it
might be 23 years before we start seeing
really good 64-bit apps or even 64-bit
apps in general but eventually you know
all these 32-bit phones are going to be
freaking useless because you know you're
going to be stuck on 32-bit apps and
while the rest of the world has
graduated too much bigger and better
things so I wanted to mention that
really quick like way earlier and then I
got sidetracked and then
yeah so just wanted to mention no you're
right and I just got a message from
krushi he says yeah the 64-bit is very
important especially if you go for the
project ara phone because the Taser is
only competitive a bit 64bit zapping
yeah you don't want a 32-bit tase
because that's like a 10 exactly you
guys it's gotta be 64 I actually had an
image in my head of feisty with this HTC
Desire and all these app developers are
trying to like throw their 64-bit apps
enemies that you guys are no seas
fanaticism I don't want upgrade i wanna
be 32-bit forever change sucks well to
the point of the the pc mart of the
computer market moving a 64-bit uh i
think i think for like a minute I i was
reading up on why 64 bits better for
processing and stuff like that but
really I just did it because it felt
like that's where we were going and then
at some point all computers started to
become that and I feel like when it when
it comes to the phones all these phone
companies are going to find ways of
saying like over 64 bit processor look
amazing that is but in reality the best
thing that they could probably do is
just make them 64-bit and we won't know
the difference eventually yep so that
was kind of what I was thinking but yeah
