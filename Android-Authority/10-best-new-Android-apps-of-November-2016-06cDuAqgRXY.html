johanna the android authority app guy
and it's about that time of month who
round up the best new android apps from
the last month if you want to check out
any of these apps for yourself you can
find those links in the video
description below
Adobe released not one but three new
applications in the month of November
the first was Photoshop fixed this
application allows you to retouch photos
and it also comes with some restoration
features the second was Adobe Photoshop
sketch as the name implies this
application gives you a variety of tools
to sketch and create original pieces of
artwork that can then be ported to
Adobe's desktop apps the last one is
Adobe comp CC this one allows you to
design wireframes using images text
shapes and fonts they're all free to
download but you'll need an Adobe
Creative Cloud subscription to use all
of the features Android auto was
released to the world this last month it
was out previously but only for a few
devices whereas this release is pretty
much for everybody it integrates Android
auto directly into your device so you
don't need a smart car in order to use
it you'll be able to do a basic set of
tasks including checking and sending
messages navigation listening to music
and playlists and a whole lot more it
still needs quite a bit of work because
it's not that great just yet that said
it is free and we expect the platform to
get better sooner rather than later Auto
tools is a no root extension for Tasker
it allows you to easily create some
stuff in Tasker that would otherwise be
a little more tedious or difficult you
can have it create toasts badges time
calculations and even gestures OTO tools
also have support for data processing
chrome custom tabs a flashlight and a
lot more you can try the application out
for free for 30 days after that you can
buy the application for $2.99 brave
browser has actually been out for a long
time however it was re rebranded as link
bubble and a new brave browser was
released and instead this browser comes
with built-in adblock as well as a range
of security features and battery
optimizations to help keep things
running smoothly along with that it
supports the usual range of features
including private tabs bookmarks history
and others it's a fairly decent little
browser if you're in the market for a
new one fingerprint gestures is a fun
little customization app it allows you
to use your fingerprint sensor as sort
of a trackpad you'll be able to assign
gestures along with various tap pad
to perform various tasks for instance
you can have it show your notifications
if you swipe down it seems to work well
for the most part although some devices
seem to have better luck than others
it's a free download so you can see if
it works for you you'll need to have a
device running Android 6.0 marshmallow
at the very least learn how to draw is a
simply named application that to the
surprise of no one helps teach you how
to draw it features lessons for
beginners intermediates and even some
advanced lessons if you already know a
little bit about drawing the tutorials
were created by will Sliney who is a
well-known comic book artist and there
are hundreds of tutorials to go through
the application is reasonably priced and
you can try it out for free before
dropping the $0.99 to get the full
version Microsoft selfie is a simple
camera application that takes selfies it
features a very simple interface that
allows you to get in take your selfie
and then send it where it needs to go it
has an editing tool that lets you move a
slider back and forth according to
Microsoft the slider is backed by
technology that takes into account
things like age skin tone gender
lighting and other variables it works
pretty well if you need something simple
photoscan is an application by Google
that helps you port your actual
photographs into your device basically
it's a scanner application that helps
you scan your photographs it has a tool
that lets you outline the photo so you
can easily remove the things like the
frame or any background that you may get
once it's digital you can back it up or
post it to social media if you want to
it takes a moment to get used to but
otherwise it's a simple app to use it
also works pretty well
pulse is an SMS application that also
has cross-platform support on its own on
a single device it functions like a
simple SMS app however you can install
it on your computer tablet and other
devices and sync your SMS between all of
them you can pay a recurring monthly
subscription for multiple device
supports or you can buy a lifetime
license for $10.99 and not have to worry
about it it works pretty well although
there are some bugs as you'd expect from
a newer application it's definitely
worth the shots
snip back is a voice recording
application with some unique features it
gets the basics right and you can record
your voice share or backup that
recording and recordings are listed by
session for easy organization however
the application also includes background
noise reduction and the ability to
record audio before the app starts
running it runs as a service in the
background and you can actually recover
the last 30 seconds of audio even if
your
recording it works well enough although
running it as a constant service may not
always be the best idea and that about
does it for this one folks if you want
to keep watching we have our Android
apps weekly show linked up there on the
screen which you can check out every
Sunday to get the latest Android apps
and games news and releases if you want
to check out any of these apps again
those links are in the video description
below and keep it tuned to Android
authorities because we are your source
for all things Android thanks again for
watching everybody and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
