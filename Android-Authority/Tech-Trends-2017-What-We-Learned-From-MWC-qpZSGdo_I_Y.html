the tech trends that we learn from the
Mobile World Congress 2017 and let's
start with aspect ratios specifically 18
9 it's no surprise here we already knew
that the LG G 6 would adopt an 18 9
univision aspect ratio what LG calls
full vision and during the Mobile World
Congress we got to hear more but why LG
believes it's the future of
entertainment on both large and small
screens we also know we can expect a
similar 18 v 9 aspect ratio on the
upcoming Galaxy S 8 which is set to be
unveiled on March 29th we even got hints
that Apple is planning the same aspect
ratio for the upcoming 10th anniversary
iPhone next up is shrinking bezels and
it's not just the side bezels but those
big ass Chin's are going bye-bye
with the exception of Sony which seems
to be in love with their big top and
bottom bezels most Android OEMs are
going for super thin side bezels and
really pushing those bezels to limit LG
has done a great job with the g6 and
with the leaks of the s8 it seems like
it's going to be incredibly futuristic
the Huawei p10 has a pretty microscopic
side bezel and even Sony minimized side
bezels to razor thin status on the
Xperia x a1 and next up HDR displays HDR
displays are going to be a big trend
this year Samsung put one in the Galaxy
Tab s 3 LG put one in the g6 and Sony
put the world's first 4k HDR display on
the Xperia X Z premium the galaxy s 8
looks like it should be a shoo-in but we
can't see any reason why other
manufacturers won't do similar things in
their 2017 flagships next up fingerprint
scanner gestures
Wow yeah fingerprint scanner jesters can
be fun and surprisingly intuitive to
adapt to mizu phones have been doing
scanner gestures for years and while we
introduced the maid s a couple of years
back with gestures for scrolling through
the interface and dragging down the
notification shade something we've also
seen in the pixels but with Huawei and
Motorola dropping phones with front
mounted scanner gestures at the Mobile
World Congress it looks like this might
be a thing now for a trend I know almost
all of you care about and that is fast
charging like big bezels the days of
wireless charging now seem to be behind
us as fast charging increasingly becomes
the preferred standard over wireless
charging that trend is proprietary fast
charging technology though watching
battery charging demos is quite
literally as boring as watching a
battery charge but what's going on
inside these demos is actually pretty
mind-blowing obviously getting the edge
over the rivals fast charging solution
makes for a pretty compelling selling
point what am i personally excited about
well fast charging is a cool thing I'm
looking forward to that but what I'm
really looking forward to is someone to
pull ahead and really make a leap
forward in the world of wearables I
don't want to carry around big clunky
phones and tablets I want something
that's not gonna look geeky and scare my
mother but will still give me access to
the internet without having to pull out
this chunk of metal from my pocket you
know what I'm saying
so whether that's glasses that don't
really look like geeky glasses because
snapchats spectacles art I don't even
know I feel like I live in the freaking
twilight zone sometimes who is gonna
wear that stuff who is gonna wear that
stuff it'd be taken seriously I don't
know I know Josh likes it but
these guys will remember from like 15
years ago when people were making money
hands over fist in the dot-com bubble
remember we didn't call it a dotnet
bubble or dot org bubble we didn't call
them dot biz billionaires we called them
dot-com billionaires because that's the
power of a dot-com now why is that
because no domain name extension tells
your story with the same degree of trust
as a dot-com or dotnet domain name.com
and dotnet domain name extensions inject
credibility into your online presence
