devices that goes from X skips Y and
jump straight to Z now lenovo is also
plainly seen on the boxes for these
phones but that's where a lot of the
changes only starts is this the new
evolution for at least moto but also
perhaps for smartphone technology itself
well it's time to find out because it's
Joshua Vergara from Android authority
what's going on everybody and we have
here the Moto Z and the Moto Z force
now we are dealing with two different
devices here and the Moto G Force is the
heftier and somewhat more capable
smartphone but the gap between these two
is actually not all that significant so
where applicable I will mention what the
differences are between these two but
for the most parts in this review I will
be focusing on the heftier Moto Z force
now as I already mentioned the Moto G
Force is the larger of the two devices
with a couple more millimeters of
thickness and a significant increase in
heft now while it does pack a little bit
more in its body as a result credit
still has to go to moto for creating the
Moto Z which is one of the thinnest and
certainly one of the lightest devices
out there when compared to other phones
with 5.5 inch screens a textured power
button makes it easy to access and is
low enough on the device to make it easy
for a thumb to reach though the flatter
Moto Z is smoother on all sides the
extra heft adds a chamfer to the force
and you may notice by looking at all of
the sides that there's only one port on
the phone now a USB type-c connector
that sits alone without a headphone jack
overall there's something really lenovo
liked about these phones and that
doesn't come with as much of a surprise
but it is definitely noticeable you have
an eye-catching all-metal design here
but it is also very fingerprint prone
just as much as it is very shiny and
also that camera optic package at the
top really sticks out a lot again it's
eye-catching but not necessarily ideal
thankfully there is a remedy included in
the box and that will be our first
introduction into the Moto Maude's
found at the top and bottom of the
devices are magnets along with a bunch
of connectors and that's where the Moto
mods will do their magic but for now we
have the Moto covers dark wooden covers
were included with both of our devices
and plenty more will be made available
for further customization but at the
very least these covers already cover up
the connectors all of the fingerprints
and makes the camera optic package flush
with the body now I wouldn't be
surprised if anyone put these covers on
their phones and thought that's more
like it
indeed it does feel like the covers need
to be on these devices and as you can
see you have two different looking
phones here because those covers really
add a different look to them so we're
excited to see what the new covers will
look like for further customization but
from there you have a pretty hefty
device in the Moto Z force and when you
put that cover on it
ads like 30 grams more to the weight but
there's something to be said about
having a thicker device not only do you
get a larger battery which is the case
here but when you have a phone that is
this thick and also this heavy it also
feels much more secure on the hand now
reaching from side to side is not all
that difficult with these phones but
because of a pretty large bezel on the
bottom and on the top of the device you
are going to have a little bit of
trouble reaching up and down on these
phones both of these phones come with
5.5 inch AMOLED displays coming in a
quad HD resolution with 535 pixels per
inch now that means that collars look
pretty good on here as is expected from
AMOLED but if they are punched out just
a little bit too much you can always
tone them down in the settings text is
also quite sharp with that high pixel
density but everything from media
consumption to reading websites and even
reading text has been very enjoyable on
here and we had a great time gaming with
games like Pokemon go and Final Fantasy
7 it is nice to have the moto display
returning here and it does benefit from
the AMOLED screens now the Moto z-force
does come with a bit of a advantage here
with the shatter shield display now
those are a bunch of layers that are on
top of the already existing display
which will keep it from shattering or
cracking if you happen to drop the phone
from typical Heights onto typical
surfaces but of course this is not a
ruggedized phone even if it does have
some water resistance and of course even
if your screen doesn't crack there are
other parts of your phone that might not
fare all that well now performance is
where you would expect it to be with the
Snapdragon 820 and the audrina 530 and 4
gigabytes of RAM pretty much powering
all of the experiences you have in the
Moto version of Android now some credit
can be given to the Moto version of
Android because it is a lot more like
stock Android than plenty other OEM
skins but even then it's still quite
snappy very smooth and multitasking is
still able to go along without any
issues and all of that is still
considering all of the red icons you can
see in the app drawer designating all of
Verizon's bloatware put on these devices
now that said it is a bummer that these
funds are only available on one carrier
but at least on that carrier you're
getting one of the best networks out
there onboard storage can be either 32
or 64 gigabytes in capacity but a micro
SD card slot is available to make sure
you never run out of space now the
fingerprint reader found below the
display is a wonderful
former it's easy to set up and it
actually responds in pretty much no time
it's an easy way of waking up and
unlocking the device simultaneously and
there's actually an extra function
programmed into it by holding on to that
fingerprint reader from pretty much any
screen inside of the Android interface
you can actually lock the device easily
that's a really nice touch no pun
intended it took us quite a while to
stop pressing it like it was a
capacitive home button and the reason
why we still think that sometimes is
because the soft keys slide out of view
when you're in full-screen situations
there are four microphones strong about
the device and all of them help not only
with moto voice activations but without
bound audio on calls people we call told
us that sound was really clear and that
makes a lot of sense to us especially
since two microphones are found at the
bottom of the front of the device the
same can't be said however of the
speaker that is at the top of the device
in that earpiece
unfortunately its sound is just not all
that loud enough despite being
front-facing and there's not a whole lot
of body to it either which brings us to
a pretty polarizing detail about the new
moto line the lack of a headphone jack a
lot of people have headphones that they
are really wanting to use with these
phones and by using an adapter it's just
an extra piece of kit that you might end
up losing somewhere in your bag or even
just in general and even then if you
want to listen to music or podcasts or
any type of content while charging your
phone how exactly are we supposed to do
that the Moto z-force has the larger
battery at 3,500 milliamp hours which is
bigger than that of the Moto Z which has
2600 milliamp hours in its battery
however it really means that you're
going to have to pick between the two if
you really need to be more of a power
user and have a longer-lasting battery
but thankfully powering up these devices
is not all that difficult as both of
them come with turbo charging blocks
battery life has been for the most part
decent I was able to get about three and
a half hours on the Moto Z's smaller
battery and about four to five hours of
screen on time on the Moto G force now
this included camera usage some gaming
and a lot of usage on YouTube and
powering up the devices like I said is
already easy because the turbo chargers
come in at 15 watts for the Moto Z and
30 watts for the Moto Z force now using
the correct chargers for either of these
devices I was able to get
from zero to 50 percent in about half an
hour and even then if you're really
hurting for power on the Moto z-force
and in this case the Moto Z you can
always slap on one of the Moto mods
how'd you like that segue now battery is
always in demand and thankfully in
scipios off-grid power pack is one way
that you can get even more on the Moto
mod connector
essentially it's 2200 milliamp hours in
just the case itself adding to what is
already found inside of the Moto Z and
the Moto Z force respectively that means
4800 for the Moto Z and for the Moto Z
force 5700 power from the power pack is
drained either regularly to keep the
phone as charged as possible or in an
efficiency mode that does enough to keep
the phone at 80% as long as I can now in
terms of screen on time these batteries
got me at least an hour to an hour and a
half more once slapped onto the phone at
single digit percentages when I really
needed it the other two moto mods are
the instant share projector add-on and
also the JBL sound boost speaker now
like I already mentioned there will be
another video detailing these mods but
in a nutshell these are pretty
convenient and nice peripherals to have
but they pale in comparison to
standalone solutions like Bluetooth
speakers or pico projectors and even
then they are pretty expensive now it's
easy to throw the word modularity around
but that's not really what the Moto Z
and the Moto G force are doing so moving
forward we're just going to be calling
them mods and you'll notice that we
never used the word modularity in this
review but if modularity or in this case
mods are going to be the future of
smartphone devices well we have to give
moto a lot of credit for executing them
pretty well
now the usefulness of these moto mods
might still be in question it might
still need to prove itself but the most
practical of the three thus far is
definitely the battery case and that's
enough to get us excited for what might
be a very colorful future for the Moto
mods the cameras are different between
these two devices but really only in one
main detail the Moto G force has a 21
megapixel camera while the Moto zeef has
a 13 megapixel rear facing camera and
the front-facing cameras are all 5
megapixels with a front-facing flash as
well the apps are pretty simple to use
and they don't really get in your way in
the viewfinder unless you get into the
professional mode where things could get
out of hand pretty quickly but that said
if you're in the regular video or photo
modes you just have to tap onto a
subject and it auto focus is pretty
quickly and then the actual shutter to
file time is really quick now we can
talk about the different megapixel
counts and in these photos that you're
seeing here the Moto Z force does have a
little bit more detail when zoomed into
the same area of a photo compared to the
Moto Z but the good news here is that
everything else including the processing
is about the same between the two so
unless you actually want that extra
amount of detail or you want more
megapixels in your camera then you can
make your pick between the Moto Z and
the Moto Z force we start off with
self-portraits which include a
beautification mode now first for Moto
but definitely not a first for lenovo it
mainly enhances the clarity and the
colors while smoothing out the lines on
the face a front-facing flash makes a
welcome return it might be a little bit
more useful for the vast majority of
people out there when you're in a dark
situation or you just need to light
yourself up onto a very bright
background modes on the main cameras
include 4k video recording which is
always nice and it benefits from the
optical image stabilization it also
seems that video is somewhat being used
in the panorama mode where you can just
quickly sweep from one side to the other
and it seems like it's recording the
video which will then stitch together a
full photo now this doesn't mean that
stitching can be a little bit tough but
the main issue that we had with it is
that in low-light situations the slower
shutter speed needed to expose the photo
properly means that photos in panorama
can be pretty blurry HDR can be on auto
when shooting in the normal photo mode
and it does a pretty good job of
enhancing the photo the effect is pretty
noticeable in the heightened shadows the
higher clarity and definitely the
punched up colors especially when used
in the right situations HDR can be a
very viable tool well overall pictures
do look pretty good with accurate colors
meaning that the saturation is not
really overdone the majority of pictures
keep from looking too dull but if you do
get a dull photo you just have to pop on
that HDR and you'll get a better looking
photo probably more pleasing to the eyes
the only real places that the moto Z and
the Moto Z force suffer are in lower
light situations we do notice a little
bit of noise reduction happening and
even bright photos not a whole lot as
the detail is still definitely there but
this noise reduction gets worse and
worse as the light gets dimmer add to
that the fact that you need to have a
very steady hand endure
situations because the night mode
requires the shutter to be open for a
long amount of time so if you're not
steady you might get a pretty blurry
photo overall though the Moto Z line
does a good job of being a companion to
the photographer on the daily and
finally we can take a look at the
software in these devices which are
marshmallow powered pretty much stock
versions of Android you get everything
you would expect from a stock version of
Android including the app drawer all the
different quick settings in the
notification drop-down and it looks a
lot like what you would expect a nexus
would have which is really great because
the extras that moto puts into here
aren't really in your face but they're
definitely there and are definitely
useful and those come in the form of the
Moto display the Moto actions and the
moto voice now the Moto display is
something we mentioned before already
and it's basically that ambient display
that allows you to action upon a number
of notifications just by waving your
hand over the device moto actions
include a few nice gestures you can use
including the double chop in order to
turn on the flashlight easily and then a
twisting motion that opens up the camera
there's also a gesture you can use to
shrink the display to make it easier to
perform on with one hand and finally
there's moto voice a great way of
customizing your own experience of the
Moto Z essentially you just repeat a
phrase a number of times and then that
is the phrase that will automatically
unlock the device and put you into a
Google Voice Search now if you remember
from the Moto X from before I said X
activate but in this case I'm using the
phrase zero help me out
moto manages to keep the good times
rolling in their version of Android that
will undoubtedly satisfy Android purists
but will also please those who need a
little bit more from their operating
systems and this is because the moto
editions are not only useful but they
are generally out of the way the Moto Z
and the Moto Z force droids are
available only on Verizon for the full
prices of 624 and 720 dollars
respectively monthly payments using
Verizon's financing put the Z at $26 a
month and the force at $30 a month there
is one undeniable fact if you're on
Verizon this is probably the phone to
beat despite changes to the overall Moto
formula the aspects that made the
previous model X devices great are still
found here in one way
the other in the case of design the Moto
X DNA is still found here only it's now
just detachable
and speaking of detachable adding the
moto mods brings versatility and if the
mods continue to bring convenient but
useful features the packages of the Moto
Z and the Moto Z force can be really
hard to pass up the new Moto's are still
worthy of their flagship designation
boasting every feature that a high-end
device should have and the user
experience that can prove reliable on
the daily we do think that the Moto mods
need may be just a little bit more time
to prove themselves hopefully more moto
mods will come out that make us even
more excited for them but it's the
potential the potential of these moto
mods that makes the Moto Z line very
exciting because they take what are
already pretty great smartphones and
they have the potential to take them to
a whole new level as always thank you
guys very much for watching and I hope
you enjoyed this review of the Moto Z
line we do think it's a great line and
they do a great job on their own but
really the Moto mods are we're putting
them over the top we just hope that more
useful accessories like this battery mod
are going to come in the future the near
future even keep it tuned to Android
Authority for even more about to the
Moto Z line and our coverage coming in
