Friday debate podcast episode number 5
discussing topics in android every
single week I am of course your host
Joshua pagar from android authority
what's going on everybody and I'm joined
by our regular panel of co-hosts we have
Joseph Indy andrew grush and Jonathan
fice how's it going all you guys hello
Internet alright cool so as always the
Friday debate podcast discusses topics
in android every week and this week
we're going to be talking about Sony but
Before we jump into our topic I want to
remind everybody especially our viewers
on the YouTube channel that you can find
the Friday debate podcast on all of the
different podcast channels from itunes
to stitch or two pocket casts so make
sure you head on over there and like I
mentioned at the end of our episode last
week we did actually rank on the top 100
of the podcast network so thank you guys
so much for putting us up there and
don't forget to keep listening and also
to reveal on the different networks that
allow you to that ups our visibility and
we would love to see what you guys think
of our podcast but nonetheless we're
going to go ahead and just jump right
into what we have this week like I said
we're talking about Sony and if you've
been following our website over the last
couple days you probably heard a little
bit of interesting news from them but
our topic will explain that so here we
go earlier this week Sony announced that
its corporate strategy for twenty
fifteen to twenty seventeen involves
taking less risk when it comes to TV and
mobile with the company and said elected
to focus most of its attention on areas
that it thinks there is room for real
growth like the PlayStation platform
whoo image sensors for mobile and camera
as well as its entertainment business
the bottom line it seems sony has lost
faith faith in mobile what went wrong
what can they do to turn things around
or are they better off cutting their
losses and selling their mobile division
just like they did with their vaio pc
division early last year all right I'm
going to open up the panel right now I
want to talk first about what went wrong
with Sony and why don't we start off
with if you're a fan of the Sony
smartphones and then you can't it can
dive into what what what what you think
went wrong with the mobile division over
at Sony any of you guys can go ahead and
start I guess I'll start there
that's all right for somebody else to go
first um but I don't know if I'm a fan
of Sony phones because I've never had
one I've seen a few of them a friend of
mine just got the the z3 see or whatever
the small one which one was that ah the
small one the z3 I oh the compact right
do you talk about the color yeah yeah
the compact one so I got to take a look
at that for a little bit and like I like
the aesthetic I like the way that they
look and you know their high-end phones
with decent specs um but i think that
the big problem is lack of availability
I we've discussed this before on this
podcast I'm almost dead sure of it but
um yeah you know you can't find a
consistent Sony experience oak across
the whole world like you can with you
know a galaxy device or you know HTC has
been doing it a lot more with their HTC
One series devices and you know you
don't see that kind of uh uh
omnipresence with sony and i think that
that's their biggest problem with with
mobiles they're just they're not in
enough places to make a big enough of a
lasting impact you know what I mean yeah
well i mean the the fact that sony isn't
necessarily a wide-reaching company is
kind of an oxymoron when you talk about
a huge company like it and I guess the
mobile division is one of the few places
that they have that problem but from
what I can tell and I have and we did
mention availability before on this
podcast and I think at that time I
mentioned that Sony seems to have a big
foothold in places like Europe and
Canada but if they're not making money
in those places I don't know maybe
they're actually not selling in Europe
and Canada that's something that seems
like a bit of an anomaly to me but why
don't we jump over to either Andrew
Jonathan either of you guys want to give
your thoughts on what kind of went wrong
with Sony's mobile division sure okay so
as far as what went wrong there's a lot
of factors I mean it's easy to say that
the whole twice a year phone you know
that they do they do 225 chips a year
definitely contributed and I think
that's true uh let's see there's that
the fact that the z3 wasn't really much
different than the z2 at all probably
didn't help um MN obviously we've talked
we've talked more than once about you
know a limited availability particularly
in the western markets
like the United States but you know I
think those are all valid points and I
think they contributed but it I think
it's more complicated than that I think
that Sony was slow to get really into
the smartphone game I mean they've been
here since the beginning don't get me
wrong but as far as truly innovating and
bringing us something wonderful I mean
you don't like display the display
technology I mean correct me if I'm
wrong but the display technology was
pretty awful for a long time right yeah
i think that the viewing angles and yeah
I remember those very well the early
xperia phones late when was it that they
addressed it with a Z 2 jobs yeah
there's you to it was definitely this
yummy busy too and so I mean it's just
it's just little stuff like that it's
like Sony's product looks good um I have
I don't have I do not own a sony mobile
device I've never owned a a sony
smartphone but i have a friend who has
the z2 and i think it's a solid answer
and I've seen others many times and I
like their the form factor I think it's
a little boring I mean it's in a way I
mean it's a square it has sharp sharp
angles um and I think that the design
has gotten a little better with az3 and
it's slowly evolved but it's been a
little boring in my opinion I think that
probably doesn't help but bottom line I
think it's just the fact that they
haven't been aggressive enough uh they
haven't you know even their software I
mean we can definitely say that it's
awesome that they don't add a lot of
blow and that's you know one of their
positives but the same time I haven't
used a lot so you can probably speak on
this a little better Josh but is there
anything like super amazing about their
software either though well from those I
know they have some yeah I mean they're
their software tends to not focus on
flash as much as the rest which was
always a plus to me and I always thought
that you know people should be flocking
to these Sony phones because they they
don't sort of punch you in the face with
all of their features the way that say a
samsung or now g phone might try to
sometimes and i don't know like while
the look of look and feel of the actual
operating system itself could use a
refresh the way that android used to
when i went from ICS to freakin
jellybean and to KitKat after that like
i do think that the sony phones i I kind
of disagree with you Andrew I don't
think that their phones are
are boring i actually think there's some
of the best made phones that are out
there well they're super super solid I
mean they are there there I've always
kind of thought and not just in phones
but just in general I've always kind of
thought of and some people might take
this negatively but I don't mean it
negatively they're kind of the apple of
non iOS and Mac world when it came to
their PCs when it came to everything
there was head kind of that you know
style that stood out that was just you
know they had the durability they had a
sleekness and I'm not an apple fan but I
admit the Apple has good aesthetics uh
to a point um and I think that Sony is
kind of the P was the windows world and
the androids world version of that in a
way and so I'm not saying they're ugly
or anything I just think that uh there
has been enough change in there the
design link which I guess was more of my
point what is that cool right before we
did this call we did sort of discuss
what our topic was going to be like how
we were going to go through it and you
mentioned under that you didn't think
I'm Sony evolved or they were very slow
to evolve in the mobile space can you
kind of elaborate on that was it really
just in terms of aesthetics and design
or did you have even more like
underneath the surface to comment on
well I mean yeah that's definitely part
of it I just think that uh I mean I'm
not gonna lie i'm not gonna say that
i've used tons of their older i mean
i've used like a what was the xperia
play the ver on verizon that was the
plaid the playstation control of you
some of the older ones but as far as
like the Erickson's and stuff i don't
have a huge amount of familiarity other
than just seeing them and passing from
other people but just seems like sony
Sony missed the boat in some ways I mean
I just feel like you know I wonder and
this is speculation but when it comes to
like software yes it's good you know
there tends to be two camps people who
like stock Android and people who
actually legitimately enjoy the extra
features that you get from you no sense
and TouchWiz the thing about Sony though
is they don't have a lot of bloat but
their aesthetics are still different
than stock too so it doesn't really I
don't know does it really appeal to the
stock crowd um or the people who want
lots of features it kind of doesn't hit
either side you know I mean okay so
that's one thing
and then i I just I mean I really yeah I
think that a lot of it just had to do
with the fact that as far as aggressive
new technologies sony has been more
tepid about it I mean it hasn't been
huge pushes forward in my opinion and
that's just my opinion okay all right
let's move on over to feisty feisty your
thoughts on Sony and what might have
gone wrong with their mobile division is
there anything left to say after Gresh
II you know I can only echo and jump off
of that you know obviously there's
availability issues there's pricing
issues I'll get into that in a second
but there's that design now we were
talking about HTC and the samsung's and
stuff of the world a few podcasts back
and you know we were talking about them
now they're innovating there the actual
design of their devices they're you know
they're going out there curved displays
all this kind of stuff and at that time
we have we kind of applauded Sony for
just sticking with it they've got a
designed and they ultimately they
haven't changed it much in the last few
and you know we praise them then but I
would have to say on the flip side right
now it's that's part of their part of
their down from using the word downfall
loosely here but and this is again was a
quick Russia was saying what's up you
know they haven't done anything extreme
examine like you know they haven't
jumped off any cliffs for us and yeah
that's gotta hurt them just a little bit
whoa but but wasn't there me I think one
of the big things is the price tag you
know when this certainly in the in the
united states this thing comes out i
look at it you know great phone i'd love
to get one that's a little bit too
expensive a few months later six months
a year whatever the price drops hey
still too expensive maybe there's one
more price drop but you know what still
can't afford it and then right there's
been three other xperia z's exactly
there's more phones out or it just
disappears inventories done that's it
it's gone so by the time you know it
becomes affordable for a lot of people
it it's done it's gone mmm well i mean
before before we get into the question
that i had in mind i did want to sort of
do a little bit of explanation the the
idea of releasing a phone every six MOS
two months that would have been the same
day hey do you have putting out a phone
every six months is actually a very at
the risk of sounding a little bit a
little bit odd here it's a very Japanese
way of business and you have constant
updates every time there might be even
just a little bit let me be just an inch
forward even when it comes to a product
they find a way to justify to put it out
it's something that a lot of the
companies happen to do in Japan that are
from Japan and it's a bit of a weird
notion to a lot of us Western users who
are used to like every year or so and
but the thing is that even the
smartphone industry itself and this is
just my opinion has made it so that we
don't necessarily have phones for a long
time anymore we actually have to plan
out to have a new phone every single
year they have put that in our minds
we're back in the day we might have had
a phone for maybe two maybe two and a
half years because those were how long
our contracts used to be before even any
upgrades were a part of the deal um but
aside from all that excuse me um its
feisty isn't there a market though for
people who want maybe going back to
basics isn't that not what sony has been
able to do with their phones as of late
to sort of create a very solid like
Andrew said an attractive phone that
doesn't necessarily have to have all the
bells and whistles that people for the
most part may not really flock to yes
for the most part but I wonder if
advertising hurts that hmm I looked at
you know followed along obviously the
Xperia z3 release and you know what I
was seeing was lots of stuff on there
triluminos display and you know they
promoted that now regular consumer I'm
assuming they don't care what the
display is motor it made out of as long
as it works and then you some of the
other things they focused on I forgive
me I forget the name of it but their
camera software word superimposes you
know jungle scenes or you know that's
sort of slow yeah that's really a are
cool but I yeah I don't think the
average Android user really they might
really enjoy having it but that's not so
to speak a selling point of the phone so
promoting all of that stuff I think
you mentioned that the Japanese market
maybe it works excellent there and the
people who are used to it you know all
the hype around the Hello Kitty's of the
world no I assume there's that benefit I
you know I'm not down down playing any
of this i'm just stating facts of
speaking for myself I don't care if
there's a cute character on the front of
the box or not I'm looking at the spec
sheet well it's been it's funny you
mentioned that goes for the record Sony
hasn't actually been the company to
really do that too often from this from
my experience over the last year or so
it's really been like LG that does that
day yeah they bring in the sponsorships
from all of these like super cartoony
characters and they're the ones who made
that one phone that it goes into a
sleeve that has a face on it and then
you can like pop it up yeah it says
hello or something laughs hey I just had
like an image in my head of like them
getting like you know they are like
Japanese come getting like like an anime
character like ash ketcham from pokemon
like I choose you LG look hahaha i buy
an LG phone again that's just so sad so
I do have that I do have two mentioned
that in every Austin in a way if he was
here but Matthew Benson's one of our
writers he lives in Japan he's lived
there for like eight years I believe
something along that line and actually
he was talking about Sony the other day
and even in their home market I think
that they're losing a little bit of of
interest though you know cuz he was
talked about how he doesn't see as many
Sony's as he used to and that's just one
man's perspective obviously but you know
we were kind of talking about that and
he said that you could see that even at
home Sony is hurting in the mobile
division it's not just the western
markets okay well you mentioned that
even at home they might be losing a
little bit of their foothold um what
what exactly do you think would have
been the reason why and and I know we
were going around talking about the fact
that they may not have evolved they
don't have much availability but is Sony
basically here's my question is Sony
basically the old manned and the old man
in the market that's starting to be
bogged down by all these hip new
companies that are coming out like the
one plus ones of the world or are they
getting it are they getting inundated
with people like Samsung and LG putting
out like nine different versions of
their flagship phone um you know I don't
think I would look at it as like an
man in a young man's world kind of thing
I would look at it is like the kid who
can't swim at the swim party like you
know sony has had like one foot in the
pool and one foot out of the pool for
all these years now with like yeah you
know we're gonna make this huge awesome
flagship phone but then we're not really
gonna do a lot with it you know we're
not going to make it overly available
we're gonna make it super expensive and
you know we're gonna see how long this
obviously winning strategy holds out and
you know while Samsung and you know HTC
and you know even HTC's losing all you
know they were losing all that money for
so long even they were like you don't
screw this i'm jumping all the way to
the pool let's do the HTC one m7 let's
release HTC Zoe to the google play store
let's do some good stuff with our mobile
you know and release the walk because
before the HTC one m7 HTC had the exact
same problem where they didn't have
phones available in all the carriers it
wasn't the same phone it was like the
HTC uh it was a she said one like MX or
something like that on AT&amp;amp;T and then it
was the evo LTE on sprint and then it
was like it's the sensation on
t-mobile's they were all over the place
with this stuff and then they buckled
down and said no we're gonna do this
right HTC one on every carrier HTC One
worldwide and now that's a brand that
they're building on and Sony already has
the brand to build on but they don't you
know if they're just there one foot in
the pool one foot out of the pool like
you know we wanted but no we know we
don't yeah you know we kind of do you
know we don't now they're like you know
what no we don't we're gonna get out of
the pool now so um but something else I
wanted to bring up real quick is uh
they've also they've had like a lot of
potential to do that flashy stuff the
crush II was talking about earlier um
because they did the the PlayStation
thing on phones right like the
PlayStation Store on phones and like you
know that they're like all ready to
create things we're let you stream old
playstation games to your phone like it
like you can with the PS Vita and the
PSP like we can get old games and play
them on your phone and then that never
happened and you know that was supposed
to be I remember seeing a demo one point
someone playing the last of us on a on a
phone well that might have been remotely
from yeah the remote play and whatever
became of that like that never came to
fruition I mean it's not is it's not
like uh
Vidya shield is doing what their grid
where they're making you know like lots
of big nate games it's available right
now you know well that might be true but
the thing is the grid is a streaming
service while the remote play requires
you to have a PlayStation 4 which i do
and i will say remote play is pretty
freaking awesome Oh in that case I was
not talking about remote play oh but uh
yeah the PlayStation Store on Android
has largely been sort of swept under the
rug at least from what I could tell from
the from from the last two iterations of
Xperia you don't really get any games
that you would recognize from
PlayStation on there you kind of get
offshoot android games that you would
find at the fifth page of the games page
on the Play Store yeah exactly like that
they didn't pay attention to this
feature and now it's a piece of junk and
they wasted a bunch of money and time on
it and I'm sure that's something that
was in that business me like you know
what the place you know we're not doing
anything with this store that we have on
Android let's just shut down the mobile
division but the other thing I wanted to
talk about really really quick I'm sorry
guys Oh was walkman how the hell have
they not been cashing in on that I mean
that's something that old people and
young people like from you know 15 year
old hipsters to 6000 everybody knows the
Walkman name and what did they do it
they had this huge up is the sony
walkman smartphone instantly
recognizable worldwide what i do they
make it a freakin music app and it
doesn't do anything important that's
what the sony walkman app is like that
they could have done so much with it cuz
partnered with a spotify right for their
PlayStation music in a couple of weeks
ago why not call that like you know Sony
Walkman music service and put it on the
phones too and like you give people
something like like her she said you
know there was no wow factor there and
that's all of their attempts to create a
WOW factor we're just so mild and tame
and not wowie at all so that's something
else I think probably contributed to it
too is just you know like they have
these awesome names in these PlayStation
Walkman and what do they do you know
when they try to bring it to mobile they
screwed it up royal and now it all sucks
hashtag wowie as we're going to use
sometimes in the future Gruchy didn't
you guys when we ought one we all went
to CES didn't you guys get
look at a Walkman iteration when you
were at the sony booth yeah there is a
Walkman it's like a thousand dollars um
what issues yes look like a thousand
dollars I have some I don't know off the
top my head but I was like a really
advanced like audio quality that makes
it like super awesome uh all i know i
don't know you know i'm not super into
sound that way i know basic stuff oh I
know I stag while we yeah give the basic
idea of that guy is that it can play 192
kill a bit flatting files so high res
audio oh okay so nothing like nothing
for ladies and retaining information
because I did not I remember writing
about well you wrote about it that's why
I got the right about it yeah you have
to see it to write about it yeah i just
looked it up you guys the guy who saw
it's just like okay and then place i saw
every girl you know how CES is I mean
for those who haven't been there
obviously are all most of our audience
or all of our audience I mean it's so
crazy you have so much going on you'd
you don't have time to like fully absorb
things just like it like the highlights
yeah for sure you know okay well if so
there is a Walkman iteration but I guess
they're making it more of like a
boutique brand in a way like yeah it is
it's supposed to be the best of the
music experience like you said you know
and it's cool but I don't see it anyone
paying its twelve hundred dollars i just
looked up who's gonna buy that and as
jellybean just just just saying oh my
god oh just about slavery beanie phones
you guys remember those lamborghini
phones are like $2,000 phones runs
gingerbread like mother effer look I've
actually seen and held the Darcy and I
when we went to china rose a few weeks
ago I we actually went to one of the
electronic stores in the airport and
they had the Lamborghini phone right
there and I held it in my hand I don't
want to hold it anymore like it it's a
weird-lookin phone they put way too much
into it anyway okay um I love that we
brought up Walkman because I actually
want to put this question out there and
we're i already mentioned that I was
gonna ask this question so Joe like
moaned first i canno groaned for
assessment for a second there like oh
I'm
gonna have too much to say about so I'll
let you answer first what Sony products
do you have like if we're going way it
past mobile now Sony is a huge company
that has their foot in so many different
doors there's got to be at least one
kind of Sony device in our houses or
that we use and apparently Joe may not
have one is that true yeah I does not
not a damn one you do i do what do you
what are you thinking PS my buddy your
periods right the PSP that's right i
have used PSP from 2005 that's the light
still on our accounts you're right i
apologize i have one sony device Josh it
is a PSP it is green what's the lesson
is it wasn't last time he played that
thing dude like three days ago well
really what are you playing on your PSP
final fantasy nine dude like I've been
trying to beat it but the last boss is
cheap and stupid so I put it down
apparently I know what Sony products
that you have and you don't I don't even
like think of PSP sony products like it
that's part of the problem is that they
and you know not to go back for where
we're at but you know i'm at wow factor
and then you mentioned the playstation
brand I just feel like they kind of
stepped their toes into all of these
things but they didn't go far enough I
mean what's josh you probably know that
what's the name of the streaming service
that they have on the ps4 instead I
think now on the Vita too i have
uploaded the update but the streaming
service they have now for like ps3 games
and stuff well it's pretty much from the
PlayStation Store and and resting
Pacific name for it that was was a
PlayStation now is that the one yeah
maybe a plus like it could be that yeah
it's anyway I'm not exactly what you
guys are talking about is what I was
talking about earlier when you guys
thought I was talking about remote play
yeah it should be I agree with you he's
talking about that what you're talking
about now is what I was talking about
yeah leveraging leveraging that on
mobile would be a huge deal a huge win
uh that's the kind of thing I'm kind of
time now as Sony's been very you know
you were talking before the show about
sony and sony has been super progressive
over the years I mean it's not like
they've always been this way I mean
Walkmans I mean they'd Betamax which
obviously didn't succeed but hey still
progressive I'll wait a minute was
awesome man beta max was better than VHS
I'm just saying that now
I'm sorry VHS sucked anyway on the point
you know they have all these great
technologies but for some reason they
just when it came to mobile they didn't
get aggressive enough with it see that's
the reason why I think of sony has the
old man in the young person's game
because they came in to this this
industry where we pretty much knew what
we were going to get you know in
smartphones you're gonna get a good
processor or in a flagship that is
you're going to get a good processor
you're gonna get a particular screen you
should have a good camera experience and
sony has been doing that for a long time
in the feature phone category what there
were sony ericsson switch i freaking
loved but once they jumped into
smartphones it was kind of already
established meanwhile in all these other
markets that they have like Betamax DVD
blu-ray PlayStation they were pioneers
because they thought absolutely they
thought outside the box and fulfilled a
need that people wanted that wasn't
there yet that's why I think they are
the old man in the young person's game
because the smartphone industry has been
established for a while now and Sony
just gives us exactly what would they
know we need but maybe they don't go too
far and I don't know it to me that's a
benefit like I would look to Sony as the
brand that I go to when I just want the
essentials a micro SD card slot really
good build quality a nice screen
especially after they enhanced it and a
really good processor but i don't know
maybe our users really need something
flashy like you were saying earlier well
yeah i have a quick question for you
guys real quick um when you look at all
of the other places they compete you
know who were their competitors like you
look at the PlayStation Brandt who are
their major console competitors like
what Nintendo and Xbox right yeah and
then like you look at um you know I
Betamax DVD and blu-ray at all that
stuff who was their big competitor like
can you guys name their competitors in
those other areas where they excelled a
whole bunch laserdisc yeah exactly right
and then like you know you look at their
competitors in the smartphone world and
in the laptop works I know Josh you
wanted to transition to this eventually
yeah but you know you look at this the
sony vaio and then like the remote who
are their competitors here like freaking
everybody yeah that's what I'm you know
it on the laptop side you got like Dell
and alienware and uh asus asus and then
asus raag which is like a whole
different thing that they do and then
smartphone Samsung HTC you know LG
whoever whatever Google's doing with
whoever they're doing it with you know
asus you know they have a whole bunch of
competition you guys think it's like it
could be likely that uh like that the
market is progressing too fast for them
to have an original idea and miss you
know you look at like you know the
Walkman brand that they tried to bring
that could have been seriously
revolutionary but then you know other
companies beat them to it and then you
know you look at the PlayStation
streaming and then you know nvidia kind
of beat him to it with grid you know
it's like a do you think the competition
could be moving too fast as opposed to
them being too timid well that's I'm
saying I think there are two met there's
too much competition and I think that I
think that was my main point I mean
maybe my old man in algae wasn't
necessarily correct when I was trying to
describe it but that's exactly what
you're saying right now exactly what I'm
thinking or there in the market that has
already been so inundated with all these
other companies that they just can't
really stay afloat and now i'm back i
chose an algae um but you know we uh one
thing we're not even thinking about is
why i mean think about it why why did
they let it get there Sony was a king
why was if they were injured early bike
back during the HTC you know the g1 era
and stuff you know uh they could have
they could have you know ran the show uh
why didn't they uh and i think it comes
well i think it comes down to the fact
that you guys we were talking about all
these great things that they've done and
all these innovative things they've done
sony's everywhere they have compared to
even some of these other companies yeah
I don't me wrong Samsung does a lot of
stuff too but sony has done so much were
they really was was mobile an
afterthought I think that's what it
comes down to hmm uh it was an
afterthought I think I think and by the
time they realized that it shouldn't be
an afterthought I think it was too late
you know which is kind of my ID you know
me going back to the whole I thought
they were slow to evolve I think that's
really what I was trying to get I
couldn't think of it at the time is that
they were they were so to evolve in
mobile but not elsewhere and the reason
was because they were focused on
elsewhere they were focused on you know
the PlayStation brand they were focused
on expanding the bravia you know lines
for the four monitors and you know
televisions and I think that they they
didn't realize the potential of mobile
may
until it was too late you know that's
just a speculation but if you think
about it would make sense and you know
once you get behind it's hard to catch
up yeah and their early funds were not
that good either like no as well say
think uh you know that like early um
pretty much anybody else you know it's a
bad hard we're not really good software
and then they finally came out with the
Xperia brand like what just a few years
ago yeah after after smartphones like
Josh said had become a thing did L
insist Joe did you have those classic
Sony phones but from back in the day the
Erickson's know it was one of the things
I always wanted one because the design
was always really nice but again they
were never on the carrier I was on so I
know Gotye one but I remember the specs
weren't that good I remember like they
were being compared at the same levels
like the old LG optimus phones yeah
where they started you before they did
the G thing where it was like mid range
low range you know like mid-range specs
you know regular prices but i don't
remember like them ever being like
considered along with like the HTC evo
4g or the or the moto droid or you know
those other big-name phones i don't
remember sony ever being a part of that
conversation but i do remember Sony
being there somewhere hmm okay oh
speaking of classic Sony yeah go for um
I may have not had an ericsson you know
I told you I didn't get into the phones
you know I did have though and I wonder
if any of you I'm a little bit older but
not a lot older than you I wonder if any
of you else had it a sony CLE a
honorable yeah yeah i had a clear um I
think the model was I don't even
remember it's been a while uh I ran on
palm OS 3.5 I think originally so it's
like 2001 I think with the t-series that
sounds right to me uh anyway uh and I
thought they were great back then you
know and it's sony's done almost
everything sony's done its bit I've been
a huge Sony fan for a long time but you
know we were talking about how much sony
products you own uh I really own very
little now outside of the PlayStation
brand i own nothing outside of
playstation really now okay and I used
to I used to have so many TVs everywhere
I used to have I don't know I think
Sony's kind of faded for my mind there's
just so many other options now ya see
though yeah that's what we're gonna keep
going back to
I one here from feisty like what would
what Sony products do you have because
there's a quickie the reason that I
wanted to go through all of this is
because we're going to see where they
have successes in other fields and maybe
a little bit later we'll see if they can
apply that to the mobile space so it
will pontificate on that but feisty uh
how much Sony do you have in your house
well just like the other guys but
talking about the Sony devices in my
house is a trip down memory lane I've
got a sony VCR it's a great VCR it's 15
years old it still works one bully wait
are you still using it today like well
you know it turns on once a year just
for the sake of turning it on to see if
it still works but but yes it's still
hooked up it's my clock never figure out
how to set it once a year I try and set
it yes yeah I mean I just imagine like
feisty living room in the middle of the
night just a blinking midnight clock
it's part of a set up I'm too late i
like it out while you're talking about
so niall though i have but i have a
Betamax player but it's not hooked up
but i do have it in the box somewhere in
my basement nice yeah well hook it up
and let us know how it goes I'm sure it
might work i don't know i haven't used
it in like wasn't that wasn't the
controller like wired to the thing or
arm out of the old ones yeah some of
them were yeah i can't remember i think
mines i haven't brought it out and so
long um I do have a viet you know I
don't he's not the only one I do have a
vcr still I just don't use it it's in
the basement and it is hooked it is
hooked up to my basement TV though oh
well yeah go ahead if I say you go so
yeah so I mean going back up and Sony
was really and this goes to our previous
question as well kind of what went went
wrong and and how things are coming
along you know when I was growing up
Sony was the company to beat you know if
you wanted to the best products the most
premium devices out there you sought for
Sony and you know I got up into my
teenage years later in the teenage years
early 20s when I started working have
some real money to start spending on you
know whatever I
wanted I went stereo shopping TV
shopping car stereo shopping you know
phone shopping all of these things and
you know I touched each of these Sony
devices because and that was my first
stop because you know that's the way to
go you get Sony that's the best and then
I found that Yamaha made a better car
stereo and well again yamaha made a
better house stereo and and you know
Samsung for example makes a better TV or
you know these are just experiences for
the few devices that I touched but what
I really found and my point here is that
you know Sony was that the fact owed top
a line but they weren't you know they
were depicted as the top but when it
really came to touching the devices as
nice as they were as premium as they
looked they just that they weren't the
best so I for me I kind of lost trust in
the brand in that front of course then
on the word trust you can come to more
recent times and they have so many
outages in their you know their own
networks and the movie side and the
gaming thing I think trust really is is
lost with this company that's an
excellent that we did I didn't even
think of that yeah i agree i really
didn't even with the hacks and
everything like that like you know who's
you know oh wow the hacks i didn't know
we were going to jump into that i didn't
think about it yeah i denied there but
sorry I don't want to go there but more
think of it that way you know that I
mean their name has been also dragged
through the mud it's you know it's not
just the hardware stuff just the Sony
name yeah sony has been the subject of
so much embarrassment over the last
couple of years well the it's funny that
we're mentioning the Sony Pictures wing
I just realized when was the last time I
watched a Sony Pictures movie and I
actually thoroughly enjoyed yeah it sure
as hell wasn't the interview holy crap
or more than you spider-man oh I didn't
see if I heard it wasn't that good so I
oh the interview you mean no the spider
did he was spider-man well they were
both they were both pretty terrible oh
my god so I never got it i will say i
will say okay very very much a tangent
but you know as much as Joe doesn't like
the interview I laughed I still laugh I
never saw it
hmm um but yeah I mean is interesting
that you mentioned like the lack of
trust I I don't feel like I've lost that
I guess I mean ok here we go Joseph and
boy like excess know Joe's gonna be like
mr. hipster man again like um I up with
sony and i remember i I'm a very
nostalgic kind of person and I
absolutely adore what they did back then
and I always look back with very fond
memories like the sony ericsson Bryant I
had the sony ericsson t610 this t 619
the the the the first walkman phone the
w800 and then when they upgraded it to
the slider edition which was amazing the
850 and I would listen to music on those
those things were like my life line
because music really meant a lot to me
back then still does but I mean back
then um let's see we had a sony
big-screen TV the old fat models that
had to come with the stand and i
remember those yeah yeah and we had that
forever and playstation 2 that was my
first foray in sort of like console
gaming me like real console gaming
because the one I had before that was
Nintendo and then I stuck with mobile
after that wow I must be way older that
I thought when was that was that
crushing i said i must be older than I
thought playstation 2 what's your first
major foray into intan i know i'm
sitting here like nes SNES oh my
goodness i'm more hipster than Josh
right now well actually know what you
just reminded me I did have an n64 my
bad um I did have an n64 before that but
but the the earliest one that I had was
a Nintendo and then Game Boy became my
like my ecosystem after that okay so
you're not completely yeah I'm not
hopeless there's a little bit of hope
left for you I do remem item I my
Nintendo is hooked up in my bedroom
right now not regular nintendo well I do
regret not how they pretend oh I do
regret not having a super nintendo i
will say that much I never ever owned
one but yeah it was Nintendo then mold
then then then portable gaming and then
n64 and and PlayStation 2 after that oh
my god you lived a deprived life no dude
what I don't know I don't know how I
could deal with that my Super Nintendo I
like I said I I still
busted out from from time to time yeah
you know I think super mario RPG legend
of the seven stars hell yes so it was
made by square and it was the last
collaboration before they had a falling
out basically and it was talking to
march anyway well well yeah but that was
a long time later and yeah um is
absolutely my favorite game I've played
that game so many times over the years
and I know I'm an adult now so I should
probably past Mario the heck now ah well
my favorite my favorite video game
character of all time is megaman x and i
think i've made that very clear over the
last couple years uh well yeah well so I
had bad and then I moved to the
PlayStation 3 obviously and now we have
a playstation 4 my bluetooth extra-base
like large form factor headphones or
Sony and you know I I don't know I still
have the faith in them I understand
where there are some some caveats with
their products like for example the
bravia tvs they really really up the the
refresh rate on those with their
software so much that movement on those
tvs looks absolutely fake like it's
weird how they do that yeah um right
great and then the PlayStation 4 has its
own somewhat issues online gaming is not
the best for it the playstation 3 look
like a piece of crap i'm just gonna say
that out right now I didn't think that
design why is the playstation 3 looked
good at all really yeah my dad it was
like this weird bloated mess like I said
I thought it look like well did you have
the original yeah I did see a this I
have the slimmer model Oh got it Joe's
overlooks not the one that looks like
the George Foreman grill yeah that's it
exactly this was the position so I mean
I I don't know I i still love sony and
it pains me to see that Mobile is not
going to be a big like like future for
them I suppose that's what they're
thinking but because someone so much of
what they've made on aside from just
mobile has been so great and and in my
opinion continues to be um so so you do
have a ps4 hi Andrew yeah I do oh yeah
that's right what are you playing uh
right now nothing it's uh I bought
dragon age inquisition a while ago and I
and then I got far into it and
then I stopped and then i restarted and
I just finished it finally oh nice oh
but said since then nothing I want to
get the new infamous because infamous is
absolute my favorite series of all time
now that getting second son right that
one's on that was on sale not good no no
that one good that one's usually on sale
these days so shouldn't be that hard to
get yeah i need to buy it because I
loved the first the first two hmm and
see and I think I think Joe made a
perfect point earlier that the
PlayStation brand doesn't have a whole
lot of competition compared to the
mobile brand and that's why we're able
to talk about it at length like this you
know um up but they mean they they have
throughout history I mean even when they
got started I mean you know I I think
that you know but I I as far as the
trust thing that Joe mentioned i still
have trust in parts of Sony that was
fired oh I'm sorry I got my bad i'm
continuing i think i think why I can
ignore me hi feisty i am sorry my steez
always like just the moment he jumps in
it's always like there's just something
its site facade I know exactly he's over
there watching ferris bueller's day off
on his VHS player bueller bueller yeah
this is my favorite part yeah I source
trust I I no longer by Sony TV's cuz to
me so many TVs were the best and then
kind of like what fice did mention yeah
that they were the best and then I
started to realize you know they aren't
necessarily the best I just thought they
were the best and I think there was a
point where Sony did lose some of its
quality a certain aspects but are they
are they not up there though like maybe
we don't say they're the best but can we
say they are still one of top five but
at one point I would consider them the
best now I would say LG is what I all my
TV's rlg not everyone likes LG I think
LG's TVs are awesome Samsung is pretty
high up there uh actually uh which I
didn't even know this is looking at
stuff the highest rated for satisfaction
is Panasonic actually when it comes to
TVs ok Missy they don't know anyone who
owns a panasonic TV but i do like
Panasonic all me a fanboy for any come
it would definitely have to be panasonic
so I'm just yeah I'm gonna hold my
tongue right now on the under by ona i
own a toughbook in the 90s oh nice loved
it loved it so i want to say how quick
things on this out of one I want to make
a golf reference I think of Sony as like
par for the course and that seems to be
their target you know and when you go
play golf ii you're not shooting for par
you want to do better but you know they
seem to be happy with with par and then
panasonic is mentioned and you know
they're kind of the opposite for me you
know growing up panasonic was kind of
considered one of the lower rung guys
but the truth is they've got some great
gear yeah the opposite was saying about
sony do you guys think that duh that
sony has been a kind of living off his
legacy is that part of the problem if
they knew but they've no they built this
big legacy and they've just been kind of
coasting on it I'm gonna counter your
question with another question from
before when because like we think of
Sony like all the great things that Sony
did you guys notice yet that like all of
most of Sony's biggest accomplishments
happened before everyone had the
internet and could like go like explore
other products like it's not any type
good point that's a really good for know
like I don't know whether like it's
stupid or not because like you think
like oh yeah you know the PlayStation 1
was awesome and the Walkman was awesome
it's like and then the internet came now
everything sucks like you know do you
think it's like just people were able to
get online like you know go get cheaper
electronics from other places because
like those other places didn't have the
money to you know specifically
distribute to regions that they didn't
have before like I'm with feisty like
when I was a kid panasonic was like oh
you have panasonic what he live in a
trailer park to like oh god wait oh it
was all word of mouth like there it
wasn't like something like you go and
look at the reviews and like you know
you go to I'm sorry the verge and like
see a panasonic review and see the
reviewer be like LOL do you live in a
trailer park no you know like you go and
you see these reviews for panasonic and
they're actually like really good stuff
and like well how come I thought that
way when I was a kid because that's just
what people told you but now we have the
inter
that and people can pull a much larger
and in some cases a much more qualified
group of people to tell us exactly how
good or bad these products are and maybe
maybe I'm gonna get blasted for this I
know it maybe Sony was a little
overrated back then it it's on the
moment just that's exactly what i was
saying good you know they were i think i
think the company to beat but the
products weren't there were excellent
products but they were the best they
didn't i say that they were the apple of
the stuff that they were the alternative
apple so there we go I'm just happy that
Joe made my old man my old man analogy
make perfect sense now oh yeah right
about I can make all analogies work just
shoot him out there i'll eventually do
it nice we have been we've danced around
so many topics he heard particular i
love it this might be this one oh yeah
we this might be my favorite episode so
far yeah we've kind of where everywhere
with this particular topic but that's
not a bad thing I mean I think we all
have long histories with Sony I mean
that you have to say I mean who hasn't
used a sony product i mean maybe you
don't have them how but I mean all of us
have used probably multiple Sony product
I was Mary Knicks fan boy growing up
dude PlayStation 1 and 2 or my crack and
then they dropped the exclusivity and I
went over to xbox baby due to Final
Fantasy were still PlayStation only I
would own way more PlayStation things
like for sure here's a here's the level
of my commitment to Sony at one point I
owned a mini disc player oh my god a
mini does your Johnny come on I got the
hipster crown and mail it to crush II
yoga's you could walk in with all of
like the the 1980s Chuck's references
you want Grusha wins with the mini disc
player too sweet nice it was awesome I
week I thought it was great I you know I
I it was like min mp3 suck this is so
much better quality I am a mini disc
player they're awesome I just really
bored I can record things off the radio
with this model I can yeah it was it was
like a hundred you listen to the radio
it was great
man it was awesome yeah I don't happen
to it to be honest uh the other day I
was cleaning though as going through
some boxes in the basement and I found a
bunch of mini discs it was like I think
he's going the trash oh my god I love
that moped things you don't want to
admit that you owned Ohio none of those
two you want to fight no I'm kidding i
didn't own a moped oh yeah buddy am I
just chuck is the big bang theory when
shell toes like you're gonna regret
buying that ipod when the zune comes out
like yeah that's what your story just
reminded me like what which I will say I
went soon when it came out I like I'll
do me too I am a zune yeah i just bought
a nokia windows phone because i wanted
another zune my gosh should we bring
this back to separate well I will go
sorry that we are coming up on our last
about 15 minutes of the podcast which
brings me to the final question we have
talked about very fondly at least of our
memories of Sony and of the various
products i think i might have the most
sony products that i'm actually still
using now so knowing what they were able
to do with these other sort of
industries is there anything that they
could take from there or maybe is there
anything they can do better in mobile
that might make them bounce back a
little bit why don't we start off a
grush e wow factor I said it like five
times you know uh a sh tag wowwy hashtag
wow but you know it's uh we met we kind
of touched on some of this PlayStation
branding they could do a lot more with
that uh but you know even just I don't
even know that's that that they need to
take anything from what they already
have they just need to realize that it
is a different category and that things
that may have worked in our other
categories don't work with mobile hmm
you know and I think maybe that's the
problem they've tried to apply HAP you
know not fully really kind of you know
like with the PlayStation thing oh
here's what we're gonna do guys here's a
playstation phone xperia play blah blah
blah but they didn't really do a lot
with it and i think that they just
haven't had a clear direction with
mobile I mean yes they've had a clear
design and I didn't
no I think they have a good design
language I said it was getting a little
boring and I I stand by that but there
is a lot of people who like it and I
still say that their phones look sexy
they just uh and so I think the design
language is good uh and i think that
it's just that they haven't done
anything to really shake things up and
you know that you said that joshi said
you know there's a market for back to
basic i think there probably is but are
they doing enough to market that more
you know to market that angle hmm um I
think they're trying to uh push this on
to so many fans and I don't think
they're doing enough to to make Sony
fans care I think that probably would be
my answer is like they need to just
reach out more I mean having
availability across the board is not
necessarily something that you need in
order to be successful let me look at
all these Chinese brands who kind of
stick to their own markets you know and
but if they are going to have at least a
phone here I mean xiii VZ 3 or z2 s or
whatever the the versions were that
we're on the various carriers t-mobile
and Verizon in particular then yeah
maybe they should just start I want to
see Sony Xperia commercials on my TV you
know and I want to see you looking us
they used to have sony ericsson
commercials all the time yeah that's
true yeah they were a bigger deal oh
they were yeah for sure and I think that
that would be probably the first place
to start that something's just my answer
that's that's my big thing you know
because we're seeing PlayStation a
freakin commercials like every day you
know greatness awaits and stuff like
that so the well yeah has anyone here
besides the internet seen any kind of
advertisement magazine billboard
anything for sony oh yeah for if there
Bobo for the mobile AL for mobile Oh for
mobile no not in America I have not I
have not and I think that's part of the
problem now you know world we're all
from you know well duh feist ease
Canadian technically but we're all from
the North America or where we live here
anyway as I took feisty out of the call
knocking yeah
that you know a certain angle that may
not be accurate I mean you know like we
were talking with Android one it's
accurate to our markets but I may not
you know some people who are listening
this I'd be like well that's not true
here and you know wherever they're at
and but just from our perspective sony
could be doing more here but what about
at home I mean cuz like i said i think
that it's even leaning in in japan so
we're sony has historically had a lot of
you know wait a lot of clout so we need
to kind of figure out what are they
doing wrong I mean are there not
advertising there either obviously none
of us can answer that because we're not
in Japan but no sure there's a failing
somewhere yeah and I don't believe that
Sony should give up I don't think they
should sell the division I don't think
they should have sold their pc division
personally but because I was a big fan
of I had several values uh and I was a
huge fan at the laptops I mean they used
to be awesome i mean when i was even in
college I mean vaio was you know Mack
wasn't hipster cool yet it was vaio you
know that was a hipster thing back then
you know all the hipster types were
going for the vials back then yeah as
I'm old it's the letter B that makes it
cool oh holy well I'm a logo was kind of
cool to you know yeah was I didn't wait
a minute like oh yeah they had the cool
the cool netbooks like instead of just
the boring looking netbooks they have
these like really like thin like ultra
wide weird ones and I remember thinking
they were almost awesome looking things
ever because you know netbooks were
awesome apparently for a little while um
I have a specific angle that I actually
want to ask feisty about and I'm gonna
ask you last so I wanted to throw it
over to Joe do what what do you think
that that Sony can do better and you're
the one that doesn't even have much Sony
in your house all right so here's the
thing like and this is something that
has been kind of like underlined you
know obviously I think that the biggest
problem is availability yeah and it's
not because it's not just like you know
in North America because the carriers
don't have it and I'm angry because the
z1s on tmobile sucked compared to the z1
is it when I know that's yeah but uh
it's something it's I give me a second
I'm articulating this in my brain right
now all right so crush you just said
that you know he saw those little
books and he said they're the coolest
little things ever crush you did you own
one no why I wanted to buy one uh they
were too expensive right so like it was
like a I remember they were like they
were like seven or eight hundred dollars
netbooks were like three or four hundred
dollars but exactly I was I'm crappy
dell right and like you know you look at
that and that's the reason why I say
that they should be available on
carriers because carriers could take
that you know because these are all
seven hundred dollar phones anyway
there's no different than the Samsung
and HTC or Apple you know but they all
you know they're all doing really well
because they're on carriers and carriers
can subsidize those things turn
expensive phones into cheap phones and
allow more people to buy them and that's
why I think that availability is super
important and you know it like even with
their you know but that's the thing that
the vibe that I get with Sony phones is
man that phone looks so great god i wish
i could buy one and like it that that is
the big point the huge thing that I hear
all over the place is man that phone is
really nice I wish I could get one like
my friend bought a UH the z3 see that I
mentioned earlier the z3 compact and uh
he bought it used on sois pas and i
believe it's like an international
version or something like that mm-hmm
and uh you know it's just it's just one
of those things just not around you know
people look at it and go even if it
we're on commercials people be like man
I really want to buy that phone now
where do I get it and the answer is
cricket cricket cricket cricket cuz no
one knows where to get it cuz it's not
available anywhere well you know I mean
you can you can go to Sully's website
and buy them yeah but then but then it's
def 11 hundred dollars you know of
course well you know of course there is
the the z3 on t-mobile and there is the
z3 V on verizon so there is availability
but are they advertised well I don't
know why better yeah they go they go
hand in hand I do feel like uh and and
Joe brings up a very good point i think
in our history of ever having sony
products there's never been a budget
sony product ever yeah you know it's
well you you you got the impression that
you're which is kind of what Apple does
you get the impression that it's worth
the money because it's the best even if
it's not really in the nest
we've been told it's the best and you
know even back then I have a I have a
fond memory of Sony stuff too but was it
necessarily the best no there were other
good stuff but we were conditioned to it
it was the brand that we knew to trust
and I still think Sony builds good
products in many ways ah but it came
down to the fact that you know we were
willing to pay that amount but I think
consumers and the internet probably has
contributed to that consumers aren't
willing to pay that anymore they would
rather you know this might only last me
for years is that you know if it's a TV
or whatever instead of seven or but
that's fine i just saved four hundred
dollars yeah i guess so you know and i
think and i guess you know we could not
to go political but we could you know
blame the economy hunt some of it too i
suppose sure though um so it's good that
you mentioned it the way that you did
crush you because feisty you mentioned
right before our podcast we were sort of
discussing how we were going to tackle
the topic that you brought a band droid
TV and what i wanted to put out there
was you can all you can of course it go
into what you think sony can do better
for their mobile division but i just
wanted to post this idea if sony of CES
made it clear that they're going to go
all in with Android TV for all of the
bravia sets and this is just pretty much
pure Android TV we're looking at they
put they just injected Google's own
operating system and interface into
their TVs do you think that could be a
route that they would take with mobile
what if they went all in with google and
just made android stock android what
they do and kind of kind of cut their
losses cut their costs when it comes to
their proprietary operating system do
you think that going all-in with android
on their experience might help that is a
tough one to answer it certainly i think
it would help a lot if they also
introduced lower end phones as long as
they're going to continue to promote
themselves as as having premium phones i
think they have to have their own OS to
match that premium nature you can i mean
that all of the budget phones and sorry
I'm going to make some generalizations
here but the budget phones run pure
Android the premium phones run a premium
experience a droid so I guess the
philosophy from the TV division probably
wouldn't help the mobile division you
think
again I'll speak to the hardware here I
there's definitely room for them to grow
I mean we look at Samsung over the last
three four years that they skyrocketed
to the top because they had the gamut of
devices they had low-end stuff that you
could make the bulk of their sales and
then they had the high-end stuff that
you know brought up the the appeal of
the line mmm but again the sales came
from the lower the mid-range device now
of course the bigger device is sold as
well but I mean the bulk of their income
came from the lower devices and Sony
just doesn't have those so that you know
borrowing from the Android TV going to
appear Android there's room but not on
their current hardware platforms and
this speaks so sorry go on so feisty I
have a question for you yeah um the Moto
X is not premium to you at all it's it's
not the new Moto X of hardware wise yes
with its decent specs with its metallic
edging with its customization leather
back I consider that pretty premium I'm
not trying well we don't ryan ackley
stock Android either there's a moto moto
skiing whoa just because the skin is
thin doesn't mean it's not there I have
to say what I've got the google play
edition moto g and the motorola software
i'm missing i hate missing it i can't
even install it and and so even if it is
thin like joe says it is missing and
yeah it's still basically stock with
also also there's no Nexus Warriors all
like in the listening audience before
anybody like blows up premium does not
mean better folks premium means like
bonus extra you know stuff more
necessarily yeah more expensive exactly
it does not mean better so you know is
we're not saying that like you know that
the Sony you I or the TouchWiz is better
but it is in fact premium by definition
sorry go ahead fine then the Nexus then
the nexus 6 isn't premium 200 I'd this
definition no no God oh but even though
it has metallic you know the design and
it's
I don't know I guess I feel like stock
doesn't have anything to do with it and
I I think that that was kind of my point
earlier is that I think that Sony hasn't
lot brought a lot of extras to its skin
uh and so it's closer to stock but it
still looks different so the purists the
people who like Nexus myself um it's not
necessarily what they want and it's not
necessarily what people who are looking
for you know advanced features want
either and so I absolutely am at a
different side of you I think that they
could benefit completely from not going
pure stock but going to a really really
light skin the same icon same design
just a few extra apps a real PlayStation
app that has real streaming and just go
to the basically scale down their
software and focus on the things that
Sony could do well with well you know
Plitt better PlayStation branding better
a better walkman music app that kind of
stuff all right did you have anything
else you want to add feisty before he
yes absolutely no no no problem I mean
that's great point of view where I guess
android is at that point now where the
OS versus you know the pure versus the
skins is you know it's blurring that
line of of the lower end versus the
higher randwick which is good I like
that and thank you good rebuttal but
going back to our actual question of
today is you know part of it was that
then Sony wants to take less risks and
they want to focus on the markets where
they think they'll see growth yeah the
thing is for me is I think they can make
that growth if they seek it out don't
look for the markets where they can make
growth just go out there and make it and
that goes to specifically for mobile I
mean they're they're focusing on one
type the kind of the premium device
where they think that can make an impact
we're really they just need to go all-in
spend money to make money if you will
and just you know do it own it they own
PlayStation they've you know they'll go
upside down on that brand if they had to
it's theirs they own it and they're
doing great in the in the in the gaming
market but you know they're hesitant
they need to take as opposed to them
saying they want to take less risks I
think they need to take more risks and
that will help them out overall in any
division not
mobile all right great well I think that
is a pretty good note to go ahead and
start closing off our show here I'll go
ahead and go into my little intro outro

co-hosts once again joseph indie andrew
grush and Jonathan Feist today we talked
about Sony and where things may have
gotten a little sour with their mobile
division because it's become clear that
Sony is not going to as they said take
risks as much anymore in the mobile
division which for a couple of us may
have made us a little bit sad or made it
made sense to a couple of us mean
personally I thought that I always have
faith in Sony and personally I do call I
do take a little bit of sadness from
that particular piece of news but we
went at length here in we also kind of
went on tangent off tangent for a little
bit in the middle I hope you guys
