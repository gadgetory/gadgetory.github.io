devices to new watches rather that
sportwear 2.0 and as a result go for a
sporty er direction it's Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody and this is a
hands-on look as I've used the Huawei
watch 2 for the last couple of days here
in Barcelona now the two devices we're
talking about in this video are the
while we watch - and the Huawei watch -
classic now I don't have the classic I
have the sporty or while we watch -
really the sporty look of the watch body
itself lends itself more to the silicone
rubberized band however it's the one
part of the watch thus far that I found
to feel a little bit under quality and
is there it's a little bit flimsy and it
feels like it could break pretty easily
over time so that's definitely a bit of
a - at first for the Huawei watch - as
far as the look goes the watch sports
two buttons on the side one of them in
order to trigger generally fitness or
you can program it for another shortcut
and then the main button up top is to go
back to the home screens or to open up
the app drawer now there is no rotating
crown on here so all of your navigation
is going to be done via taps and swipes
which is not necessarily ideal for me
after seeing watches like the gear s3
and more recently the LG watch sport
both also feature an ip68 rating for
dust and water resistance meaning that
you could go swimming with these devices
but they shouldn't be submerged for too
long under one meter for over half an
hour speaking of that screen it is a 1.2
inch AMOLED 390 by 390 resolution screen
coming in at 326 pixels per inch the
processor is Snapdragon wear 2100 and
the ram comes in at seven hundred sixty
eight megabytes now there is storage on
these four watches as well as you get
four gigabytes of internal storage if
you want to put some local music in to
listen to and on top of that despite the
enhancements - - where 2.0 I just feel
like after the LG watch sport I have to
take a small step backwards in my input
when I have to use taps and swipes to
get across all the parts of Android wear
2.0 that said functionality hasn't
really been a problem at all
there have been very few hiccups that
when it comes to my navigation and my
also the performance of the watch and
battery life has actually been pretty
good so far I've already gotten update
half-off of this device with the 420
milliamp hour battery now I have not put
a sim card in the Huawei watch just yet
however I will definitely do that when I
get back from Barcelona and that's just
one of the details you can look forward
to in my full review that is going to
come alongside the Huawei p10 so keep it
tuned to android authority for that and
even more from MWC 2017 don't forget to
subscribe to our channel if you haven't
already so you can see my review of the
Huawei watch 2 and also the Huawei p10
keep it tuned here for more because we
