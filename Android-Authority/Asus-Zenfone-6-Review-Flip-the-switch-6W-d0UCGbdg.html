of really weird ways of hiding the
front-facing camera on the phones
we've got pop-up cameras hole punches
fins and now we've got this this is the
Asus zenfone 6 and it's pretty much a
flagship it's just not priced like a
flagship but what makes this phone
really great is that it's just plain
weird
okay so we got to talk about the camera
first because it's definitely one of the
main selling points of this entire phone
it's using the sony i MX 586 48
megapixel sensor that very much every
other flagship is using right now and
it's paired with a 13 megapixel
wide-angle camera so you can get really
nice group selfies now probably the
weirdest thing about this phone is that
the camera
physically flips over the top of the
display so you don't actually have to
have any sort of cut or notch in the
front of the phone and it's really fun I
kind of just want to keep doing it over
and over I'm not really a fan of moving
parts and phones but the flip camera on
this phone actually enables some really
cool features one of them is motion
tracking so if you're taking a video or
a set of photos you can lock on to a
subject and as it moves around the frame
the camera will physically tilt and move
around to follow that subject it's a
little janky and it's very jerky but
it's still pretty cool nonetheless the
other thing is a automatic panorama mode
so you can just hold the phone steady
and the camera will swivel around a full
180 degrees which is a little bit weird
because it's probably gonna get you in
the shot but it's really nice that you
don't have to physically turn around to
actually get that panorama now for the
quality of that camera it's actually
pretty decent it has a good amount of
dynamic range it's not too washed out
but I did notice a little bit of skin
smoothing when taking pictures of people
portrait mode is actually pretty good
though it's obviously not as good as the
pixel but it's definitely a lack ships
that I've seen that really just don't do
a good job of cutting out the subject
now I do have to know if the Asus just
released a firmware update which is
supposed to update the camera but I
wasn't able to install this for some
reason every time I tried to install it
it was load up to a hundred percent and
then say the update could not be
installed so I'm gonna try to figure
this out over the next few days and they
will be updated camera samples on
Android authority comm alright so the
camera is definitely the primary feature
of this phone and probably the feature
that's gonna turn the most heads let's
talk about what's good
in this phone besides the camera now
first of all I see is pretty much
scratched the Zen UI that they had
before and replaced it with a UI is it's
almost stock Android they've just added
a few extra features like a long screen
shot mode and a built-in screen recorder
so those are pretty nice to see and it's
really nice that I don't have to deal
with all that bloatware anymore it's
pretty much just stock Android on a
really nice phone and the new UI makes
the fun feel really snappy obviously
it's running some of the latest specs
available on the market and with a
really lightweight skin the performance
is overall just really great you also
got a headphone jack expandable storage
and a notification light so there's a
lot of features than this phone that you
don't even see in some high-end
flagships and it's available for just
499 dollars there's also this dedicated
quick actions button on the side of the
phone that lets you do a ton of
different things you can activate Google
assistant turn on your flashlight take a
screenshot there's a lot of
customization here and it's really nice
to see that asus is putting the extra
effort to include a button like this but
of course at $499 there's gonna be some
drawbacks asus is using an LCD display
in this phone and i'm really missing a
whole ide now the last three phones that
i reviewed how to a LED display so
you're just not gonna get those deep
deep blacks like you get from those
phones and when it shows you
notifications it actually has to light
up the entire display so it's gonna use
a little bit more battery on standby and
speaking of battery this thing is a five
thousand milliamp hour battery and I was
really excited that I was gonna have
true to day battery life just like I saw
on the Huawei P 30 Pro but sadly that
wasn't really the case now the battery
life is not bad at all I got about six
and a half hours of screen on time which
is pretty good it's about what I got on
the oneplus 60 but with a five thousand
million power cell I was really hoping
that I was gonna see a little bit better
battery life there and probably my last
write with this phone is the vibration
motor it's not good a lot of the times
when you get a notification it will
physically rattle the camera sensor
which just sounds really bad and I was
hoping that they would be able to
isolate the vibration a little bit
better in this phone now I see this
phone is competing a lot with the pixel
3a because it's slightly more than the
pixel 3/8 but still cheaper than a lot
of other flagships out there
if you want raw power this is definitely
going to beat the pixel 3a but you're
not getting things like the really nice
screen that you get in that phone so I
think the zenfone 6 is gonna turn a lot
of heads you're getting more features
than you get any a lot of modern-day
flagships I'll be it still doesn't have
things like water resistance or wireless
charging but for people who don't really
care about those things and just want
raw power and a few extra features this
is an awesome device now Asus still
hasn't set an official price for all the
SKUs of this device because the trade
were in the u.s. might set some tariffs
which will change the price so stay
tuned Android Authority comm because we
will update you as soon as we have
pricing and availability make sure you
head over there as well because we've
got tons of sample images from this
phone and a ton of pictures and I did a
full written review as well
so I will catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
