camera with a phone attached the p9
which promises to be a game-changer in
smartphone photography I'm Chris Karlin
for Android authority let's take a look
and see if the Huawei p9 has what it
takes to spark the revolution
design-wise the Huawei p9 is very
similar to its predecessor the p8 you've
got the same sham pad edges brushed
metal and overall design styling with a
few minor changes like a textured power
button the headphone port has moved to
the bottom edge and there's only a
single speaker grille this time the
quaiity 9 is just six point nine five
millimeters thin though which is a
pretty impressive design feat but we
didn't necessarily come here for the
design the biggest feature of the p9 is
undoubtedly the dual camera array on the
back Koh engineered with German optics
maker leica now there's 2 mote 12
megapixel lenses that allow you to shoot
wide-angle and bokeh effects as well as
selectively focusing but there's no
camera bump at all even on a phone this
thin so we've got an RGB sensor for
capturing color information and another
monochrome sensor for capturing fine
detail this setup allows the Huawei p9
to increase contrast by 50% and light
sensitivity by 300% the p9 introduces a
hybrid autofocus which combines laser
depth and contrast focusing so you'll be
using both camera lenses and the laser
focus with a dedicated depth measurement
chip to isolate the best focal length
like as influence on the camera app can
be felt with tons and tons of modes
presets and settings to fool around with
as well as a full manual mode for
fine-grained control but unfortunately
there's no optical image stabilization
on either lens up front there's an 8
megapixel camera with beauty mode and
perfect selfie for all you selfie fans
and on the display front we've got a 5.2
inch full HD IPS screen same size and
resolution as the p8 but it does seem to
offer a few improvements in terms of
quality on the software front we've got
Android 6.0 marshmallow straight out of
the box as well as emotion UI 4.1 but
the software is a very similar
experience to what you would know from
our Huawei phones so don't expect
anything too radically different on that
from the p9 also introduces USB type-c
as well as a finger scanner that's
apparently a market improvement over
previous Cloe finger scanners which were
already pretty impressive the new finger
scanner is a class 4 scanner which
apparently can sense differences in
fingerprint ridges in three dimensions
p9 also has the latest Kirin processor
the 955 3000 milliamp hour battery and a
few different variations for storage 32
gig with a 3 gig of ram and 64 gig with
a 4 gig of ram option and they will both
be available in mid april of course
there is also a larger version of the p9
as well Huawei p9 + now it bumps things
up a little by bringing a 5.5 inch
AMOLED display but unfortunately it's
still full HD as well but it brings a
few other improvements like press touch
a slightly larger battery and IR blaster
and some other improvements it'll be
available mid-may and comes in 64 gig
and 128 gig versions with 4 gig of ram
each in terms of pricing the p9 is not
exactly cheap the base model with 32 gig
of storage is 599 euros the slightly
larger one at 64 is 649 euros and the p9
+ with 64 gig + 4 gig of ram is 749 now
highway is not talking specifics on the
US market but these devices will
reportedly be hitting the states
sometime this year a yp9 ticks a lot of
boxes but they just sort of seemed like
something is missing it's hard to put a
finger on it because the phone offers so
many improvements over its predecessor
but I guess we'll have to wait for the
full review to find out if the new like
a camera really is all it's cracked up
to be till next time guys hit the
comments let us know what you think of
the new Huawei p9 + p9 + hit that
