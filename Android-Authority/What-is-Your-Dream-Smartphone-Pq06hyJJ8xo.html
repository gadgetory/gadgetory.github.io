brought to you by domain.com you guys
know we live in a bubble right I mean
there's a world of us geeks and then the
rest of the world who could really care
less about phones I'm sure you've heard
your significant other say something
like this how do you find the time to
watch so many videos about phones the
same way you find the time to feel two
closets full of shoes you got to do
better than that oh hey so if wives and
girlfriends can be shoe geeks we can be
phone geeks and that's why today is all
about the ultimate geeks phone and I'd
like to start off with aesthetics so the
onion com has a great parody about
Apple's MacBook Pro and how they said
they did away with the keyboard and put
in a key wheel I'll buy almost anything
too shiny and made by Apple Alex Alban
was one of the lucky few to get to try
out a Mac wheel and spent 45 minutes
typing an email to his friend and of
course this was a gross exaggeration
because it would be exceedingly painful
to type with a key wheel but they made a
point that Apple often sacrifices
function for design now I'm not here to
rag on Apple I love a lot of different
Apple products but they do exaggerate to
make an effective point here for the new
MacBook I'd have to buy an $80 dongle
because they're only putting in one port
to the MacBook for people like me who
live on my macbook and I earn my living
off my macbook pro that is a really big
sacrifice for design but there's a
reason they do that they're questioning
what do 80 percent of the people do 80
percent at the time and what 80 percent
of the people do 80 percent of time is
they're looking for something that's
sexy that looks good that they can show
off to their friends a little less so
with function now many of you will think
hey Android manufacturers often you know
favor function over design but look
what's happened most recently with the
galaxy s6 and s6 edge would it have been
as popular if it were not so thin and
sleek and metal unibody I would submit
to you that it would not I think it's
fair to say the market has proven that
aesthetics are important and you're much
more likely to be engaged with your
device if it is aesthetically pleasing
and looks like from our poll that most
of you agreed
notion no let's talk screen size some
people feel that bigger is better
but flagship smartphones are now
frequently bumping up against phablet
territory officially the phablet
category starts with the screen size of
about 5.1 inches and goes up to 7 inches
where devices really become tablets but
that probably needs to be reassessed the
original Galaxy Note had a 5.2 inch
screen the galaxy s6 now has a 5.1 inch
screen shrinking bezels allow us to get
away with much bigger screen sizes
without having to have huge devices and
you can see here how most of you really
prefer larger devices now let's talk
power now I could tell you that you know
I gave my son the Nexus 5 that has a
Snapdragon 800 and it has never lagged
he plays games on that quite a bit and
he would tell me if it slowed down at
all but this show is all about our dream
phone so let's talk about the dream
system-on-a-chip
now some of you might be lusting for the
rumored Snapdragon 820 but personally I
would go with the Exynos 7420 because it
has been blowing away all benchmarks
thanks to the smaller manufacturing
process samsung has been able to up its
clock speeds by 200 megahertz on the CPU
side and 72 mega Hertz on the GPU side
working out to around 10 percent
increase over the Exynos 54:33 what this
will inevitably lead to some performance
gains the biggest changes have been made
in the system on a chips memory and GPU
specifications and of course when you
power-hungry geeks chimed in it was
clear you were all about the muscle now
for all you shutter bugs out there let's
talk about the camera
thanks to these smartphone gods the mega
pixel war is now over and we can talk
about cameras that actually make a
difference I am looking for cameras that
have really good low-light performance
cameras that I can use in real-world
scenarios when I'm in a restaurant or
you know I'm out late at night and I can
still take a photo without flashing that
harsh ugly flash now if we're talking
about a dream phone that also means a
dreamed camera and I have the Sony
Xperia z3 compact it has a very powerful
camera on there but all those great
features are deep within the menu and
often times when you go in and try and
use it it's tedious takes a long time
and sometimes it just makes the app
so we we need to pull out those powerful
features and make them much more user
friendly that to me would be the dream
camera what do you guys think
storage anybody you know what this
really depends on where you live what
country you live in and how expensive
data is here in Canada it's super
expensive I'm on like a $70 a month plan
and it's like I don't know five
gigabytes a month and without sneezing I
can easily hit a hundred and thirty
dollars per month like without even
trying and that's not watching YouTube
or Netflix or influent that that's just
regular uses a little bit of Facebook a
little bit of Twitter Email and Google
Maps like it's that stupid expensive
it's crazy here some other countries I
know you've said hey you know just use
the cloud it's not practical for people
who you know don't have affordable data
plans what do you guys think so my dream
phone would have a crazy internal
storage or microSD support I'm talking
like 512 gigabytes you may laugh but in
five years you're gonna have phones that
big no problem so when you're talking
about the ultimate anything you really
should put a time limit on it the
ultimate phone I'm looking for in the
next year is different than the phone
I'm looking for in five years but if I
were honest with you the ultimate phone
I'm dreaming about isn't a phone at all
I want the hardware to get out of the
way from the content and the information
that I want to get to when I'm at dinner
with my wife I don't have to be looking
down to my phone to get the information
I want when I am driving I don't have to
look down on a text cuz I don't do that
or I don't want to have to look down for
a map when I'm driving get the hardware
out of the way between me and the
information or content that I want to
access whether that means better
wearables whether it means HUD displays
on cars you know other devices I don't
know but we need to not allow the
hardware to get in the way from us and
the wonderful world of the web what do
you guys think let me know in the
comments below so I asked you guys to
share your domain names and business
names and you did I found John grant and
Michael from the game Bolcom and they
produce some really good stuff there
it's all gaming news and reviews please
go
checking out the game Bolcom they said
they took about two hours to consult and
decide on the name and make sure that
you'd find the dot-com cuz you know the
dot-com matters why because no domain
name extension tells your story with the
same level of trust as a.com or.net
domain name dot-com and dotnet domain
name extensions and Jack credibility
into your online presence and who
doesn't want more credibility you can
save fifteen percent on domain name and
web hosting when you use our coupon code

forget 15% off when you use our coupon
code Android when you think domain names
think domain.com now I know what you're
thinking you're thinking Jace how could
you have possibly missed battery life I
didn't miss battery life there's like
more than 20 videos on our channel about
battery life and how important it is and
shows they're just dedicated to battery
life alone it's one of the biggest pet
peeves of all geeks and casual users
alike we know battery life has got to
change it's a long time coming honestly
I think the device itself has to change
before the battery life will change so
we'll see how that goes let me know in
the comments below what you think what
is your dream phone I will be reading
them and checking them out you can
connect with me here on Google+ or
Twitter don't forget about my brothers
in Android who are trying to be your
