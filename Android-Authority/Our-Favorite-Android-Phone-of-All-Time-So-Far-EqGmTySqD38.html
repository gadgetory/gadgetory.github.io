authority and there are a ton of Android
phones out there but we all have that
one that is near and dear to our hearts
that one particular Android phone that
we have really fond memories of and
thoroughly enjoyed using so from myself
and a few of the guys here at and your
authority here are some of our favorite
Android phones of all time so what is my
favorite Android phone of all time would
have to be the Galaxy Note 5 now let me
explain why when I the very first kind
of digital device that I had was a Palm
Pilot and it came with a stylus and then
before the age of Android I also had a
Windows CE II phone that also came with
a stylus
now once Android and the iPhone came out
I was like everybody else I was used to
using a finger only interface however
there are times and having a stylus is
really really important and having the
option the option of using a stylus has
made the note range for me absolutely
essential device and so I had a note for
edge of a note edge and then I had the
note 5 I didn't get around to getting a
note 7 before things went wrong there
and I'm sure the note 8 will replace the
note 5 as my best most favorite device
ever but at the moment it is the note 5
I couldn't live without it so what's my
favorite Android phone event of all time
it's an interesting question because
until very recently ie last year I've
always been a Galaxy Note man and I'm
going to take you back to last year a
lot of you may not agree but for me the
Galaxy Note 7 is probably one of my
favorite phones Android phones of all
time and for one main reason yes it was
a really complete phone you know apart
from the problem with the battery
blowing up we all know that I'm you know
if you're going to say it in the
comments please go ahead
it's kind of old guys the simple fact is
that even though the note 7 had a
battery that blew up and Samsung
basically screwed up massively it was
still probably the most complete Android
phone made if I had to pick something
else I'm going to go back to the Galaxy
Note 4 which was for me was the first
time an Android smartphone camera really
competed with the iPhone and in a lot of
ways and I've said this in a post
very similar post on the website the
smartphone the camera on the Galaxy Note
4 really and truly set away the Android
camera revolution that we've come to
expect ins so there's my pick for the
best Android phone of all time the his
phone of all time
gonna have to go with the HTC
thunderbolt because that was my first
phone ever and well my first phone first
smartphone ever and it had a kickstand
and it was metal and it felt amazing and
it was one of the first 4G smartphones
of all time and it overheated on me in
my hand because I was using too many
applications at once Skype was not good
for that thing but oh my gosh it had the
biggest screen I'd ever seen on anything
ever and I had to return it for a droid
charge which was way way worse of a
phone but that Thunderbolt still rings
true in my head I heard a text
notification recently that sounded
exactly like the initial text
notification that I had on that smart
phone and it just brought back all this
nostalgia because that kickstand that
screen just that metal body that
everything the whole thunder full logos
it started when you started that
smartphone that's too many memory so my
favorite Android phone of all time has
to go to the Moto X I'm talking about
the original og Moto X and if you guys
remember this phone came out at a time
when Android phones were getting bigger
screens were getting larger and higher
resolution and the Moto X sort of went
in the opposite direction it was a
smaller more compact phone and it didn't
have the latest and greatest specs but
what it did offer was a really great
Android user experience it ran
practically stock Android with a lot of
really useful customizations from
Motorola like motor display which had a
different name at the time but it later
got renamed and the twist of the wrist
to launch the camera and because it was
running basically stock Android and
Motorola was under the helm of Google it
received updates extremely quickly
sometimes faster than Nexus phones
themselves but what I love most about
the Moto X was the Moto maker this was a
really groundbreaking thing at the time
it was something that was never done
before but it allows you to customize
this phone with different colored back
accent colors and you can also get it
engraved with a custom message or your
name a lot of really cool stuff that you
could do with this phone I actually
still have my
motox and it brings me a lot of really
good memories so that's why it's my
favorite Android phone of all time hey
guys Joe Indy here and my favorite phone
of all time is the LGV 20 what I like
about it is that it covers most if not
all of the right bases you get the usual
baseline of good stuff the specs are
good the camera is good the battery is
good enough the screen is decent and as
far as gimmicks go the second screen
really isn't all that bad
it has four gigabytes of RAM it's not
breaking any speed records but
everything you want is essentially there
where this thing really shines are the
power user features it has 64 gigabytes
of storage and I rock a 200 gigabyte SD
card giving my v20 a total of 264
gigabytes of storage the build quality
is decent and the battery is removable
check and check
additionally the USB type-c port is HDMI
out compatible and while it's not overly
necessary I feel better having something
like that in place in case my chromecast
ever dies on me the headphone jack has a
DAC as well as a built-in amplifier they
can support headphones with up to 600
freakin ohms of impedance and so that
kind of power cost a pretty penny all on
their own there are phones that beat out
two v20 in most areas it doesn't have
the best specs anymore and there are
phones with better build quality battery
and camera however there isn't a single
use case that the v20 can't handle at
least moderately well from high
impedance headphones to mobile gaming to
taking a decent photo the b20 can do
pretty much whatever I needed to do it's
like my little Swiss Army knife the
glass on the camera lens is a little bit
fragile but when it comes to the
Achilles heel of high-end smartphones I
prefer the ones that I can fix with a
ten-dollar case from Amazon as opposed
to something I cannot do anything about
it's not perfect but it checks all the
boxes I could ever really want a
smartphone to check so there you have it
