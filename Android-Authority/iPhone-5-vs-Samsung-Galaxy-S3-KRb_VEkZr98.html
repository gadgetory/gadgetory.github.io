authority reporting live we were set up
here in Hong Kong we've been here for
the iPhone launch we've been able to
secure an iPhone we did a nice drop test
on an iPhone several hours ago and now
we have another iPhone that we're
looking at to compare arguably two of
the best of smart phones on the market
today everyone wants to know what's the
heavyweight what's better now in terms
of physical footprint we can see that
they're actually relatively similar
obviously significantly slimmer but in
terms of the height the iPhone 5 and the
s3 are quite similar
now there's physical dimensions for the
s3 are 5.39 inches by 2.8 now in terms
of thickness we have a 0.3 4 inch
profile making a remarkably thin for a
device of its stature in size the iPhone
5 on the other hand is 4.87 inches long
it does have a width of only 2.31 inches
and its thickness is 0.3 inches so
that's 0.3 inches of thickness versus
0.3 for making the iPhone 5 thinner than
the actual galaxy s3 now in terms of
their weight the iPhone 5 is going to be
weighing in at 112 grams making it
remarkably lighter it is 19% thinner
than the actual original iPhone iPhone
4s excuse me
they've incorporated a new alloy which
we've discovered is very very impact
resistant and also remarkably
lightweight not quite sure what it is
but we will find out that for you very
shortly so in terms of the processing
power we're looking at a quad core of
1.4 gigahertz Exynos processor in the
galaxy s3 International Edition now if
you're living the United States and you
have an LTE connection likely you have
an s4 processor which is a dual core but
does clocked at 1.5 gigahertz and it
features some architectural advancements
which put it on par with the
international version that we're looking
at today it displays themselves well the
display is always usually the most
important part of any device the
technology itself is different this
features an HD AMOLED display whereas
the iPhone 5 features a TFT IPS LCD
display whites will be whiter on the
iPhone 5 but colors will be
significantly richer on the galaxy s3
the operation on both is remarkably
smooth as they are leading-edge high-end
devices from two manufacturers that
capture collectively over roughly 68% of
the smartphone market so we have a
resolution on the galaxy s3 of 1280 by
720 pixels giving it a PPI of 306 the
iPhone 5 features a display of the odd
form of 640 pixels by 11:36 giving you a
ppi of 326 so we have 326 with the
iphone 5 vs 306 with the galaxy s3
though we should consider that this is a
four point eight inch screen whereas
this is only a four inch screen moving
on to memory with the iPhone 5 when you
have 16 32 and 64 gigabyte iterations
but no expandable memory making a bit
difficult for some and for those that
have used iTunes before it does become a
little troublesome sometimes though some
people appreciate it's convenient
syncing feature
the problem is you simply can't just
take a microSD or and I USB cable and
just throw your music and photos on
whereas with galaxy s3 you have 16 32
and 64 gigabyte flavours and in the rear
we do feature a expandable memory slot
as well making it remarkably convenient
for movie and music lovers who don't
want to have to reload their media or go
through a third-party software suite you
can have 128 gigabytes of combined
storage with the galaxy s3 whereas with
the iPhone 5 only 64 gigabytes it's
important to remember that obviously
cloud computing and data syncing is
becoming more prominent though for many
people data bandwidth issues are a
problem so sometimes it is convenient to
have access to physical hard stores that
you can add by yourself moving along to
the battery the galaxy s3 features a
massive 2100 milliamp battery making
remarkably substantial and there are
third-party companies even Samsung
themselves make a battery and extended
battery that is substantially larger
than this which will obviously increase
the profile but for those that need a
long day battery that is possible to get
the iPhone 5 on the other hand features
only a 1400 milliamp battery maybe
perhaps do in fact that it is 19%
thinner than the original iPhone 4s we
will be testing thoroughly to see how it
holds up under intensive web browsing
and multimedia consumption as well as
with overall talktime so moving on to
the rear camera both feature very
similar 8 megapixel cameras this has an
F 2.4 camera excuse me this has an F 2.4
camera whereas this has an F 2.6 camera
arguably the iPhone 5 will be able to
take pictures on par if not better and
we will be testing the low-light
situation which they've claimed they've
been able to improve through a variety
of hardware and software improvements
now going along to the front facing
cameras we have a 1.9 megapixel camera
on the galaxy s3 whereas on the iPhone 5
we only have
point two megapixel camera the galaxy s3
also features NFC technology for Google
Wallet and for other short-range
connectivity technology like Galaxy S
beam where you can share contacts and
information simply by tapping two
devices together making it quite
convenient it only will work with
Samsung Galaxy s3 so at this time the
iPhone 5 sadly does not feature that now
there are LTE variants for both the app
in fact iPhone 5 is in fact capable of
LTE and also HSPA connectivity so it has
some really unusual but also more
advanced connectivity features baked
into the associate cell
otherwise completely different operating
systems this is an Android device with
Ice Cream Sandwich with jelly bean the
latest version of Android that's
featured in the Galaxy Nexus excuse me
the Nexus 7 to come soon
we've been told and this iPhone 5 it
features iOS 6 which is the latest
version of Apple's operating system for
mobile devices the price of the devices
varies by market it's been quite
expensive for us to get this i iphone 5
here in hong kong but in the united
states it will be launching at $1.99
$2.99 and 399 price points 16 32 and 64
gigabytes respectively on a new contract
to buy the device on unlocked you're
looking at upwards of $700 other unique
features include the fact that the
Samsung Galaxy s3 is capable of wireless
charging albeit with the sever backplate
whereas the iPhone 5 is not in addition
to that of course we have a micro USB
plug in on the galaxy s3 making capable
for you to connect to a computer for
simple uploading and downloading data
everything needs to go through iTunes
with the
five now the galaxy of three is the
best-selling Android phone of all time
it has been able to sell over 20 million
units since it was launched in June and
this video is being recorded on
September 21st making it the
best-selling Android device of all time
now the iPhone 5 was able to sell over 2
million units within 24 hours of it
going up for sale so it will be
interesting it will likely be the
best-selling mobile device smartphone
mobile device in history but that
remains to be seen some people think of
it as a minor upgrade but compared when
you compare it to the iPhone 4 it does
feature substantial aesthetic hardware
and software improvements so it
definitely is a true successor to the
iPhone 4s other than that Samsung of
course would like us to focus on a lot
of the software merits that they have
baked in here and they have actually
come a long way in terms of their
TouchWiz overlaying not very intuitive
operation very very fast and with
jellybean coming soon we're gonna be
again guaranteed even faster operation
obviously everything on the iPhone is
smooth they've architected their
software in such a way that it
prioritizes the GUI so that it maintains
the integrity and always ensures smooth
operation so other than that Apple was
able to develop an a6 processor for this
device that an initial benchmark show
that the iPhone 5 is actually
substantially faster than the original
iPhone 4s and on par if not better in
many use cases than the actual Galaxy s3
so basically guys these are the two of
the hottest phones in the world right
now if you're looking for one of the
larger footprint rich colors fast
processing and great optics the galaxy
s3 is to say bad if you are looking for
more convenient operation for one-handed
stuff it's likely that it's likely that
the iPhone 5 could be a great
alternative let's see how quickly you
can take a picture focus all right let's
just do it together now focus focus
see you can see the difference see how
pronounced those whites are on the
galaxy excuse me on the iPhone 5 that's
the difference between LCD and AMOLED
technology both are remarkably fast at
capturing photos something obviously
mobile enthusiasts love to do browsing
something simple like the gallery that's
just here
fix the profile thank you
not both appear to be very satisfying
really fast and definitely now bringing
back to the real brass tacks of these
it's been reputed analysts in the
industry that study mobile all day have
been able to reverse engineer and tear
down the iPhone 5 it features the
building materials of 207 dollars so
that's what it calls for all the
components inside the iPhone 5 and to
manufacturing not including shipping or
duties which are likely nominal maybe
ten dollars or so now the s3 actually
costs around two hundred and
thirty-eight dollars to build a
manufacturer but that is for the 64
gigabyte action it should be noted
though that memory is very cheap for
both manufacturers and in fact it's odd
because these manufacturers work
together closer than many others in the
smartphone space it's rumored that
Samsung in fact built and many of excuse
me not built it manufactured through
their foundry the a6 processor contained
within the iPhone 5 and although they
have constant legal disputes in fact
Samsung losing over 1 billion legal
disputes Apple recently they still do
maintain a harmonious relationship
despite being the biggest competitors in
the smartphone space anyway guys this is
the iPhone 5 vs samsung galaxy s3 you
take your pick
