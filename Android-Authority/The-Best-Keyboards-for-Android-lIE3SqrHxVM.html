handy the Android authority app guy do
you like to type I know I do and after
the intro will show you some of the best
third-party keyboards for Android first
on our list is a I type keyboard plus
this interesting and versatile keyboard
gives users a lot of options all inside
of an eye friendly interface even the
menus in this app look good it's a
fairly accurate keyboard that tries to
compete with SwiftKey on things like
prediction the keyboard works fairly
well and it's also thema below an extent
this includes a transparent option where
you can put an image in the background
to make it whatever you want to really
get the full experience though you have
to use it long enough for it to learn
your typing next up is hackers keyboard
this keyboard has been around for quite
some time and it's a favorite among its
somewhat small but loyal fan base it
features the ability to set up a
keyboard like you can find on any
Windows computer this includes things
like function keys and ctrl + alt you
can resize it to 4 rows to look like
your standard Android keyboard if you
want to and you can set it independently
based on rotation so if you want a
regular keyboard for portrait and a full
keyboard for landscape it's possible
it's also good with tablets and phones
and it's also a little Thema below the
smart Keyboard pro has been a longtime
competitor in the third-party keyboard
market it has improved leaps and bounds
from its earlier editions in terms of
functionality but there are still signs
of its older days like the gingerbread
theme for the keyboard the options are
about as standard as you can get
although there are still more than most
stock keyboard offerings
you can also theme the keyboard but it's
a little bit more complicated than
you'll see from these other keyboards so
it's definitely more for the people who
don't mind taking the long road
sometimes we knew we would be crucified
if we didn't include Swift keys so we
were certainly glad that it was rated
high enough to make the list Swift key
is well Swift key if you haven't seen
the bazillion reviews online already we
did a pretty good one a couple of months
back the predictive text is considered
one of the best the trace keyboard is
considered one of the best and small
things like stats on how efficient you
are and even the theme options help give
Swift key that all-in-one keyboard
experience to put it bluntly yes it
really is that good last and certainly
not least is the venerable swipe
keyboard
the longtime champion of third-party
keyboards it's so good that om have been
packaging it as a stock
keyboard and Android phones for years
it's now available in the Google Play
Store for everyone what can be said that
people don't already know it's the king
of the trace keyboard as most prefer it
over even Swift key for trace typing it
holds the Guinness Book of World Records
for the fastest text message it's solid
it's stable
it has good voice dictation and most of
you have probably already used it or
have it already if you take a look at
our leaderboard you can see how all
these apps stack up against one another
please keep in mind that we do not
personally rate these apps you guys do
there is no bias on our part if you want
to check these out for yourself you can
find the links in the video description
honorable mentions for these include go
keyboard touch pal slide it thumb
keyboard and the vanilla keyboards from
Android 2.3 and 4.2 all of these are
available in the Google Play Store the
only reason why we didn't include OAM
keyboards like sense or TouchWiz is
because they aren't available to
everyone when it comes right down to it
the key is looking for and finding which
keyboards work best for you some people
never leave the OEM of vanilla keyboard
options if there's a great keyboard we
didn't include feel free to let us know
in the comments once again i'm joe hindi

to subscribe to our youtube channel and
check out our social media links in the
