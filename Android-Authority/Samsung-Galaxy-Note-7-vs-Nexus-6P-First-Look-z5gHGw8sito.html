line Samsung once again brings their
flavor of Android to the masses
including the S Pen and now a couple of
new features like the iris scanner but
it does have to go up against what is
considered one of the purest Android
experiences here in Strasburg are from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and this is your quick look at
the samsung galaxy note 7 going up
against the Nexus 6p the samsung galaxy
note 7 continues a glass and metal
design that was permeated through most
of the recent iterations of the galaxy
line but there are some noticeable
enhancements and refinements the main
ones come in the form of water
resistance which both the body and the
s-pen benefit from and that means that
you can actually use the s-pen and right
underwater though we're not exactly sure
why you would want to do so the note 7
also gets a curve on both the display
and the glass backing both of which come
to meet the metal lip now essentially
what this means is that it feels just
very pleasant in the hand other than
that however most of the elements of the
note 7 are largely the same as before
including the s-pen which is now 200
millimeters in length but it's still as
light as ever and no it does not go
backwards into the slot so it will no
longer get stuck and break on the other
hand quite literally is the Nexus 6p the
Huawei made all-metal device that
brought a new design language to the
Nexus lying now there's no denying that
this feels very premium due to all of
the metal but there is a little bit of
slippage that can be had basically
because of its sheer size that said the
six piece best design features include
the dual front-facing stereo speakers
and the placement of the fingerprint
reader though it did take some time to
get used to in the Nexus 6p the USB C
port is now a part of the note 7 so by
now people probably have some USBC cords
lying around but even if that is not the
case an adapter will be made available
in the box contents of the note 7 now
both displays our 5.7 inches in size but
the curves of the Super AMOLED quad HD
display of the note 7 help but feel a
little bit more narrow and also like I
said before the curves allow it to feel
more comfortable in the hand on the
other hand the Nexus 6p with its AMOLED
display does get an ambient display that
Paul's from time to time when you pick
up the phone but it pales in comparison
to an always-on display that Samsung has
been able to put into their note 7
performance does favor the newer phone
which is expected the note 7 gets the
same processing package as the Galaxy s7
and s7 edge which can be the latest sexy
nose or the Snapdragon 820 depending on
one's region the Nexus 6p despite
rocking the Snapdragon 810 should still
be able to keep up with all of its
smooth transitions and it's snappy
performance due to the stock Android
experience there are still going to be
all of those optimizations that you get
with the latest updates to the Android
build samsung finally made some choices
that benefit power users by putting 64
gigabytes as the main on-board storage
there are no other versions of the note
7 and the 64 gigabytes can be bolstered
by microSD card now no such expandable
storage options are available for the
Nexus 6p but if you put down some extra
money there are 64 gigabyte and 128
gigabyte versions of the phone over the
base model of 32 gigabytes and battery
life should pretty much be similar
between these two phones because the
3450 milliamp hour battery of the Nexus
6p is only 50 milli amp hours below that
of the 3500 milliamp hour battery of the
note 7 now security was a pretty big
deal for both of these phones as Nexus
imprint was a focus of this current
generation of Nexus devices now the
fingerprint reader on the note 7 is
still very good you just have to press
the home button in order to open it up
but there's a new form of security on
here and it's called the iris scanner a
dedicated camera next to the
front-facing camera has an infrared
light as well in order to scan one's
iris only one can be registered into the
phone but once all of the elements are
put into place and eyes are lined up
with the HUD like elements that come up
on the screen it actually unlocks the
phone in kind of what feels like no time
a closer look at the scanner and a
couple of security measures that were
added to the note 7 are available in a
separate feature focus video the Nexus
6p may have somewhat popularized the
trend of less megapixels for larger
megapixels with its package of a 12
megapixel camera at F 2.0 aperture
making low-light
Foreman's a priority and then the galaxy
s7 came out with its 12 megapixel camera
with dual pixel technology @f 1.7
aperture in order to make autofocus a
snap and also have good low-light
performance the note 7 gets this same
camera package as the galaxy s7 so its
picture should be pretty similar making
this a comparison that you can make if
you want to look at galaxy s7 photos
compared to the Nexus 6p so despite all
of the differences and some of the
similarities that both of these phones
may have the user experience of these
phones will predicate on which Android
experience you really want the note 7
has a myriad of features to boast
including all of the features that are
included with the s-pen the s-pen is not
only a way for people to put down notes
or to use the s-pen as a pointer or a
kind of mouse in order to navigate
around but it's also an easy way of
sharing with friends there are a lot of
different tools like screen writes or
the notes application which now gives
every single tool needed to create
really nice-looking notes and there's
also the smart select which actually can
now take a 15-second gif and give that
to you to share in a very easy way
there's also an easy way of taking down
notes with the screen off memo but now
the screen off memo can also be pinned
to the always-on display so you have
that information pretty much constantly
at the ready we take a closer look at
the s-pen and all of its new features in
a separate feature focus video as well
and what might be on the very other end
of the spectrum the Nexus 6p is
considered the pure Android experience
and really the stock Android experience
is something you would already expect at
its core it's totally functional and
easy to use but from there there's a
whole different layer to the nexus
experience that has to do with updates
the Android iteration inside of Nexus
devices can be updated with the latest
version with all the security updates
that are involved but there's yet
another layer on top if you want to be
at the bleeding edge of the software
Android n for example is on its way and
I've had it installed on the Nexus 6p
for quite a while now being able to use
the newest version of Android is
actually quite sublime and Android n is
pretty delightful so far now while it's
true that the Nexus 6p is undoubtedly
the less expensive phone at 399 dollars
for the base model you might
so get what you pay for when considering
the shear feature sets the note seven is
stacked and every note device has done
really well to reflect that in their
price points so it really comes down to
what kind of phone experience you want
out of your phone but in either case you
can pretty much say that you're getting
the bleeding edge on the one hand you
have the Samsung Galaxy Note seven at
the forefront of new features that
include the S Pen and the iris scanner
but Android purists will likely already
have the Nexus in mind when they want to
try out the very latest that Google's OS
has to offer stay tuned to Android

samsung galaxy note 7 and our
comparisons with even more devices more
