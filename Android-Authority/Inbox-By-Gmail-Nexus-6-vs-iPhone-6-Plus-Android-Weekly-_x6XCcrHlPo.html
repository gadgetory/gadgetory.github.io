brought to you by harry's welcome back
to android weekly my name is Jace and
this past week saw some good news
regarding Google's new in box and we
compared a little bit the iphone 6 plus
vs Shamu that has been Nexus 6 and 4 you
battery hogs out there we talked about
how some of you can save as much as
forty percent on your battery
consumption oh alright so if you're like
me you spend a lot of time emailing more
than you'd like to you'd know that a lot
of your email is associated with tasks
that you have to do so when you send or
receive an email you have to do
something after that you have to call
someone email someone work on something
and Google's inbox is trying to make an
effort to confuse those two tasks
together they're also trying to allow
you to group a lot of your emails
together which makes it easier to get to
inbox zero which has been a fantasy up
until today please for me Google's goal
within boxes to totally reinvent email
by creating an intelligent system to
sort information and bundle things into
groups so you can better figure out what
is worth reading right now and what's
worth just dismissing beyond this inbox
sort of acts like a personal assistant
with reminders the ability to snooze
items and even create to do's speaking
of to do's and reminders if you write a
reminder to call the hardware store for
example inbox will supply the stores a
phone number and tell you when its open
assist works for your email too if you
make a restaurant reservation online
inbox adds a map to your confirmation
email book a flight online and in box
gives you a link to check in alright so
I was lucky enough to get an invite to
Google's inbox and I've been using the
past couple days and so far love it it's
fantastic my only concern is ads when
will the ads be coming if ever now I
would be willing to pay for the
subscription I suspect many of you would
too it's a gorgeous clean interface I
don't want that to change just bundle it
with Google business apps come on mother
Google gimme some now many people out
there will want to compare the whale of
a phone that is the nexus 6 and the
iphone 6 plus so now we're going to just
do a brief segment facing these two
beasts
off here we go first let's start with
the display we find that the nexus 6 has
a strong head start here the iphone 6
plus is full HD 1080p display catches up
with last year's Android devices but the
Nexus 6 is 1440p display provides a
little extra clarity in this extra-large
handset size the other half of the
display battle comes down to the classic
AMOLED vs LCD arguments here we should
expect the nexus 6 AMOLED display to
feature better black reproduction and
slightly wider color gamut we found that
the AMOLED display offers a little bit
more pop colors than most other LCD
displays now let's talk ram ram might
play a bigger part in multitasking
performance here and the nexus 6
feature's 3 gigabytes plenty for all
situations even given androids tendency
to use more memory than iOS Apple seems
to do well with limited resources when
it comes to ram but I can't help but
feel that the one gigabyte of RAM could
become an issue for more intense
multitaskers alright so that's just to
the hardware features I want to talk
about but I also wanted to talk about
the ecosystems because there's a reality
here if you're like me you've been using
iTunes for more than 10 years and over
that time I've been accumulating media
like almost 20 gigs of music and more
audio books movies videos all that stuff
within the iTunes ecosystem and it's
just much easier to use them on iOS and
Apple devices if I want to use them on
Android devices i first have to convert
them with a program like double twist
double tues was fantastic by the way you
should check that out if you're an
Android lover or you're converting from
iOS to Android so that is a factor do
you have a huge ecosystem in itunes and
if so are you going to be willing to
transfer it over you need to consider
that now if you're a man like me you
enjoy shopping for razors about as much
as you enjoy getting fishville invites
from facebook yeah not too much but if I
neglect it I have to resort to more
painful methods to remove those hairy
hairs on three ready
with its clean and elegant design
Harry's is focused on providing guys
with a great shaving experience at a
fraction of the price of their
competitors this allows you the
convenience and ease of ordering online
and then you get those great high
quality blades engineered at their own
factory in Germany for sharpness and
strength and they've officially launched
two new products foaming shaving gel and
aftershave moisturizer now if you go to
Harry's calm and use the promo code
Android you get five dollars off your
first purchase check it out so one of
the age old debates when it comes to
saving on battery consumption is how
worth wild if at all is it to use apps
or graphics that have dark screens
because if you're using bright screens
the theory is that the battery has to
use more juice to fuel those brighter
screens obviously it must have some
effect the question is how much and now
we know to put this theory to the test
green be calm grab the latest Moto X
which features a 1080p AMOLED display
and an app to measure current draw from
the battery the amount of current draw
was then measured at repeat intervals
using two different display modes on the
reddit sync app which then switches
between colored and mostly black
backgrounds and the verdict is forty
percent that's fantastic now there are
other factors that will influence that
whether or not you're in the bright Sun
you may not be able to use apps like
that but if your app or phone has the
option you should do it alright thanks
