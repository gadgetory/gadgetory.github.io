know that the Galaxy Note seven was a
massive disaster for Sammy but if it's
fun right this could be an advantage for
the note 8 now why you ask why could
this potentially be an advantage for the
note 8 well there would be extra media
attention regarding this new device
because of what happened last year and
if Samsung capitalizes on that there
could be unprecedented hype about this
device first up let's talk about the
release date the Galaxy Note 7 was
announced back in August 2016 and went
on sale in the u.s. the same month it
looks like things won't change much this
year according to a South Korean news
website the Bell Samsung will take the
wraps off the note 8 in mid-august it's
likely that the smartphone will then go
for a pre-order more or less right away
with sales officially kicking off a
couple of weeks later now when it comes
to specs and software just like the
galaxy s 8 Series the note 8 is expected
to sport a curved Super AMOLED display
with a resolution of 29 60 by 1440
pixels with an 1859 aspect ratio however
it is quite a bit bigger when compared
to the one found in the note 7 which
features a 5.7 inch screen the latest
rumors suggest that the note 8 will have
either 6 3 or 6 point 4 inch display the
upcoming phablet is rumored to be
powered by either the latest Snapdragon
835 chipset or the upgraded and yet
unannounced Snapdragon 8:36 while at
least the US model will Samsung is also
expected to offer a variant with the
Exynos 88-90 5 processor under the hood
in Europe and other markets which also
powers the Galaxy s8 the note 8 will
either come with 4 or 6 gigabytes of RAM
and should according to most rumors be
equipped with a dual camera setup on the
back the rumor mill has it that the
device will sport a 12 megapixel
wide-angle lens and a 13 megapixel
telephoto lens that will offer a three
times optical zoom it will also have an
8 megapixel self snappy on board moving
on to the fingerprint sensor it looks
like it won't be built into the screen
of the device as was originally expected
according to a report
naver there are still various technical
limitations when it comes to in display
fingerprint scanners which is why
Samsung will not use one on the note 8
interestingly though multiple reports
claim Apple has managed to do so in the
upcoming iPhone based on the fact that
the note 8 will feature small bezels
around the screen the company won't be
able to mount the fingerprint sensor on
the front either as there's just not
enough room available below the screen
this means once again that the
fingerprint scanner will likely be found
on the back of the device let's just
hope Samsung won't place it right next
to the camera like they did with the
Galaxy S 8 series the node 8 will look
more or less the same as the galaxy s 8
with a few minor differences here and
there it will be a little bit bigger and
should have a slightly redesigned back
thanks to the dual camera setup as well
as a different fingerprint scan or
location we can hope on the front not
much is expected to change this is
probably considered a good thing by a
majority of users as the galaxy s 8 is a
real stunner
although the note 8 will have a larger
display than its predecessor it won't
really be much bigger physically based
on the small bezels surrounding the
screen nevertheless it's still
technically a phablet meaning that it
won't be easy to use with one hand the
design of the device has potentially
appeared in a recently leaked video
showing what is claimed to be the front
glass cover of the note 8 as always
there's a lot of debate about the
veracity of the screen shown but you can
check it out for yourself so how much
will this puppy cost you think about
three decent laptops there's still a
chance you might be able to get the
smartphone for around 850 bucks u.s. but
a price tag of 900 dollars maybe more
likely especially if the base storage
goes up and the phone gets an additional
camera Samsung might have no choice but
to bump the price so what do you guys
think is the king of phablets holding
its crown let me know in the comments
