smartphone with an affordable price tag
although it makes a great first
impression on paper how well is it
really fair in day-to-day use this is
Bailey Stein with Android authority and
this is my full review of the Lenovo k3
note the k3 note offers a relatively
basic design with the somewhat boxy feel
in the hand the edges are easy to grip
though the matte plastic rear resist
both fingerprints and scratches well and
the tactile feeling buttons are
positioned perfectly for one-handed use
at 8 millimeters and 150 grams it's fair
to say that the k3 note is an average
sized smartphone the back cover is easy
to remove and lets you access the
user-replaceable 3000 milliamp hour
battery microSD card slot and dual micro
SIM slots
unlike many smartphones the k3 Notes
microUSB port is located at the top of
the device near the headphone jack
whether you like this will depend on
your personal preference but I found
myself preferring it since it actually
makes it easier to charge the device
while listening to music also the rear
speaker is located near the top on the
back of the phone which makes it easier
to hold the phone without destroying the
audio with that said it's undoubtedly
still inferior to front-facing speakers
the three capacitive keys on the front
of the k3 note menu home and back
sadly do not illuminate although some
may be disappointed by this there was
never a time when I had trouble finding
each button in addition to a five
megapixel front facing camera there's
also a notification LED at the top-right
which illuminates red for charging and
green for missed calls the 5.5 inch
1080p display on the k3 note looks great
and has good viewing angles color
reproduction is accurate and while the
phone does have better sunlight
readability than the Asus zenfone 2 it's
still lacking when compared to other
devices like the meizu m2 note it can be
difficult to read while outdoors but
otherwise provides a great viewing
experience well it is coated in dragon
trail protection I did notice a few
minor scratches on my unit after just a
few days of use powered by the octa-core
64-bit mediatek mt6752 processor clocked
at 1.7 gigahertz the k3 note is very
powerful for
price although the benchmark scores are
relatively high the phone did lock up a
few times during my testing it's far
from a major issue but it can still be
pretty annoying when watching a YouTube
video or scrolling through a web page in
chrome luckily the device would restore
twits responsive state within about five
to ten seconds but again it can be kind
of frustrating there's also two
gigabytes of RAM for basic multitasking
as well as the mali t760 GPU the k3 note
was able to handle gaming very well and
I don't have any issues to report with
support for 802 11 and Wi-Fi GPS and
Bluetooth 4.1 the k3 note has all of the
connectivity options you'd expect the
Wi-Fi signal is very strong and the GPS
signal is also pretty good it's actually
providing more than double the range
that I had with the new mobiles the
eight and I can get a reliable Wi-Fi
connection with the k3 note in areas
where my Dell XPS 13 can't cellular
network support will vary based on the
model you purchase although I was able
to receive HSPA+ on 80 in the United
States although there is single sim
support for 4G LTE you won't be able to
receive those speeds within the US
regardless of the model the speaker on
the k3 note is surprisingly good when it
comes to clarity but it could use a bump
in volume it's much better than the
speaker on the zenfone 2 and while it
isn't as loud as the m2 note speaker it
doesn't include nearly as much
Distortion
backed by a 3000 milliamp hour user
replaceable battery the k3 note is
pretty much expected to provide
excellent battery life fortunately it
delivers I started my day at 7 a.m. with
brightness set to 100% for most of the
day and Wi-Fi on for about half I washed
about a half hour of YouTube videos
played a few games and also ran a couple
of benchmarking applications the phone
did call it a day slightly earlier than
I did at around 10 p.m. with just over 4
hours of screen on time I think the
battery life is on par with the meizu m2
note and you do have to remember that a
k3 note offers the option to swap out
the battery if needed in addition to
that lenovo has also included a couple
of power saving modes for even better
battery life the 13 megapixel rear
camera captured mostly nice-looking
images although there were times when it
had trouble focusing images appear to be
fairly sharp and detailed and the dual
LED flash is very bright low-light
images taken without the flash didn't
turn out so well as expected but overall
I think it takes some very good pictures
when you factor in the cost of the phone
Lenovo's camera app lets you change
white balance and ISO as well as select
specific scenes it offers a bit more
control than average and I would say
that it's definitely an improvement over
media Tech's camera app the k3 note runs
5 UI 2.5 on top of Android 5.0 lollipop
out of the box vibe UI has matured quite
a bit over the past year but I still
think that it could use a bit more
polish the general user interface is
mediocre and I'm far from a fan of the
default system app icons with that said
you can use lenovo's built-in theme
center to change the general look and
feel of the software experience it's
fairly robust although I do wish that we
could see English text previews for
different font types also the stock
launcher is missing an app drawer the
lockscreen doesn't display our
notifications and there are just certain
areas of vibe UI
feela Ted unpolished that doesn't mean
the software experience is all bad
however I actually prefer the
notification shade overstock androids
and I do appreciate the extra software
features and gestures that Lenovo has
added there have been a few other
reviews posted which criticized the
phone for having annoying blow wear but
your experience will vary depending on
who you purchase the phone from the
stock rom does not include Google Apps
so many resellers are adding them before
shipping the devices out however some of
those resellers may also be adding some
additional blow air which may compromise
the overall software experience if
you're looking to purchase this phone
officially in India you won't have to
worry about this at all since lenovo's
stock rom ships without the insane level
of bloatware and also includes Google
Apps the moral of the story here is to
do your own research before buying from
a specific reseller and be aware that
you may have to flash a different ROM to
get a more desirable software experience
the Lenovo k3 note is available
officially in India for ten thousand
rupees and can be imported in the US for
about $160 if you're not a fan of the
golden yellow color you can always pick
up a white or black model instead also
if the single sixteen gigabyte partition
isn't enough you can always expand the
storage by using a microSD card up to 64
gigabytes the Lenovo k3 note is one of
the best smartphones available for under
$200 with a good display excellent
performance in a large battery to keep
it going the k3 note gets the essentials
right however the design could be
considered too simplistic for some the
display offers poor sunlight readability
and the speaker could use a bump in
volume those drawbacks are all
relatively minor though when considering
the phone's very competitive price point
I would say that it's a better value
than the base model Asus zenfone 2 if
you can get LTE and maybe even the meizu
m2 note depending on your preferences do
keep in mind that the m2 note shines
more in design and display quality while
the k3 note focuses more on performance
and speaker quality in conclusion the k3
note is yet another great option in the
budget smartphone space thank you for
