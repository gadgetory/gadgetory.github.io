Authority and this is the Nubia Z it's
been out for a while now in other
regions like China but it's coming to
the States to compete with other
flagship Android phones what does this
phone do differently from the myriad of
other high-end Android flagships that
make this phone worth buying let's find
out with the Nubia Z 11 so the new uz 11
doesn't have the most eye-catching or
original design but it is a pretty
good-looking phone with solid build
quality it's an all metal unibody
rectangular slab that's really thin at
7.5 millimeters feels great in the hands
and puts its build quality on par with a
lot of other flagships it's got rounded
corners and slight tapers around the
back and sides which make it more
comfortable to hold but because it's
bare aluminum and there aren't any sharp
or flat edges to help with a grip the
phone can be a little slippery and tough
to hold on to at times because this is a
Nubia phone you'll notice some red
accents on the phone like the ring
around the camera lens and the bright
red capacitive keys along the bottom of
the display to make the phone stand out
a little more
the z11 also comes in a black and gold
color if you want something a little
more flashy over the standard silver and
grey and personally I think this color
option looks much nicer and makes the
phone look a little bit more unique
going around the device you've got the
power button and volume rocker on the
right side which are also made of metal
so they're very clicky and tactile and
they're positioned well enough that
they're easy to reach and press with
your thumb on the left side is the SIM
card slot that also houses a micro SD
card slot for expandable storage and on
top you have the headphone jack and an
IR blaster which can be really
convenient for controlling your TV and
other peripherals especially considering
a lot of phones nowadays don't have this
feature finally on the bottom you have
the USB type-c port and what looks like
dual speakers but only the right side
houses a speaker while the other is just
a microphone the speaker sounds fine and
doesn't get distorted or tinny at all at
max volume but it's a little on the
quiet side and a half volume or less it
becomes pretty tough to hear on the back
of the phone you also have a fingerprint
sensor which has worked extremely well
it's fast accurate takes very little
time to set up and I've had no issues
with it it's been very reliable and
rarely
never misread my fingerprint so it's
definitely on par with some of the best
fingerprint sensors on the market one of
the most eye-catching parts about the
z11 is the display it's a 5.5 inch LCD
display but instead of quad HD like most
high-end flagships does the Elevens
display is actually 1080p it's very
bright
has very saturated colors good viewing
angles and it still looks plenty sharp
that web browsing playing games and
watching YouTube is not an issue
whatsoever so unless you're using this
phone for VR you're not going to be able
to notice any difference what makes a
screen stand out though is that it's
basically bezel is on the left and right
sides and part of the reason why Nubia
has been able to achieve this bezel
let's look is by curving down the sides
of the display if you used other Nubia
phones in the past you're probably used
to seeing this but it's still really
impressive to look at simply because we
haven't seen this from many other phone
manufacturers and it really feels like
you're holding just a screen in your
hands because the side bezels are so
thin it also makes this phone feel a lot
smaller and more compact and comparison
to other 5.5 inch smartphones the curves
on the sides of the screen aren't as
drastic as what you might find on the s7
edge or note 7 but that didn't stop
Nubia from adding some additional
software tweaks to take advantage of the
super thin side bezels you can do a
variety of different things like adjust
the screens brightness by sliding two
fingers up and down along the edges of
the display swipe up or down from the
edge to switch between apps you have
running in the background
swipe repeatedly from the edge to close
all recent apps and hold along the edge
and swipe inwards to quickly switch to a
specific homescreen
they all sound really useful but can be
a little awkward to use and some of them
aren't that much faster than doing
things the traditional way I also ran
into a lot of issues with accidentally
triggering these features from just
holding the phone but fortunately all
these features can be disabled if you
run into the same problems or don't find
them all that useful inside it's got the
typical specs for a 2016 flagship you
have the Snapdragon 820 4 gigs of ram
and 64 gigs of internal storage and if
you opt for the higher-end black and
gold model this actually comes with 6
gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigs of
internal storage while I can't comment
on what performance is like on the 6
gigabyte model performance has been
perfectly fine on the 4 gigs of ram
version even with Nubia is very heavy
skinned it's been very fast and
they use from launching apps web
browsing watching videos and playing a
lot of graphically intensive games it
does all those things without much of a
problem with the only exception being
multitasking the multitasking experience
on this phone feels very slow and clunky
there's no recent apps key so instead
you have to long press the back key to
get to your recent apps and the loading
of the recent apps usually takes a good
couple of seconds the apps are also laid
out in a horizontal view allowing to
only see a couple apps at a time and
swiping back and forth to switch between
apps is a much slower experience in
comparison to something like the card
stack layout from stock Android as far
as battery life goes it's nothing out of
the ordinary it's got a three thousand
milliamp hour battery and Nubia says
their battery optimizations will allow
you to get two days worth of battery but
in my experience it never lasted more
than just a typical days worth of use
with texting social media email web
browsing and a couple hours of YouTube
and gaming per day the phone usually
lasted between 12 to 13 hours off the
charger which is far from Nubia stood a
claim but it was always good enough to
get me comfortably through a day and yes
of course with this being a flagship and
running a snapdragon 820
it does come a quick charge 3.0 to make
it really fast and easy to get this
phone back up and running the camera
isn't rocking any fancy dual lens setup
that we've been starting to see on a lot
of other smartphones but it is packin
some rather interesting features the
front camera is an 8 megapixel lens and
if you're into taking selfies it is
definitely more than good enough to do
that the rear camera comes in at 16
megapixels with f 2.0 aperture optical
image stabilization and phase detection
autofocus the camera app is
straightforward and easy to use but it
does look very I Oh s like you can swipe
left or right to switch between
different camera modes and there are
some modes built into this camera that
make it unique and fun to use for
example there's a clone mode that we're
overlapped several photos to make it
appear as if there are multiples of a
person or object in one photo and for
the most part it does a pretty good job
of stitching these photos together but
it isn't always perfect
another interesting mode on the z11 is
called electronic aperture and this mode
lets you dial in an aperture from as
wide as f 2.8 to as narrow as f 44
changing the aperture will effectively
change the shutter speed from as little
as three tenths of a second to
72 seconds long and the longer shutter
speeds will allow you to capture some
very silky smooth motion blur with
moving subjects while still keeping
everything else that's stationary in
focus the z11 has three types of
stabilization built in to allow you use
this feature with just your hands but in
my experience the results were still
much better with a tripod especially if
you're using shutter speeds that are
over a minute long in terms of general
picture quality it's actually quite good
the pictures that it takes are
pleasantly sharp and detailed and
there's a good amount of color to make
them look pleasing to the eye but not so
much that they look oversaturated or
unnatural it does however have the
tendency to overexpose and blow out
highlights which can be alleviated by
using HDR the thing I like most about
the HDR mode on this camera is that it
will automatically take a standard shot
and an HDR shot for you in one take
which can ultimately save you a lot of
time and hassle from having to switch
back and forth between HDR and standard
photos and low-light the camera does
tend to focus on a lot which makes the
camera experience feel a lot slower but
the pictures that it takes in low-light
still have a relatively good amount of
detail there isn't a whole lot of
graininess or noticeable noise reduction
but it still has problems with properly
exposing highlights just like it does in
daytime shots it's currently running
Android 6.0 marshmallow with Nubia UI
version 4.0 which drastically changes
the entire Android experience it's
filled with very bright and cartoonish
looking icons a lot of transparency
effects and there's also no app drawer
but Nubians UI does come jam-packed with
some pretty interesting features if you
long press on the fingerprint sensor or
hold volume down in power this will give
you the option to take a long screen
shot which is great for web articles a
standard screen shot that you can crop
into different shapes like hearts and
circles or create a screen recording my
favorite feature is actually the way
this phone handles split-screen
multitasking to enter split-screen
multitasking all you have to do is swipe
up from the bottom of the display but
instead of give you a list of
applications like you would get on other
smartphones that have split-screen
multitasking the z11 splits the screen
into two separate desktops it's a very
different approach but by doing it this
way you're able to use virtually any
application that you want the only
exception is the camera but just because
you can use any apps you want it doesn't
necessarily mean that you should apps
like games can open up as
flat-screen view but they aren't exactly
split-screen friendly but apps like
social media email text and chrome work
just as you would expect pricing for the
Nubia Z 11 in the US is still to be
determined but in other regions it's
currently going for 499 euros for the
standard version and 599 euros for the
black and gold edition hopefully these
prices aren't an indication of what the
US prices might be because if they are
then the z11 is going to be fairly
expensive for an unlocked phone but the
big question here is if this phone is
worth getting over other flagships the
z11 is a good flagship phone from Nubia
but it doesn't necessarily have a ton of
compelling reasons to make this phone a
better option over the smartphones
currently available had it came to the
US a lot earlier in the year it might
have snagged a lot more attention but at
this point in 2016 there's a ton of
great Android options at a variety of
different price points and Nubia might
be a little too late to the party as
