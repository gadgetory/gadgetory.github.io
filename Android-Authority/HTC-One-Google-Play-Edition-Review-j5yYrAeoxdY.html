that was given the Google Play edition
treatment the very well-received
flagship from HTC has been Google fide
as well hey it's Josh regard from
Android I thought hey what's going on
everybody and this is the HTC one Google
Play edition it should be obvious
already that this phone is nearly
identical to the original HTC one as
such I won't be getting in-depth into
all of the details that remain the same
for a closer look at those specs check
out Chris's full review of the original
HTC One everything down to the battery
is the same and of course it is the
software that has really changed in this
Google Play edition of HTC's phone this
aluminum clad smartphone brought a bro
freshing industrial look into the
smartphone market it is metal smooth and
although a black edition of the original
is available only the silver version is
found in the Play Store the HTC One
didn't get into the 5-inch screen game
and instead brought a 4.7 inch screen
capable of 1080p resolution at 469 PPI
the stock Android experience looks great
on this display performance wise you get
the same great performing Snapdragon 600
clocked in at 1.7 gigahertz and backed
by the audrina 320 and two gigabytes of
RAM even though Sense 5 worked really
well in the original the Google Play
editions jellybean speeds through its
elements as quickly as ever when it
comes to hardware the HTC One doesn't
have expandable memory or a removable
battery 32 gigabytes of onboard memory
provides plenty of space to work and
play the main attraction however is of
course the two front-facing boomsound
speakers they sound just as great on
this version of the HTC One and are
great for sharing media straight from
the phone
the 2300 milliamp power battery found in
the HTC one is it removable but gives
the same good longevity and so we get to
the camera which is the very same four
megapixel shooter from the original
these are HTC's patented ultra pixels
which are supposed to bring better
picture quality by focusing on good
light capture instead of high megapixel
count the app itself has obviously been
stripped in lieu of android stock camera
in the conversion you do lose HTC Zoe
and the original interface the stock
Android camera app is stylishly
simplistic though as the whole screen
becomes the viewfinder and only a few
buttons lay on the side the settings are
accessed by touch and swipe navigations
through arches as far as modes go there
are some preset scenes HDR and of course
the photosphere quality of the pictures
is just about as good as was found on
the original HTC one as the ultra pixel
still do their job low-light performance
is still good though it does seem that
losing the software optimizations from
the original HTC one camera app causes
photos to lose a little bit of fidelity
I will have a full versus that will go
more in depth on the camera but I can
say that the stock Android camera
performs just below the original and
finally we make it to software at least
for me one of the best parts about the
original HTC One was its upgraded Sense
UI blinkfeed helped to make sense 5 more
attractive and useful well you lose all
of that in the Google Play edition and
gain the stock Android experience that
many of us do Pine over and really it is
a very welcome change the real jellybean
experience translates very well to the
HTC One personally as far as operating
system experience goes I would have had
fun with either stock Android or even
sense 5 it made more sense to change the
game with the s4 as its TouchWiz is
definitely getting old anyway the
experience is quintessential Android do
you have your home screens your AB
drawer the notification drop-down with
the elegant shade for frequently used
settings you also get the daydream app
to make the HTC One O'Clock or extra
display while charging lock screen
widgets are available as well oh and you
can't forget about Google now jellybean
is a well featured operating system that
ops for simplicity and utility over
numerous extras or quite on
over trying too hard it fits right into
HTC ones design and should please just
about anyone who puts down the money to
enjoy it speaking of that price it is
probably the only difficult part about
the HTC One Google Play edition it got
the nexus treatment but it didn't get
the Nexus price users who want this
version will have to shell out five
hundred ninety nine dollars for the full
unlocked version in the Google Play
Store and so there you have it the HTC
One with the real Google experience I
actually think that the HTC One makes
even more sense to get Google fied
because much of what was included with
the original can somewhat be translated
over if you miss Beats Audio you can
easily find an equaliser app and enhance
your sound if you miss blinkfeed plenty
of other news and social media
aggregators like Flipboard are available
HTC Zoe quirky camera apps can have your
back there when it comes to hardware the
front-facing speakers and the ultra
pixel powered camera you can still enjoy
what the HTC One has to offer through
the vanilla Android operating system yes
the price point is a little bit tough to
fathom have the moments which is
probably why the expected exodus to
these Google Play edition devices hasn't
exactly happened yet but let me present
to you a possibility if you really
wanted the stock Android experience on
your HTC one then of course rooting and
flashing custom roms is definitely a
route anyone previously skeptical about
doing so can look to the GPS and see
that Google is pretty much saying to you
it would be ok especially if you
wouldn't missed a few main extras that
are available in the original HTC one
rest assured that the quintessential
Android experience is definitely a great
way of enjoying your HTC One no wonder
we love our stock Android like I said
earlier I will have a full versus
pinning this Google Play edition of the
HTC One against its original make sure
