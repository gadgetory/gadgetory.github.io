the top tier smartphone market with the
release of their fine 5 and now to
follow up on the success of that they
decided to think a little bit outside
the box with a phone that just might be
a little too big for that box hey it's
Josh regard for manage or authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the Oppo n1 in the 6-inch device we're
going to be seeing not only size but
some interesting design choices starting
from the bottom and going to the top all
the ports on the n1 are located on the
bottom opting for a somewhat different
layout that allows for the sides to
remain pretty minimalistic there we have
the headphone jack the microUSB port and
the rather small speaker it admittedly
does succeed at freeing up the sides but
might not always be practical the sides
have a thick rim and how's the button
layout all on the right side located
lower on the device which is a great
move you'll be able to trigger the power
button pretty easily and also the volume
rocker is even lower on the device which
actually makes it pretty nice especially
when you're on the phone we see the 5.9
inch screen up front but while that is
quite a size already a pretty thick
bezel all around it further adds to the
girth there is even more up top with the
camera optics and then down below with
the capacitive keys the back is made up
of a smooth material all of the
literature will tell you is ceramic like
in reality it is aluminum modified to
have a soft touch feel it feels really
nice and is one material choice least
prone to finger printing or smudges and
etching is barely noticeable a little
bit higher than in the middle this is
the O touch area which is a secondary
touch sensitive space that is supposed
to make life on such a large device even
easier more on that in a bit finally we
make it to the top and what is perhaps
oboes most unique addition the rotating
13 megapixel camera the entire unit
rotates in a 206 degree arc allowing not
only for rear-facing shots but also for
a high quality front-facing
self-portrait beast while moving parts
often run the risk of wearing out over
time Opel claims that it can withstand a
ton of rotations and never lose Vidal
so far that does seem to hold up try
going from these capacitive keys all the
way back up top to the notification drop
down with one hand it just simply can't
be done this is definitely a phone made
for two hands but thankfully it is a
good-looking one to boot and it has
material choice that gives it very good
looks as well as a weight that keeps it
from being too heavy so you should still
have an enjoyable time having this in
both of your hands the N one comes with
a 5.9 inch IPS display that gives 1080p
resolution and pax 373 pixels per inch
these are specifications that we'd
expect on a large screen and they happen
to work pretty well
IPS creams tend to mean high brightness
and even in daylight the n1 performs
pretty well the aptly-named color OS
puts this screen through its paces
while the blacks might not be too deep
the color still is very pleasant and
thus provides a good experience whether
you're watching videos or reading text
big screens equal big media and you
should be able to enjoy just about
anything on this screen well after
you've done what you need to navigate on
it the n1 actually falls short a little
bit by not packing the fastest current
processing package available the
Snapdragon 600 at 1.7 gigahertz and the
audrina 320 power this beast putting it
just behind the Snapdragon 800
performers empirically thankfully these
Snapdragon 600 still holds up just fine
and provides a good experience through
the flourishes and smooth transitions of
color OS after quite a bit of daily use
I'd never found myself delayed while
needing to do my tasks while there might
be snappier experiences out there the n1
is definitely not far behind
hardware takes on some of that
out-of-the-box thinking here but we'll
get to the N ones little friend in a
second 16 or 32 gigabite varieties of
the n1 are available though not
expandable due to this unibody design
you won't be getting into the back to
remove that battery and to replace it
but that's okay because this 36 10
million power unit performs very well
after an entire weekend of going out
taking pictures taking calls and even
downloading a bunch of apps via mobile
networks the Oppo n1 was able to last
throughout the entire weekend and
finally tuckered out after pretty much
too full worked
if large phones are supposed to mean a
lot of longevity the Oppo n1 is a
shining example of good battery life in
that game I did find however that
Bluetooth had a couple issues when
paired to my lg tom bluetooth headphones
the sound came through just fine in the
connection held but the button sometimes
wouldn't work call quality was good as
the top speaker provided good sound and
very little drop-off speaking of
networks the Oppo n1 does not have LTE
support so whether you're on AT&amp;amp;T or
t-mobile in the States you're just gonna
have to settle for HSDPA connectivity
and if you thought the speaker on the
bottom of the phone was a little small
while it is and it has the quality to
match the n1 is able to get pretty loud
considering but it sound is almost
expectedly just below average and now we
can get to the O touch area which is
found pretty much around the middle of
the back portion of the Oppo n1 it
basically is a secondary touch sensitive
area that allows you to do some extra
tasks that otherwise wouldn't be very
easy on this huge screen you can
basically just tap or swipe your finger
in that area and it allows you to swipe
among the home screens in your galleries
or if you tap it while you're in the
camera app you will be able to take an
easy self-portrait currently it is a
rather limited technology but it should
open up in possibilities what the SDK
being sent out to developers for now
though it is just a really nice idea
that has yet to show its full potential
and finally the O click this small
module is a little unassuming it
actually has a nice look to it as you
would expect this is a Bluetooth module
that allows for phone finding and vice
versa however with the unique camera
Oppo also added in the O click as a
wireless trigger it works pretty much as
advertised and there weren't any real
issues that I found as a handy little
tool the old click being bundled in with
the n1 package is a very welcome
addition that definitely adds to its
value now we can talk about that
rotating camera to be fair a rotating
camera is not necessarily new but it is
in the smartphone space especially for a
phone as huge as the n1 this 13
megapixel shooter provides high-end
specifications and 10
P video capture with a few extras in the
app you don't get too much manual
control but some scenes and filters are
available to get you just what you need
and after taking a picture an
interesting beautify feature allows you
to get extra post editing done even
going as far as applying a makeup
palette over your subjects face quality
coming from the six piece lens
construction yields pretty good shots
indeed you'll get vibrant and really
nice pictures out in the daylight and in
very well-lit situations further
enhanced by the included HDR
capabilities some of the shots I got
were really great with nice color
reproduction and quite a bit of detail
the only thing that was really lacking
even in perfect conditions was
stabilization it's very easy to get a
blurry shot if you don't have super
steady hands my best advice in these
cases is to take a bunch of shots at
once
that way you can make sure that at least
one of them will probably be just right
you already wouldn't take this huge
phone out for a night out on the town
but even if you did the low-light
performance is pretty lacking the dual
flash diode does help somewhat but is
often so bright that it washes out
detail it is supposed to provide a nice
skin tone and in a way it does but it
does that at the cost of some detail in
your subjects face which might not be
the best trade-off speaking of
trade-offs if you do decide to try
taking shots without the flash you
better have a steady hand because the
lack of stabilization makes getting good
shots kind of difficult downloaded
updates do improve the quality of the
camera but all in all the general idea
here remains about the same the video
capture on the OCO and one is actually
quite good and if you rotate that camera
all the way around you could probably
get some pretty easy vlogging done
however other than that the rotating
camera on the Oppo n1 is probably at
best a great conversation starter some
stealth photos might add some fun to
your smartphone experience but that's a
situation you won't always find yourself
in nor should you try to
so despite all of the possibilities that
were opened up with having a rotating
camera we still don't find that the Oppo
n1 allows you to get pictures as easily
as we would have hoped and finally we
come to the software I know I know
you're wondering about the CyanogenMod
developments we did see earlier this
year that Oppo and Savage and Mach
teamed up in order to bring what was
affectionately called the CyanogenMod
phone in a way that is supposed to be
the n1 however the version that I have
is not this antigen monthon that will be
a limited edition that will be released
later this year however if you still
want to get signage in mod put onto your
n1 that originally has color OS although
we'll have all of the tools that you
need ready in the coming weeks so what
we get instead is color OS the evolved
version of the user interface that we
saw in defined 5 quite literally it is a
skin over classic Android elements with
a few different and unique features
baked in in particular the entire
interface can be changed via different
themes and add-ons of note is the color
OS edition of dedicated media areas like
for the camera and for playing music -
that is a live weather feature that
allows for the whole homescreen to
reflect real conditions one of the more
functional features is somewhat hidden
drag down from the very left of the
notification drop-down and you'll get a
canvas on which you can draw any number
of programmable gestures it's a nice way
to get straight to where you need
without too much fuss
however after all of this color OS is
basically a pretty classic Android
experience the home screens are your
customization canvases and then you have
the app drawer which can actually be
modified with multiple pages for
arranging your applications freely and
though we know that translations between
regions is likely the cause of this I
did however find a couple of typos
across the board color OS does come with
a number of really smooth transitions
flourishes if you will that have an Lu
factor to them it makes for an almost
ethereal experience especially when you
use one of the lush wallpapers it could
just use a little bit more polish
overall however you have a very
functional and very elegant operating
system in the color OS
while we don't have too much information
regarding the final price point of the
Oppo n1 it should come in at around $600
or possibly more and that's considering
a conversion from Chinese currency to
u.s. dollars it may come in at a little
bit more they may come in at a little
bit less but considering all that the
Oppo n1 comes with we want to be
surprised and so there you have it the
Oppo n1 if large screens are looking to
be our future Oppo got a lot right in
this particular release but if you still
aren't convinced a six inch phone is for
you maybe all that was added in will
entice you
despite some finicky consistency the
rotating camera is a great idea that
could use better stabilization and
perhaps a dialed back flash the color OS
is elegantly functional though plenty of
Western users will probably want
CyanogenMod and despite its size it's
hard to argue with build quality on such
a well-put-together device size truly
does matter when it comes to the Oppo n1
however if it's size is the only thing
that's keeping you from liking this
phone well then maybe you should give it
another try
and you might end up enjoying it just as
much as I did as always thank you guys
very much for watching and I hope you
