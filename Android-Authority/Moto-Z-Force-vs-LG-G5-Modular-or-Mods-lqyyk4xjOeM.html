of 2016 and we've seen the word
modularity being thrown out a lot we've
already seen two devices that try to
take this idea and execute them quite
well the first one being one from LG and
then another phone by moto that didn't
necessarily do modularity but certainly
use the word mod which of these two
actually puts new features onto the
phone in a very user accessible way what
we're going to find out but not only by
looking at the modularity but also
looking at the phones themselves it's
Josh regard from Android thority what's
going on everybody and this is the Moto
Z versus the LG g5
now as is the case with these verses
videos you can go ahead and look at the
full reviews for both of these devices
here at Android authority comms youtube
channel you can also find the full
written reviews at andrew authority comm
as well and another note we are going to
talk about the modularity or in the case
of the moto z force the modding
capabilities of these phones but we're
going to take a look at both of these
devices as stand-alone phones first but
with the Moto Z force you have the
larger of the two phones here and
actually the thicker and somewhat more
feature-packed of the moto z line very
shiny metals what you get on the backing
so it is really fingerprint prone and on
the front you have two very large bezels
one of which houses the fingerprint
reader which is a square underneath of
the display and also that fingerprint
reader because it's a square on the
bottom does make us feel like it's a
button when in reality all it does is
read fingerprints the larger Moto Z
force gets a chamfer because it is a bit
thicker and if you look on the backing
there the camera optic package does pop
out quite a bit which means that the
moto covers which snap very neatly onto
the back are kind of needed in order to
make it flush and of course on the back
we have magnets on the top and on the
bottom where those connector pins are in
order for you to put the moto mods onto
here which work simply as a
plug-and-play
deal now contrast that with the LG g5
now putting aside all of the talk about
paints and everything like that this is
a metal device through and through that
has a different shape on compared to
previous LG devices gone are the days of
the curve to display or leave in the
curved phone and gone are the days of
the rear-mounted button layouts now you
just get the single button on the back
but there is a fingerprint reader
installed and above it is the dual
camera setup with a wide-angle lens on
top of the regular camera it is the
smaller of the two devices which will
make its handling just that little bit
better but that is also because of a 5.3
inch display when compared to the Moto
Z's 5.5 inch display and of course on
the bottom there on the side is a
release button that you have to hold
down in order to slide off the entire
bottom part of the g5 this is where the
battery will be snapped out and put into
other modules in order to create the
modularity that the g5 introduced at
beginning of this year really it's up to
you guys which one looks better but
there is one big advantage that the Moto
Z has over the LG g5 customization now
because those magnets on the back will
allow for the attachment of plenty of
different modal mods thirty of which are
available now you can also get a number
of moto covers and in the case of our
phones we got dark wooden ones that snap
neatly onto the back and give it the
look that you probably remember from the
Moto X a bunch of them will be made
available so even if you don't really
like the look of the Moto Z right now of
course you can put some covers on that
will change it and also make that camera
package flush the displays for both of
these devices are feature packs and
comment quad HD resolution but the Moto
Z has a slightly larger display at 5.5
inches compared to the 5.3 inch display
of the LG g5 now the LG g5 does have an
IPS display compared to the AMOLED of
the Moto Z so the coloration might be a
little bit different but if you want the
colors to be that little bit more
punched out then the Moto Z might prove
a little bit better for you now there
isn't always display on the LG g5 that
shows icons for various notifications
and it is always available even when the
phone is in standby now moto display was
always a very nice feature in the Moto X
and it returns on the Moto Z simply wave
your hand over the sensor or even close
to the phone and a monochromatic
pulsating display will come up if there
are notifications there you can actually
hold on to the icons and action upon
them by swiping up down left or right
you can also kind of take your pick when
it comes to the specifications about
devices after all they come with the
Snapdragon 820 the adrenal 530 and four
gigabytes of RAM storage can be made
from 32 or 64 gigabytes when it comes to
the LG g5 but the Moto Z only comes with
32 built in thankfully both phones do
have microSD card slots for bolstering
that onboard storage so you can always
put a microSD card inside if you really
need it there is one big problem with
the Moto Z and that's its availability
it's only available on Verizon Wireless
and only works on that network so if you
want to get a version that is unlocked
you have to go outside the US or wait
until Moto finally makes them for us
perhaps unsurprisingly the battery life
battle goes to the one that has the most
capacity and that would be the Moto Z
force with
500 milliamp hours compared to the LG g5
which has 2800 milliamp hours but with
normal usage we get pretty much the
standard amount of battery life here
with a day to a day and half depending
on usage but when it comes to charging
the LG g5 actually has a bit of an
advantage because it adheres to the
quick charge 3.0 standard the Moto Z and
the Moto Z force for that matter require
their Chargers that are in the box
because they have the cords that are
tethered to the blocks but if you do use
those you get really good charging time
about half battery in about half an hour
which is the same that can be said for
the LG g5 when using proper quick charge
3.0 adapters which brings us to the
cameras and one of the first things
we'll mention is the wide angle lens
that's found on the rear of the LG g5
without even any mods put into it you
already get an extra on the LG g5 and
the wide angle lens is a pure joy to use
it's not necessarily going to be the
highest quality or even the sharpest
output but it is great to use when you
want to do things like take very
interesting selfies or if you want to do
flogging footage you get much more in
this very wide angle lens almost as much
as a GoPro so if you want to get let's
say a landscape it's probably the one
you want to go for the more conventional
cameras found on the Moto Z and the Moto
z-force are pretty standard they don't
necessarily excel in any one place but
they also aren't all that bad and work
well as daily companions when it comes
to the coloration however we do notice a
warmer tone in the Moto Z in most photos
when compared to the LG g5 and when you
look at the applications there are quite
a few features in the LG g5 including
modes and it's manual mode which has
been praised in the past but a manual
mode is also found in the Moto Z as well
but in both cases things can get pretty
messy pretty quickly if you are actually
going through all of those settings one
very nice feature about the Moto Z
cameras is that they can be launched
really quickly by just double twisting
the wrist and also if selfies are really
your game then maybe the Moto Z is the
one you're going to want because it
actually has a front-facing flash it's
kind of a rarity to see this in
smartphones and the Moto Z is one of the
few that is available with it now
finally before we get to the mods we
talked about software and the LG g5
actually had a bit of a rough start
mainly because it didn't have an app
drawer
now this caused a lot of hubbub and over
time LG decided to rectify this problem
by allowing the app drawer to be
downloaded in their smart world
application so once that is installed
this pretty much looks like a regular LG
UI a number of features have been
streamlined or rather put aside so that
they're not all up in your face trying
to get you to use them after all things
like the Q slide and the curiously
missing dual window are things that most
users probably would never find too
useful it's still a very functional
version of Android but we want to be
surprised if anybody put a launcher on
there but what moto has always excelled
in is providing this pretty easy on the
eyes and functional version of Android
that is close to stock and adding
features on top that are pretty much all
out of the way but are ultimately quite
useful and these can be found in the
Moto app in the app drawer where you can
set up a number of different moto
actions like the double twist of the
wrist to open the camera or a double
chop to turn on the flashlight and of
course the moto voice which is always
really fun to use because it is fully
customizable to a phrase that you would
like to use for example on mine I say
zero help me out when it comes to
operating systems we do prefer ones that
have features we would use rather than
ones we would never touch and in that
scope the Moto Z does kind of eek by
because there's still a very functional
Android on the LG g5 that just happens
to be features on it that we pretty much
would never ever use but thankfully
they're nicely out of the way in LG UI
and finally we can talk about the mods
now one thing that we will say about
modding is that modularity is not
necessarily the phrase that you would
use for the Moto Z that's because you're
not taking anything out or adding
anything in there's not really a whole
lot going on rather than just magnets
putting connectors into pins so modding
is the term we're going to use for the
Moto Z's and modularity is the term that
we should use for the LG g5 the LG g5
really took a risk in bringing
modularity in such a way that actually
requires a little bit of a learning
curve you have that little release on
the bottom that pulls the entire bottom
portion out and then from there you have
to actually snap the battery off of the
g5 s bottom portion and then put it into
a whole new mAh
now those modules are the cam plus
module which add hardware buttons and
also a little bit more battery life to
the phone and of course the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen DAC which adds some hi-fi audio
capabilities to the phone these are the
two main ones that are available and
unfortunately we haven't seen any more
and even though the LG g5 has been
around for quite some time and even then
the usage or rather the practicality of
these modules is still in question
even though we were able to use the cam
plus module for a little bit of time we
found it to be bulky and it made the
shape of the phone just that little bit
of a nuisance that it wasn't something
we wanted to use all the time and even
though - I do is gray it kind of has a
bit of a niche audience the moto mods
are kind of the easiest way that we've
ever seen to put new features onto a
phone granted those are the magnets on
the bag with connector pins and you just
have to slap it onto the back of the
device but there are a few moto mods
that are available and they range and
usefulness the projector while it is
pretty fun to use only has a one hour
battery life and it costs a lot of money
the JBL sound boo speaker is nice to
have when you don't really have or want
a separate Bluetooth speaker and then
finally the most useful of them all
which is the incipio power pack which
adds more than 2,000 milliamp hours to
the existing battery of either the Moto
Z or the Moto Z force and in every
single case you simply have to make sure
that they have their charge either via
wireless charging or USB C ports and
just slap them onto the back of the
device so it's probably not much of a
surprise that the Moto Z kind of takes
the crown when it comes to modding the
main reason is that its ease of use the
plug and play of it all just makes it
easier than the LG g5 which you have to
turn off the device take the battery out
hopefully not break it in the process
which usually doesn't happen and then
you put the battery into a new module
and then wait for the phone to power up
again it's simply a steep learning curve
that a lot of people just don't really
want to go through which brings up a bit
of a problem that we think LG might have
we already see that with the LG g5 being
out for a number of months now we
haven't actually gotten any new modules
we haven't gotten any new LG friends and
if the LG v20 that's coming up is going
to be modular as well then what if it's
not cross compatible
not to mention the fact that in terms of
practicality the LG friends just simply
don't stack up to the Moto BOTS you are
going to have to pay a pretty penny not
just for the phone but also for the mods
that go into them as well so it's really
up to you to decide which one as a
standalone phone and then after that the
Moto Z has the better modding phone
which one would be better for you in the
overall package we do like both of these
phones for what they provide as
standalone devices especially in the LG
g5 which already has a wonderful
wide-angle lens as its addition in the
body the moto G on the other hand has
great features on top of what is a great
modding experience and if the Moto mods
are going to grow from here then we
think there's a lot of promise for them
but in the end when it comes to modding
we just have to see what's going to
happen in this new world of smartphones
that we call modularity that is still
very young today we'll see what happens
with the upcoming LG devices including
the g6 or the V 20 if it does happen to
be modular and that should be coming
very very soon so stay tuned to Android
