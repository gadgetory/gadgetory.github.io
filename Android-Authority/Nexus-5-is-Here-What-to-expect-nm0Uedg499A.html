and I get to introduce to you what
Google dropped today BAM the Nexus 5
which some might consider top-level
Hardware without the top-level price but
personally i'm lusting after the nexus
5's wireless charging why I'm wired
challenged here I get some help here
join me why we look under the hood of
the new Nexus 5 and discuss why it might
be the choice for you the Nexus 5 comes
with Android 4.4 KitKat and you'll be
the first people to experience the
KitKat androids new version of the
operating system it has a 5-inch display
at 1920 1080 and of course is the
gorilla glass tile protect that new
gorgeous screen the front facing camera
is 1.3 megapixels and the rear is 8
megapixels with optical image stabilizer
the weight is actually lighter than the
nexus 4 just over four and a half ounces
the battery also got a boost with 2,300
mella app hours that means the talk time
is up to 17 hours and the standard time
or standby time is up to 300 hours no it
is somewhat reassuring that Google
assured us in the footnotes that those
times included having LTE and Wi-Fi
enabled we look forward to getting our
review device to prove that of course it
has a 4G LTE unlike the Nexus 4 which
does not have LTE at all it also has
wireless charging built-in 32 gigabytes
of internal storage 2 gigabytes of RAM
and a USB 3.0 for much faster file
transfer of course being a Nexus device
you get a pure vanilla Android
experience you don't have carriers
putting blow where on your phone slowing
it down and when other people are
waiting 18 months for the new version of
Android you get it right away now for
what many will consider the greatest
news of the Nexus 5 is that it carries
within it a processor called the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 unless you say
it's fast really fast and powerful so
much so that it can record and playback
4k video what is that well you take your
1080p high-definition video this can
record video in this little dinky phone
that is four times the resolution
yeah do you hear that that's my inner
geek going but for you normal nice
people out there this is what the Nexus
5 will mean for you you know when you
buy an expensive brand new smartphone
and right out of the box it's like whoo
it's fast so fast but nine months later
you're like yeah and that's what brings
us to the bottom line of the Nexus 5
this device will allow you to at least
somewhat future proof your phone by
providing top level hardware that will
keep you running faster smoother longer
at almost half the price of comparable
phones pretty sweet so very soon guys we
will acquire our own Nexus 5 and put it
through its paces in an in-depth review
I'm very excited about that so subscribe
so you don't miss that review when it
comes to android we strive to be the
authority
no seriously this is frickin stock okay
it's a problem spa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
