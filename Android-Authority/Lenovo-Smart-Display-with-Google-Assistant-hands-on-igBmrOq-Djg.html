assistant in town it's the Google
assistant and now it comes with a screen
one that isn't tied your mobile device
if you've ever looked at the amazonica
show and thought hey I'd love one of
those in my house you might find the new
Lenovo variants with Google assistant
built-in to be more up your alley
the Lenovo smart display is pretty
fierce looking you can choose between a
10.1 inch IPS Full HD display or an
8-inch one both units have 10 watt full
range speakers with dual passive
radiators and a 2 by 2 dual mic arrays
so they can hear you from across the
room with no problem the smart display
also has physical buttons on the outside
of its chassis so that you can mute it
when you're not using it as well as a
camera shutter button for snapping
selfies with a 5 megapixel front-facing
camera and unlike the Amazon echo show
the smart display looks thin from the
side with an attractive white and bamboo
finish that can fit in with most modern
decor it doesn't seem like a typical
Lenovo product and it's not really not
when you consider the company is famous
for its laptops and tablets but that's
because Google has a little something to
do with this remember back to all those
rumors about a touchscreen display on a
Google home it's highly likely that this
is related those rumors have pointed to
codes suggesting the ability to launch
websites Google Maps and recipes it's
very similar to what the Amazon echo
show can do but could it be better with
assistant built-in we'll find out when
Lenovo smart Display makes its way into
your home this July 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
