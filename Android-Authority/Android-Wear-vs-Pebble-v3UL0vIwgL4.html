SmartWatch ecosystems available right
now and they do work on pretty much any
Android smartphone that you can throw at
it so after using them for quite a while
I have some thoughts that I want to
share with you so it's Josh regard from
an authority what's going on everybody
and this is Android wear versus the
pebble now obviously when it comes to
trying to pick between Android wear and
the pebble we do have to start with the
hardware because you are going to be
donning that SmartWatch on your wrist
and it has to fit your style luckily in
either ecosystems you get a few choices
in the pebble ecosystem you have a
couple of main ones they are the classic
plastic version that came with a
silicone band and you can also get the
pebble steel which comes with a metal or
a leather band there are a lot of new
colors available for the classic version
so you can also take a look at that as
well the special LCD that is used on the
pebble allows it very low power
consumption but also it is easier to
view in daylight after that you have the
buttons on the sides which give it a
different Navigation feel especially
when compared to Android wear but then
we shift on over to Android wear which
already has a few choices but plenty
more or on the way right now we have the
LGG watch the more simplistic of the two
and the Samsung gear live which takes on
the look of Samsung's already
established gear ecosystem from there
though we have the simple bands
especially more simplistic on the LG G
watch and then full touch screens with
no buttons as you will be navigating
using presses and swipes there are a
couple of other additions that might be
found on various types of Android wear
watches one example right now that we
have is the Samsung gear life having a
heart rate monitor but nonetheless you
will be having either the square faces
of the ones we have now for example or
round faces like will be found on the
Moto 360 and like I said already plenty
more on the way but that's when we have
to get underneath the surface and really
find what the differences are between
these two ecosystems we'll start off
with the pebble which is connected to
your phone via the pebble application
which then uses bluetooth in order to
connect the two the pebble uses the app
in order to do all of its work and all
of the applications and watch faces that
are available for it are found within
actually has gotten a lot easier to
customize the pebble interface to what
you want it to be because of a recent
update that brought an official
pebble app which then consolidated all
of the apps and watch faces into one
place it's actually been quite good and
from there you can look for apps and
watch faces eight of which you can
install on your pebble whether it is the
original or the pebble steel you can
only install eight but luckily that does
allow you to really figure out what the
essentials are for you and to be able to
really see what applications would be
most useful to have installed on your
watch connecting an Android wear watch
to your phone is largely the same
procedure you will be able to use the
Android wear application in order to not
only connect it via bluetooth but also
pick the default applications that will
be used when you perform certain actions
whereas all of the applications in
pebble will be installed via that
application and are real pieces of
software that are put onto their Android
wear applications are often companions
to already existing applications you may
have already installed on your phone a
lot of them may range from hangouts from
which you can reply to messages or even
the Google Play Music application which
will allow you to control music and to
even other ones like lift which will
allow you to a call a cab or rather a
ride using your voice but before I get
into the differences I do want to say
that both of these ecosystems perform
their core tasks very well when it comes
to showing notifications and thus not
needing to take out your phone very
often both of these systems work very
well the pebble can use the built-in
notification system or you can replace
it as is available inside of the pebble
app store in order for a more
customizable experience with your
notifications as opposed to Android wear
which has cards a very nice attractive
way of looking at your notifications
especially considering the nice screens
that might come with those particular
watches and you are able to swipe up and
down swipe to the right to dismiss or
swipe to the left in order to find even
more functions for the particular
application who is notification your
viewing well with the pebble you do have
the buttons that give you a real tactile
feel and you can remember what kind of
presses are needed in order for you to
perform a particular task and that's
really nice especially the one you can't
be looking at your watch because you
have to keep your attention somewhere
importance compared that to Android wear
in which you pretty much can't do
anything without looking at the screen
and actually swiping and tapping around
until you find exactly what you need to
do now that might not seem like a very
big deal when it comes to control but to
be honest it's really big deal when you
consider one
particular a situation that I always
find points of contention in and that is
driving now if smartwatches are supposed
to make it so that we don't look at our
phones too often well unfortunately with
Android wear it's really just taking our
attention from one periphery and putting
it onto another which is the screen on
our wrist so I found plenty of times or
when I'm trying to figure out what the
next direction is a navigation or trying
to change the music track I would have
to actually activate my android wear
wearable and look at it keeping my eyes
off of the road just as badly in my
opinion as looking at my phone really
the driving example is the best one that
I can give you because it's the one that
I feel like I have contended with the
most and I'm sure a lot of people out
there will as well it's really only in
those situations that I have to
consciously think about which watch
would be better dogging on my wrist in
order for me to easily control my music
or anything else while I'm on the road
but there is one thing I will say even
if the pebble has a little bit better
control because you don't necessarily
have to look at the watch in order to
perform tasks I will say that the trump
card in Android wear is it's voice
dictation doing commands and messages
using your voice on any Android wearable
is still really awesome and is something
I do all the time especially when I'm
responding to hangouts messages and what
you'll probably find is that the pebble
app store definitely has a lot more to
offer then Android wear does I draw
Android wear really tethers on to what
applications are already installed on
your phone so it may not be as easy to
find extra applications for you to
install on there meanwhile on the pebble
it's all under one roof and there are a
lot of offerings available for you to
really experiment and find what is the
best situation for you so those are just
my thoughts on Android wear versus the
pebble but I will say that I still think
that they are kind of on a level playing
field because while one ecosystem might
perform better in one situation there's
yet another situation that you can use
the other form and I do think that that
levels things out a little bit because
well you can get a lot of functionality
from both of these ecosystems as long as
you kind of dig deep and try to find
exactly what it is that you want out of
a SmartWatch but as notification hugs
you really can't go wrong with either
one it really is a matter of what you
want out of a SmartWatch that you need
to figure out and truthfully if you
really need a SmartWatch at all there
are plenty of people out there who tell
me that there
perfectly fine just taking their phones
out and looking at it because it's not
that big of a hassle anyway but for the
rest of you out there Android where it
is really great and I'm sure it's going
to grow in the coming months but pebble
has already gotten a pretty good head
start and it has a lot of merits on its
own as well so it's just a matter of
what you want out of what you're going
to put on your wrist so keep it tuned to
Android authority I'm sure we're going
to be seeing a lot more from pebble and
we're going to definitely see some
Android wear wearables coming out in the
coming months perhaps an ephah which is
only just a few weeks away so keep it
tuned for all of that coverage and for
even more drop with some likes in our
videos because we'd love to see their
thumbs up subscribe to our channel if
you haven't already and remember that
