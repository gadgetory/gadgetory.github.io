developer conference 2018 and there was
a lot of stuff announced today we've got
a new developer API / vixx V we've got a
new UI layout that they're pushing
across all their devices like phones but
I think the biggest thing that everyone
was really excited about at this
developer conference was the new
foldable phone by Samsung
now Simpson had the phone in a
specialized container so they didn't
really want to show off exactly what the
foldable phone was going to look like
but they showed off kind of the
possibilities that it was actually going
to enable so for example this phone is
going to fold out to be a 7.3 inch
AMOLED display which basically gives you
a tablet after you fold it out so you
use it as a phone form first and then
you can just kind of fold it out into a
tablet whenever you feel like you know
I've seen other companies like ZTE do
this where you've had two screens on a
single phone and it just pulled it out
into two parts
but that wasn't actually flexible that
was a foldable phone but this is a
flexible AMOLED so you're actually going
to be able to just like flex it into a
full screen phone and there's probably
not going to be anything actually
intersecting the center of the phone
samsung didn't have a lot to show off
they were just kind of showing how it
would work and what it would really
enable but they are partnering with
Google to make sure that this works
natively in Android so this was actually
just announced today as well at Google a
separate developer conference that's
going on but effectively Android is
going to support these flexible displays
natively now so Samsung doesn't even
have to do that much work they're
working directly with Google so other
manufacturers can probably do this as
well we're not really totally sure if
flexible displays are going to take off
but it's a pretty cool concept I think a
lot of people like the idea of being
able to have a smaller phone in their
pocket and then when they want to
actually watch that content or respond
to messages or maybe turn this into like
a mini little laptop they can just fold
it out get out their keyboard out their
mouse and start working so that's really
been it for the Samsung developer
conference here is only day one so there
might be some more stuff coming later
but make sure you stay tuned to our
website Android authority comm because
we have a lot of articles on everything
that they actually announce today so
headed over there and I will see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
