2016 here we are with Fred tabula he's
the CEO of seeker and today he's
bringing us the granite phone so let's
talk about privacy sure let's talk about
the granite phone in the eve of the
black phone hack so why did you create
this product what is it intended for
okay so let me just give you a little
bit the history on that how that warning
and idea that we had behind on that so
we started with the platform's 2012
which we was an idea to create a message
platform to exchange some sensitive
documents then our first customer was
the Brazilian government from Brazil
well then to the Minister of Justice so
in that moment we say okay great we have
the platform on the PC initially and
then but you have agents in the field so
we need to start in creating the mobile
point yeah so between 13 we started the
ios and android version of the
applications for deployment in the field
and then we gained the ward with other
countries in south america US europe and
going forward but one of our customers
say well we had a problem one of the
device its have the communication
cryptid have the conversation encrypted
but the device has been hackett and
someone has been inspired in the screen
and the microphone of the phone laughs
how you can prevent that so we started
thinking that end of 13 how we're going
to create something to protect that then
we came the idea with a grenade phone
that's the integration between software
hardware in OS which we lock him down
our solution together with a hardware
which nobody can install and malware and
virus why spider or anything so that's
the way we bring the grenade OS to the
phone plus the platform from secure for
the communication together with a
different hardware with the keys in a
different place in which nobody have
access to life so we're talking about
encryption talk about privacy you know
there's a lot of professionals you know
I mean there's so much corporate and
military espionage that's happening
right now so what makes this phone so
secure it's built on Android you let's
talk about the level of encryption sure
so we started the keys with 512 bytes
for the exchange key but in turning for
the platform in 4096 4096 bit encryption
as I heard yes and the kiss is on the
device itself so that means we in our
platform where the communication it's
flowing we don't have access to that
because the user have the own key
so if I was travelling through I mean my
generation you know we're pretty angry
we're angry because we have no
expectation of privacy you know it's a
revelation Edwards we live in a post
Snowden society where it's you know
there's automatic license plate
recognition there's satellites that are
tracking our gate or step yeah
everything is known you know quantum
computers can break like we were talking
about before 2048-bit encryption in real
time
I mean SSL Certificates the whole thing
is just crazy right right it's so
imagine if you're a professional you're
traveling you have sensitive documents
and you're going in and out of airports
and countries there's a lot of need for
a device that's as secure as or you
claim this to be that's pregnant so when
can people get it and you know what kind
of price points are we looking at and
who is this intended for okay so we're
starting shipping in December okay so we
launched in Barcelona next year in
Mojave there yeah so we start in
shipping in December 15 it's $99
straight price the most of our customers
government defends an enterprise like
MLM companies are indie companies so we
have a lot of different segments inside
of times and yeah well it's and that's
come with a two years license so a lot
of people ask me okay what's that price
point it's because come with the
licenses for two years you also can use
your PC to exchange information as well
so we have customers that have the phone
and customers that have only the
software and now they're integrated so
that's fantastic
so if this is built on Android so you've
made changes the hardware and you built
an application layer or you know OS on
top of Android that's more secure and we
what we did we get the Android is the
base but we change the bootloader they
femur everything above and below and so
we just used as
right is a stack for the initialization
but everything else it's made by us and
the hardware some change to make sure we
safe that key and everything on that
that makes sense so what do you think
about all this policy level stuff
talking about making encryption illegal
so you know as we starting talking the
privacy is something that the people
wanted back they wanted so you have the
bad people and the good people so we
created a product for the good people
we are contributed with the government
with the information that we have that
some metadata so we don't have access to
any information from the users but we
don't want the bad guys using our
product as well but we are intended to
create a product for the whole people
that are like you and me is carried with
anybody I look in your conversation with
your wife or your parents or when you're
talking to company secrets and sorbetto
all those are in the new product and
stuff like that so we made the product
for that so just in terms of you know
you talk about secure and you built this
platform right that's encrypted right so
it's just all through the pipeline you
know it's all in the cloud essentially
so you able to achieve 4096 bit right so
to the tactical point so we had our
cloud which most of our customers are
using but some government and defense
are so sensitive of thing for makers
they want to have on their own on
personal tab and we permit that so we
are is one of advantage that we have on
the platform that can have the customer
using on their own friends when you
believe this is a superior alternative
to the black phone oh yes
yes so I believe black phone do a good
job doing the protections on a circle
soilless Oracle application plus some
permission control but not enough to
protect someone to spite the phone yeah
so that's why we bring something that's
locked down we not gonna allow any
external application to be loaded
because it's the only way that you can
guarantee the security is it
yeah I really think that there's a lot
of desire for encrypted communications
for privacy right you know and yeah it's
it's really uh it's really really
encouraging what you guys are doing in
wish you all the best and thank you and
because of that you for last year we
starting also given for free yet such
application the chat application so you
can download right now on Android or iOS
or PC the chat version for free just go
to security concreted chat encrypted
chat okay that's good encrypted call
that's gonna be next she's coming he's
got I mean you know people use WeChat
and Skype everything they don't realize
that all this data is being recorded you
know I mean do you think that it's
reasonable for any of us to expect any
kind of privacy in the future or is it
gonna be total Information Awareness for
most people I think we deserve it you to
have our privacy back that's something
that also we are encouraging our
customers and people to say I know the
trends on that is difficult because of
the government's trying to protect
themselves and all of ya terrorists
apart yeah but I believe the most of the
people wants the privacy so we are more
than that so I think that's why we serve
kind of the privacy back to us I agree I
agree it's we live in interesting times
right you know but we all have to keep
safe so I wish you all the best in 2016
thank you I appreciate it thank you for
volley of secure here with the granite
phone it starts to like be a reporting
