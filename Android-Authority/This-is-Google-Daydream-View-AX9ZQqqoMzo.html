regard from Android Authority what's
going on everybody
and I wanted to bring you a look at
Google daydream view and we have a full
review of this over at VR source comm
and John Velasco was the one to review
it so there's a lot of comprehensive
information that you'll be able to get
from that video and from the
accompanying written piece at VR source
calm but here at Android authority we
just want to bring you a look at it and
I thought the best way to do that was by
actually giving you a live demo of it
now I have used this a little bit
already but I'm going to use it again in
front of you guys and you'll see what
I'm seeing
at least half of it rather over on the
side here on the frame so with that mind
I have my Google pixel and I have the
daydream headset right here now the
setup is really easy you just open up
the daydream app and it guides you
through everything and then once you're
ready to go you'll just open up daydream
and it will prompt you to throw it into
the tray it's a nice looking headset we
have the slate version here that looks
really nice and the fabric is definitely
a little bit more comfortable than other
iterations that we've seen before but
once you put it on you only have this
one strap back here and you have to
tighten it kind of really tight to keep
it centered on your face and it does
tend to slide around a little bit so it
kind of takes us out of the immersion by
having to adjust it every now and then
just to make sure we have the best field
of view and the other thing that I do
have to mention here is at the phone
while doing VR or while doing daydream
rather tends to get really really hot
and even though you have these padded
and breathable pieces of fabric over on
the front I could kind of feel the heat
emanating from the top of the phone here
or rather the top of the headset from
the side of the phone but without any
further ado we are going to jump right
into the VR world Wow
but once you have it on then you can go
ahead and grab the controller here so
there is a trackpad or rather touchpad
at the top with a couple buttons
underneath and the touchpad can be
pushed down or to interact with parts of
the world now one of the best parts
about this is if you point forward and
you
the home button which is the bottom
button you can recenter the screen and
it tells you that that's something that
other VR headsets kind of struggle with
if the gyroscope or whatever it uses in
order to spatially put you into the VR
world kind of gets off kilter sometimes
it doesn't give you an option to
recenter it and with the controller you
finally get that option and it's really
nice to have even then the world doesn't
really get off kilter a whole lot so
here you're seeing the main world and we
have a bit of a polygon ik forest and it
looks wonderful
the initial tutorial does a really good
job of showing you how the controller
works and it's a very cute one as well
but if I'm able to swivel around by the
way the best thing to use for a VR
headset like this a swivel chair trust
me
so swiveling around right now and just
seeing everything in this animation it's
a good looking animation and especially
at the highest resolution it will look
quite good through this phone and the
quad HD display does a great job of
doing that let's go to the Taj Mahal so
this is Street View
now essentially Street View just is
Street View and even in VR it's a lot of
the same thing except it gives you
immersion through a 360 photo now Street
View will just allow me to let's go
ahead and play and we'll really play the
slideshow I'm just going to move using
the controller as you can see here I'm
going to move to different portions of
the Taj Mahal and it's right in front of
me in gorgeous gorgeous resolution it
looks very nice the quality of daydream
is actually something that we want to
highlight here but yeah this is Street
View and if I were to go to particular
dots on the field I will be able to move
over here and see even more and this is
the Taj Mahal right in front of me so
that experience is actually about the
same the only difference is you have a
controller and if I look down I can
actually see that the controller and it
gives me a bit of a tutorial as to what
I can do with this controller in the
world so finally we're going to move
into gaming which i think is the main
portion of daydream view or daydream VR
that I think actually could change
because of this controller so first
thing we're going to do is do my Karami
the Kurama VR gives us a little robot
friend that we have to guide through the
particular world now I'm not necessarily
moving in this game but because of the
3d aspect and the ability to control the
world I can see where I would have to
move if I had to let's go ahead and get
this moving over here now what I do need
to do is move this there it is so kind
of move that there and you can see that
the 3d space is a highlight of a game
like this and it's really nice to be
able to control it with more than just
what I'm looking at a lot of other VR
headsets especially the mobile VR
headsets tend to rely on whether or not
you're looking at the right spot and
it's not necessarily ideal and for
puzzle games this is actually a
wonderful example of how VR can really
change let's say platforming or just
gaming genres that we're ready familiar
with oops I'm messing up here that you
have the ability to control the world to
actually control parts of this world and
I really think and I'll get into this a
little bit later that having a
controller like this is only the start
what's to stop daydream from tapping
into a lot of other controllers that
were already available Bluetooth
controllers even so we can have things
like fighting games or you know even
bigger action games
okay one more gaming experience just to
kind of show this off one more hunters
gate now the reason why I want to bring
this game up is because it kind of has a
it gives me it gives a perfect example
of how this controller could make these
experiences that much better now there's
one thing I want you guys to notice here
is that I am moving around the world by
moving my finger like it's a joystick
over the touchpad and it works
beautifully to be honest so if these
games are able to leverage it properly
then they could lead to even better
experiences in VR aside from just
looking and hoping that things happen
because you're staring at it now that's
kind of the point I wanted to make in
opening this game Jon Velasco mentions
that one of the pitfalls of mobile VR
especially this right now is that you're
only sitting there or you're just in one
particular space and the world kind of
washes over you you're not exactly
experiencing the space you're not
spatially within it so really it's just
a perspective type of VR and that's
perfectly fine but I think movements via
this controller could change that
imagine a game that is first-person
shooter or first-person perspective and
you're running around that kind of kind
of marries the two it kind of finds that
happy medium and I think we should see a
lot more games like that and I hope that
we do so that I'll pretty much do it for
this look at daydream VR or daydream
view as the peripheral is called
and overall I think it's a wonderful
start and rather a step forward for VR
mainly because of this controller now
the controller itself does provide you
some extra control over the environment
over the VR space itself and I think
that's a leap forward that should only
become better and better as time goes on
now the library itself is not really
available doesn't have too many things
available I should say but that should
change over time and in order to get a
daydream view headset it'll set you back
about $79 now that does sound a little
bit steep considering that cardboard
itself was kind of free but $79 to me is
kind of a small price to pay if you
already have a pixel XL and you want to
complete the experience that Google is
trying to give you with what is already
a pretty great phone so with that in
mind you can head over to VR source comm
for the full review of daydream view and
I hope you enjoyed this live demo of
what I kind of looked at and what
content is available right now and
giving you a glimpse into what daydream
view can do so keep it tuned to Android
30 for that and even more and don't
forget to check out vo source com not
only for the full review but for
everything else in the world of VR and
we have a lot of other websites
including sound guys tab times and
charged
I owe to dive outside the world of
Android and when you're done with all of
that
don't forget to head on over to Andrew
