Android authority and mid-range phones
aren't for everyone but there is a
demand for them and a company like Sony
knows that so today we're going to be
taking a look at a phone that features
sony's iconic design but in a much more
modest package this is the Sony Xperia
m2
whether it's Samsung HTC or LG every
manufacturer has figured out a design
language that makes their devices easy
to identify and Sony is no exception the
Xperia m2 features the same flat
rectangular design with sharp angles and
slightly curved sides that we've seen on
previous Sony devices which isn't
necessarily a bad thing as it's a very
simplistic look that many people seem to
be a fan of unlike the higher-end Xperia
devices like the z2 which is made of
glass and metal the Xperia m2 is
entirely made of plastic and doesn't
have the same waterproofing
characteristics either despite the
plastic build it feels very solid in the
hand and the compact form factor makes
it very easy to hold on to the only
problem that I've really had with it is
that it attracts fingerprints and
smudges like crazy and even after taking
this phone out of the box for just the
first few minutes it was already
completely covered in fingerprints so I
did find myself cleaning this phone
quite a bit it's not a huge deal by any
means but I figured it was worth
mentioning on the right side you're
going to find Sony signature power
button with volume rockers right below
and a dedicated camera button which is
always nice to see especially on an
Android device I will admit the buttons
do feel a little bit on the cheap side
as the feedback is really mushy and have
a wiggle to them especially with the
camera button above the power button is
a rather large flap that houses the SIM
slot and a micro SD card slot with
support up to 32 gigs but again even
with this flap the m2 is not waterproof
in any way and the flap is really just
sort of there to maintain aesthetics on
the bottom you're going to find a single
speaker and it's not the worst placement
in the world it's definitely a lot
better than being on the back but being
on the bottom means you're going to get
sideways firing audio when in landscape
and it's also really easy to cover up
when watching videos or playing games
for being a single speaker though I was
actually really surprised at how loud it
gets it's a little on the tinny side at
max volume but overall it sounds pretty
good
Charlotte's on steroids because her love
is so strong
on the front is a 4.8 inch display with
a resolution of 960 by 540 so the
resolution isn't going to blow you away
you're not going to be able to watch
videos or play games in HD and pixels
are noticeable especially with smaller
details like the folders but other than
that it's certainly a passable display
with great colors viewing angles and
brightness but the reflective panel that
Sony likes to put on a lot of their
phones does make outdoor visibility a
little difficult the Xperia m2 is being
powered by a Snapdragon 400 clocked at
1.2 gigahertz one gigabyte of RAM the
Adreno 305 GPU and 8 gigs of internal
storage which are relatively standard
specs when it comes to mid-range devices
but in day to day usage performance has
been quite good with really no issues at
all whether with something as basic as
swiping through home screens opening
apps or even multitasking the m2 seemed
to handle everything I threw at it just
fine it even handled gaming without any
issues as I was able to play simplistic
games like clash of clans - more
graphically intense games like dead
trigger 2 without any noticeable lag or
drop frames so while the m2 is far from
being the fastest device in the world I
certainly didn't have any complaints in
terms of performance the camera on the
back of the m2 is an 8 megapixel sensor
which is a far cry from the 13 16 and 20
megapixel shooters on high-end flagships
but 8 megapixels is still more than
enough for everyday picture taking
Sony's camera UI comes packed with a lot
of features from various different scene
modes to more basic functions like ISO
exposure value white balance and all of
Sony's own shooting modes that make the
camera fun to use like timeshift burst
and AR effect are also included most of
the time you'll probably either shooting
in automatic or manual mode and to be
honest the camera is pretty lackluster
and good lighting I did manage to get
some good-looking shots with nice color
reproduction and sharpness but the
second thing start to get even the
slightest bit dim or gloomy photos
completely
fell apart with a ton of noise
especially around the edges making
low-light or nighttime shots look really
bad and HDR mode seemed a little
inconsistent sometimes making the photos
pop and other times I ended up
preferring the non HDR photo battery
life however has been really solid
inside the m2 is a 2,300 milliamp hour
battery which I know in 2014
sounds really small but despite the
battery size I still managed to get
through a full day just fine with my
usage which typically consists of
texting checking social networks like
Facebook Twitter a little bit of web
browsing and some YouTube watching and I
got about 5 hours of screen on time
without doing any sort of crazy power
management except for keeping the screen
brightness low but if you want to
stretch the battery life of the m2 even
further Sony does include their own
stamina mode to help you get through the
day but honestly I never felt the need
to use it moving along to the software
the Sony Xperia m2 is running on Android
4.3 jelly bean out of the box it would
have been nice to see KitKat but Sony is
promising an update to KitKat at least
that's how I'm interpreting the sticker
on the box we just don't know when
that's going to happen on top of Android
4.3 is Sony's Xperia UI that comes with
their usual slew of apps like Walkman
and PlayStation mobile and at the end of
the day I prefer stock Android but if I
had to pick a skin the Xperia UI isn't
bad at all as it adds some useful
features like these small apps built
into the recent apps menu for example
without feeling like bloat or
interfering too much with the core
Android experience the Xperia m2 is
available now for $300 give or take a
few bucks in either direction and it
does indeed support LTE and HSPA+ inside
the United States if that is where you
live but there are three different model
numbers to be aware of
there's the 2303 the 2305 and the 2306
the 2303 and the 2306 both support LTE
and HSPA+ while the 2305 caps out at
HSPA+ so before you buy make sure to do
your research
and check those model numbers now I know
what a lot of you guys are going to say
$300 is really high for a phone with
mid-range specs and a 960 by 540 display
especially when you can get phones like
the Nexus 5 or the Moto X for an extra
$50 which offer higher end specs and a
stock Android experience and then
there's phones like the Moto G and the
Moto e which are really pushing the
boundaries when it comes to mid-range to
low-end smartphones making the Xperia m2
a really hard sell by no means is it a
bad phone but if you plan on picking one
up I definitely wait for the price to
drop and so there you have it for the
Sony Xperia m2 Sony's iconic design in a
much more modest package but that is it
