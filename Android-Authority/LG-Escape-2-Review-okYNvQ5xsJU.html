smartphone with a curved and compact
design how well does it stack up next to
the growingly fierce competition this is
Bailey Stein with Android authority and
this is my full review of the LG xscape
2 on the outside the escape 2 displays a
design that we've yet to see and other
low end offerings LG is making a big
deal out of the phone's curve and
rightfully so although it is more so on
the subtle side while holding the phone
it's still a very respectable component
of the phone's satisfying visuals the
matte plastic rears attempt to emulate
brushed aluminum can be primarily
described as hopeful and the parting
lines found around the headphone and
micro USB ports
sadly serve as reminders of the escaped
whose price tag I also noticed that the
back scratches easily as my unit had
several imperfections after just three
days of normal use that's not to say
that they escape - feels cheap in the
hand however in fact while they escape -
is on the thicker side at nine point
nine millimeters it is surprisingly
light at 119 grams the phone size lens
too comfortable one-handed use and the
rear facing buttons are a nice departure
from the norm the buttons have good
tactile feedback in our position
perfectly for quick access with an index
finger there is an LG logo as well as
some carrier branding on the back of the
phone as well as an additional LG logo
on the chin of the device on the top
there's a measly 1 megapixel
front-facing camera to the right of the
earpiece the 4.7 inch 720p display looks
great with good sunlight readability
viewing angles are pretty good as well
although you may notice a slight drop in
brightness
I think 720p was a wise choice
considering the escape to size processor
and battery capacity on the downside the
display glass is a fingerprint magnet
despite my best efforts to keep it clean
the excuse to manage to collect
fingerprints much faster than any device
that I've recently used powered by the
quad-core 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 410
collect out 1.2 gigahertz the LG escape
2 does perform on the slower side I
didn't have any major issues with
performance but the phone certainly
feels slower than higher-end devices
the bigger problem for me was actually
the one gigabyte of RAM it's quite
simply not enough for what most people
use their smartphones for for example
just opening a web page can cause the
launcher to be removed from memory which
causes a delay when trying to go back
home if you do like to listen to music
and do other things at the same time
you're pretty much out of luck as your
music will stop as soon as the phone
runs out of memory
coupled with the Adreno 306 GPU the
escape2 is able to play most games
although you'll definitely notice some
dropped frames and slow load times and
some of the more resource intensive
games when it comes to connectivity the
LG xscape 2 has everything you'd expect
802 11 and Wi-Fi GPS Bluetooth 4.0 and
4G LTE unlike most budget smart phones
however the escape to include support
for NFC the rear speaker and the escape
2 is pretty loud although it also sounds
heavily distorted LG's curved design
helps make the speaker less prone to
further distortion one set on a table
however although nothing really tops
front-facing speakers
a user replaceable 2100 milliamp hour
battery can be accessed by lifting off
the back cover 2100 mili hip hours is
relatively small compared to other
smartphones and the actual battery life
reflects that
I started my day at 7 a.m. with
brightness set to 75% and Wi-Fi on and
was able to get the phone to last until
about 7:00 p.m. with 3 hours of screen
on time sure that's better than what I
had expected from the 2,100 milliamp
hour battery but it still may not be
enough for some users thankfully you can
always swap out the battery if needed
the 8 megapixel rear camera with flash
on the escape to captured some decent
looking images color reproduction was
fairly good but the photos seemed to
lack detail and sharpness it can also
take a few tries to get an object in
focus which may frustrate some users LG
did include a quick launch feature which
allows you to hold down the volume down
key to quickly open the camera app the
camera app provides little control
overall but does have an easy-to-use
interface the escape 2 runs LG's custom
skin over android 5.1.1 lollipop the
phone does run Android 5.0
out-of-the-box but an OTA update is
available many aspects of LG's skin make
a lot of sense then that code unlock
feature the pull down to view time
gestures flipped to silence gestures
hold volume buttons for quick launch
customizable quick toggles a clear all
apps button and navigation bar settings
are all nice additions the og keyboard
launcher and lock screen are all also
pretty good and I didn't feel the need
to replace them out of the box there
were a couple of minor annoyances that I
noticed as well including the inability
to customize the lockscreen apps and
inability to change the night brightness
feature hours the biggest negative point
for me though was the amount of
bloatware that came pre-installed on the
phone I counted over 25 individual
third-party apps many of them coming
from AT&amp;amp;T
you can't uninstall these apps either
which is very disappointing sure you can
disable them but they're still going to
use up space on the phone the LG escape
tube can be purchased from 18t in silver
for 179 off contract
99 cents on contract there are also a
few installment plans available starting
at $6 per month for 30 months it does
include 8 gigabytes of internal storage
but only about 2.8 gigabytes is usable
out of the box luckily there is a
microSD card expansion slot which
supports up to 32 gigabytes
although the LG escape 2 may look like a
good deal on the surface it's probably
not the best option the positives
include a nice design great display and
a good software experience on the other
hand the performance could be better the
speaker is heavily distorted and the
battery may not last through a full day
of use for some users with options like
the $200 Asus zenfone 2 and upcoming
moto G refresh I can't recommend this
phone to the average user unless you've
already decided that your next budget
smartphone must have a curved and/or
compact design you should really look
elsewhere thank you for watching this
