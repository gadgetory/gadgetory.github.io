what's going on everybody and unless you
haven't really been watching TV lately
you may or may not have seen that
commercial that keeps airing about
Amazon's new Kindle Fire HDX tablet
features especially the one called
Mayday
essentially what Mayday is is it's a
button in the notification drop-down
that you can press whenever you feel
like you don't know where you are on
your new Kindle Fire tablet or you need
to get some questions answered and once
you hit that button what happens is a
very quick wait time happens and before
you know it there's somebody on your
screen an actual face an actual person
who is talking to you they can't see you
but they can talk to you and they'll be
able to pretty much help you out with
whatever you need now instead of just
telling you everything that these
customer service representatives will be
able to do once they get into your
tablet and essentially take control of
it I thought that maybe I could call
somebody on the made a feature and let
them give me the rundown small window
here in the queue it's been 5 seconds 10
seconds I was right here
music advisor oh yeah my email address
is I was I was I thought it'd be cool to
have you actually explain all the things
that made a can do as a way of showing
our viewers and from the beginning of
the call you have you're able to see the
screen the entire time right yeah I can
see your full screen everything that's
going on if you have a yeah definitely
I didn't I I did call a little bit
earlier to get a couple questions
answered and he I think it was Jacob was
the person he had his particular little
window move across the screen just to
get out of the way of things like he
that was one thing he showed me I
thought that was pretty cool as well
and yeah
you can put your finger on me yeah okay
goal that trip pretty much do it I I
really appreciate you showing me all the
features on Mayday and I hope you have a
really good day
now I take care Caleb and so that was
the made a feature available on the
Kindle Fire HDX tablets by Amazon now
just to clarify these are features that
are only available on the HDX tablets
not the Kindle Fire HD so make sure you
have that distinction in mind if the
made a feature is something that you
really want and to be honest it's
actually a really cool feature I did
feel a little bit weird at first just
hitting the button and in no time at all
pretty much I had somebody on my screen
that I had to talk to and they were
talking to me and it became this full-on
conversation which is a little bit
different than just calling the customer
service representatives on the phone for
example it's definitely a little jarring
at first but once you get into the flow
of things it becomes really easy the
Kindle Fire tablets are actually pretty
easy to use at least by my estimation
but if you have parents or grandparents
or anybody in your lives that are
technologically challenged the Mayday
button will help get them off your back
so for people like me who used to be the
tech support people in our families well
the may divine is probably a little bit
of a godsend for you so thank you very
much for watching this quick feature
