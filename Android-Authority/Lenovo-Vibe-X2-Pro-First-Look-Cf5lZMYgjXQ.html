what's going on everybody we are here
live at CES 2015 kicking it with Lenovo
and they have some phones and devices
for us to look at one in particular is
this vibe x2 Pro in this case we did get
a look at the vibe x2 at Aoife and I
already said I love this multi-layered
look that they have here the bamboo one
there was really great but the pro now
comes with a 5.3 Full HD display but
that's not the only story here let's get
the specs out of the way we have the
Snapdragon 615 here at 1.5 gigahertz as
an octa-core processor that you can see
is performing quite well under the
operating system lenovo likes to put on
here no there's no app drawer but it's
still able to bring some nice-looking
interface elements here for example the
translucent icons that are up here at
the top you can see through and see the
background but getting underneath there
this all-metal layer design is just 140
grams so it's really light in the hand
this flat design which i think is really
underrated gives it a wonderful feel in
the hand and of course we have 2
gigabytes of RAM underneath 32 gigabytes
of internal storage a 24 10 million
power battery that should be able to
perform quite well on a full day's work
and of course LTE and it's actually a
dual nano SIM phone also as well but if
you hear me say dual nano SIM there you
pretty much thinking this probably is
not going to come to the west and that
is exactly what is the kind of the
bummer here what the vibe I love the
look of the vibe and these multi-layered
looks I really wish that this one will
come to the west but that's just not
going to be the case for this lenovo has
motorola in the west so we're not going
to be seeing these particular phones you
can find them online of course but
nonetheless we're giving you a nice look
of it here now I said there is an extra
story here when it comes to the vibe Pro
here and that is with the cameras the
rear facing camera is a 13 megapixel
shooter that is pretty standard but
lenovo is getting into the self portrait
or selfie game right now with a 13
megapixel front-facing camera as well so
you'll be able to take some pretty
amazing photos especially when you pair
this phone with the brand new vibe
selfie flash that you just put right on
top here and will give you yet another
source of light especially when it comes
to your selfie photos
so we have pictures going right there so
one less look around this is the vibe x2
Pro and we're here with Lenovo here at
CES 2015 looking at their devices this
update to the vibe is once again
bringing that wonderful design that I
love so much but it's not coming to the
west unfortunately so take a good look
at this so that you really see what we
might be missing out in the West
nonetheless it's Android Authority at
CES 2015 make sure you stay tuned for
all of our great coverage including ones
just like this here at Lenovo and
remember we are your source for all
things Android but we're also your
source for all things CES 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
