andrew authority and most phones
nowadays are designed to be thin and
good-looking
at the sacrifice of durability but sonim
has a phone that deviates from all of
that but is a phone built to take a lot
of abuse worth the investment well
that's what we're going to find out with
the sonim xp1 the sonim xp1 sleek
lightweight or good-looking in any way
but it wasn't meant to be in fact it's
actually everything most current day
smartphones aren't it's thick bulky and
heavy and it feels like a brick in both
the hand and the pocket but there's a
reason for it all this phone was
designed for people that live a very
rough lifestyle and they need a phone
that can keep up this is far and away
from a phone that's made for the casual
user the phone isn't indestructible and
I eventually was able to damage it but
it can take one hell of a beating and
keep on ticking the hard rubberized
outer casing not only protects it
against the most brutal of drops but
also makes the phone resistant to
puncture it can also withstand corrosive
chemicals and oils extreme pressure and
sudden shocks or vibrations just to name
a few
the package wouldn't be complete without
a rating of ip68 that makes it
resistance dust and water for up to two
meters for 30 minutes and IP 69 for
resistance against high temperature
pressure wash taking a look at the rest
of the hardware the xp7 comes with only
16 gigabytes of storage with no option
for expansion so you're pretty much
stuck with the on-board storage and
cloud-based services you'll find the
volume rocker on the right side with a
red button to contact Sodom's emergency
support line for loan workers the
service isn't currently available but is
expected to launch this year on the left
side is a dedicated camera key a
push-to-talk button and a very awkwardly
placed power button the buttons on the
front are physical and you can wake the
display with the home button so that
will help cut down on how often you have
to reach for that power button on top is
a very bright and handy notification
light accompanied by a 3.5 mm headset
jack and a SIM card slot which are both
covered by flaps held in with
work screws the headphone jack can be
accessed without removing the Torx screw
but the SIM card slot will require you
to remove them with the tool included in
the box before you can insert your SIM
the charging port is located on the
bottom but it's a proprietary magnetic
port instead of the usual microUSB which
is kind of unfortunate considering how
prevalent microUSB is these speakers on
the front which is nice however it's
only one speaker and even though it gets
extremely loud the audio sounds are very
Hollow and tinny it can get pretty
obnoxious at high volumes and I found
myself keeping the volume low a lot
because of how harsh it sounds the good
majority of the specs is basically low
end to mid range and the display is
going to make you feel like you're back
in 2010 it's a four inch screen with
WVGA resolution and it's functional but
in this day and age it's a pretty poor
looking panel on top of being low res
the colors are washed out there's a lot
of color shifting when viewing off axis
and it doesn't create for a very good
gaming or media consuming experience you
won't be able to view videos in high
resolutions or take full advantage of
high-end games which to me is the
biggest downside of this display on the
bright side the screen is usable with
gloves which complements the hardware
keys well but that is really the only
feature that makes this screen stand out
for the processing package the sonim xp1
packs the very commonly used Snapdragon
400 processor and one gigabyte of RAM
like most phones running a Snapdragon
400 the performance is quite respectable
and everyday use the xb7 runs very
smoothly absolute quickly and graphic
intensive gaming is also a breeze it
probably also helps that the processor
doesn't have as many pixels to push
around due to the low resolution display
and that is running a basically stock
version of Android the camera on the
back of the XP 7 is of the 8 megapixel
variety and since it's running stock
Android you're dealing with the stock
Android camera it's not the more
up-to-date Google camera so if you want
to use that you'll have to download it
from Google Play the stock Android
camera if you aren't familiar with it is
a
pretty bare-bones experience with just
the essential features like HDR exposure
panorama and a few other basic camera
settings the picture quality I would say
is OK at best
there's certainly a lot better than I
expected with a fairly decent amount of
color and detail the only things I
really noticed was that a lot of the
photos tend to have a very cold or
bluish cast of them and the lack of
dynamic range HDR will help bring out
more detail but it does so at the
expense of introducing more noise into
the picture one of the biggest
highlights of the sonim xp1 definitely
has to be the battery life it's a huge
4,800 milliamp hour battery and when you
combine that with the fact that the
processor isn't pushing very many pixels
due to that low resolution display you
pretty much have a recipe for really
awesome battery life with 48 hours off
the charger and almost 11 hours of
screen on time I have no doubts that you
can go a weekend road trip with this
phone and not have to worry about
bringing a charger and this is what's
really heavy usage like playing games
and watching a lot of YouTube and I
still had a really hard time killing the
battery on this phone so I was really
pleasantly surprised by how long it
lasted on a single charge like I
mentioned a few times already the sonim
xp1 is running what it's basically a
stock Android experience of 4.4 kitkat
there's a few Telus applications and FM
radio and a couple of useful additions
like a flashlight toggle on the
lockscreen but otherwise it's a very
pure experience that will keep things
running very smooth and fast the sonim
XP 7 is designed for Canadian carriers
like Telus and Bell but it will work on
t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T LTE networks it does
go for six hundred and fifty dollars off
contract which is really expensive for
what is essentially a mid-range phone so
in order to justify the price you really
have to want its ruggedized capabilities
but even then that might not be
compelling enough for some users but
that is going to do it for the sonim xp1
something to keep in mind with this
phone is that it's not meant for
everyone it's a very niche product with
a very specific audience so if you're a
casual user this phone is not
not going to be worth it but if you
happen to have the lifestyle to match it
it could potentially pay for itself in
the long run
