authority and with an all-new metal
build dual cameras and a modular design
is the LG g5 worth the upgrade over the
g4 this is the LG g5 versus the LG g4 so
with the LG g5 LG basically switched up
their entire design formula and created
a completely different foam from last
year's g4 the g5 has an all-new metal
build which makes it feel a lot nicer
and more high quality over LG's previous
plastic designs but because it's been
coded in a primer and paint it doesn't
feel quite as premium as it should and
the g5 is by no means an ugly looking
phone but it's certainly not the most
attractive design that LG has ever used
the big story here with the g5 is its
modularity the bottom chin pops off with
a simple press of a button allowing you
to swap in different modules like the
camera grip that LG dubs the cam plus
and the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen hi-fi DAC for
higher quality audio this also gives
access to the removable battery so
despite the change in design LG still
managed to figure out a way to keep this
feature intact for those of you who love
swapping batteries on the fly in
contrast to the g4 it's kind of hard to
believe that these two phones were made
by the same company the g4 was entirely
made of plastic or a combination of
plastic and leather if you opted for the
leather back and it also featured LG's
signature curved but judging by the g5
and their previous flagship the v10 it
looks like they're moving away from that
it's kind of shamed because the curve
was unique and different and it also
made the phone feel more ergonomic in
the hand like the g5 the g4 also has a
removable battery except this can be
accessed in a more traditional manner
simply by removing the back cover both
of these phones also support microSD
card expansion but that's about where
the hardware similarities end the g5
still retains the rear mounted power key
just like the g4 but the volume rockers
been moved back to a more traditional
location on the side which to me
personally isn't that big of a deal the
power button on the g5 also doubles as a
fingerprint sensor a feature that was
absent on the g4 and with the g5 LG also
made the switch to USB type-c over the
microUSB of the g4 as far as one-handed
usability goes the g4 and g5 are roughly
the same in terms of height but the g5
is overall the smaller phone especially
in the width Department this is mostly
because it has a slightly smaller
display so it's a little bit easier to
hold and operate in one hand the g5 is
rocking a 5.3 inch LCD display with quad
HD resolution and it's a pretty good
looking screen with good viewing angles
brightness and color but it's definitely
not the best quad HD screen on the
market the g4 also has a quad HD screen
but this one measures in at 5.5 inches
and apart from the extra screen real
estate that you get on the g4 both of
these screens are pretty comparable to
one another in terms of quality the g5
screen does however exhibit much cooler
color tones over the warmer look of the
g4 s but that's a difference you'll
really only notice if you have these two
screens side-by-side the other big
difference is the g5 has an always-on
display that can show the clock
notifications and a custom message and
this is a feature that the g4 simply
doesn't have but since it's more
software based it could totally be
possible that we see come to the g4 in a
future update internally the g5 is
packing the latest and greatest specs
for a 2016 flagship you have the
Snapdragon 820 Adreno 530 and 4
gigabytes of RAM which makes this phone
very fast and responsive and on par with
every other flagship that has come out
this year with the same specs the g4 on
the other hand has much more outdated
specs at this point with a Snapdragon
808 and 3 gigabytes of RAM and while it
still performs very well in day-to-day
use it's not going to hold a candle to
the g5 s much more powerful processor
and generally snap your performance and
if you care about benchmark scores
you're obviously going to get
significantly better numbers on the g5
the battery inside the g5 is a 2800
milliamp hour battery which is actually
a tad smaller than the 3000 milliamp ire
cell on the g4 but battery life on both
of these devices is pretty par for the
course they can easily get through a
full day with regular you
perfectly fine but I wouldn't expect
much more than that on either device
they also feature fast charging
capabilities so they're both very easy
to top off or fill up anytime you need a
quick charge but again if you want to go
from zero to full as quickly as possible
with these two phones it's as simple as
swapping out the battery for a fresh one
the cameras between these two phones is
where it starts to get a little bit
interesting the g4 and the g5 are
actually both utilizing the same 16
megapixel optically stabilized F 1.8
aperture sensor as their main camera but
on the g5 LG tacked on a secondary 8
megapixel wide-angle lens that allows
for some very amazing and incredible
looking wide-angle shots it's a ton of
fun to use and is by far one of the best
features of the g5 there are some subtle
differences in the camera software like
the multi View mode on the g5 that lets
you use all three cameras at once or the
snap mode for recording a string of
three-second clips but aside from that
the experience is practically the same
you still have the simple and auto modes
if you rather keep things relatively
straightforward but if you want to dig a
little deeper you can always jump into
LG's manual mode for DSLR light controls
over your photos with the same 16
megapixel sensor you would think that
the images between these two phones
would be exactly the same but
surprisingly they're not they both take
very sharp very well detailed photos as
you would expect from a camera on an LG
flagship but the way they go about
processing these photos are slightly
different the g5 opts for more contrast
II more vibrant colors which results in
much darker shadows and less detail in
these areas the g4 is a complete swing
in the opposite direction with less
contrast and slightly less color but
you're getting a much brighter image
with more details in the shadows the
only drawback is because the g4 opts for
a much brighter image you're also
getting more overblown highlights the g4
and g5 are running on Android 6.0
marshmallow but they're on two
completely different versions of LG's
interface the g4 has an older version of
LG's UI which is much more bloated with
more software features that may or may
not be all that useful and it feels a
lot more intrusive with so many features
being turned on by default with the g5
LG's interface still isn't the best but
it's a big improvement over previous
versions it still has very cartoony and
brightly colored
Conn's but the overall aesthetics from
the notification shade to the settings
menu look a lot cleaner and more
streamlined LG also got rid of some of
the features like dual window and made
other features such as smart bulletin
and qslide more hidden and less
in-your-face but they're still there if
you really want to use them the biggest
change the LG's interface is that it no
longer comes with an app drawer by
default which makes it feel a lot more
like iOS and your only form of
organization is through the use of
folders but since this is Android you
can easily change that with a
third-party launcher like Google now
apex or Nova or if you really want to
stick with LG's software you can
download their own launcher from the
smart world application to bring back
the app drawer so the big question here
is did LG do enough with a g5 to make it
worth getting or should you save
yourself a little bit of money and stick
with the g4 which is proven to still be
a more than capable smartphone here in
2016 the answer to that question really
depends on how much you want all the new
features that the g5 has to offer like
the modular design the dual cameras and
the fingerprint sensor the g5 does all
the basic things that we expect out of a
smartphone really well like having great
performance a great display a good
camera and good battery life which are
all things we usually expect to be
better as we upgrade smartphones and LG
certainly made improvements in those
areas with a g5 if you really want all
the new features of the g5 and you find
the modular design to be compelling
then the g5 will be worth your time but
should you decide to stick with the g4
for the time being while you wait for
another flagship is at the market you
still have a more than reliable daily
driver and that pretty much wraps it up
