experience goes up against one of the
most full-featured versions of that very
operating system it's charged regard
from Andhra Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Nexus 6p
versus the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 as
always with these verses videos you can
find the more my new details including
the spec sheets for both of these
devices by clicking on the card that
should be appearing right about now so
you can see the full written comparison
at Android authority calm when it comes
to design you're pretty much going to
get premium either way it just matters
what kind of material you're going for
in the case of the Samsung Galaxy Note 5
we now have a metal frame with a unibody
that employs dual glass panels what's
nice is that there is a curve to the
backing so it does sit really nicely in
the hand but this unibody also means
that there are no more removable backs
and that means no more replaceable
batteries or expandable storage but
really from there you have a lot of the
same elements including the s-pen which
is nestled right down here in the corner
and now has a clicky top so it is able
to be in there completely recessed you
still get the same button layout all
over the place and really this feels
like a still samsung esque device on the
other hand we have the Nexus 6p which
takes on a new design now head by Huawei
and Huawei has done a great job in
providing a big metal redesign on here
that provides a very premium look and
feel you even have that black bar on the
top which houses the camera and it's
accessories but of course it's all about
this fingerprint reader here on the back
that is able to wake and unlock the
device simply by putting your finger on
that area 5.7 inches is what you get in
both of these devices and the Nexus 6p
is just that little bit bigger overall
than the Galaxy Note 5 but it doesn't
really hinder its handling all that much
for the most part you're going to get a
very similar experience here even though
the curve on the back here does make
this sit a little bit more nicely the
flat sides of the Nexus 6p also help its
case as well but we have very similar
specifications when it comes to the
displays quad HD is the name of the game
here you get very high resolution no
matter which of these two devices you
pick now we do have a Super AMOLED
display on the galaxy note 5 but that
doesn't necessarily mean it is really
all that much better than the AMOLED
display on the Nexus 6p we get a very
similar
output on here with a bit of a punch up
in those colors due to the saturation
but from there it's still a great
display experience either way for both
work in play now one thing that the
Nexus 6p is able to boast is the ambient
display which does come up when you
bring the phone up from let's say a
table or the prone position it is kind
of nice to have so you can get a quick
look at your notifications but it's not
the easiest thing to trigger when it
comes to performance we have a great
experience out of the way but they both
come from different sources the Samsung
Galaxy Note 5 now employs the Samsung in
how 16o 7420 processor along with 3
gigabytes of RAM which should definitely
help with multitasking now it is a very
worthy to mention that TouchWiz still
has a lot of features that are not found
in stock Android so multitasking is
really its kind of Forte you will be
able to use the multi window and also
the S window capabilities but for the
most part going through all of the
typical tasks in the home screens apps
and even gaming did not bring us any
issues whatsoever in the note 5 and it
still provides a very reliable
experience but on the other hand the
tried-and-true Snapdragon 810 and 3
gigabytes of ram as well are what powers
the Nexus 6p and it does so beautifully
we do give a little bit of credit to the
Android iteration on here because it is
stock Android with all the optimizations
that marshmallow has put in you're
really aren't going to have any problems
on here though you are not going to have
as much multitasking because the recent
apps screen is the main way to use the
Nexus 6p that said the interface and all
the applications go by swimmingly so the
experience of the stock Android on the
Nexus 6p is really one of the most
sublime experiences we've had in Android
this year now the core basics when it
comes to the hardware section are
actually kind of similar when it comes
to these two devices after all the
Samsung Galaxy Note 5 this year no
longer has the removable backing so you
don't get expandable storage or even a
replaceable battery so that kind of puts
an in line with what we have already
been used to in the Nexus line but of
course the main edition in the galaxy
note 5 is going to be the S Pen which
pops out very nicely because the pen
itself while very symmetrical also has a
very addicting clicky top and it is
really easy to use when you're using the
stylus experience on here just remember
don't be putting this pen in backwards
the speaker on the bottom is
is not all that great to be honest it
does provide a little bit more body than
plenty of other devices but it is also
not quite as loud as some iterations but
it pales in comparison simply to the
dual front-facing speakers of the Nexus
6p for that matter however the
connections are all pretty much the same
on here and the fingerprint reader
inside of the home button is really easy
to use you are going to have to press
the home button to wake the device but
leaving the finger on there will unlock
it pretty quickly and from there you
also get for charging wireless charging
which Samsung has set is one of the
fastest iterations out there but you
still have the micro USB port on the
bottom here which is able to do fast
charging so you won't be having to
charge too often when it only takes
about 10 to 15 minutes to be able to get
past the rest of your day as we move on
to the Nexus 6p the first thing we can
talk about is that fingerprint reader on
the back now it's that little circle
there and once you have your fingerprint
set up you just have to put a finger on
to that area and it will wake and unlock
the device simultaneously which makes it
just that little bit faster than the
Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and then when
going to the front we have the dual
stereo front-facing speakers on here
which are a treat no matter what device
we see them on and they work really well
in the 6p we don't really have to have
our headphones out when we were playing
games mostly and because the sound from
these two speakers already provides a
nice experience a lot of the same
connections are also still available
here in the Nexus 6 people you're not
going to get wireless charging on here
which is a little bit of a bummer but
actually the 3450 million of our battery
on here can go for quite a while just
that little bit more than the Galaxy
Note 5 especially when you factor in
marshmallows new doze feature and then
finally here on the USB type-c port
which is the new standard that we do
have to get a little bit more used to
still we also have the higher power
currents that even if it's not going to
be using Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 it's
still able to provide a really fast
charging experience this 3450 million
power battery might seem large but going
from 0 to 100 in the charge only takes
about 90 minutes so for both of these
devices we have a good outlook when it
comes to hardware but when it comes to
the Galaxy Note 5 you obviously have the
stylus experience and if that's what you
really need then you can go ahead and
choose the Samsung device but the Nexus
6p is definitely proving that it is very
good for even the power user and in
camera we are dealing with two very
powerful pack
here the Nexus 6p is the one that
probably got the more profound upgrade
however because it now brings great
camera quality whereas the rest of the
Nexus line just paled in comparison to
the rest of Android a larger sensor is
able to pull in 13 megapixels worth of
data and you'll be able to get those
pictures along with an 8 megapixel front
facing shooter for those selfies but
when we're talking about the application
there aren't too many controls on here
definitely no manual controls and as far
as the modes go we do have a nice auto
HDR plus mode and also a really good
slow motion capture at lower resolutions
but as far as other modes go we have
things like Lens Blur and photosphere
and with not too many extras after that
but that is what the Samsung camera is
able to boast now though it does have a
16 megapixel shooter it is also with
optical image stabilization which the
Nexus 6p does not have and it's
front-facing shooter is of 5 megapixels
but its application provides a lot of
control not only are you able to add a
lot of different modes onto there but
when you go to the pro mode you are able
to change even in my new increments
things like the white balance and the
ISO so from there you have a lot of
great features that Samsung has commonly
put into its cameras but we are always
looking at picture quality here and to
that end we have these examples we'll
start off with the low-light shots of
which we actually think that the optical
image stabilization is able to pull a
more usable shot than the larger sensor
of the Nexus 6p but that is of course
with the combination of a very steady
hand if you can do it along with a night
mode that tries to pull in a little bit
more light in a longer exposure but when
it comes to general pictures we actually
thought that both of the cameras
provided really great pictures the Nexus
6p does tend to have that little bit
more sharpness in its photos and the
galaxy note 5 is kind of putting a bit
of a warm hue over all of its photos so
the color profile might be just very
slightly different that said however
both pictures are really enjoyable and
you should have a lot of fun with it so
it kind of comes down to how much
control you want to have over them that
warmish hue that we see on the galaxy
note 5 can be alleviated of course in
the pro mode so you can really kind of
take your pick here but at the very
least in the auto modes with auto HDR
available you should be able to get some
nice photos no matter which of these two
devices you pick
and finally in software we have two
versions of Android here the lollipop
version of TouchWiz on here that is
Samsung's usually kind of oversaturated
in features software suite and then we
have marshmallow on here the stock
Android the pure experience of Android
now we will start off with the Nexus 6p
which has the stock Android experience
and if you've ever had one before you
kind of know what to expect here there
are a few subtle changes however with an
extra line on the app drawer that
provides your most used applications app
permission so you can get an extra layer
of security and the flashiest of the new
features now on tap which by holding the
home button you will be able to look for
certain terms that are currently shown
on the screen now the thing is though
that the Android marshmallow iteration
on here is all about its speed and
snappiness and of course when you're
going to be getting eighth Nexus device
you're also going to be getting a lot of
updates for the foreseeable future that
are available before plenty of the other
carriers but that said however speaking
of the carriers and manufacturers
Samsung has put a slightly toned-down
TouchWiz onto the galaxy note 5 which of
course uses as its mark the s-pen but
before we get to that we still have the
multitasking capabilities of the multi
window which is easily triggered from
the already existing recent apps screen
and of course the S window if you want
to drag down to a floating window but
from their TouchWiz pretty much looks
and feels the way that it always has but
you can of course theme it if you want
to but it's all about this s-pen right
here which does provide a stylus and
more executive like experience if you so
needed to pulling out the S Pen from
here we'll open up the air command menu
and there are a few key functions on
there including the ability to go
straight to S note by using the action
memo and writing down any number of
things that could then contextually be
put into other applications smart select
is one of our favorites because it's
able to pull any little portion of the
screen and then it provides a very easy
way of sharing it then of course the
screen write which now can also take
scrollable webpages but really the best
part about using the s-pen is that if
the phone is actually in standby and off
when you pull out to the S Pen this
becomes a black slate and you can
actually write anything on here that
will then become part of s no and you
can always use that for further
reminders later on
now it is worthy of mentioned that the
Nexus 6p despite having a great and
mostly updated version of Android has
features that will eventually make it to
the other phones and Samsung is no
exception
it just has to take a little bit longer
for it to provide those updates for
their users phones like for example mine
which is still on lollipop
but if you want a very saturated in
feature software suite then of course
you have multitasking abilities and that
S Pen here in the note 5 so unless you
really want those extra ways of doing
your work and play you still will have a
great experience on the Nexus 6p doing
the conventional and more original ways
of all those things for the base models
on these two devices we're dealing with
32 gigabytes and true to form the Nexus
6p is available at the Google store for
499 dollars starting off now if you want
to go to the Galaxy Note 5 will use
t-mobile as an example where they're
after monthly payment you'll be paying a
total of six hundred and ninety-nine
dollars and so there you have it for the
Nexus 6p and the samsung galaxy note 5
now it was pretty easy before in the
Nexus line to say you kind of get what
you pay for when comparing them to the
flagships of the Samsung camp but now
that's not really the case as with
Huawei Google has been able to provide
kind of the real flagship experience if
stock Android is your measuring stick
but if you already know what version of
Android you're looking for then the
choice is really easy no matter which
one you choose however you get very
premium devices here and you aren't
going to have any problems getting
anything done no matter which one you
pick so as always thank you guys very
much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this versus between the Nexus 6p and the
samsung galaxy note 5 they provide
pretty much the same powerful experience
and if you're looking for the most
powerful devices right now you're
probably looking at them in the Android
space so you really just have to kind of
be in tune with your needs what kind of
features you want to use and how you
want to get your work and play done that
said however you really can't go wrong
with either of these and if you're an
Android purist go for the Nexus 6p
otherwise the note 5 is really calling
your name so keep it tuned to Android
authority for all of the best here and
