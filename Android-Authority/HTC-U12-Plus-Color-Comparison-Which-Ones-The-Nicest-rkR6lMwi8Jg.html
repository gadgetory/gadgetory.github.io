on everybody and here we're taking a
look a closer look at the three
different colors of the HTC u12 plus now
we don't really get a look at all of the
colors of a phone every single time so
it's nice that we were - this time
around and HTC has done a good job of
keeping each one just unique enough so
that it might be hard to make a choice
we want to know which one you're going
to pick in the comments down below let's
start off with the classic one the base
model which is the ceramic black now all
of the phones are encased in glass so
you're not actually getting ceramic here
I was hoping for the real ceramic but
the sheen is very similar to what real
ceramic would look like you've given
this treatment you can let us know what
you think of the black one down below
especially once we start to look at the
other two the one that we're going to
look at first is the model that's not
going to be available at least for a
little while and that is the flame red I
said red and flame red kind of makes you
think of a certain type of red a certain
shade of it but in person when I was
looking at this phone it actually looked
more pink
now that might actually appeal to some
of you out there because pink phones are
not really all that common it is just as
shiny as the other ones probably a bit
more reflective than the ceramic black
and it is a unique color something that
we don't really see in a whole lot of
other devices but finally speaking of
what you don't get to see in devices is
the translucent blue and as you can see
there it is blue but there's a little
bit of transparency to the backing that
allows you to see some bits and pieces
underneath the cover now we all talked
about wanting to have clear cases for
phones that would really make them
incredibly unique and something that a
lot of us in the tech world would
probably want to have because it seems
one-of-a-kind and that's kind of the
direction that HTC has managed to go
with their blue coloring you can see the
lining of the battery you can see the
module for the camera you can even see a
couple of bits and pieces that have to
do with connectivity but the blue is a
really good shade still it's only that
underneath it you get to see even more
so the translucent blue is actually the
hero model of this it is the one that
can come in 128 gigabytes of on-board
storage while all of the phones are
going to get six gigabytes of RAM and
even if the higher capacity is something
you were considering already at least
you also get a really good looking back
in a very unique looking phone let us
know which of these colors you would
pick and
the comments down below and we'll be
down there discussing with you as well
you could let us know which of them you
would want and of course in the case of
the flame red you might have to wait a
little bit longer in any case don't
forget to check out our full hands-on
about this phone and stay tuned for our
full review because we are of course
