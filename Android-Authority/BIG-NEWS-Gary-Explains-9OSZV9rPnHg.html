Authority and I've got some exciting
news to share with you so if you want to
find out what it is please let me
explain so I've really enjoyed making
these gary explains videos here for
Android Authority there was my idea I
came up with a while back it was about
cache memory I think and I thought well
I could explain that in a video and then
after that I thought I could explain
something else and then we've covered a
whole range of topics that are like 60
or more videos that I've done up until
now and it's been a real fun ride we've
covered so many different areas
including you know the technology and
artificial intelligence and things to do
with cameras and software and it's been
absolutely brilliant now the problem is
is that here Andrew Authority I'm
slightly limited in what I can make
videos about technology is used
everywhere in the world in fact in the
world and even in outer space and it's
not all related to smartphones so
therefore I would be good if I can
actually get into explaining some of the
technology in servers and PCs and the
internet and networking and Linux and
just so much stuff so to do that we hear
an authority decide that I should start
a new channel called Gary explains now
the new Gary explains channel will
follow a very similar to format to what
I've been doing here on Andrew thority
but just with a much wider scope not
just dealing with mobile technology but
dealing with all types of technology
that we find in our lives as I've
already just mentioned PCs and servers
and Linux and software development and
space travel and maths and we'll try and
get into everything just to see if
there's interesting things we can find
about technology in the world we live
today of course I'm still going to
making videos here on Android or
authority whenever there's a new
processor that comes out when there's
something to do with Android it's
anything to do with smart phones you
know Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and 5g and all
that good stuff everything I've been
doing up until now I'll still be making
it here on Andrew authority but there's
now gonna be a second stream of videos
that deal with technology in a much
wider Avenue so really my one request me
today is this please go over to the new
Garry explain channel there's a link to
it here in the description go over there

going to be doing a whole bunch of new
videos

it and I really hope you are all going
