s5 one of those things that you just
notice on the back because it's well
kind of hard not to notice is the heart
rate monitor but is it really ultimately
useful for you general users out there
well that's what we're about to find out
because it's Joshua Garr from Android
thorny what's going on everybody and
this is the future focus on the Samsung
Galaxy s5 regarding the heart rate
monitor all right and here we are with
the Samsung Galaxy s5 as you can see
here and we're taking a look at the
heart rate monitor which is as you can
see right there right below the camera
so we'll go ahead and just jump right
into the usage of the heart rate monitor
I'll just get into the operating system
here and here is s health now s health
comes with a number of the same
functions that you may remember from the
Samsung Galaxy s4 including the ability
to just have the phone let's say in your
pocket when you're going out for a run
or a walk and you can see that the
pedometer is right there
you aren't also able to track your
exercise any different form and also as
you can see up here there is a calorie
monitor using a database full of all of
the different foods that you might use
so you can track your calories but we're
talking about the heart rate monitor
here so I'll go ahead and just click on
that and here you go now you'll see the
most recent reading that you did on the
heart rate monitor but basically what
happens here is once it is ready you
just have to put your finger over the
actual as you can see the information
the little tutorial there you have to
put your finger over the sensor and you
don't have to press all that hard and
you just have to keep still while you're
doing it and by still they mean your
entire body they don't want your moving
at all if you use let's say the gear 2
or the gear fit it tells you to be as
still as possible and also to be quiet
which is a little peculiar but you
didn't want to have an inaccurate
reading because of anything extra that
you're doing so I'll just hit OK on
there let's turn this phone over and
there we go you see the red light right
there and here we go measuring my heart
rate I'm not being quiet though
and there you go 93 beats per minute yes
my heart rate is a little bit higher
than normal but that that does happen
from time to time but trust me I am in
good health and as you can see here it's
it's a one time reading and it's not a
gun it's not going to be a continual
reading which is a little bit of a
little bit of an issue that I'll get
into in a little bit but we'll just do
one more reading just in case I was
talking during that last one so let's
try one more time there you go that's a
little bit more like it so this should
tell you for all intents and purposes
that's the heart rate monitor on this
and perhaps on the wrist watches or the
fitness bands that they might not be
completely accurate maybe not a hundred
percent of the time just because I was
talking a little bit more during the
first test that you saw here I had a
heart rate of 93 beats per minute but
this time around when I was just as
still as possible and also quiet
I had a heart rate of 80 which is a
little bit more in line with what my
heart rate should be okay so I looted to
this about a minute ago already but I
just wanted to reiterate that the heart
rate monitors on the phone especially
but also on the wrist watches and the
fitness bands are single time readings
now that's not that huge of a deal
because if you're doing a workout and
let's say you're doing some intervals
with running cycling or in some cases
even some of your resistance training
you will be able to check your heart
rate between your intervals to make sure
that you're going as well as you should
not too hard and not too soft but the
issue that I have with it is now I'm not
a fitness nut by any means I just really
like running and because of that I have
invested in a heart rate monitor the
kind that straps around your chest like
around your sternum and has a
transmitter that is constantly checking
your heart rate and sends the
information to a wristwatch so that even
in real-time during your workout if you
think you're going too hard it'll tell
you if you are or not and you can adjust
your workout in real time if you need to
that won't really necessarily be the
case when it comes to the Samsung Galaxy
apparatuses you'll only be able to check
the
one at a time you know at the times that
you are able to so in a way for those of
you who are much more in tune and much
more dedicated when it comes to fitness
this may not be the solution that you're
looking for but for the general users
out there who just want a quick snapshot
of maybe just one little facet of your
health then yes that would make this
useful but ultimately it's not one of
those things that really distinguishes
the Samsung Galaxy line there's a true
Fitness companion at least in the case
of the heartrate monitor after that you
are able to track your various heart
rates throughout the times that you test
them even right down to the hours that
you do it so if you are a bit of a
fitness nut and you really want to know
what your heart rate is after let's say
some exercise or even just throughout
the day to make sure that you are
healthy at least by those standards you
can test your heart rate let's say every
hour every half hour whatnot and you'll
be able to see the progression as it
goes along as you can see mine kind of
went down a little bit it takes the
average and that would be 87 across the
few that I've done on this phone and
even over the month so you can kind of
see what your overall health is from a
longer standpoint and here is a quick
log of my heart rate and then finally
some of the heart rate accessories that
would be available like the gear 2 or
the gear fit accessories that would be
able to share the heart rate monitoring
that it does to your phone if you use
those for your fitness or your daily
needs and so there you have it for this
feature focus on the heart rate monitor
found on the Samsung Galaxy s5
smartphone itself stay tuned for more
