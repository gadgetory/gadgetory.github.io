brought to you by Linda calm go to Linda
calm forward slash Android to learn more
welcome back to Android weekly my name
is Jason this is where we cover the
week's Android use and what an eventful
week it was at Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona Spain we were underwhelmed by
the s5 tickled by the z2 and hopeful
about project aria but you know what
else now the wider public can download
the Google Experience launcher and that
makes a TD people like me just giddy
with excitement you know what's coming
next it will not work on your phone time
for you to take a nap all right Android
army let's start with project Aria we
just learned last week that Google will
hold its first project are a developer
conference this coming April in Mountain
View project re is this idea that you
can build a smartphone that has
individual components that can be
upgraded when those best components
become available I know it sounds like a
geeks dream but it intends to be even
more than that according to google's
official are a page their goal with aura
is to ultimately make modern smartphone
technology more accessible for the
masses in order to reach this lofty goal
though Google's are a project head Paul
II remain co says that the device could
go on sale sometime next year for as
little as fifty dollars now call me
skeptical I mean I know it's gotten a
lot of press and it's a wonderful lofty
idea and I get excited about it too but
I really think it's a geeks dream and
it's going to start and end there here's
why I'm not a hardware engineer but i do
know enough to know that when you tell a
hardware or designer hey you know most
of the components of this phone needs to
be modular you're seriously limiting
their design options when we've seen the
most meaningful innovation with
smartphones it wasn't due to an
individual component like a great
battery life or a great system on a chip
the average person doesn't know or care
about that stuff what they care about is
the whole user experience
that's where we've seen the most
innovation with smartphones when you
think about designing the phone as a
whole now for approve of this you look
back on the PC revolution I was a
hardcore geek I built my own pcs for
gaming right from the ground up right
from the motherboard to the CPU to the
water cooling system the whole bit i did
everything ok the vast majority of
people in the world don't care they were
you'd be lucky if they upgraded the ram
maybe their hard drive but you start
talking about their mother board and
they have no idea what you're talking
about I think this is a geeks dream but
we shall see how it goes moving on to
the pleasant surprise that is the Xperia
z2 now although the z2 looks very
similar to the z1 there have been
significant improvements the Xperia z2
comes in with a 5.2 inch display at
1080p it has a two point three gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 801 and in Adreno
330 GPU it has three gigs of RAM a
fantastic 20 megapixel camera that
captures 4k video with steady shot image
stabilization it has digital noise
cancellation technology a whopping 3200
milliamp hour battery it is waterproof
and dustproof and is running Android 4.4
KitKat so many experiment owners will
want to know about the viewing angles if
you were not looking at the Xperia z1
directly the images would be
significantly diminished but according
to first impressions from Josh the
viewing angles on the Xperia z2 are
fantastic move it on to the Google
Experience launcher which is now called
the Google now launcher you can go to
the Google Play Store and download it
now maybe that's right you heard
correctly the Google now launcher is
available to anyone with a Nexus device
or a google play edition device Google
now is now part of your home screen
after activating it in the launcher
settings you simply swipe left of the
main home screen and it will be there
waiting for you saying OK Google while
at the home screen should automatically
open the voice search for everyone
instead of a pop-up box though long
pressing the home screen allows you to
add widgets wallpapers and enter the
launcher settings and even a larger
viewing area is offered thanks to the
trans lucien status of navigation bars
where supported
so for us the only real downside to the
Google now launcher is its lack of
customization options now if you're a
fan of nova launcher for example the
Google now launcher may not be the best
alternative for you because hardcore
Andhra geeks are well hardcore which
compels me to point out that if you are
one of those people who messaged me
about the most obscure Android questions
you may be one of those people who would
enjoy learning how to code and there are
affordable options for high quality
instructions I myself used linda.com to
learn how to edit videos professionally
and look where it got me I get to talk
to you about what I love to talk about
and get paid to do it yeah check out the
easy to follow video tutorials to help
you learn software business and creative
skills go to Linda calm forward slash
Android and please get started last week
on Android weekly where we covered the
official announcement of the galaxy s5
none of the press including android
authority was very clear on which system
on a chip was being used in the s5 so we
went with the best information we had a
time which was the Snapdragon 800 but we
now have fermer details it turns out
Qualcomm has confirmed that the galaxy
s5 will actually run a 2.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon 801 CPU the Snapdragon 801 is
essentially a Snapdragon 800 with a
faster clock speed and support for
faster GPU frequency aside from the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 model samsung
told Engadget that they will also use a
2.1 giga hurt octa-core exynos variant
just as we saw last year with the galaxy
s4 following past trends the Exynos
model will likely be pushed into
international markets with North America
and some parts of Europe getting the
Snapdragon 801 all right Android army i
know i hear you many of you were very
disappointed with the specs surrounding
the samsung galaxy s5 you were expecting
more i was too but manufacturers tend to
do these things right they want to
incrementally improve their phones
because that's how they maximize profit
but my question to you is which phone
will become the premier flagship phone
of 2014 will it be the s5 the new HTC
One the m8 or will it be a phone we have
not heard from yet
or maybe the z2 will surprise everybody
and be the best phone of the year what
do you think tell me on Google+ or
Twitter in the comments below I'd love
to hear your opinion you don't want to
forget about my brother's an Android
over here Josh Joe and a tech ninja
Kevin and Christopher I shall see you
next week on Android weekly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
