expensive ultra powerful smartphone
you've been lusting for is on its
deathbed now I know what you're thinking
you're thinking Jase what the f if you
look at the last round of flagship
releases it's difficult to see where the
innovation is we haven't seen many
compelling new features in the last few
years the flagship lineup has started to
look pretty homogeneous and almost
everyone owns a smartphone now when the
market stagnates one of the few
remaining options for manufacturers
looking to stand out is to drop prices
the average selling price for an Android
phone has plummeted from four hundred
and forty one dollars and twenty ten to
two hundred fifty four dollars last year
that's partly because of the abundance
of budget Android smartphones on the
market the platform has improved and
hardware has reduced in price
dramatically over the last few years
budget phones are now perfectly usable
and some mid tier offerings in terms of
price are competing with the high-end
flagships also in terms of specs now
that's all great news right more money
in the pocket of consumers you're now
more likely to be smart and buy a phone
off contract and not get stuck in those
two-year crazy contracts where you end
up spending more money than if you did
if you bought the phone off contract
that's good now what about the cons
we're actually I've been thinking about
and I can't think of any real negative
side effect to this one might argue that
there's less money for research and
development but I just don't buy it it's
just good news all around the fact that
a flex your premium phone cost more than
my laptop is that only ridiculous prices
are coming down and that's a good thing
now to buck this trend manufacturers are
going to have to do something innovative
something to distinguish themselves and
at least begin to justify those premium
prices Samsung has done it somewhat well
the innovative curved display design of
the galaxy s6 edge led to better sales
than anticipated
apparently Samsung expected the normal
s6 to outsell the edge significantly but
it didn't considering the edge was also
more expensive at release there's
clearly still a hunger for sexy new
devices that innovate it will be
interesting to see what happens with the
s6 edge+
as it combines both trends of big
screens
the edge design and now is the most
expensive smartphone in Samsung's lineup
I don't think it's rocket science to
predict what's likely going to happen in
the next three to five years Chinese
manufacturers are going to continue to
provide almost the same power and
features but in much cheaper phones than
compared to Samsung LG and Sony for
example and those premier manufacturers
are going to have to stay ahead of the
game with premium devices that do
something different let me know what you
think in the comments below thanks for
watching android army my name is Jase
love to connect with you for real in
Google+ or Twitter and I follow you in
the comments below you don't forget
about my brothers and sister and Android
