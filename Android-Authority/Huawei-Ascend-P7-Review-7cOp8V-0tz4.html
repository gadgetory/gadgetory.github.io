the Chinese market this year and in this
review we're going to take a look at the
update to a phone from the veteran
company Huawei that was originally known
as the thinnest phone around hey it's
Josh regard from Android Authority and
this is the Huawei p7 while it does add
a little girth to last year's really
thin p6 we're still dealing with a very
streamlined design here a metal skeleton
holds together two panels of Gorilla
Glass 3 meaning that this phone for all
intents and purposes can take a little
bit of abuse while a flat profile is
found all around the sides two rounded
corners up top are opposite a nicely
rounded bottom portion all of the
buttons are on the right and below them
are the sim and microSD trays up top is
the headphone jack and on the rounded
bottom is the microUSB port the optics
and the speaker are on the back atop a
pattern design just under the glass what
really stands out about this phone is
not just its thinness and it's like
profile but also the fact that it really
rocks this new five-inch screen very
well this might be one of the best
handling phones of its size making it to
an extent better at handling than
current mainstream flagships the flat
but minimally sized sides make for a
pretty comfortable feel one that is
somewhat reminiscent of the iPhone 5s of
which this phone has been noted to take
some inspiration from but ultimately you
have a pretty unassuming design here and
especially in this white edition you
have an attractive phone that gets
plenty of points because is really easy
and comfortable in the hand Huawei
graduates the p-series to a 1080p screen
at five inches in size this IPS screen
also brings 441 pixels per inch now it's
not hard to get impressed by the colors
this screen puts out especially with how
colourful Huawei's user interfaces
colors are greatly vibrant and even at
very steep viewing angles it retains
pretty much all that fidelity and even
playing injustice with it's pretty much
much darker tones was easy on here with
good contrast and nice deep levels in
the dark areas you do get the option of
adjusting the screens color temperature
if you really feel the need to and a
high sensitivity allows usage even when
you're wearing gloves Huawei sticks to
an in-house processing package
consisting of four cortex a9 core
dubbed the hisilicon Kiran 9 100 T it is
backed by Mali graphics and 2 gigabytes
of RAM
now revisiting the intensive injustice
game I will say that I never ran into
any big issues with lag and performance
while playing getting around the
operating system and loading apps never
pose any problems either it does help
that Huawei doesn't go very crazy with
all of the transitions so you get the
feeling of real speed here so I had
really no complaints with the
performance of the p7 the sense of speed
you get from the operating system
snappiness certainly lends itself to
fast work and fast play Huawei does pull
ahead of the hardware department with
the inclusion of a microSD card slot and
often sought-after feature that here
allows for expanded storage over the
included 16 gigabytes the full range of
connectivity options is available here
including NFC which is fairly obvious
because it clearly states NFC at the
very top in the notification area call
quality on the AT&amp;amp;T network brought me
no issues pretty much a standard
experience was had here the rear-facing
speaker on the other hand despite the
less than ideal placement is actually a
pretty decent performer quite loud but
not really too rich but able to at least
showcase the lows pretty well which is
not always the case
covering the grille with a finger
effectively stifles the sound though and
as far as battery goes the 2500 milliamp
power unit did pretty well for me a
five-hour stint consisting mainly of
playing music via google play music and
also one hour almost of playing in just
as Strait brought this phone down to 70%
and I do feel like with moderate to
heavy usage you will still be able to
make it to that 12 hour mark the good
standby time that I observed on here
however can easily put this phone past
the day day and a half mark so you
should be able to get pretty much what
you need out of this phone there are
power saving modes available and they
include projected hours of usage so you
can see just how far you're going to get
one mode in particular can bring the
phone down to its essentials if you
really need to eke out as much as you
can while weighs focus on self-portraits
was really made known in the p6 and it
continues here but first let's talk
about the rear-facing camera 13
megapixels are what you work with here
and they perform about as well as you
would expect
- while there isn't anything
particularly stunning about the photos
that you get the colors are really
vibrant and noise levels despite still
relatively unchecked don't become too
prevalent unless you crop in now the app
keeps things pretty simple with just six
button elements on the viewfinder
filters and modes including HDR best
photo and panorama now what I really did
like about the camera experience was the
super fast
ultra snapshot through which you can get
a really quick photo from standby via a
quick double press of the volume down
button it doesn't take the time to focus
on the subject however so that is the
trade-off for a 1.3 second picture
taking speed the front-facing camera is
a powerful 8 megapixel shooter really
helping to please anyone who loves
taking self-portraits it's a pretty
powerful camera on its own but a couple
tools added in to help make the most of
the self-portrait experience
beautify helps to soften your skin at
the expense of some detail though so if
that is your thing that is available a
box on the top right will show you where
to look for a proper perspective and a
panorama mode lets you tilt the phone
and piece together three photos for a
wider look for let's say group shots I
did find it pretty simple to use but
making people wait for you to tilt the
phone left and right and plus anyone
that might suddenly move during the shot
can ruin it all in all you get the kind
of performer you would expect from a
flagship device there really aren't too
many bells and whistles here that
differentiate the camera experience from
other flagships except for of course the
front-facing camera if you really love
to take selfies but then again not all
of us do and finally in software the
emotion UI returns once again in a very
colourful and quite pleasing manner I
before that the lack of transitions
makes for a really snappy experience
though the notification drop-down
doesn't quite exhibit this as well still
it makes for one of the nicer Chinese
interfaces around but what does come
here is the usual Chinese interface
trope a lack of an app drawer which
means you'll have to organize your apps
into folders but ultimately the you
motion UI looks like a pretty simple
skin over what is essentially Android
KitKat what with the simple recent apps
screen and the easy to navigate settings
area huawei zone Edition serves some
good purposes - in particular a phone
manager that provides all the tools
needed to accelerate the phone by
closing background apps freeing up space
by deleting files and much more
or that are listed one it can scan the
entire phone for issues and list them
off anyone nitpicky about what goes on
in their phone will have that extra
sense of control with the phone manager
easily my favorite aspect of the emotion
UI is the easy mode where everything is
presented in large buttons on an
attractive grid it manages to still
provide everything that is needed while
staying minimalistic and keeping things
pretty tight and finally all of these
elements are able to be easily
customized in the themes application not
only are there a slew of built-in themes
already available you can easily tweak
any single aspect from within the actual
application so in the end the lack of an
app drawer for anyone used to having one
in their Android will find quite a bit
to like in this snappy take on it the
huawei p7 is not quite available across
the board yet but we have been getting
reports that in Europe it'll probably
come in at around 350 euros which does
put it somewhat below the price point of
current mainstream flagships but it is
up to you whether or not you want to go
out on the limb to pay the full price
for a phone that is not as widely
regarded as the ones coming from Sony
Samsung and HTC and so there you have it
the Huawei p7 I do find myself enjoying
this phone mostly because of its ease of
use both on the outside with its slim
and light profile and on the inside with
aspects like the easy mode but while I
did find quite a bit to like about this
phone I will admit that unless you're
looking for those specific kinds of
experiences and maybe perhaps the
powerful selfie camera there really
isn't too much distinguishing this phone
from the more mainstream competitors
when compared to the behemoths in the
market no one defining feature really
separates the Huawei p7 from them but
when you look at the whole package you
do find a smartphone that succeeds in
bringing power function and
accessibility in a fairly unassuming way
it may not be the life of the party but
the huawei p7 certainly deserves to be
at that party as always thank you guys
very much for watching and I hope you
enjoyed this review of the Huawei p7 as
you may have gleaned from this review
there are a lot of things to like about
this phone as it performs exactly the
way that you would want it to but there
are no defining features that really
separate it from the current mainstream
flagships and because it's availability
is a lot lower comparatively to those
other flagships it's kind of a hard
device to really recommend over
so keep it tuned to Android authority
for all of the best coverage including a
future coverage of events like the
Google i/o event coming up at the end of
this month at I'm going to be at after
that check out the coverage from my
colleagues in Android Joe Jace Kevin the
tech ninja and of course lawn and once
you're done with all of that drop us
some likes subscribe if you haven't
already and then head on over to Android
authority comm for even more because we
are of course your source for all things
