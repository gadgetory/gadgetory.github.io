smoke bomb across the board is a
revolutionary new design is it a bigger
battery a better camera maybe it's the
latest version of Android and more power
than you know what to do with if that's
what it takes then the HTC u11 truly is
a great
fine it has all the specs in numbers you
could ask for in the 2017 flagship from
6 gig of ram 128 gig of storage and the
snapdragon 835 - microSD expansion and
an ip68 rating there is no headphone
jack of course but that shouldn't come
as a surprise seeing as HTC was among
the first to abandon it also absent is a
secondary camera and this is where we
have to start asking ourselves a few
questions does a secondary camera really
matter the pixel 2 does perfectly fine
without one and so too does the u 11
Plus HTC doesn't go in for any fate
portrait mode blurring of the background
so it's really up to you if you think
the additional hardware really makes
that much of a difference on other
phones but the U 11 plus is still
perfectly capable of capturing lots of
detail HDR boost does a great job of
pulling dynamic range out of some pretty
tough lighting and colors are insanely
poppy and generally very accurate you
won't get a wide angle or zoom lens here
but you will get reliably good quality
images and for many that will be
perfectly fine the 11 plus features a
single ultra pixel 3 lens at F 1.7
aperture with optical image
stabilization and dual pixel face
detection autofocus what all that means
is a nice natural-looking bokeh first
focusing no real need for super steady
hands and excellent low-light
performance you know it does creep in in
very dark environments and there's the
occasional blown out highlight at night
but right now it's a toss-up between the
mate temp rode the pixel 2 and the u 11
plus for my favorite low-light shooter
well everyone else has been adding a
secondary camera play lots of other
companies including HTC have been
steadily removing the headphone
HTC clearly recognizes the choice has
unpopular so the you 11 plus includes a
pair of very decent you sonic active
noise-cancelling earbuds along with the
USB type-c 2 3.5 ml adapter when you
plug those you sonic buds in you can map
the inside of your ear to better suit
the you Elevens audio to your particular
hearing profile the 11 plus has 30%
louder volume than the you 11 and it
sounds every bit as awesome I'm not a
huge fan of the placement of the bottom
firing speaker because it's all too easy
to cover up with your hand while gaming
throwing that delicate balance between
the woofer and earpiece tweeter out of
whack that HTC has always done better
audio than most and you've 11 plus is no
exception
another thing HTC has traditionally been
very good at is smart phone design from
the iconic One m7 to the new liquid
design language in the you 11 series but
ACC also had an unhealthy addiction to
flat bezels in the past about how that
the company has finally begun to kick in
the U 11 plus the six inch qHD plus IPS
LCD Grace's the front of the U 11 plus
providing a crisp if not exactly bright
workspace HTC hasn't gone in for rounded
corners on the display but it has
adopted the new 18 to 9 a speck ratio
that is quickly becoming the new normal
that's not AMOLED here either so VR fans
will have to look elsewhere but the LCD
panel does haven't always on display
mode and you'll still get plenty of
screen on time from the 11 plus that
brings me to the single greatest flaw
with the U 11 plus other features like a
secondary camera or the headphone jack
might be a deal-breaker for some but
just as many people can live perfectly
fine without them but the U 11 plus has
the single dimmest display I have seen
on a smart phone in a long time it's
almost unbearably dim to the point that
outdoor legibility isn't impossible even
at 100% the HDR 10 update that rolled
out a little while back did nothing to
improve the max brightness of the Super
LCD 6 display and while it looks great
inside going outside turns it into a bit
of a nightmare
people with that display bumped uploaded
the 3930 milliamp-hour battery will keep
you going for quite a while I get my
display at about 50% while I was inside
shooting this review and I reliably got
over seven hours of screen on time
assisted by the default battery saver
mode on the 11 plus if you keep the
display cranked up all the way or
disable battery saver for some obscure
reason then you can expect much lower
results but even with occasionally
having to bump the screen brightness
right off I could still get through a
solid day and a half of usage despite
the glass backing of view 11 plus there
is no wireless charging here so be aware
of that if you're a fan speaking of the
glass vacuum the Gorilla Glass 5 they
coach the front and back of the you 11
plus is insanely slippery put this phone
down on the wrong table on either side
and it will slowly migrate itself to the
floor while you're not looking there's
an included case in the box and I'd
advise you to make use of it if not to
limit that you 11 pluses suicidal
tendencies then at least a protective
gorgeous and very slippery foam that
same buttery smoothness appears on the
inside of the 11 plus 2 with Android
aurilla out of the box and HTC Sense
skipping along on top like a stone on a
frozen lake HTC has always made fast and
reliable software and senses stop like
interface an unloaded feature set makes
the U 11 plus about the fastest Android
experience outside the pixel to edge
sensors onboard so you can map very
short cuts to squeezes of the smartphone
frame some finest gimmicky that I
actually find a pretty intuitive and
handy an interesting new feature on the
11 class is the edge launcher app I will
shortcut pickin that's kind of like
Samsung's edge panels but in a form that
you might actually use you can assign up
to 55 shortcuts here from your favorite
apps and contacts to quick settings
toggles a couple of intuitive gestures
borrowed from elsewhere have also made
their way to the U 11 plus where a swipe
up on the home screen will open the app
drawer and a swipe down will summon the
notification shade they make using a
phone as tall as this much more
manageable and as always with HTC
software they implement it very well HTC
lets you add up to five buttons to the
nav bar on the home screen and there's
an entire second bar to the right that
can have another five shortcuts on it
there's a whole bunch of other great
features included on the HTC u 11 but
despite all the positive things I can
say about it there's one big issue that
stops it from being the truly great
phone that HTC sorely needs like they're
saying that the best camera is the one
you have on you the best smartphone can
only be one that you can actually buy
and that's where HTC HTC EVO 11 plus
displayed it being the best smartphone
the company has ever made they did
themselves a great disservice plain not
making it available in the US market if
you live in Europe or Asia where the
phone is available then I'd
wholeheartedly recommend it it nails the
basics incredibly well from camera and
battery to performance and software it
even kicks HTC's love of big bezels to
the curve it will work on AT&amp;amp;T or
t-mobile if you want to import one but
not making this phone full in North
America was a big mistake on HTC's part
at 699 pounds or 799 euros it's cheaper
than the pixel 2 or galaxy si and right
in line to the may 10 Pro its most
obvious competitor well we can only
imagine how awesome the 11 plus would
have been as a pixel it's still an
incredible phone in its own right the
only problem is getting ahold of one hit
