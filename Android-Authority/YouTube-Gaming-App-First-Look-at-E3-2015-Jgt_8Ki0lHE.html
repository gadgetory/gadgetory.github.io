authority what's going on everybody and
here at e3 we were able to get a look at
YouTube gaming now what I am going to be
showing you is the app and you can see
the new icon that was already there and
opening it up we already have the front
splash screen that includes a few
highlights up at the top that
automatically start playing but of
course if you were to click on any of
those up there just tap on any of the
videos it will go fullscreen into a
familiar interface that looks a lot like
YouTube but has a few different new
elements you are able to scroll and to
swipe among the different elements here
from the details of the video to other
suggested videos to even the comments
now what you're going to notice in this
particular video is well it's the Final
Fantasy 7 remake the trailer and we're
all super excited about that it does get
front and center on the YouTube gaming
application which is really awesome as
we continue forward what you'll find in
the splash screen that you have the
ability to take a look at not only a
feed of what is available now and live
streaming but also take a look at all
the different channels that typically do
gaming video so people like PewDiePie
will be there you also get publications
like IGN and GameSpot there but over
here on this side you have various
favorited games now you can search for a
game you can hit a star on the side and
you'll be able to have them on the list
here easy to find all of the different
types of content that you have there i
click on mortal kombat x here and we not
only have the ability to look at a live
stream that's going on right now but
there are also some explore video so
probably some just some general
suggestions that youtube gaming will
give you as to what kind of videos they
think that you would like to see from a
particular game i did pop on over to
another live stream this one was on
advanced warfare and as is the case with
some of the streams that you might see
across any of the other networks the
same as here that you could just have a
camera pointed at yourself and you're
just reacting to the game of course a
mixture of the two is probably better
but you'll also notice on the live
streams that a live chats are available
as well so in real time during your
stream people will be able to comment
and you can see here on this nexus 6
that i will
able to experience all of that an easy
way right here on the mobile side of
things ads do come up there so of course
YouTube game is going to have the
monetization value of YouTube into a
live streaming service that is a lot
like twitch TV so going through the chat
a little bit there are a lot of
different comments already available and
all of them will be made available also
once the stream is done and the video is
converted into an actual YouTube video
but as we remove ourselves from the
streaming area now we'll go to the
search box now you'll have really
powerful Google like searches here I'm
ready looking for Final Fantasy and
right away a lot of final fantasy games
just appear and you'll have all the
search results including the album arts
the game art rather from all of these
games if they are populated already some
of them were not but heading on over to
Final Fantasy 10 in this particular case
we see the different types of content
that YouTube gaming will be able to give
you right away this was the explore tab
right here but swiping around you'll
also find popular videos probably the
most viewed ones for Final Fantasy 10 in
this case in particular and also the
let's play channels that are available
as well if you have let's plays that
already you also have reviews at the
very end which make it really easy for
you to find all the research you need in
order to see if a game is what you want
to buy with your hard-earned money and
of course you are able to star these
games and have them in the games area on
the home splash screen as well of course
there are a ton of people out there
doing gaming content on YouTube and now
streaming is going to be a big part of
it we did talk to somebody who had a few
answers for our questions about YouTube
gaming streaming and ultimately it's
going to require the right applications
and capture cards for your pc games and
on various platforms like the ps4 in
particular we talked about a youtube app
will be available and will provide the
kind of streaming service that is
already built into it that you could do
with twitch already up until this point
but now YouTube gaming is looking to
really get into that market as well but
of course we can't forget about the
desktop side of things the YouTube
gaming apparatus is available across all
the major platforms whether it be mobile
tablet or on the Chromebook here
browser of course and as you see here
there was a live stream already
happening this was actually happening
right behind me already Freddie Wong
meeting up with YouTube gaming and
rooster t than the livestream there and
you have the chat on the right side so
people will be able to pretty much
comment whenever they want in real time
and you can see that the interface here
is very similar to youtube in general
just a little bit more dial to back
because it is focusing on a very
specific genre of videos and of course
you have the splash up top where you
have the top trending videos and the
ones that they want to have front and
center the interface on all of them
looks pretty great and we did kind of
comment a little bit thinking that maybe
this is the kind of interface that
YouTube should have in general but of
course with YouTube gaming you have a
very specific breadth of content and it
would be a little bit easier to really
curate what is appearing on all the
different tabs here all of which include
of course the Let's Plays and the
reviews with a very nice splash up top
that's kind of reminiscent of google
play music for example and Google Play
in general actually so yeah it's really
easy to find content for any games that
you're looking for and if you want to be
a content creator than the ability to
stream and create YouTube videos at 60
frames per second of all of the stuff
that you play will be available and they
will be coming pretty soon they slated
it for the summer so it should be coming
any time now so perhaps YouTube gaming
is the next place where you'll put your
gaming prowess out for the world to see
that was just a quick look at YouTube
gaming here at e3 they had a little
booth and we just wanted to take a look
at what this new app and new ecosystem
for gaming might look like for people
like you then wonderful gamers who came
out to e3 and joined us and what was a
pretty awesome show so keep it tuned
here for even more and we have a lot
more content from e3 2015 because we are
your source for all things Android and
for this week a little bit of gaming as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
