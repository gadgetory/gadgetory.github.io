brought to you by domain.com hold the
presses the battery gods have answered
our prayers that's right a new
breakthrough from Samsung could almost
double the life of your lithium battery
researchers at Samsung Electronics
announced yesterday that they have
developed a new technology to produce a
silicon cathode material that coats
graphene onto a silicon surface for
higher energy density in other words
Samsung has found a way to almost double
the capacity of lithium batteries which
are used to power smartphones and
various other gadgets smartphone
capacity has increased slightly over the
last decade but the technology remains
limited by the physical size of gadgets
and the limitations of the actual
materials inside the battery and as we
can't make batteries much bigger
increasing the raw capacity is needed
and researchers have been looking into
new materials to find the solution this
is where Samsung's research comes in the
company has come up with a new coding
method for battery cathodes which
overcomes the cycling performance and
capacity limitations imposed by current
implementations the new process makes
use of that excellent conductive
material known as graphene which has
grown directly onto the silicon coating
surface without silicon carbide
formation if this sounds familiar other
groups in the US have been attempting
similar ideas this allows for about 1.8
times greater than commercialized
lithium-ion batteries meaning more
battery capacity for a given area
typically this type of design reduces
the battery's lifespan due to more
charge and discharge cycles but this
time the researchers also claimed good
cycling performance due to its
multi-layer design Samsung expects that
its breakthrough will have great
implications for both mobile devices and
the electric car industry which both
really need additional battery capacity
however like most new innovations
industry observers expect that that
technology is at least two or three
years away from commercialization do you
hear that that's all the hardcore
android geeks breathing a sigh of relief
you don't have to message me anymore
about battery life because there's some
relief on the way but I would ask that
you put your thinking caps on again and
please come up with another Android
related domain name a.com domain name
that has not been purchased yet people
that should have been painfully clear
last time but if you can do that come up
with a Android related domain name
cleverly creatively cuz it takes a lot
of creativity I will send you a t-shirt
I sent mr. Singh another t-shirt in
India he should be getting that soon
because it takes a lot of creativity to
come up with a.com domain name that has
not been thought of yet why because no
domain name extension tells your story
with the same level of trust as a.com
or.net domain name dot-com and dotnet
domain name extensions and Jack
credibility into your online presence
and who doesn't want more credibility
you can save 15% on domain name and web
hosting when you use our coupon code
Android at domain.com check out don't
forget 15% off when you use our coupon
code Android when you think domain names
think domain.com thanks for watching
android army my name is chase love to
connect with you right here on Google+
or Twitter and I follow you in the
comments below you don't want to forget
about these guys these guys over here
working super hard to be your source for
