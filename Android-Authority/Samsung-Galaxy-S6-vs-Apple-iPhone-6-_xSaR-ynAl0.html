latest iterations of their respective
lines pit Samsung and Apple against each
other once again it's the Samsung Galaxy
s6 versus the iPhone 6 metal rules the
day for both of these phones as Samsung
has finally brought their design
language into new territory
the metallic frame now keeps two glass
panels together in this new version of
the galaxy which still retains much of
what makes it a samsung built device the
classic button layout with tactile
fingerprint reading home button flanked
by recent apps and back capacitive keys
are coupled with the power button on the
right and the volume rockers that are
opposite it what has been most hotly
debated about this version is the lack
of a removable backing which means no
access to the battery or expandable
storage though on the back there was
still a heart rate monitor and the
camera sticks out quite a bit there is
little to really clutter the form factor
of this phone handling is as good as
ever with a 5.1 inch screen and the
device has a good lightness and thinness
that keep it really nimble for
one-handed usage despite all other
elements being moved to the bottom and
that makes the s6 look pretty similar to
the iPhone this is still a Samsung
device through and through but that
brings us to the iPhone 6 which marked a
change in Apple's design language as
well a larger model finally came with
the main model but the 6 plus gets a 5.5
inch screen for those who really need
more screen real estate focusing mainly
on the smaller model that now Apple
asked metal construction keeps the phone
looking and feeling really nice with its
own button layout of home button up
fronts that can scan fingerprints as
well and the volume rockers and silenced
toggles on the left side with the power
button brought to the right side this
time to accommodate the larger size of
the 4.7 inch screen despite being point
1 millimeters thicker than the galaxy s6
both of these phones are actually very
similar in handling with the iPhone
getting the slight bump in ergonomics
because of its smaller screen size for
any Apple veteran it's not hard to
applaud what the company did by refining
the design and making the iPhone 6 and
6-plus much larger than before but on
the other hand Samsung has really
changed their tune when it comes to
design and many people are going to like
the metal design with the dual glass
panels and that is the case for us here
at Android authority but for those power
users who need or want out replaceable
batteries and expandable storage neither
of these devices are going to please
them
nonetheless metal is the way to go for
both of these devices and it's a
personal choice as to which company
rocks it better but we applaud Samsung
for finally making the substantial
change in design that we've been waiting
for as already mentioned the iPhone got
a bump up to 4.7 inches in the main
model and 5.5 inches in the plus
basically flanking the middle size of
5.1 for the galaxy s6 adhering to their
original company philosophy of pixel
density Apple keeps the resolutions of
both fairly low compared to many new
Android counterparts keeping the iPhone
6 at 1334 by 750 resolution at 326
pixels per inch
though the plus does get a full 1080p
display as Android manufacturers
continue to push the boundaries of
specifications quad HD is the new flavor
as 2560 by 1440 resolution at 577 pixels
per inch brings high performance to the
Samsung Galaxy s6 if you're looking for
a great display experience you'd be
hard-pressed to find many flaws in any
of these devices unless you are actually
very spec hungry the galaxy s6 manages
to have a high powered display without
sacrificing how well it performs and
with such a high pixel density
everything from media to text looks
gorgeous under the great contrast levels
of a Super AMOLED display the Apple
phones don't suffer from any sharpness
issues due to the resolutions though
their IPS LCD constructions may not be
as pleasing to the eyes of Super AMOLED
fans users who want to have a very good
media experience with the iPhones would
likely opt for the larger 6 plus for its
real estate as the galaxy s6 tows the
lines of comfort and size with this 5.1
inch panel Super AMOLED continues to
really prove itself as a great display
experience and it's a feather in the cap
of Samsung but Apple's Retina displays
definitely hold their ground still as a
display tech with a rich pedigree it
almost sounds like a cop-out nowadays
but these two different ecosystems bring
different performance experiences no
matter how you slice it though this
might have been the general line for
comparing Android and iOS this new crop
of flagship devices out of Android camp
seemed to be getting the speed upgrade
that they've been needing the Android
lollipop can take quite a bit of the
credit here but in the galaxy s6 Samsung
opted for a different processing package
in their Exynos 7420 as a replacement to
the snapdragons backed by three
gigabytes of RAM TouchWiz then has been
optimized by Samsung for Samsung and the
results is one of the most
experiences that the company has ever
put out stutters are nearly non-existent
and movements through the interface and
even among different apps and either the
recent apps screen or through things
like the multi window or as smooth as
ever in the past shade thrown ad
TouchWiz for less than a completely
fluid experience put iOS that little bit
over with it's nice animation seamlessly
moving in and out of applications and in
this latest iteration of their
smartphone the Apple a8 with one
gigabyte of RAM are able to sufficiently
power their operating system with very
few problems this disparity in
processing packages is the main reason
why it's clear Android and iOS are
completely different beasts but as an
operating system cater to just one
platform of devices it makes sense that
Apple would be able to optimize iOS
fully and the result is an experience
that has thus far stood the test of time
for Apple veterans Android seems to be
in a little bit of a renaissance
definitely led by all of the companies
who we think are stepping their game up
in terms of performance on their
smartphones with that all in mind we do
have to give Samsung some credit for
closing the gap between it and iOS
hardware takes on a similar story for
both of these phones especially
considering Samsung's new compromises
both phones come without expandable
storage so paying for 32 64 and 128
gigabyte options are up to the user
either phone sports fingerprint readers
embedded in the home button and this
time around Samsung made it a press type
instead of a swipe type which is a
better implementation that Apple has
used for a couple of generations now as
such turning on either phone is a simple
matter of hitting the face button and
leaving the finger there to be read
speakers on both of these devices are on
the bottom now which is the headline in
terms of design similarity between these
two but the truth remains that Samsung
finally brought the speaker away from
the back and put it in a better space
and in our testing the s6 speaker
sounded a bit louder though in either
case we'd prefer to have headphones at
much noisier environments and finally in
battery Samsung might have lost its edge
a bit by encasing the battery but it's
longevity is about where Android
veterans can expect it to be a day and a
half could be had if power saving modes
are taken advantage of but fast charging
is probably the tool most users will
benefit from on these 25 50 milliamp
hour units die phone 6 and 6-plus
haven't gotten to many high notes on
battery and lack these particular
features and that's something Apple
users have become used to in their
respective camp as well respective
numbers are around
hours of moderate usage and these have
been observed in both of these phones on
the daily the lack of certain features
for both of these phones have displeased
many users in either camp but perhaps in
this hardware section it's clear now how
neck-and-neck these phones are slowly
becoming in their latest versions and in
the camera features that are found in
the Samsung Galaxy s6 are a bit split in
the two versions of the iPhone mainly
because of oh is which is only available
in two plus as such these pictures are
all coming from the plus two even up the
playing field a little bit after all if
you want oh is between the s6 and the
iPhone 6 well the s6 is the obvious
choice while that will help with
stabilization in both photos and videos
the general quality of the iPhone 6
phones continues their well-regarded
performance the app is pretty simple
though with swipes controlling the modes
and there are a few extra settings aside
from filters and automatic HDR slow
motion and time-lapse are fun additions
to the camera experience and I have seen
some really nice examples from both
effects the Samsung Galaxy s6 on the
other hand has plenty of options to
enhance photos though the main story is
the inclusion of f 1.9 apertures and
auto HDR for both cameras indeed selfies
from both phones are pretty good and
this is evidenced by the Apple camp by
just how many iPhone self-portraits are
all over social media
but the s6 brings a lot of customization
to photos including the option to change
picture and video sizes and a pro mode
even brings the ability to manually
focus the shot along with all of the
other options typical of a manual mode
pictures in either camp have great color
reproduction and details and all that
the dimmest situations will remain well
captured sharpness is at its best in
these newest versions of the respective
lines and it seems Samsung has opted to
keep the noise reduction to a minimum so
pictures are more accurately depicted
rather than smudged out by bad
post-processing in low-light situations
is actually a toss-up between these two
but the Galaxy s6
tends to go for warmer temperatures in
its colorations in lower light
situations like this one indoors as
Samsung further closes the gap in camera
quality since the note 4 is a great
performer it seems the only real problem
the iPhone has here is a smaller sensor
at a megapixels as the galaxy s6
demonstrates that it's larger 16
megapixel sensor captures a bit more
detail for its better post-processing to
work on you won't have a bad time with
either of these cameras when it comes to
quality for shooting options both
provide some compelling
versions of their own creative mode but
if what you want is more freedom in
controlling your shot the galaxy s6
turns out to be the somewhat better
choice in software we get some key
enhancements in both versions of these
respective interfaces with one updating
its look a little bit and the other
finally getting the boost that we've
been waiting for let's start with iOS
which got a pretty significant upgrade
in iOS 7 continuing to bring its control
center for easy access for settings a
notification drop down for stock
scheduling and general happenings and a
more hollow like look all around that
has helped keep the long-standing
operating system from looking too long
in the tooth yes there have been updates
to iOS 8 recently but these updates
focus mainly on the Apple watch and a
new suite of Health applications that we
have yet to fully put through its paces
all in all i OS veterans remain
satisfied with their flavor of operating
system even with the lack of its app
drawer which is a mainstay for Android
and it's on the back of the newest
version of Android that TouchWiz has
gotten the update we've been waiting for
coupled with the in-house processing
package of the exceed no 7420 this
version of Samsung's interface has
gotten smoother and slimmer many of the
different features that clutter the
operating system in the past are no
longer here like the air gestures but
some remain like the multi window and
the S window without annoying tutorials
all over the place to push these
capabilities in your face it does get
some aesthetic changes including a few
new transitions and effects that are
somewhat akin to the ones found
originally in iOS but they suit this
version of TouchWiz very well as health
itself has been updated though how it
stacks up against the medical suite in
iOS remains to be seen ultimately the
galaxy s6 is a phone that takes lollipop
and puts its own flavor on it and that's
something we didn't think we would say
in the last couple years as much of what
Samsung has always wanted to bake in
turned out gimmicky and somewhat outside
what should have been the daily usage
prowess of proper Android and now you
have that proper reliable experience on
the daily which can be bolstered by
extra features if you dig a little
deeper ultimately you're going to know
what operating system works better for
you thankfully over the last few years
Android has really closed the gap with
iOS in terms of the number of apps that
it has and all of the capabilities that
it can offer but the main story in the
software segment is not just that these
operating systems have become updated
but Samsung has really made a step
forward in the galaxy s6 and so there
you have it the Samsung Galaxy s6 and
the
Apple iPhone 6 both of these phones
bring their huge bang for a huge buck
because both of these phones will cost
you a pretty penny replaceable battery
and expandable storage are what got cut
to trim down the overall experience of
the s6 into one that we're actually
happy to recommend to users new and old
but these compromises have been well
known to Apple users by now who have had
to contend with embedded batteries and
fixed storage for years now what has
seemed to work for iPhone users will now
have to work for galaxy users and that's
what will continue Samsung's polarizing
nature perhaps the best way of looking
at these two phones is how the race
between them has gotten much closer
perhaps neck-and-neck so if you want
either a smaller screen or bigger screen
with the proven power of iOS then the
iPhone is for you for a more powerful
screen and more robust camera experience
powered by a renaissance and design and
software Samsung has done some great
things to start off this flagship
citizen of 2015 and we're excited to see
where these two phones go next as always
thank you guys very much for watching
and I hope you enjoyed this versus
between the Samsung Galaxy s6 and the
iPhone 6 depending on which ecosystem
better suits you on the daily you really
can't go wrong with either of these
devices and we really do applaud Samsung
for closing the gap even more with this
latest version of their flagship
smartphone Apple it's your move now so
