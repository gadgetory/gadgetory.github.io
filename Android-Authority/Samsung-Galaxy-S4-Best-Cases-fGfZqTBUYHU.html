here with Android Authority calm out in
the beautiful mountains of Oregon and
today I'm showing you the best cases for
the Samsung Galaxy s4 smartphone the
first case in our lineup today is the
speck CandyShell grip this is a highly
sought after case because of its
two-in-one hard and soft construction
and it's rigid grip on the sides and
back I obviously have the black version
but it comes in seven different colors
and retails for 3495 as you can see on
the back of the speck we have our grey
rubberized grip area it's raised so it
provides maximum grip to almost any
surface we also have our volume and
power buttons which are easily pressed
and take little to no effort at all to
access we have our mic and headphone
cutouts on top as well as our lower mic
and our charging port cutouts on bottom
and we have a gray rubberized edge that
surrounds the bezel of the galaxy s4
this edge is going to protect against
any facedown falls but you'll want to
make sure to protect with a screen
protector as well next up is our signet
fit grip hybrid active case it's a dual
material case with raised edges and a
nice dual color design looking at the
front of the Signet you immediately
notice the raised edge it's very nice
and will protect from facedown Falls
we've also got a rubberized power button
we have a nice signet logo on the bottom
next to our speaker cutout as well as
our charging port on the top we have
cutouts for our microphone and our
headphone adapter and then we have our
volume keys on the side you can see that
the Signet has extra rubberized corners
to protect against corner Falls now it
comes in four different colors and
retails for 25:49 installation of the
Signet is extremely easy simply pop your
Galaxy S 4 and make sure the bezel is
lined up for a perfect fit next up is
our samsung official s view cover this
is unique because it offers full screen
protection but still allows you to
access basic features of the phone such
as answering and rejecting calls without
opening the cover
simply open up the cover to access your
home screen and then close the cover to
get the s view now it is just a shell
that replaces the backing on the s4 so
it does not offer any protection for the
bottom sides or top now with the cover
closed you can still access and utilize
the touch screen simply slide left on a
call to end it or slide right to answer
installation is easy as well simply pull
off the existing backing on your Galaxy
s4 and replace it with the S view cover
all you have to do is snap it in and
then you're 100% ready to go now the S
view cover is one of the priciest of the
bunch at $41.99 but it's available in
seven different colors and is quite
convenient if you don't want to use the
phone without screen protection
moving right along we've got our
OtterBox Commuter case this is one of my
absolute favorite cases for the Samsung
Galaxy s4
it features protection but it's not as
bulky as the Defender case you can see
it has a raised edge to protect against
facedown falls and it really does that
nicely we've also got a rubberized power
button which is easy to press unlike
some of the previous model computers and
we've got our volume buttons we have a
nice coating on the back and a deep dish
for the camera as well as a cutout for
the speaker we also have rubberized
edges to prevent against corner Falls
and to help it bounce in the case that
you do drop it
installing the dual layer protection
computer is easy simply grab your first
rubberized layer and slide the galaxy s4
inside make sure it's tight around the
bezel because you'll do some adjusting
when you get the second part on then you
simply grab your hard shell and line up
the cutouts for the headphone slot and
press in from the bottom make sure to
work the bezel around so you can't see
any of the silver bezel on the galaxy s4
the OtterBox Commuter is available in 10
different colors and rings in at 34
ninety-five now we're checking out
another case that utilizes the Samsung
as few features this one's called the
Sony Bo sneak peek case and it's
basically the same as the Samsung
official case but it rings in at 2149
instead of the $41.99 it's available in
nine different colors and has an awesome
flip cover with a magnet securing it
down as a great texture feels like
leather with cutouts and easy access to
all of our ports as well as buttons
it even has a cutout for the top speaker
now the screen isn't fastened as tightly
as the Samsung official as few cover but
that's to be expected with the lower
price point now the zone Evo offers more
protection than the official Samsung
cover because when installing you simply
put this amiibo in an actual existing
case instead of taking the back cover
off then you can easily reject answer
calls and access all of your
notifications through the s view panel
move it into the next case we have our
spigen slim armor case now this is a
very shock absorbing case with a
hardshell exterior as well it's
available in five different colors which
are all dual color and it's available
for twenty five forty nine
I really enjoy this case because of the
rubberized corners as you can see the
colors blend in very nicely and we have
our nice logo on the back we also have
easy access to our LED camera power and
volume buttons and the home button on
the front as well as our charging ports
and mics on top
I really enjoy the dual color on the
slim armor and I would definitely check
out more of the available colors
installation is extremely simple
just grab your Galaxy s4 and slide it
into the spigen slim armor case making
sure the bezel is snug and then you're
ready to rock
last but not least we have our OtterBox
Defender case available in 12 different
colors ranging from 50 to $60 the price
is very fair for the protection it
offers
we have triple-layer protection on the
OtterBox Defender in a very large raised
bezel above a screen protector that sits
atop the galaxy s4 we have easy access
to our home buttons speaker cutouts
power buttons volume buttons camera and
we even have flaps to prevent dust from
getting into our headphone slot and
charging port the buttons are very easy
to press because OtterBox has improved
over the years and it's a joy using the
Defender you can see that the raised
bezel will protect against any facedown
falls and the screen protector is also
going to keep the screen intact in case
it does shatter but the screen shouldn't
shatter so I wouldn't worry installing
the defender is a three part process
grab your foam shock absorbing hardshell
backing and slide your Galaxy s4 into it
making sure it's a tight fit then simply
grab the included screen protector and
raised bezel and snap that in until it's
perfectly secure making sure all the
corners are nice and intact then we grab
our final rubberized coating and we
slide the entire assembly into that
making sure that the bezels snap and all
of the connections are tight
it's simple and takes less than 30
seconds if you're an experienced
installer and then you're ready to hit
the road
the OtterBox Commuter and Defender
Series cases also come with belt
holsters which allow easy access to your
phone in heavy working conditions they
also provide a clip for you to clip them
to your belt and use on the road I don't
have to say that I personally enjoy the
OtterBox Series whether it be the
commuter of the Defender Series they
provide perfect protection for an active
lifestyle simply install them and you're
ready to go anywhere with perfect
protection I also want to extend a huge
thank you towards mobile fun comm for
providing all of the cases in this video
and I would like to thank the viewers
for viewing as always this is clean
