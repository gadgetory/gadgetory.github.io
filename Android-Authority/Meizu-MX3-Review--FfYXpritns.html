clear in the last say six months Chinese
manufacturers are really looking to take
over the smartphone space with great
offerings that prove that they can
create wonderful Android smartphones and
slowly but surely they are coming to the
west so in this Chinese movement we have
seen a lot of great offerings from
people like Oppo and also Huawei but at
CES we saw a great flagship phone from
meizu and we wanted to show you what it
was all about hey it's Josh regard from
Andhra Authority what's going on
everybody
and this is the meizu mx4
now before we even get started I will
say this yes a lot of you out there are
right in saying that when you take a
first look at the mx3 by meizu you can
pretty much tell where some of its
inspirations come but even if that is
the case and if that is where your mind
goes when you look at this phone that
doesn't take away from the fact that it
is still a really good looking device so
to all of that I say so what the black
front is only interrupted by a simple
white circle down at the bottom which
works as the home button and is also a
very elegant way of showing the LED
notification light the other buttons
take on a somewhat different layout from
much of the rest of the Android space as
the volume rocker is on the left side
and the power button is up on the top
the back of the phone takes on a glossy
plastic look that can be fingerprint
prone and they will show up depending on
what color you pick of the mx3 as it
comes in a bunch of different colors and
holding this all together first is a
magnesium alloy back panel that is
supposed to help with the cooling and
the dissipation of heat and then after
that the frame itself is made of
stainless steel now what is really nice
and is quite a feat in regards to all of
the metal that is actually supposed to
be inside of this phone it makes for a
device that actually isn't all that
heavy to begin with it is very nimble in
the hand and especially with that curve
on the back it allows for very easy
handling as it rests really nicely in
your palm and then when you're reaching
around on the 5.1 inch screen on the
front actually doesn't feel that
difficult at all speaking of that screen
it is like I said 5.1 inches and comes
with a somewhat unique resolution of
1,800 by 1080 whereas the general 1080p
resolution will come in
1920 by 1080 so it is a little bit
unique but it still comes in at 412
pixels per inch which makes all text
still look very nice and that resolution
does mean that videos will have a bit of
a letterbox effect with black bars on
the top in the bottom but otherwise the
color looks really great coming from
this LCD screen with wonderful viewing
angles to boots what we probably love
most about this screen is the very small
bezel especially on the sides as you can
see here they're just really thin which
means they were able to pack such a
large screen onto this device and still
keep it from getting any larger than it
needed to be when it comes to power the
mx3 has no problems with that at all as
it may not come with a Snapdragon
processor like we see with a lot of
flagship devices but what could be
considered the next best thing and of
course that would be from Samsung's
Exynos 5 octa which brings a whole
course of power to this handset after
that it is powered by power VR SGX
graphics and 2 gigabytes of RAM for
multitasking now given that the fly me
operating system itself is a pretty
different type of operating system that
has a lot of elements specifically built
by meizu from the ground up it would be
no surprise to us if optimization was a
big factor in what has become a very
smooth experience on here especially
with all of the transitions and the
software itself you really don't get any
sense at all that there's lag on this
phone and you're able to get everything
you need done pretty easily
now while the mx2 you might not have
expandable storage you do have the
option of getting a 16 32 64 or 128
gigabytes worth of it onboard so that's
a really nice option and also this
version of the MX 3 that I'm holding
here is basically made for Europe and as
such it does come with HSDPA
connectivity out of the box LTE is not
available so hopefully when versions of
this come to the west we will see it
have LTE support so you can take
advantage of your high-speed networks
and as far as call quality goes I use
this on the t-mobile network here in the
United States and I found no problems
when it came to the sound quality the
call quality and more importantly there
were no dropped calls at all when it
comes to the battery 2400 milliamp hours
in terms of capacity might seem a little
bit low these days in the Android space
and unfortunately that is true
especially for the mx3 I never really
got any more than maybe eight to ten
hours out of it when I'm constantly
using it under moderately heavy usage
that means even with the power saving on
which is just an option doesn't give you
much customization of the power saving
you probably will only be able to get
about a day out of this phone even if
you try to not use it too much
the real story with this particular
phone however is its audio output as it
is outfitted with a Wolfson audio chip
that's supposed to provide even better
audio processing and then after that a
speaker system that even if it doesn't
necessarily look all that great it's
supposed to provide good dimension in
the sound now in our testing we did play
a lot of music on this phone and I do
have to admit that it provides a very
nice rich sound there's actually some
bass to this tiny little speaker on the
back and it's very very pleasant
all right now let's move on to the
camera which is a 8 megapixel performer
with a low f 2.0 aperture made for
low-light shots and for the most part it
does its job but before we get into that
the app is pretty simplistic with all of
the elements on the right side and some
options are available within for some
creativity like a macro mode which
you'll see in a bit and also some manual
controls are available now when it came
to auto focusing it really wasn't the
best because we could be pointing the
camera at a particular scene and it
wouldn't really auto focus at all
generally we have to touch to focus but
thankfully it does do so quite quickly
now what's really nice is the gesture
capture it's just a really cool feature
that allows you to wave your hand over
the proximity sensor at the top of the
phone that way you don't worry about
pressing down buttons or creating some
sort of shake by actually pressing the
key on the viewfinder itself now quality
is a bit hit-and-miss though I will
admit it's generally hid the colours do
look really good and the details come
through the photo however once you zoom
in a little bit you will see that the
noise levels are still pretty high it's
not the sharpest image that you'll find
but we will say that we've seen much
worse in terms of noise levels and other
phones you also might get a slightly
overexposed shot from time to time
probably more often than you would want
but overall this is a very capable
performer and is actually quite a bit of
fun to use especially with that gesture
capture feature all right now we're
going to get into the software which
might take a little bit of time to talk
about because it is vastly different
from many of the other Android systems
that we've seen out there now in this
particular case we could say that the
fly me OS at 3.0 which is what was
debuted on the MX 3 is a bit of a mash
up yes it does have iOS 7 elements and
there especially its flat look and those
merge with what is ostensibly in Android
shell to make a very basically gesture
heavy interface which is interesting the
home button is where everything is
centred around obviously and it
simplifies things but also makes other
buttons soft keys but even if they are
soft keys they are pretty brilliantly
collected in a bar just above the home
button gestures center around the home
button as well if you swipe up away from
the home button you will bring up a line
of your recent apps
and then if you swipe up starting from
home you have to touch home on the way
up it will emulate a back button in most
cases but also is a nice way to quickly
unlock the phone without having to use
the power button up top now as far as
the general interface goes this flat
design does come with many unique ways
of expressing what are otherwise very
familiar elements of Android the volume
indicator is really understated the
notification drop-down doesn't come all
the way down it only comes down as far
as the number of notifications it is
displaying and then of course there is
the settings page which is just a long
line down of different tabs for various
functions now simplification is
something that's always welcomed to us
here at Android or 'ti however a
simplification can sometimes come at a
cost when it comes to the mx3 it
unfortunately has to do with function
swipe up from the bottom and you do get
a list of your various recent apps and
you are able to switch between them very
easily however you don't get really any
previews of what those apps are doing in
the background so you don't get that
kind of Nexus or KitKat type of
functionality and not even that you
can't do it much else when it comes to
multitasking except switch between the
two simplification also meant for the
general design of the phone doing away
with the app drawer which is always an
interesting choice given that a lot of
us Android users really kind of rely on
the app drawer for organization
literally all of your apps and widgets
will appear on the home screens making
folders does help and overall be good
design keeps it from looking actually
cluttered or even unattractive which is
nice but in the worst case scenario you
probably will just have to install a
custom launcher and finally when it
comes to price we did hear from a zoo
that they're planning on bringing the MX
3 to the west at a competitive price
point now what that is exactly we don't
really know but if you need to get your
hands on this phone before it comes out
in the West you can find it at the base
model for under five hundred dollars now
considering that a lot of other flagship
Android handsets come in at over $600
you can say that for all that this phone
is capable of doing that is a bit of a
steal and so there you have it the meizu
mx4 term that I can't help but think I
know a lot of you out there think it as
well made in China
well that's a term that unfortunately
has been saddled with a negative
connotation in recent years especially
in regards to quality however what we
can tell you is I in the smartphone
space companies in China are making
moves to reverse this notion and to be
honest we think that especially with
offerings like the mx3 they are
definitely succeeding and to be honest
we're all really excited to see that
movement come stateside as always thank
you guys very much for watching and hope
you enjoyed this review of the meizu mx4
chinese companies as they're coming to
the US we already have a lot of good
offerings already and it could only get
better from here
so keep it tuned to android authority
