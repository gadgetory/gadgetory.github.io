authority and Motorola's latest flagship
has finally arrived so let's go ahead
and unbox this bad boy this is your
unboxing and first impressions of the
Moto X pure edition aka the Moto X style
if you follow the Moto X since the
beginning like I have the first thing
you're going to notice right off the bat
is how much bigger the box is compared
to the boxes of the last two moto X's
and there's a couple of reasons for that
one is obviously because the phone is
much bigger and two because Motorola was
nice enough to include a bumper case
inside the box which will of course take
a look at during the unboxing
after you've sliced open the plastic
film tossed it aside and crack open the
box you're immediately greeted with the
phone but in the usual unboxing fashion
we'll set that off to the side and see
what else is in the box to the right
side of the phone underneath the paper
insert is a plastic clear bumper it's
nothing fancy but should get the job
done just fine if you need a little bit
of protection and you can't really
complain too much about it because after
all it's practically free underneath the
bumper case is Motorola's turbo power
charging brick to take advantage of that
fast charging and moto says this will
give you 10 hours of battery life in
just 15 minutes
the only oddity that I noticed was that
the cable doesn't disconnect from the
charging brick so if you need a
dedicated microUSB to USB cable you'll
have to supply that yourself also
included inside the box is the typical
start guide and warranty information
which nobody is going to read and
underneath all of that is the standard
sim removal tool and that's pretty much
all you get what you really want to take
a look at is the Moto X and one of the
biggest selling points of the Moto X has
always been customization and making it
your own so that's exactly what I did I
chose to go with a black front slate
back and lemon/lime for the accents and
personally I think it looks pretty good
but you can choose whatever color or
material choices that you want like wood
and leather and that's part of the
beauty of owning a moto X design wise
it's very similar to the previous
generations of Moto X's with the sloping
curve back rounded corners and
unassuming clean front and of course
Motorola signature dimple is on the back
underneath the camera and they've chosen
to go back to a much smaller more
subtle dimple which I think is a lot
better the biggest difference this year
is the size and I'll be honest when I
got to check it out in New York I was
very skeptical that was going to feel
too large in the hand especially because
of that 5.7 inch display but once I got
to hold it for the first time all my
doubts were put to rest and I still feel
the same way about it now don't get me
wrong it's not a small phone anymore and
it Dwarfs the previous two Moto X's but
Motorola has done a really nice job with
tightening up the bezels that it feels
very manageable in one hand in fact it's
actually very similar in size to the
Galaxy Note 5 in terms of height and
width the only exception is the Moto X
is slightly thicker but basically what
I'm saying here is if you can handle the
size of the Galaxy Note 5 you'll have
absolutely no problems with the Moto X
just to recap these specs really quickly
you're looking at a Snapdragon 808
processor 3 gigs of ram 16 32 or 64 gigs
of internal storage plus microSD card
expansion this year and inside is an
embedded 3000 milliamp hour battery
which hopefully is enough especially
considering the display on this year's
model has been swapped for a TFT LCD
display versus the amyloids on previous
models so features like moto display may
eat up a little bit more battery life
but obviously we'll have to wait and see
the cameras have also seen an
improvement at least on paper with a 21
megapixel shooter in the back and a 5
megapixel wide-angle lens on the front
with a built-in selfie flash I haven't
had the phone long enough to test the
camera in fact I just received it
earlier this morning but I'm going to
keep my fingers crossed and hope that
it's a lot better than last year's and
can at least somewhat compared to other
flagships and finally you have the
software with android 5.1.1 out of the
box and motorola has had a really good
track record with keeping the experience
very close to stock which is why I have
always felt the Moto X is the best
alternative to a nexus and in some ways
it's better because of Motorola super
useful features like moto display and
moto voice which you can still customize
with your own key phrase another awesome
thing about the Moto X pure edition is
that there's no bloatware and on first
boot you'll notice that there's only a
page and a half worth of apps with most
of them being Google applications and
only a few moto applications like moto
Connect migrate and the Moto app for
tweaking the Motorola features but that
is going to do it for this quick
unboxing and first impressions of the
Moto X
hopefully you enjoyed it and stay tuned
for the full review which should be
coming up shortly and subscribe if you

it when it goes live and as always thank
