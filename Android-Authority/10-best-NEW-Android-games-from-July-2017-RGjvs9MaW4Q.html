indeed Android Authority app guy and
we're nearing the end of July which
means it's time to check out the best
new Android games that were released
over the course of the last month as
usual if you want to check out any of
these games for yourself you can find
those links in the video description
below
all that remains part one is a horror
escape game you and your sibling are
trapped in your dad's bunker and the
goal is to escape the bunker with your
sister alive it plays a lot like games
such as the room you'll find clues solve
puzzles and eventually make your escape
the game features an in-game camera so
you can easily check on previous clues
there is also an autosave feature it's
had an excellent reception so far and
it's a dollar 49 with no in-app
purchases Arkanoid vs. space invaders is
an arcade game mashup by Square Enix it
features mechanics from both arkanoid as
well as space invaders you'll have to
bounce objects up at the invaders to
take them down meanwhile the invaders
will be firing at you it's not the
deepest game ever however it does have
twenty powers forty unlockable
characters and a hard mode unlike most
arcade games these days this one doesn't
have any in-app purchases Crusaders of
light is a new MMORPG admittedly it
doesn't bring anything new to the genre
that said it does do several things
better than most it features the usual
campaign mode with many many quests and
storyline branches it also has raid
bosses that you can fight with up to 40
people there are also three PvP variants
a bunch of gear and some social elements
it's a freemium game but you probably
already guessed that face grand order is
an anime themed RPG it bases its story
off of the eponymous anime and you'll
get to play as characters from the show
as you embark on an adventure to save
the world the game is a character
collecting title you'll recruit various
servants to fight for you and do your
bidding they level up n evolve as you go
the storyline is actually pretty decent
however the mechanics aren't overly
unique in any meaningful way it's good
for what it is
Grand Prix Story 2 is the sequel to one
of the most popular racing Sims on
mobile this one allows you to run your
own racing crew and you'll hire people
build cars race them and earn lots of
money the ultimate goal is to become the
top dog in the industry you'll have to
build multiple cars to race on the
various types of tracks it's a
game unlike its predecessor however it's
still one of the better racing Sims that
we've seen minecraft story mode season 2
is the next chapter in the popular
adventure game series from telltale
games this one picks up where the
previous game left off and you'll play
as most of the same characters you'll be
forced to make tough calls that branch
the story just like most telltale games
titles otherwise it's a pretty standard
point-and-click adventure game
experience the first episode of the game
will cost you $4.99 each subsequent
episode will likely cost the same
oxen-free is a horror adventure game
you're on an island with a bunch of your
friends and the characters end up
opening a ghost rift
you must explore the island figure out
what happened and of course stay alive
it focuses a lot on the storyline and
you'll also have to make choices that
affect the outcome of the game it's kind
of like this war of mine except it takes
place on a haunted island instead of a
warzone it's $4.99 with no in-app
purchases pathos is a new puzzle game
you'll make your way through a bunch of
levels by solving puzzles to complete
your path it's a little similar to games
like Monument Valley or Laura Croft go
it features 36 levels across six
chapters the control scheme is also
simple and easy to learn the underlying
story deals with a kid who is moving
around through the foster care system
the game runs for $2.49 with no in-app
purchases run or die is a rare pain once
endless-runner it's a 2d platformer with
retro graphics and you'll have to jump
over obstacles slide under them or even
dive through layers of the level to
avoid certain doom it features a hundred
and seventy maps three playable
characters and endless mode and even a
day and night cycle it has controller
support and Android TV support however
they're still working out some kinks
with that one
it's $0.99 with no in-app purchases star
Vikings forever is a unique puzzle RPG
you play as a handful of characters and
the goal is to battle off all of the bad
guys levels generate randomly so each
puzzle is just a little bit different
there are six character classes a new
game plus mode and around 8 hours of
storyline the storyline is filled with
all kinds of silly dialogue there is the
occasional bug however it otherwise
plays pretty well is $2.99 with no
in-app purchases and that about does it
for this one folks if you liked this
video share it with your friends so they
can see it as well don't forget to
subscribe to android authority and brain
the bell to get the latest Android
authority videos as soon as they come
out you can find all of these games
linked up in the video description below
