market but they have been making moves
to reach wider audiences and you guys
must be a part of that because you've
been requesting us to take a look at
these funds for some time well I've been
playing around with their brand new
flagship and I gotta say it's pretty
solid
hey it's Josh regard from Android
Authority what's going on everybody
and this is my review of the Xiaomi me
for the me for joins the growing line of
phones particularly out of the Chinese
market that are starting to swarm metal
in their frames the mute for comes with
and apparently elaborately constructed
metal skeleton that only helps with
sturdiness but also helps with its looks
even the buttons on the right side of
the phone are metallic and this time
around you're getting the easy to reach
power button that is now beneath the
volume rockers follow the line around
the phone and you'll see clean elements
that include the headphone jack up top
the microUSB charging port on the bottom
and the speaker that is also on the
bottom the metal skeleton keeps together
two panels that obviously one is of the
five inch screen and then on the back
you have the glossy plastic now speaking
of the five inch screen you do have a
pretty respectable bezel all around it's
really not all that big and really it
gives the phone an even better factor of
slenderness underneath that screen are
the capacitive keys and an LED light
that is used primarily when charging the
phone jump around to the back and the
glossy plastic takes on a white color in
this version I have and despite its
simple outlook oh the feel of glossy
plastic still tends to lend itself to
some slippage now handling the five inch
form factor is a breeze compared to
other phones especially the ones coming
from the Chinese market that have at
least a half inch more diagonally
getting around with one hand is far from
difficult in the flat sides of the metal
frame make it very easy to grip you
really do get the sense that this is a
sturdy phone which is a common
conception when you think of a metal
device sure it might look like a couple
of other phones out there but honestly
when they happen to make the fun look
this good we're not going to complain
while there are certainly no problems
with this 1080p 5-inch display that has
441 pixels per inch these are numbers
that we've grown accustomed to seeing
any way through out screens of this size
and caliber colors are quite vibrant and
the contrast allows for some deep blacks
making the viewing or even the gaming
experiences as good as they should be on
a flagship device the view
angles are also quite good too with the
image losing fidelity only at angles
that are steeper than what practicality
dictates and if you look closely around
the screen you will see a small black
line that frames the image somewhat
adding to the overall bezel size now
it's not a big deal by any means and
it's not a big offender as we've seen on
other displays but it is something that
I thought would be worth noting but
underneath that enjoyable display is
also the processing power that we've
come to expect from a flagship like this
the Snapdragon 801 and the adrenal 330
backed by three gigabytes of RAM it's
certainly the kind of power that you
would need in order to do everything
from working and playing play in
particular was pretty dang fun on this
device as I had little to no slowdowns
and even highly intensive games one
particular game that I got sucked into
shadow fight 2 showed off the contrast
possible on this display as well as
never quite slowing down but then it is
in hardware that we see the main issues
with having a Chinese market phone
outside of its origin this version of
the phone only connects two HSDPA
networks making the internet experience
less than ideal for Western audiences
while that is something I've certainly
had to contend with in the past I've
unfortunately had plenty of connection
issues and haven't been able to use
mobile networks consistently as I said
before however Xiaomi is trying to reach
more audiences and thus a version made
for 4G and Western networks is upcoming
which is great phone calls came in loud
and clear and the same could mostly be
said about the speaker on the bottom of
the device when playing clear music and
playing high-caliber games the sound
actually comes through quite loud which
is a big plus in the media department
and finally the issue of network
connectivity on the me--for did make it
kind of tough for me to create some real
battery metrics for you so I'll just
give you my experience one thing I will
tell you is that the standby time is
actually really great I had the phone
sitting for quite a while and it really
made no dent in the longevity of the
phone overall I did do one specific test
using a looped season of a television
show at half brightness and volume while
it died before I could get a screenshot
of the battery usage it definitely took
at least eight hours to reach single
digits we then move on to the camera
which is mostly a standard affair and
another example of xiaomi taking off all
the right boxes on the me for 13
megapixels are what you get in the
rear-facing camera with a very
impressive 8 megapixels packed into the
front-facing camera
the interface is pretty awesome
ballistic and can be changed from simple
to advanced which does add some settings
but mostly removes the icon labels
ultimately the functionality is on par
with other smartphone camera offerings
which include burst modes and even a
refocusing mode if you want to play with
your depth of field camera quality is
about as standard as you can expect in
broad daylight the camera does well to
capture detail though it might produce
the occasional photo that is well too
bright indoors it starts to taper off in
quality but that's to be expected when
you start to lose light the grain
appears and gets exponentially worse as
conditions get lice I deal with color
even losing fidelity in those darker
situations the front-facing camera does
produce some nice large photos but its
color reproduction leaves quite a bit to
be desired selfie lovers might enjoy the
higher pixel count on this front-facing
camera but it doesn't bring anything
extraordinary to the table and thus we
make it to software which is where some
real differences between this and other
flagship devices truly appear in the me
UI operating system we have Android in
what I could call a hybrid fashion much
of what you'd expect from Android is
turned on its head here like the lack of
an app drawer and the lack of Google
Play services in the chinese-built but
it's not hard to install it yourself and
actually thankfully in my version of
this unit the Play Store was actually
already installed bubbly icons are par
for the course here all sprawled out on
home screens that will only be organized
by the will and use of folders due
diligence as thus needed here but you
will be able to make a clean interface
with some effort after that the menus
take on the same simplistic but
attractive style and just about
everything moves in some sort of
interesting fashion via some lovely
transitions get underneath the surface
and you'll find quite a lot of
customization a powerful theme engine
gives you a slew of new themes and
options to get away from the norm the
notification drop-down can be customized
to a good amount to show icons and rows
or grids or even show certain
information like your current bandwidth
speed the capacitive keys can be further
used for long press functions as well
Xiaomi zone apps are all still in
Chinese making them impossible for
anyone who can't read it while I didn't
have too much trouble with the
applications I installed on there I did
see the Google Play Store crash on more
than a few occasions at the very least
you can't say that the me UI isn't
always improving updates are available
on a weekly basis and might be a mixed
blessing because of how frequent they'll
notify you of that now the me--for isn't
available widely just yet but if you do
want this one right now the currency
exchange will make this about 350 US
dollars that's actually a pretty good
price for some really solid hardware
which is the best way to describe this
phone make sure you'll be able to use it
on your network though and in the end
the Xiaomi me--for is another example of
a point I posited not too long ago that
if the Chinese market for smartphones is
trying to break free and show us what
it's really made of here on the other
side of the world then examples like the
me for service signs that they are
definitely succeeding what you get here
is a package that is easy on the eyes
and easy to use thanks to the somewhat
controversial take on Android called me
UI we're seeing a new batch of metal
clad smartphones especially in the Asian
market but it seems that they're all
going to come to the u.s. in one way or
another
and in the case of the me--for they're
off to a good start
thank you guys very much for watching
and hope you enjoyed this review of the
Xiaomi me floor we'll definitely keep
our eye on shop me from now on and I
know that sometimes I may not pronounce
the name correctly but I hope Xiaomi is
about as good as I'm going to get it but
nonetheless stay tuned for more coverage
of this and Aoife is right on its way
it's just days away so you can make sure
to take a look at all the coverage I'm
going to have I'm going to be there
right on the show floor bringing you all
of the new announcements for a bunch of
new phones and also smartwatches as
we're going to be seeing quite a bit of
presence of those with Android we're on
the cusp so from there make sure you
stay tuned and take a look at content
from my colleagues in Android as well
and from there drop us some likes
subscribe if you haven't already and
once you're done with all of that don't
forget to head on over to android
