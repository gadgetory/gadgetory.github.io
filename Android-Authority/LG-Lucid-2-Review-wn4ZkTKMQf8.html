with the new verizon contract is that a
sign of a bad phone or a sign of
changing times find out in our review
hey everybody Chris look here it wasn't
that long ago that a phone for free with
a contract automatically man it was a
piece of junk with phones like LG's
lucid too could those days finally be
behind us let's kick off the review by
taking a look at the specs the LG Lucid
two features a 4.3 inch qhd display with
a pixel density of around 250 pixels per
inch inside it packs a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 chipset with a dual-core
1.2 gigahertz Krait processor for memory
we have one gig of ram in eight gigs of
internal storage expandable by microSD
the rear facing camera is 5 megapixels
capable of recording 1080p video and the
front facing camera is 1.3 megapixels
providing the devices power is a two
thousand four hundred and sixty milliamp
hour battery I've been a fan of LG's
stark rectangular design for a while now
and this is still the case at least
looking at the Lucid two from the front
or back personally I could do without
the silver around the buttons on the
sides but these touches do add a bit of
visual flair to the phone's look that
others may like the lucid 2 is fairly
light but still manages to feel sturdy
it should fit well in most hands and the
textured back of the device should do a
lot to prevent people from dropping it
though it doesn't quite reach HD
resolution the display isn't the sore
spot that it often is with mid-range
phones at 4.3 inches and a resolution of
960 x 540 we're left with a pixel
density of around 250 pixels per inch
which isn't the sharpest you'll see by
far but it does manage to avoid
noticeable pixilation or blurriness
colors are vivid almost to the point of
over saturation but they aren't too
over-the-top black levels are good as is
the brightness unlike a lot of devices
in this
range the screen was clear and readable
even in bright sunlight these Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 chipsets often proved to
be good performers for the price and
that was the case here as expected we
started our benchmarking with antutu
running 10 separate tests at different
times in different conditions when we
were finished our final average score
was eleven thousand six hundred and
eighty six now we'd love to show you how
epic citadel ramp but it didn't it
started once and then no more in the
real world performance felt snappy
whether it was scrolling through home
screens in the app drawer launching apps
or even trying out a few games though we
didn't go for anything too demanding the
LG Lucid two runs android 4.1 point to
jellybean it is skin with the same
overlay that LG uses on most of its
devices which some of you may not like
but this skin is far more customizable
then skins from a lot of other
manufacturers aside from the standard
apps there are a lot of other apps
included out of the box while some of
these could definitely be considered
bloatware we're looking at you verizon
others are pretty useful the final
manager is really handy as is Polaris
Office the bundled Amazon apps well that
depends on how much shopping you do the
LG Lucid tues camera is usable which
could actually be considered a
compliment when compared to some other
devices in this class while low-light
performance is far from good and it's
fairly easy to take a blurry photo if
you take your time chances are you'll be
able to get a decent shot the 1080p
video capture is decent with the main
issue being that the sensors auto
adjusting to different lighting is very
slow and definitely very noticeable the
2460 milliamp hour battery and
snapdragon chipset work together well
here providing some very good battery
life eight hours of testing including
benchmarking and leaving the display on
most of the time only brought the
battery down to around thirty percent a
16 hour day of normal moderate use
connected to both Wi-Fi and cellular
networks
left me with about twenty percent when I
finally plugged in at the end of the day
as a plus the battery is removable which
is always handy a phone that can be had
for zero dollars with a contract needs
to do a lot of things wrong to not get a
recommendation the LG Lucid to actually
does a whole lot of things right no it's
not a high-end monster phone but that's
not what everyone needs we have a
