Joey indeed Android authority app guy
and it's near the end of March which
means it's time to look at back at the
best new Android apps that were released
over the last month if you want to check
out any of these apps for yourself you
can find those links in the video
description below
Lord is a fun little application that
lets you find YouTube videos cut them up
and then make little clips that you can
share on various social media sites the
application includes a variety of
pre-selected videos that way you can
learn how to use it you can add other
YouTube videos as well and the ones that
you add will be accessible to other
users it's not the most amazing thing
ever but it's a fun way to make a few
clips that could bring some humor to
some it's free to download with no
in-app purchases coroner fly is a
customization app it cuts off the
corners of your phone and rounds them up
for you it's similar to what you see on
the LG g6 ironically this application
actually works pretty well on the g6 the
basic features are free to use there are
additional options such as different
corner sizing available if you happen to
purchase the pro version going pro also
removes all of the advertising it
doesn't do much in terms of
functionality however it's a fun
customization if you're looking for
something a little different energy bar
is another Android customization app it
allows you to display your battery on
top of your status bar that way you can
easily see how much you have left you
can configure it so it's a small bar at
the top and those who buy the full
version can use the entire status bar if
they so choose you'll be able to
customize things like the colors on the
bar it's not the best thing ever but
it's great for steamers who want to try
something different
focus timer reborn is actually a
Productivity app it works by helping you
time the parts of your day where you're
working and in the times of the day
where you don't when it goes off you set
the break timer so you don't dilly-dally
around and get back to work in a prompt
fashion the general idea is to help you
stay on track and be as productive as
possible without burning yourself out it
also keeps a log so you can see how well
you've been doing it's free to download
and use so it's worth a shot
if you've been slacking at work lately
Google is slowly stretching hangouts
into its own suite of business oriented
communication apps hangouts meat is one
of those apps it's a video chat app that
lets you join meetings as well as
conference calls you can get the video
function or disable the video portion
and just use your voice instead if you
want to it supports up to 30
participants integrates with Google
Calendar and a whole lot more
you can join meetings as you please but
you'll need AG suite account to make
full use of the features the application
itself is free to download IQ box e is
an expense management application as you
can imagine they can help you track
expenses
it features OCR support to help you
digitize your receipts for future
reference it's an essential tool for tax
season especially for freelancers and
those who need to keep track of things
for deductions it has a simple material
design interface and the application
also boasts no human behind the curtain
so there is no one reading your receipts
when you scan them it won't replace
large expensive tracking Suites but it's
great tool to augment them meteor is a
new speed testing application it will
measure your download speed upload speed
and ping like most speed testing apps
what makes it different is it'll give
you a rough estimate of how good or bad
your experience will be with
applications that require data it'll
also keep a log so you can check out
your previous scores it has some bugs
that still need to be addressed
however it's completely free with no
in-app purchases or advertising so bears
patch NBA VR is a new Google daydream
app it lets you view special content
from the NBA and that includes
interviews highlights and other
basketball related content unfortunately
it doesn't let you watch entire games at
least not yet you'll be able to download
this on Google daydream enabled devices
only and that unfortunately means that
most people will be able to use this one
in any case it's free with no in-app
purchases if you are interested pics bar
helps your device look a bit more like a
Google pixel it works by adding a few
graphical elements to your navigation
bar and then you move them around until
they line up with your existing buttons
the result makes your phone looks like a
pixel it doesn't support every device
just yet and there are some bugs that
need to be worked out however it does
actually work on devices that run stock
Android it's $0.99 to try it out but you
can always get a refund if you don't
like it Super Sonic is a new messaging
application with a fun premise you'll be
able to message people using your voice
you hold the button record your voice
and then you send it and then the
recipients can listen to the messages
the application also converts what you
say into cute little messages right with
emoji so for it seems to work well
enough although the feature set is a
little bare-bones we don't anticipate it
becoming the next whatsapp or snapchat
but we're sure it's fun for at least
people and that about does it for this
one folks don't forget to hit the
subscribe button and ring the bell so
you can get the latest android authority
videos as soon as we release them also
don't forget that all of these
applications are linked up in the video
description below just in case you want
to check them out as always thanks for
watching everybody and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
