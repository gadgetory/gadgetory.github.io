authority what's going on everybody and
today we're taking a look at kyocera
hydro series right here we have the
hydro extreme if I could just find the
power button there there we go and over
on the right side we have the hydro edge
now these are both waterproof phones
hence the name hydro oops went over to
messaging there and these are coming to
prepaid markets in the US in the coming
months this one in particular the
kyocera hydro extreme is coming to US
cellular even at the end of this week
and what we have here is a is more of a
mid-range phone sporting a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core processor it is running
jellybean 4.1 which I'll show you right
here I believe we can do the yep there
you go jellybean 4.1 point2 and the
screen on here is a four-inch screen at
wvga resolution so obviously with
mid-range specs you're not getting too
big of a screen but for many people that
is not going to matter as you can see it
goes through its elements pretty well
it's able to run pretty much everything
that Android has to offer so you will be
able to get a good experience no matter
what coming around the back over here
you'll see the 5 megapixel camera and
this rugged more ruggedized rather
textured plastic back gives it a nice
feel and of course in the hand with a
smaller form factor you will get a nice
handling on the phone this is definitely
a far cry from the 5 inch screens that
we're seeing these this this year but
four inches for a lot of users is still
more than enough for a good experience
this is shock resistant as well as being
water-resistant and we're going to show
you the waterproofing in a little bit
but yeah we're going to go ahead and
move over to the hydro edge which is a
little bit less in on tour in terms of
the specs and the mid-range extreme all
you have on the edge instead is a dual
core 1 gigahertz processor you are still
running jellybean 4.1 point2 on here
which I'll show you is
here just kind of tap on the android
version and there it is jellybean 4.1
point to the battery on this is 1600
milliamp hours as opposed to the 2,000
milliamp hour battery found in the
extreme again this is water resistant as
it is a hydrophone coming around the
back you have a 5 megapixel camera as
well on the back as well as a bit of a
tapered look with the top a little bit
higher up than the bottom portion right
here again it is a 4 inch screen wvga
resolution on both of these phones you
do get 4 gigabytes of onboard memory and
1 gigabyte of RAM so as we said this is
more of a mid-range market for these two
phones but they are going to be good
soldiers as kyocera has been able to
have a lot of success with boost mobile
US cellular all of the prepaid markets
are available in the US this one in
particular the hydro edge will be coming
out on boost mobile sometime this summer
while the extreme will be coming out on
US cellular by the end of this week
alright and the last thing you kind of
want to take a look at here is one thing
that I have to mention before is that
when you're looking at this version of
Android it is pretty much stock Android
so you're getting a very similar
experience to the original jellybean 4.1
point2 so that's really cool to keep
things simplistic and also very usable
so what I have in my hand right here is
the hydro edge and this is the 3g
variant the hydro extreme as the 4g one
this is coming out on boost and sprint
what we wanted to show you real quick is
if you look at the screen here and i'll
have a shot coming up right now just
kind of highlighting it there's no
speaker hole at the top and the reason
why is because there's a technology in
here called the smart sonic receiver so
typical speakers or speaker grills that
are found on other phones use air
conduction in order to get the sound
into your ear however instead there is a
there's a transponder inside of here
that uses vibrations to vibrate to send
vibrations actually through the tissue
of your hair to create a bitter sound
there's not really much of a way to to
show it to you on video right now but
basically if you have the phone covering
your ear not only are you going to get
that air conduction from certain parts
of the screen but also the entire screen
will vibrate the tissues in your ear in
order to create the sound straight to
your eardrum
for an even better sound whether or not
the call quality is better than even
some noise canceling traditional phone
grills are is kind of up for debate but
I will tell you this when you have the
phone pressed up against your ear it
does create a very nice and loud sound
so that's just one of the last features
I wanted to go through so once again
this is we're here at kyocera at ctia
2013 and we just took a look at the two
hydrophones in the hydro line the
extreme and the edge we'll see you on
the floor at ctia 2013 is Joshua Vergara
i'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
