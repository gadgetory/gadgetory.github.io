S flagship the Samsung Galaxy S nine is
Java gara what's going on everybody
and we're here to take a look at
Samsung's latest device and tell you
everything that it brings to the table
considering this is the ninth generation
of an already high powered line of
smartphones
now when you look back on at the Galaxy
S 8 and in some ways even the Galaxy S
seven were already wonderful in their
own ways and they delivered a number of
different features that a lot of smart
phones have now and what the Galaxy S
nine Samsung is trying to continue that
trend but we wouldn't be surprised if it
was a little bit difficult which is why
it was almost surprising to us that when
we left our meeting taking a look at
this phone for the time that we did we
actually still had a lot to talk about
when it comes to the design language
it's all pretty much the same with the
glass on glass design but there is this
lilac purple color that you're already
seeing in this video and yes we'll talk
about in a second but there are two
lenses on the back of this Galaxy S 9
plus that I'm using for the majority of
this video now the overall footprint for
these phones remains the same as before
however the screen has been tweaked a
little bit we don't really have a
close-up of it but the screens don't
really bleed all the way over to the
edges anymore this is still the infinity
display of what Samsung wanted to
minimize the potential accidental
touches that you'll have on the sides
when holding the phone in one hand on
top of that the Super AMOLED screen is
made just that tiny bit brighter so it's
something that you might notice
especially in broad daylight but when
you go around the body of the device
that you realize there are a couple of
key changes the first one we'll talk
about and is one you probably saw
already is the fingerprint reader it is
now below the camera package and that
makes it easier to reach with your index
finger no matter which way you slice it
this is better for anyone that wants to
use their fingerprints as the main way
of unlocking the device however Samsung
is obviously moving towards other
biometric meters like for example using
the face scanner or the iris scanner and
this time putting them together into
what they call the intelligent scan
basically you're going to scan both your
face and your eyes and at any given time
if it's not able to use one of the
measures they will use the other so that
you always have a way of unlocking the
phone while you're just looking at it
and in case you're wondering yes the
headphone jack still remains but right
next to it and past the USB type-c port
is a new speaker and the reason for that
is because that's one of two speakers
yes stereo speakers are now available on
the galaxy s 9 and they are certified by
Dolby Atmos they get really loud and we
did a small comparison compared to the
single speaker of the galaxy s 8 and the
sound is just louder richer and fuller
and underneath the surface you get all
of the bits and pieces that you would
expect
a bit of connectivity the snapdragon 845
is the bump up in performance and you
also get six gigabytes of ram on the
larger s9 + putting it that little step
above the original smaller model the
batteries are all the same as well from
before you have 3000 milliamp hours in
the smaller unit and 3500 in the bigger
one but that brings us to what was
really considered here in the new
version of Samsung's Galaxy s flagship
the camera you're going to hear a lot
about this camera because we actually
think that this new feature that we're
about to talk about is something all
manufacturers will be trying to do in
the future and that is adding a hardware
mechanical iris photo purists will
probably like the fact that software is
not dictating everything anymore as
there's a bit of hardware actually I
work here if you look closely the iris
or the aperture is actually opening and
closing there is an iris in there that
goes at F 1.5 aperture which is
incredible for low-light performance but
then it can also close down to F 2.4 if
you want to have a wider focus like for
landscape scenes for example consider
for a second that F 1.5 is still better
than the F 1.7 that we had in previous
models including the Galaxy Note 8 and
speaking of that you have these
enhancements in the main camera on top
of the telephoto lens at F 2.4 that
comes from the note 8 and is available
on the s 9 plus now Samsung's processing
is also getting a bump up here with
multi frame image processing the S 9
comes with D Ram on the actual camera
module so that it's able to store a
number of different images that are
processed for detail colors contrast and
noise in a split instant the camera
takes 12 images that are sorted into
batches of four and the software then
uses all the detail and information to
produce the noise overall this happens a
few different times gets three different
best photos and then does it one more
time so that those three photos become
one final incredible photo that DRM is
also used for super slow motion video
which is a fun addition that we already
have some fun using during our meeting
at 720p resolution you now have 960
frames per second capture but what
Samsung tried to do is make it easier by
adding in an auto mode where the camera
will figure out when the motion is
happening so it knows when to capture
that super high-speed recording
and if you have any an emoji Envy then
Samsung has brought their own version of
something like that called the AR emoji
the camera captures a face and then
creates a sort of caricature of that
person a little bit like a bitmoji if
you're a snapchat avid user and that AR
emoji can be customized with a number of
different hairstyles from a plethora of
different colors different eyewear
different pieces of clothing and can be
cater to the users desire when you hit
say if it saves all of the options and
you can use the front-facing camera in
order to do an AR like Avatar where when
you move your head and you move parts of
your face the AR emoji does it all - it
also saves something like 18 gifts to
the phone's gallery so that you can
easily share a number of different
emojis literally to your friends the
camera also helps enhance bigsby a bit
as bixby has been updated to provide
some better augmented reality
experiences like for example live
translation has been given some
enhancements but one thing that we did
see here is the ability to recognize
food now it might not be super accurate
all the time at one point it thought
that the bagel spread was ice cream but
we can see where that might be a little
bit confusing so it seems that Samsung
really put their work into addressing
the main parts of a phone that people
want the media consumption experience is
already great with the infinity display
but now the sound experience is even
better we're looking forward to putting
some high-powered headphones into that
headphone jack and seeing how it sounds
when you just want some private
listening time after that you have the
camera which is bolstered to have even
more fun modes and that AR emoji is
great for anyone that wants to fully
express themselves in very unique ways
and with all of the power and
performance that these phones already
had you're just getting more of that in
the S 9 including with Bigsby and Google
assistant both in there so you can have
your own AI available at the ready three
colors of this powerful phone will be
made available in the US midnight black
lilac purple and coral blue there's a
titanium gray but it's not coming to the
US it's not really a certain how much
they will cost just yet but we want to
be surprised if they get a little bit
close to that $1,000 mark and the
pre-orders will start on March 2nd ahead
of it going on sale on March 16th if you
happen to have a more recent Samsung
device or even just a recent phone in
general you could get the deepest
discount on there by trading in that
phone and getting up to three hundred
and fifty dollars off the latest device
and you might want to check it out
because Sam
might once again be pioneering another
movement in the smartphone camera game
especially with its hardware and
mechanical additions that really excite
us but then we're gonna go ahead and
pose the question off to you what do you
think of the galaxy s 9 and the s 9 plus
let us know in the comments down below
and our top comments might get mentioned
in a future piece while we are here in
Barcelona for Mobile World Congress let
us know what you think of this phone of
all of the announcements at MWC and
sound off in the comments below so that
we can see what you guys think of these
great phones that are coming out in 2018
