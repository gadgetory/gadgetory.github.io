welcome back to Google Play weekly this
week we're going to talk about a lot of
huge changes to the Google Play Store a
new FIFA game a new angry birds game and
a whole lot more so let's get to it
first up this week angry birds
transformers got a soft release any few
select countries this is becoming the
normal thing to do for rovio because
they've done this with their last few
launches right now you can get the game
in New Zealand and Finland and there are
reports that it's coming to Australia
and Canada soon if they don't have them
already the game is set to launch on
October 15th and I guess those of us who
don't live in those countries will find
out at the game as any good then late
last week the game voxel brush hosted an
android vs apple competition which i
thought was pretty cool for those who
are wondering naturally android one the
winners got free in-game currency and
one lucky android gamer got an Nvidia
shield tablet as the event was sponsored
by Nvidia I know it's not the most
exciting news but I really like this
idea it gave fans of either platform a
chance to defend their platforms on her
in a way that wasn't silly fanboys trash
talking on social media and on blog
posts I really hope more games do this
because it was a lot of fun occupy
central activists in Hong Kong we're
using a really unique way to communicate
that really couldn't be hacked all that
easily but that doesn't mean people
didn't try the application they've all
been using is called fire chat this is a
unique chat application because it uses
a Bluetooth connection to send messages
instead of data and cell networks which
means it can't be hacked using the
conventional means which was pretty cool
however there was an attempt to get
protestors to download an application
called code for HK which is a known
group of activists developers turns out
code for HK didn't actually write this
application no one is positive on who
did but those familiar with the matter
have their guesses earlier this week
google announced a new video ads
platform that's supposed to make video
adds a little bit more enjoyable i can
already hear your collective groaning so
i will pause for a moment to let you get
your grown out ok does everyone feel
better now these new video ads are
apparently configurable dependent on the
size of the screen this means more
engaging ads that actually fit on your
mobile stuff instead of poorly optimized
as this stretch and look terrible I know
it's not a popular thing but developers
got to make money somehow and this is
about their only option if they want to
offer their app for free it'll suck for
some people and others won't mind it so
much but this is something
that is happening so we might as well
get used to it last up this week the
google play store now shows developers
addresses as well as in-app purchase
prices this is both awesome and
bittersweet indie developers are very
unhappy about the addresses thing
because they usually code from home and
don't want to use their home addresses
in public which is totally
understandable on the other side of
things in-app purchase prices can now be
seen in the Google Play Store however it
doesn't show each item and it's really
just a vague number that shows the
minimum and maximum prices I really
think Google could have done better here
but at least it's something so who wants
to see some trending applications as
usual if you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the written companion which is in the
video description below first up this
week is FIFA 15 Ultimate Team this is
the successor to the widely popular fifa
14 franchise and thus has things like
improved graphics more teams more
players and more stuff to do it's free
to play with in-app purchases but some
people have had troubles with the
servers early on we're sure that'll get
worked out eventually with flexi
keyboard got an update this last week
that gave it more language support a new
theme and it was also released to the
amazon appstore and the Samsung App
Store the update also fixed a variety of
bugs and has improved the performance of
a bunch of features it's free to demo
and 399 to buy if you're interested the
official TiVo app was updated this last
week and with it came one big feature
you can stream shows you have recorded
on your tebow to your android phone and
tablets this is a big deal because it
brings tebow into the modern age of
mobility which is only a good thing now
if they just do something about all
those user complaints the cosmos browser
was released this last week for those
who may not know is the browser
everyone's been talking about that
browses the web using SMS instead of
data it's in beta right now and it's
only available in the United States
however we're really excited about this
project because it has a lot of
potential blast up this week is a unique
application called horizon using this
application you can shoot horizontal
video no matter how you hold your device
pretty much everyone hates videos that
are in the wrong orientation and really
everyone hates vertical videos with the
two big black bars on the side this app
apparently fixes all of those problems
it does have some bugs but it is free to
use so there is no harm in trying it out

greatest in android app news and reviews
