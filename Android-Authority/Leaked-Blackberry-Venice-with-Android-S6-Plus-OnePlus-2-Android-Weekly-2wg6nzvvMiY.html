brought to you by domain.com oh it's
been a serious geek week here at Android
Authority because we got leaks on the
Galaxy s6 edge plus the oneplus 2 and
we've got something for all you
crackberries out there alright let's
start with the galaxy s6 plus a rumored
samsung galaxy s6 edge+ has been all the
hype this past week when a trademark
filing for the device leaked now we have
a bevy of images and details that
provide ample evidence the device
actually exists let's take a look the
first evidence showed up in the form of
a leaked samsung galaxy s6 edge+ case
now that alone really doesn't tell us
that much but it does give us some form
of proof that the device is indeed in
the works it really looks just like a
samsung galaxy s6 edge case except
bigger if this rumors to be believed it
suggests the smartphone may sport a 5.5
inch screen that's a pretty good size
upgrade over the original galaxy s6 edge
5.1 inch display yet it's still not too
large to make it unbearable now if you
needed further proof we found this from
the united states patent and trademark
office memo android and blackberry
they're having a baby soon after the
information surfaced about the ATT bound
blackberry Venice evleaks posted yet
another piece of insightful information
on Twitter this time containing a leaked
render of the supposed device what's
most notable from the renders that the
blackberry Venice looks like it's
running a full build of Android not a
forked version of the OS like we've seen
with the Amazon fire phone as you can
see here there are also google apps
installed on the device meaning users
can have access to everything in the
Google Play Store on the hardware front
the Venice is shown sporting a single
front-facing speaker below the screen
which many users will likely appreciate
down below we have a micro USB port and
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack nothing
too out of the ordinary but what isn't
shown off in the render is the slide-out
keyboard that we've heard so much about
over the past few weeks the keyboard
will likely be one of Venice's biggest
selling points among consumers so
hopefully another render will show up
sporting a glimpse of it sometimes
to really a tactile keyboard in 2015 hmm
for all u 1 plus fans let's talk the
oneplus 2 and all its supposed unibody
liciousness there's certainly no
shortage of 1 plus 2 rumors floating
around especially because the official
unveiling of the device is only a few
short weeks away it's already been
confirmed that the new phone will come
with a fingerprint scanner a Snapdragon
810 2.1 processor and a USB type-c port
though we have yet to hear anything
official on the devices chassis just
yesterday however one plus is CEO Pete
Lau teased in his weibo account that
they 1 plus 2 may in fact come with an
all metal design taking a look at the
render we can see that the device
closely resembles the HTC One m8 and the
m9 with it's all metal chassis aside
from the materials though were not
seeing much that stands out and rear
facing camera a volume rocker on the
right hand side as well as the standard
3.5 millimeter headphone jack on top
although the render isn't the best
quality league we've ever seen it still
may give us a glimpse of what's to come
with 1 plus his next flagship this is
jason calacanis he's the host of this
week in startups he's also a famous
angel tech investor and he says that the
first test that he gives potential
startups is choosing their domain name
it is hard to find a quality domain name
in a dot-com extension and he says if
they can solve that problem they've
demonstrated they know something about
business why because no domain name
extension tells your story with the same
level of trust as a.com or.net domain
name dot com and.net domain name
extensions and Jack credibility in to
your online presence and who doesn't
want more credibility you can say
