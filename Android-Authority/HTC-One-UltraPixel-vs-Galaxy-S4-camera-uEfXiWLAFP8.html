Authority two of the latest hottest and
most powerful Android smartphones are
the Samsung Galaxy s4 and the HTC One as
expected these Android Titans come not
just with awesome displays and
processing power but also with
interesting cameras and camera features
in this video join me and looking at the
Galaxy S Force and HTC One S camera more
closely between the two the galaxy s4
seems to have the better camera thanks
to its sweet sounding hardware specs by
Mir pixel can alone it seems to have a
big head start over the HTC One 13
megapixels in all
meanwhile don't be too quick to demean
the HTC one slow megapixel count just
yet HTC takes pride in its new ultra
pixel camera a 4 megapixel shooter yeah
small right but with larger pixel size
for capturing more light both cameras
can reach up to 4 times digital
magnification and can record 1080p full
HD videos the HTC One though has optical
image stabilization while the s4 uses
digital image stabilization which of the
two cameras provide quality photos and
videos will answer that question later
for now let's first talk briefly about
the camera interface and features on
both phones the galaxy s4 inherits some
of the camera interface elements from
the Galaxy camera button layout is
similar both also use the camera mode
Castle and the shade 4 preset filters
there are new buttons menus and filter
presets - meanwhile the HTC one's camera
UI resembles that of its predecessors
only a few changes have been made to the
camera UI for instance the toggle button
for HTC Zoe is placed prominently along
the same side as the flash toggle and
the Settings button so what do the two
cameras have in store Furze quite a lot
actually both cameras offer several
filters and effects that you can apply
immediately to your photo as you are
snapping it the HTC one has a longer
list of effects and filters but we've
already seen them on HTC phones such as
the One X or even the HTC Sensation but
that's not a bad thing at all in fact
HTC's effects and filters produce really
cool looking photos though I personally
find the filters and effects on the
galaxy s4 more interesting and more fun
one thing I like about them is that each
filter thumbnail acts as a mini preview
of that effect it actually looks cool
and I like it a lot aside from camera
effects and filters there are also the
various shooting modes that make camera
use convenient and fun let's look at the
galaxy s4 first the galaxy s4 includes
shooting modes that first debuted in
Samsung's other earlier releases but
there are a few new modes and features
- drama mode is one new feature it
captures several photos of a moving
subject and combines them resulting in a
dramatic portrayal of an action another
new feature is animated photo for
capturing a still photo with some of its
parts animated it's a cool effect eraser
shot is a new handy feature the phone
tries to detect moving or unwanted
objects in the background of the photo
and lets you remove the unwanted objects
sound and shot is an interesting concept
it captures a still photo and records a
few seconds of the background sound at
the same time dual shot is also another
interesting feature it captures photos
and videos using the front and back
cameras at the same time lastly there's
auto night detection which detects slow
lighting and adjusts camera settings to
capture clear and well exposed photos
without firing the flash those are some
of the fun and interesting new features
of the galaxy s4 camera
what about shooting modes and features
on the HTC One on the HTC One you get
exactly the same bunch of features from
previous HTC releases plus one new and
interesting camera mode known as HTC Zoe
HTC Zoe reportedly leverages the HTC
ultra pixel camera by capturing up to 20
still photos in very quick succession
plus a three-second mp4 video the
resulting image set and video are
collectively known as a Zoe Zoe's in the
gallery app appear as animated
thumbnails you can playback Zoe's if you
like you can even select and export a
single frame from a Zoe from out of a
Zoe you can also create something
similar to the S Force drama mode shots
best face shots and eraser mode shots
just tap on the retouch button for the
drama mode shot choose sequence shots
for the best face shot choose always
smile and for eraser mode shot choose
object remove remember to save your
edited work before moving on to
comparing actual image samples let me
tell you a bit about video recording on
the two phones both phones can record
1080p full-hd videos as well as slow
motion and fast motion videos
the s4 can capture slow-mo in
high-definition
but the HTC one downsizes the resolution
to 768 by 432 both can capture fast
motion videos in 1080p full-hd the HTC
one though has an advantage it can't
capture 1080p full HD videos with high
dynamic range or HDR on the s4 HDR is
available only for photos via the rich
tone shooting mode now let's find the
proof in the pudding and compare the
output quality of these cameras we took
photos in various settings to see how
each camera performed the image sets can
be divided into four general categories
studio shots indoor shots daytime
outdoor shots and nighttime outdoor
shots first let's begin with a semi
controlled environment inside a
makeshift studio our goal was to compare
image quality of photos captured with
the same amount of lighting and across
various ISO speed ratings this first set
used auto ISO settings the Samsung folio
is sharp and vibrant and uses a standard
4 to 3 aspect ratio the HTC photo has
somewhat subdued colors with greenish
bluish tint uses the 16 to 9 aspect
ratio and has a wider field of view
here's the second set using ISO 100 the
Samsung Photos still captured rich and
vibrant colors some parts of the HTC
photo are slightly clearer and less
washed out than its auto ISO version the
differences in this batch are nearly the
same as in the previous batch this third
set uses ISO 800 which is the maximum
setting for the s4 although noise and
grain become perceptible on the Samsung
photo it still captured rich and vibrant
colors
the HTC photo was still subdued and has
some greenish hue quite similar to its
auto ISO version after some fiddling
with HTC photos exif data we found that
the photo was taken at ISO 1 to 5
instead of ISO 800 we also tried
snapping an image at ISO 1600 on the HTC
one but the phone continued to insist on
using ISO 125
to compare the quality of images snapped
under dim lighting we took indoor photos
a little natural outdoor light was
available through a nearby window but no
house light was on the galaxy s4 image
size was set to 13 megapixels with a 4
to 3 aspect ratio at HTC one to 4
megapixels with 16 to 9 aspect ratio
here's the first batch of indoor photos
shot in normal or auto mode the HTC once
photo came out brighter and less noisy
but observe the textured background more
closely it looks smooth and out on HTC
one but seems sharper and more detailed
on the s4 photo onto the next batch of
indoor shots this time using flash
here's the HTC one photo
it shows some yellowish tinge but the
colors are preserved and appear
realistic and this one's from the s4 it
has some bluish tint because of the
flash here's the last set of indoor
shots these were shot in night mode
night mode surely helped the s4 snap a
clearer and brighter photo of the HTC
One night mode seems to negatively
affect quality as it produced a grainy
photo with subdued colors
Photography is all about lighting that's
why the time outdoor photos often turn
out awesome but even under bright
lighting some cameras just produce more
awesome than others which of these
phones gives more awesome here our
daytime outdoor photos shot in Auto mode
both phones used the highest image
resolution using a 16 to 9 aspect ratio
this means 9 megapixels on s4 and 4
megapixels on HTC One as expected both
images came out sharp crisp and well lit
the HTC ones image came out a little bit
overexposed and washed out though it had
a wider field of view we also tested the
digital zoom capability of the two
phones here's the s4 photo of a subject
zoomed to maximum and here's the one
from the HTC One samsung photo caught
more details than the HTC one thanks to
a higher megapixel count many people
love photographing objects up close so
we took some sample close-up and macro
shots first the results the one on the
left is from the s4 the one on the right
is from the HTC One the HTC photo has
sharper contrast resulting in a clearer
view of the subject but also making the
colors too vivid it was also able to
blur out the background a bit the
samsung photo seems to have struck a
nice balance of contrast and sharpness
resulting in a clear and realistic image
take note that the galaxy s4 doesn't
have macro mode we also recorded some
sample Clips to check the quality of
outdoor video recording interestingly in
these sample Clips the s4 s digital
image stabilization seems to perform
much better than the HTC ones optical
image stabilization the s4 video appears
more stable and shows less shake and
less jitter colors on the s4 video also
seem to be more realistic compared to
the contrast and colors on the HTC video
we stumbled upon this refreshing side of
water spreading and gushing upwards then
cascading down into a pool we took some
photos just to see how well the phone's
captured photos of moving subjects both
images came out while Expo
crisp but I like the galaxy s4's image
better because it appeared crunchy err
sharper and realistically coloured it
also maintained focus the HTC photo
appeared washed out and slightly
overexposed it also lost some focus on
some part of the image and we also
grabbed the chance to test the two
cameras slow-motion recording the HTC
One can do slow-mo only at 768 by 432
pixels but the Galaxy s4 can do up to
1280 by 720 High Definition most users
avoid taking pictures at night because
the photos tend to be noisy and darker
that's because of the lack of adequate
lighting but are things two phones able
to produce night photos with acceptable
quality here's a set of outdoor images
taken at night the cameras were a normal
or Auto mode trying to brighten up the
images the s4 and HTC one ramped up
their ISO levels result bright yet noisy
images as shown by the overpowering
bright lights from street lamps and
nearby buildings in this set the
background lights drown out the tree
outlines on the HTC photo but such
outlines are perceptible on the samsung
photo here's a second set using night
mode night mode helped brighten up the
photos a bit but didn't solve the noise
issue the background lights on the HTC
photo appeared to intensify and finally
a third set using HDR mode on both
cameras the bright background lights on
the s4 photo seemed to mellow down a bit
but noise is still present the s4 image
actually seems to have balanced the
lighting levels quite better than the
HTC one did the HTC photo became noisier
and had some eerie glow for the
background lights so far I've shown you
sample photos of scenery shot at night
what about closer shots of objects here
are some sample close-ups of an object
this first set used auto or normal mode
the HTC photo appears dimmer and darker
the s4 photo captured more light and
more detail we enabled flash thinking
that it could help with the lighting
deficiency both photos still came out
dim but the flash did throw in some
extra light to make the subject more
visible and clearer the Samsung photo
came out
with a bluish tint and a bit overexposed
the HTC photo came out dimmer but the
subject was definitely visible and clear
and not too much of the light from the
flash bounced off the subjects body
finally we checked how well the two
phones can record videos at night the
galaxy s4 produced a darker noisier and
softer video than the video from the HTC
One in terms of image stabilization
though I find the galaxy s4 clip
smoother the HTC clip has more jitter
and looks more shaky many people buy
Android phones not just for the phone
features but also for multimedia
features such as photo and video
capturing the galaxy s4 is 13 megapixel
camera offers a good balance among
Hardware camera features and output
quality it became my personal choice
after we did the photo and video tests
yet the HTC ones 4 megapixel ultra pixel
camera is not to be easily dismissed
either it does perform well in many of
the test settings that we tried it seems
to perform quite well in low-light
environments and HTC Zoe is quite an
intriguing new feature offering
flexibility though I find it a bit too
roundabout what about you on the basis
of camera power which is your preferred
Android phone the Samsung Galaxy s4 or
the HTC one let us know in the comments
