picking up and the first bit of news is
a leak from Samsung
the Samsung decks pad a rumored Samsung
accessory has leaked in some render
images the peripheral is expected to
launch a longside the galaxy s 9 and
allow it to connect to a computer
monitor mouse and keyboard for a desktop
like experience the pictures were
published by evey leaks and a tweet last
week giving us potentially the first
look at the new accessories design now
you can see for yourself it's a little
bit different and design from last
year's model but what it will mean for
actual real world use we'll have to wait
and see and we also sniffed out some
very interesting news about Google the
search giant is apparently entering into
the game streaming service interesting
anonymous informants who claim to have
inside knowledge at Google are reporting
that the company is secretly working on
a streaming service focused on gaming
codenamed Yeti the service would
ostensibly enable gaming without
downloading software or buying physical
media other details are vague at the
moment but it wouldn't be too surprising
if this turned out to be true Google has
repeatedly played around with the idea
of getting into the hundred and five
billion dollar gaming industry and its
continued emphasis on being part of the
home would make a gaming service a no
brainer now this really isn't Google's
expertise it isn't their wheelhouse but
dang they certainly do have a lot of
resources to throw into this so what do
you think do you think they could be
successful at gaming service or will
this turn out to be another Google Plus
now this is good news for those of us
who've always wanted to regram a public
post to our own story on Instagram
according to TechCrunch Instagram is
giving a small percentage of users
access to a new regram feature
essentially you can share and add public
feed posts from other users to your
story as you can see in the video here
not only can you resize it but you can
also edit it by adding stickers or
drawing on it before posting of course
you have the option to disable others
from sharing your posts in the app
settings like me do you like ultra thin
phone cases if so you just need
protection against everyday wear and
tear and our sponsor has super-thin
cases price just right for all major
phones
goto minimal case comm use our coupon
code a a 20 and get 20% off an already
sweet deal
