Authority what's going on everybody and
I'm here to bring you something on
Android authority that well we wanted to
make sure we gave you a drop test
because it's that time of year we're
here in Australia not Hong Kong like we
did in the past to drop the iPhone and
iPhone 7 plus iphone 7 iphone 7 plus but
we did that over on tap time so make
sure you head on over to see how that
drop test 1 but we wanted to make sure
we had something for you guys so I'm
actually gonna be dropping a Samsung
Galaxy Note 7 now I know there are a lot
of jokes about this phone and maybe I'm
a little bit afraid that it'll blow up
if I drop it but the overwhelming odds
are that's not going to happen so we're
gonna go ahead and drop this so that we
have a drop test for you guys so why
don't we go in and get started so you
already know how it goes we have the
standard drop test and then maybe
depending on what the results are we
might do a second-tier using one of our
taller colleagues Chris Carlin but as
you know already we're going to drop it
onto its back on to its side usually the
bottom portion right here where the S
Pen is and of course onto its face which
is usually where we find some real
damage all the cameras are already
rolling so I'm gonna go ahead and get
started with the first test dropping it
right onto its back
all right camera is rolling on the phone
working perfectly fine as we drop it
onto its back in three two and one got a
nice bounce off of that - well it fell
pretty squarely onto its back and then
it bounced up did a nice little flip and
fell right on its back again so the
camera still works fine obviously we
don't have any problems with the screen
let's take a look at the backing now we
have dual glass backing switch or dual
glass rather on the front and back
meaning that we could get cracks across
the board but so far it's looking pretty
good so we have the black version of the
Galaxy Note 7 in the hand right now so
it might be a little bit tough to see if
there are any blemishes or scuffs but so
far that's simply not the case so you
don't really have to worry too much so
far with the Galaxy Note 7 in our first
drop for this test all right well the
camera is still working so everything is
still operational
I'll leave the camera recording
throughout this one right now as we drop
it onto its bottom so what
go and do that right now three two one
bye-bye all right hopefully the cameras
were able to catch that and the camera
of the note seven is still recording
which is great so screen is perfectly
fine obviously so we have the screen
there and as I look around the phone one
really good scuff on the bottom which is
exactly where it fell so and there you
go with this darker metal frame it is a
little bit tougher to see all of the
elements and in this case the one scuff
that is right on the corner here it does
make it so that you can feel it's no
longer very smooth but that's about it
everything else is operational so far on
the note seven what the camera is still
recording me even after two drops all
right well so far so good we got two
drops out of the three in our
traditional drop test the camera is
still going so nice a little selfie
video right here but I'm gonna stop it
and go to the other camera because we're
doing the face drop so let's do this
right now we're gonna go ahead and drop
it onto its face so you can see me in
the camera right now all right moment of
truth let's see what happens with the
screen of the note seven when I drop it
in three two and one it was nice of it
to bounce right back up so that I could
see if anything happened and so far it
looks like we're all good
there's the camera and there's an arrive
again and there's me everything seems to
be fine we do have a couple of scuffs on
the top that I'll show you in a second
but the screen looks perfectly fine we
definitely have a blemish at the top of
the screen that's probably where it
landed it wasn't the flattest drop that
I kind of wanted but even then it was a
good impact and it caused that little
blemish up top the phone survived the
traditional drop test so we have to go a
little bit untraditional just like with
the lgb 20 and if you go over to tab
times you can see the iPhone 7 and 7
plus being dropped from it even higher
height thanks to this guy this is a lot
taller than me you can reach a lot
higher than me drop tests onto its back
first one of these three and three two
and one
on the front again but we already have
some results hey guys I hope you can't
see it but there are cracks down here
the screen is damaged
alright well after the original test we
didn't have any problems but now we have
some really big ones we have a few
spider webs down here because I think
that's where it landed instead of its
back then we have a large crack across
the bottom of the device so let's take a
look at it a little bit closer up in
this angle up here as we always say in
these drop tests drops or random even
though we wanted to make it land flat on
its back that sometimes won't happen and
if you ever drop your phone of course
you won't be able to control how it
drops so we were able to basically see
that here and thanks to that the bottom
portion of the screen is correct with a
bunch of spiderwebs some very large
cracks that are permeating throughout
the bottom half of the screen and
actually I can feel a bit of a prick
from how I'm holding it definitely got
to be careful with this phone now
alright moving right on to the bottom
test we're gonna drop it right onto its
bottom in three two and one
it's a little better yes s-pen S Pen
came out just a little bit but let's see
if there's any more damage to the screen
because I mean they're already cracks it
could just get worse and it did not get
worse thankfully but the S Pen did pop
out just a little bit but that's an easy
fix just get it right back into place
let's take a look at some of the other
damage I might have happened but we do
get one new scuff on the bottom corner
which is probably why the S Pen popped
out like that but that's an easy fix and
after that we still have all of the
cracks camera is still running so we
still have the front-facing camera
recording me even talking about this and
there are all these same scratches that
we had from the previous test so so far
it's the cracked screen that we're
mostly really bummed out about
the screens already broken now we're
just gonna drop it right on its face
again or good do something else well the
funny thing is I wonder if we should
just do a regular front-facing test that
way it will land on its back because
clearly so we're gonna try dropping on
its back see if we could get a nice flat
drop on the back because it is a glass
backing which could break I mean after
all the screens broken already so let's
wait when we going to do that all right
we have the final test doing a back test
again because the screen is already
broken in three two and one that was on
the back that was much better
that was much much better but the back
it's totally fine the back is totally
fine it did land on its face again but
just taking a look at the back yeah it
looks fine there's a tiny little crack
on the bottom here that I'll show you in
a close-up but yeah it's still oh well
the camera stopped recording else I can
tell you that but let's hit record there
front is still broken bottom half of the
screen is still cracked up to hell and
unfortunately that means that this phone
is still operational but probably not
one you want to use there is a very tiny
crack on the bottom part of the backing
probably where it kind of landed but for
the most part the backing is fine again
it's all about that screen there's a lot
of glass on this phone and we kind of
expected that to happen anyway but it's
a little bit unfortunate still the thing
is the device is still fully functional
it's just that you probably don't want
to be using this phone when you have a
crack screen like that the s-pen is
still okay and the camera was running
for most of the test so all of that was
okay but still you're gonna want to get
this glass at least replaced or in our
case so maybe this phone is gonna get
recalled anyway so we'll get a
replacement at some point so thankfully
for that we were able to use this for
our drop test with the galaxy note 7
keep it tuned to Android authority for
all of the best coverage and remember to
head on over to tab times and their
YouTube channel to see the iPhone 7 the
iPhone 7 plus those drop tests and of
course all the coverage revolving around
the iPhone 7 line and then you can stick
around here because of course we are
your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
