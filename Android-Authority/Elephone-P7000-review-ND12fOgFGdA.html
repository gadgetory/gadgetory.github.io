Randall authority now the competition
amongst the smaller Chinese OEM is
certainly heating up over the last year
I've reviewed several devices by le
phone and today we're going to be
looking at their latest offering the
early phone P 7000 in an attempt to
distinguish itself from the myriad of
plastic low-end phones coming out of
China le phone has put some extra effort
into the design of the P 7000 first of
all it includes a metal bezel which
instantly gives the phone a high-end
look and feel the bezel is made of
magnesium which le phone set has great
strength and lightness now I hadn't
heard of his particular hallow myself
but a quick bit of research reveals that
it is an aluminium alloy with magnesium
and small amounts of copper nickel and
tin although more expensive than
aluminium it is indeed known for its
strength and low density elephone points
out that the use of a metal bezel means
the p7000 won't bend in your pocket and
that the Magnolia
also has good electromagnetic shielding
characteristics another interesting
aspect of the P 7000 design is its range
of colours out is the standard black and
in our gold white and cool grey on the
front of the device is the 5.5 inch full
HD display the front-facing camera an
earpiece and the HOME key integrated
into the home key is a breathing pulsing
LED which can be configured in the
software to change color when you have
notifications messages and calls on the
left and right of the home key are the
menu and back keys respectively but
there aren't any actual marking on the
phone however this is less troubling
than you might think since I already
know where the buttons should be and I
tap there instinctively however for new
users coming to Android for the first
time this might be a little difficult
down the right-hand side is the power
button while the volume rocker is on the
left both are easily accessible when the
phone is held in your left hand on the
top you'll find the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and the microUSB port on
the bottom are two speaker grilles
however there is only one speaker
flipping the phone over you will see the
prominent LFO logo the camera lens the
flash and the fingerprint reader the 5.5
inch display on the P 7000 is okay
but not brilliant
it is an IPS display with a resolution
of 1920 by 1080 and that works out at
400 PPI overall the definition is
excellent but the color reproduction is
fair to middling with colors lacking
vibrancy and the white sometimes seeming
pale having said that the viewing angles
are great the display is reasonable when
used indoors however I found that it
could do with being a bit brighter for
outdoor use on sunny days
as with most displays the lacks are
really only noticed when you place the
phone next to another device with a
better display however when used in
isolation the display seems to be more
than adequate it's just not stunning
it's also worth mentioning that in the
box is a toughened glass screen
protector not a piece of plastic you
stick over the display but an actual
piece of Gorilla Glass 3 the only
downside is that you need to stick it on
the phone yourself at the heart of the
p7000 is the mediatek mt6752 it is an
octa-core cortex a53 based processor
which is coupled with a mali t760 GPU a
quad-core version of the same processor
can be found in the early phone p6000
the mali t760 is certainly a powerful
GPU and while the cortex a53 has a lower
performance than the cortex a15 or even
the cortex a9 it is a good entry point
into 64-bit computing and it works well
with Android 5.0 lollipop one key thing
about the court is a53 is that it is
armed super power efficient 64-bit
processor and the mt6752 uses 8 of these
calls all clocked 1.7 gigahertz my
experience of using the P 7000 is that
overall the processing package is fast
the UI is smooth and rapid and
multitasking is a breeze due to the 3
gigabytes of on-board ram
overall the P 7000 handled everything I
asked of it including gaming and video
in terms of benchmarks the P 7000
managed to talk up a score of 53.4
frames per second on epics is Vil in
high quality mode and to to gives the P
7000 a score of 45,000 and 34 and it
measures score of 6,000 234 on 3d mark
ice storm extreme the phone comes with a
3400
50 million power battery which is a
great size for this device
since the P 7000 has a 5.5 inch display
then it made sense for le phone to use
that space for a bigger battery and I'm
glad to see they didn't go down the
ultra-thin path and sacrifice battery
capacity what my testing showed is that
the battery is great for this device it
will last all day that's from morning to
evening without any problems I ran my
customer set of tests on on one charge
to be able to play intensive 3d games
for at least five hours and for those of
you into multimedia you can get about
5.5 hours of YouTube streaming over
Wi-Fi in full HD the phone has a single
speaker on the bottom edge and over I
was quite impressed with the sound
quality considering this is a mid-range
phone however they'll expect the same
fidelity as you would from a high-end
flagship phone as music can sound tinny
and in general there is a lack of depth
in terms of internal stories the device
comes with 16 gigabytes of flash and has
own micro SD card slot which accepts
cards up to 64 gigabytes thankfully
unlike other media tech based devices
the storage isn't divided up and you get
access to the whole lot which is around
12 gigabytes once you leave space for
Android it's worth mentioning the p7000
does not have a gyroscope sensor but it
does have an accelerometer and the
result is that you can't use the phone
with Google cardboard or other VR
applications this phone has a 13
megapixel rear-facing camera and a 5
megapixel front-facing camera the sensor
in the rear facing camera is from Sony
and le phonus coupled it with a large F
2.0 aperture lens over all the pictures
are crisp but they seem to lack punch
even in good outdoor lighting using HDR
can help in some situations but it isn't
a cure-all
however the low-light pictures are much
better than I was anticipating the
combination of the F 2.0 aperture and
the support for ISO 1600 means that you
are able to take pictures without the
flash in many indoor situations however
the laws of physics still demand a
certain amount of light entering through
the lens so don't expect wonders for
those of you intervie do the rear camera
can capture at full HD at 30 frames per
second
the included camera app at first glance
looks like the standard open-source app
however it seems to offer a few more
features beyond HDR and panorama for
example the camera options include
anti-shake smile shot 40 picture
continuous shooting and auto scene
detection the video options include
noise reduction EW is and time-lapse
mode you can also change things like the
exposure level the scene type the white
balance face detection and so on overall
the app is fairly comprehensive and
includes some special modes like object
/ motion tracking if you'd like to see
some more sample shots then please check
out the written companion on Android or
thority calm the p7000 runs stock
Android 5
point-0 lollipop you get access to
Google Play and all of Google's services
like YouTube Gmail maps however most of
them are not installed by default the
device supports over-the-air updates and
since its official launch elephone has
made at least one new firmware release
however the default firmware on my
review device had a glitch and that
while it says it supports OTA update it
actually doesn't the phone checks for
the update and even downloads the new
software but when it comes to actually
updating I used to get the error your
system was damaged Wireless update has
been disabled although it sounds serious
the phone does actually continue to
function normally the solutions are down
at a new firmware and reflash the phone
after the reflash everything works as
expected a few days after I flashed on
the new firmware any phone released
another OTA patch and this one
downloaded and installed without any
problems the supplied version of
lollipop is basically stock Android with
the standard launcher and an app drawer
there are a few extras included for
things like the fingerprint reader the
posting notification LED known as the
Harlequin LED notification in the
settings and the screen of wake gestures
like double tap the fingerprint reader
is located on the back of the phone just
below the camera it is a 360-degree
reader which means it doesn't matter how
you place your finger on the sensor it
will still be able to read it and
recognize it this is particularly
important since most of the time you
will use the reader while using the
phone which means you can't see the
reader and depending on how you hold the
phone your finger will be placed on the
sensor at different angles
overall the sensor works well the number
of miss rate is actually quite low the
initial setup is quite easy and just
requires you to place your finger on the
reader several times until the
fingerprinted registered the default
security mechanism is for the
fingerprint unlock which only unlocks
the phone with your fingerprint and they
have it the a leaf own p7000 it costs
two hundred and thirty dollars and for
that you get a phone with a Magnolia
metal frame a fingerprint reader three
gigabytes of RAM full access to Google
Play an Android 5.0 lollipop well my
name is Gary Sims round or authority I
hope you enjoyed this video if you did
please give it a thumbs up also please
use the comment below to tell me what
you think about the elephone
p7000 also don't forget to check out
