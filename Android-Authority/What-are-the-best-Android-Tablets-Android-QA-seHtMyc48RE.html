Jace and one of the most common
questions we get here on Android QA is
what is the best Android tablet for 2014
well we'll give you a premium mid-tier
and entry level option let's get all
tablet happy here we go so what is the
best Android tablet on the market I'm
talking high-end premium level well in
my opinion that's got to be the Samsung
Galaxy Tab s for sexy and it's largely
about the AMOLED display why the AMOLED
displays such a big deal it's because
AMOLED as exemplified in the galaxy s5
is emerging as the best display
technology BarNone according to experts
at display mate the galaxy s5 has the
best display they've ever tested AMOLED
or LCD and this tablet has the same
display technology as the galaxy s5
moving in between applications using the
recent apps screen brought no issues at
all for Josh in his full review you also
have the multi window available if you
really need to multitask and it works as
well as you'd expect from a samsung
flagship Android device the Samsung
Galaxy Tab s 8.4 will be available at
the base price of 399 while it's bigger
brother the Galaxy Tab s 10.5 will be
coming in at $4.99 now for those of you
looking for a mid-range device I'd have
to suggest the LG G pad 8.3 the G pad is
a fairly attractive aluminum clad tablet
with an 8 point 3 inch 1920 by 1200 LCD
display as Snapdragon 600 CPU 2
gigabytes of RAM and plenty of
additional specs that make it a solid
option when compared to other 7 and 8
inch tablets even with the growing
number of processing intensive features
that LG baked into the Optima see why we
haven't come across any true stutter or
lag when perusing the G pad gamers will
be pleased to learn that demanding games
like dead trigger true pose no problem
with the G pad there's the usual
assortment of bells and whistles on the
G pad 8.3 with the notable exception of
NFC you do get however a micro SD card
slot located at the top behind the
plastic flap and an infrared blaster
that lets you control TVs and other
electronics the connectivity
options include dual-band Wi-Fi and LTE
but the latter is only available in some
markets for now primarily Europe now of
course we couldn't talk about Android
tablets at all without mentioning the
Nexus 7 2013 because for the price it is
a fantastic Android tablet now we've
noticed that the Nexus 7 2013 edition
has improved smoothness and speed over
the 2012 edition and speed is always a
good thing the 2013 edition has a
seven-inch LCD display with 1920 by 1200
resolution it runs a 1.5 quad-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor 30% wider
range of colors than the original Nexus
7 it has an Adreno 320 graphics card 2
gigabytes of RAM 16 to 32 gigabytes of
storage a 5 megapixel camera a 1.2
megapixel front-facing camera dual
speakers and a Bluetooth 4.0 pricing
starts at 229 for the base 16 gigabyte
model and 269 for the 32 gigabyte
version now of course a major factor for
any Android lovers that this is a nexus
device and therefore gets Android
updates before anybody else always good
