the original release of the Galaxy s4
now I was there when it was unveiled at
the unpacked media event in New York and
I got a chance to review the new
smartphone before it even hit store
shelves and since then I've been using
the galaxy s4 on the daily but do I feel
the same now as I did before
Hayek's Joshua card from Android 30
what's going on everybody and this is
the Samsung Galaxy s4 after the hype
let's begin with how I first felt and
still feel about the s4 for a phone with
a 5-inch screen it's one of the easiest
to handle a replaceable battery and
expandable memory are obvious pluses as
far as all of the new features were
concerned I thought they were all great
new ways of doing tasks we've done
before were they all practical well even
back then I knew some of them were more
like gimmicks than real game changers
and when it came to TouchWiz I was never
actually a fan of it as a user interface
but on a bigger screen I thought it
actually worked better so I had a phone
that was both new and very familiar
I've played plenty of games on it and
haven't had any problems speed has never
been an issue on the s4 and I've only
counted two times total that has ever
crashed on me okay a little bit of
disclosure here I was never actually a
galaxy s3 owner I was very familiar with
it though so a lot of the stuff that
might have returned in the s4 did
actually seem somewhat new to me
multi-window and some of the gestures
all worked awesomely and along with the
new stuff the s4 turned out to be a
really jam-packed device and for a while
I used all of those features especially
hand gestures website reading was done
in a better lazy fashion when I could
wave my hand while it was on the table
air view helped me zoom into elements on
webpages and YouTube viewing was
enhanced by the smart pause function
especially when I got distracted
but the rest yeah they lost their
usefulness within the first few weeks
the smart scroll especially a simple
demonstration of it amazed my friends
but otherwise it was never used that s4
commercial that shows people talking
about the phone and asking about its
features is actually true well half true
when people realize you are using the
Samsung Galaxy s4 they do get excited
and ask a lot of questions which is
great when they can tell that you're
using the s4
are we Android users might be able to
differentiate between the s3 and the s4
easily but it's become clear to me that
the general user can't and without being
overtly head-turning the s4 just looks
and feels like the old s3 as
tried-and-true as the design of the s4
is inside and out none of it matters if
the phone can't real people in from the
start as the exciting features were used
less and less the more the phone felt
older and without anything else that
could turn heads it gradually felt less
exciting and this is only after a few
months now don't get me wrong I still
think the galaxy s4 is a fine device it
is still a great example of all the
finest that Android has to offer I'm
obviously in a bit of a special position
because I do have access to all of the
Galaxy s4's competitors there are a lot
of them now and that is the rub look at
it this way there's no doubt in anyone's
mind how well the Galaxy s4 has been
selling and will continue to sell it
will get a refreshing boost by the
release of a bunch of new accessories
which will allow for further
customization but how has it even been
able to achieve all of that the answer
is simple what the success of the
original s3 but over a year ago the
smartphone market was different while
there were plenty of other Android
phones worthy of praise the galaxy s3
basically had one gold content with the
iPhone and it did a great job its
skyrocketed samsung status in the
smartphone market and made the term
galaxy as ubiquitous as droid it paved
the way for future Galaxy phones to
enjoy the same kind of success but then
the s4 was released without any real
drastic changes to the general formula
it focused on perfecting what was
already started in the galaxy line at
this point in the smartphone market
though sticking to what worked might not
always hold up to what other
manufacturers are currently attempting
it's no longer about just contending
with the iPhone it's about keeping up
with all those other players that more
easily represent change I don't fear
that the galaxy s4 will fade into
obscurity that's quite impossible with
how huge Samsung is what I can admit is
that even as a big s4 supporter I soon
started to experience phone Envy one
year ago that might not have been as
possible with the s3 but now it's not
quite so lonely at the top the HTC One
the Sony Xperia inline and even
or known phones like the Oppo fine five
are looming in the shadows so do I still
love the Samsung Galaxy s4 well yeah I
do it's fast reliable and it can still
be a very exciting device I use it every
day because of its familiarity and
because it's as reliable now as it was
when I first got my hands on it
it's just that the extras don't really
excite me as much anymore and when you
strip all of that away what you get is a
phone that you already know and may have
already loved since the galaxy s3 and
that's when you have to take a step back
and realize that the galaxy line no
longer stands alone ok I'm not telling
you to go out there and buy multiple
devices that's obviously not what I'm
trying to do here but the takeaway here
is play the field if the galaxy s4
offers you everything you need and it
will keep you engaged in happy more
power to you just remember there are a
lot of other devices out there and
that's a fact that's gotten truer every
single year for the past half decade and
you know what that's what's awesome
