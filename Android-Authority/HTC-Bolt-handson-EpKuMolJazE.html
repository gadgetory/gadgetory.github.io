thority I'm here in New York City
checking out the HTC bolt it's gonna be
coming out soon and by the time you're
watching this video it's gonna be
available for purchase and it's gonna be
exclusive to Sprint and its name implies
you kind of think it's gonna be all
about the speed given the name bolt but
before I get into that let's talk about
the design now from the front it kind of
looks like the HTC One eight and nine
from last year but it's actually more in
line to the HTC 10 just because it is a
unibody aluminum construction and we
look at the back it has those same very
thick cut contoured beveled edges which
gives it a very distinctive look overall
the phone feels pretty wide it's a big
phone of course but at least with the
metal construction it does have that
sense of solidness to it what's
important to note here though is that
has an IP 57 rating which means there is
a level of water resistance with the
desire which is pretty impressive given
that very few phones special and metal
phones offer it so nothing worth
mentioning is that it doesn't have a
headphone jack everything's done through
the USB type-c port it's not the first
time as you've seen the iPhone and some
other recent Android devices do this so
if you're used to that you might be
bummed about it but it does come
included with this special pair of
headphones now it utilizes this HTC
boomsound audio adaptive technology so
that the headphones themselves will
deliver a customized experience just to
give it more of an immersive feel and
fine-tune it to your specific liking now
it's named bolt for a reason and that's
because it's gonna be running off of
Sprint's LTE Plus Network for really
fast data speeds you have 3 by 20
megahertz carrier aggregation support
thanks to the Snapdragon X 10 LTE modem
it's using now here in New York City
it's not yet available but just knowing
that it has that ability means that
you're gonna get fast data speeds as far
as the rest of the phone is concerned
you have a 16 megapixel rear camera in
the back hopefully it's gonna take
decent shots just like the HTC 10 you
have the
eight megapixel front-facing camera you
have the fingerprint sensor that doubles
as the home button for security it's
running Android 7.0 with the Sense UI
interface and it's powered by Snapdragon
810 chip with 3 gigabytes of RAM now you
might be scratching your head why they
went with the a-10 as opposed to
something you are like the 820 now they
tell us that this is an updated chipset
so you're not gonna run into any sort of
heating issues and seems to be pretty
responsive it's gonna be available
starting today November 11th and it's
gonna be exclusive to Sprint you'll have
to fork over $600 to pick it up outright
or $25 on a 24 month leasing plan so if
you guys wanna learn more about the HTC
bolt you could check our website Android
