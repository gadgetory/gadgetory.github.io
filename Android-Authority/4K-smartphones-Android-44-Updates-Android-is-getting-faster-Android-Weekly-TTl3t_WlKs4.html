Jace and this week we get to talk about
some real goodies right from what the
head or director of Android user
experience Matias to art said is the
single most exciting thing to come to
the Nexus 5 to what experimental edition
has been added to KitKat that could
potentially change Android as we know it
I know you're thinking that's hyperbole
and one of you said I'm probably on Mac
I am NOT but it does have something to
do the speed now to start off let's talk
about the new google keyboard what's new
in the google keyboard it now has
rationalized punctuation across
different device sizes inserted emoji
entry points and layouts simplified mini
keyboard on full stop long press d blued
press dates added space aware gesture
typing so now you won't have to lift
your finger while gesture typing except
for when you go to the spacebar moving
on to the latest hangouts update the
latest google hangouts update actually
features a newer build version than was
found on the Nexus 5 this update seems
to fix the video chat and crashing
issues that some devices we're
experiencing with the Nexus 5 version of
the app if you have yet to try out the
new version the biggest change here is
the SMS integration there's also new
animated gifs and the ability to share
your location during a chat 4.4 kitkat
unofficially arrives for the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus you see when 4.4 KitKat was
released last week with the promise to
also be released to most of the older
nexus devices Samsung Galaxy Nexus
owners were happy but that was revealed
shortly afterwards that Nexus owners
wouldn't be getting KitKat through any
official release yes and they cried a
little bit weak but the good news is
that the developer community is rallying
to the support of those Samsung Galaxy
Nexus owners at least in an unofficial
capacity when available you can find the
links below to get your version of 4.4
KitKat you'll feel right as rain the new
Google Experience launcher is basically
a revamped google search google now app
with launcher functions that are
currently exclusive to the Nexus 5 it
may not come to android devices at all
including
Nexus models according to Matthias to
art the director of Android user
experience although you can download the
apk for the Google Experience launcher
providing the links below so why would
Matthias report to the verge that this
launcher is the single most exciting
thing about the Nexus 5 well think about
this for a moment if Google put search
front and center of every product that
it builds it certainly seems to be doing
that it would then extend the greatest
value to the user so at the moment it
only applies to the home screen the
google google now app and the launcher
so to follow up on what matanzas said
could then they be thinking of extending
that feature to third-party apps think
of the possibilities I could be watching
Game of Thrones and at the same time
search for the name and history of that
amazing redhead without having to leave
the app I know what you're thinking you
know nothing geez bro oh let's talk
android kitkat roms for those who don't
mind going the unofficial route Android
4.4 KitKat roms already exist for the
nexus 4 and 7 and even the verizon and
gsm variants of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
now it looks like we can add three more
devices to the list the gsm HTC One the
Sony Xperia Z and a sprint towards plus
version of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus now
moving on to the m8 otherwise known is
the successor to the HTC One we know for
instance that HTC is currently working
on the successor to the popular one do
in the first quarter of 2014 according
to EV lakes the device is codenamed
internally m8 you see the HTC One was
codenamed m7 and will be the first
device to run HTC's Sense 6 Android
overlay let's talk about tickets
experimental feature you see deep within
KitKat is a feature that could
potentially have a significant impact on
user experience and it is called art no
not that type of art I'm talking about
Android runtime now it is meant to
replace the aging dalvik and dalvik is a
process virtual machine that's basically
responsible for running Android apps on
Android devices but it's slow and its
aging an art is fast so fast that it is
effectively halved the execution time of
all the applications thrown at it
far so even on old Galaxy Note devices
i'd be like things but right now I'm
more like LG g2 android 4.4 kitkat
update tip for November or December a
French mobile operator revealed on a
smartphone software update page that the
LG g2 will be updated to Android 4.4
KitKat in the following weeks without
providing an actual update date it was
listed November or December 2013 as they
expected KitKat update period for LG's
flagship smartphone which is what the
Nexus 5 is largely based on now look
into Samsung and 2014 and beyond peering
further into the future Samsung hopes to
have you HD also known as 4k displays on
the market by sometime in 2015 while the
benefits of such a high resolution are
debatable Samsung and other display
manufacturers are clearly going to push
the envelope in this area as much as
they can now if everything goes
according to plan Samsung will move to
have the current high-end resolution
standard full HD moved to wqhd or 2560 x
1440 so how far can this res war really
go and what's the point of an ever
increasing resolution if it moves beyond
what the human eye can appreciate anyway
seems like things could get really silly
I'll look at those images</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
