familiar it basically feels like a
gutted honoree with an updated spec
sheet and a front-facing fingerprint
scanner
despite delivering a familiar design
software and hardware experience it
somehow still comes out feeling like an
exciting phone I'm Chris Colin of
Android authority and this is beyond a9
hands-on one has remain remarkably
gimmick free over the years so while
other companies have gone in search of
the next big thing honor has instead
focused on providing a solid core
experience the upshot of the Distilled
smartphone experience is that honor has
also managed to keep its prices down
young and I continues that tradition
starting at four hundred and forty nine
euros in Europe although there's
currently a deal one offer to get a 64
gig on a nine and an honor band 3
fitness tracker for 429 euros for 379
pounds no matter what you pay though
you'll be getting a phone backing pretty
high-end specs essentially the same as
those found in the world we mate 9 and
p10 but for a lot less than those other
phones to get those specs out of the way
here they are so just for this video if
you need some time to ponder specs aside
though the owner 9 is focused on a few
key areas style performance gaming audio
camera and sports it looks a lot like
the honoré from last year but with the
addition of 3d curved glass on the back
to improve its grip ability the 15 layer
optical treatment on the back curves
into the sandblasted metal frame and
around to the front where a 5.1 5 inch
1080p IPS LCD panel sits atop a
front-facing fingerprint scanner that
panel is plenty punchy though with nice
saturated colors good contrast and
outdoor visibility combined with solid
viewing angles while some folks will be
disappointed that the fingerprint
scanner has migrated to the front of the
on a 9 I can show you that it is
unbelievably fast and very reliable
there's no option for on-screen
navigation buttons anymore but you can
switch the location of the capacitive
buttons flanking the ceramic home button
emui 5.1 on android 7.0 is just as fluid
feature packed and customizable as
always and there's no major new
surprises here other than the addition
of some new 3d audio profile
so when you're listening to tunes with
headphones you can choose the type of
headphones you're using and select a
listening profile out of near front and
white depending on whether you want a
more immersive or up close and personal
experience the bottom firing Speaker
gets notably loud but you might want to
avoid maxing it out if you actually like
your music moving on to the dual camera
the monochrome sensor has been beefed up
to 20 megapixels resolution which
affords the 2x hybrid zoom we've also
seen on the huawei p10 and mate 9 that's
a well megapixel RGB sensor as colour
information while the monochrome sensor
takes care of details pixel burnin
promises superior low-light performance
but while the honor 9 does pretty well
with color there's still a fair bit of
noise and lost detail in the shadows the
absence of óas means you'll suffer at
night with either F 2.2 aperture lens
and your 4k footage will be noticeably
bumpy we'll bring you more detailed
information on the on a9 camera in the
full review but we can already tell that
it performs quite well if not exactly
spectacularly in full daylight
everything comes out great just like
with most phones and there's a bunch of
other options available like live photos
full manual mode of monochrome only a
patchy sort of VOCA portrait mode like
painting and a new night shot mode
you'll need to use a tripod for unless
you want to end up with this kind of
mess as I mentioned at the outset beyond
a 9 is a no-frills smartphone delivering
a solid baseline across the board at a
price point that most can manage it
doesn't add anything brand new to the
mix just improves on a winning formula
from years past and there's absolutely
nothing wrong with that as always thank
