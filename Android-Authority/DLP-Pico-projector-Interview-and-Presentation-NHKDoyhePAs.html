with android authority we're here at
showstoppers here at Aoife Berlin I'm
just here with Frank moishele he's the
manager of GOP Pico obviously consumers
are really curious to know about mobile
projection technologies a lot of
industry analysts are saying over the
next three to five years it's going to
become more mainstream obviously
increasing the utility of a device to be
able to share media and movies and
presentations and so we're just going to
have a good little quicker get a sense
of what we're looking at in dlp pico
sure yeah ok great so we're really
excited to be here because you've taken
our cinema technology the same
technology that's using the majority of
cinemas in the world DLP technology and
we've reduced that down to the chips
that are this size and what that really
enables is enabled us to do mobile
phones and all sorts of mobile devices
that can get incredibly compelling
pictures and experiences with people
whether it's for gaming or whether it's
for recreational use or whether it's for
enterprise and businesses
these are just tremendous opportunities
to leverage the technology in the
different spaces you want to share with
you a really cool product this is
samsung galaxy be
this phone is an android based phone it
was just released recently into the
marketplace and it uses our daily
technology
prepare the sauce
so for example
here's a presentation that's on the
phone and if we want to go through a
presentation but you can easily do that
if we want to show show videos we can
easily do that as well
so here's
for example you can see we're in a
pretty decent nvm life scenario right
here that's quite bright and so you can
take anything any app that's on here
whether it's it's a crackle or Hulu Plus
and yeah there's so much available
content area and you can use it and show
things like this in addition you can go
in here and play and play video games as
well it's a really compelling experience
we take you back
video game
ooh I like this thing so this is a great
game yeah we won't actually play it for
you here but it's a but the show coming
up right here you can take a wireless
Bluetooth controller in conjunction with
this phone and play this this really
cool game we got it happening over there
we just got
I don't have a bluetooth controller with
me at the mouth but playing it on this
shameless related with the wireless
bluetooth controllers even that much
more compelling indeed so whatever it is
whether it's gaming whether it's
presentations whether it's at other
types of contact for consumer
applications copp code enables these
kind of products in the marketplace and
that's not just on android phones both
products that help power products like
this new effects leave this basically
powers the iphones and also doxy iphone
so it's a case you need but it also
allows you to protect images from the
it's quite right yeah this is this is a
brand new here at the show excellent
here is just a video streaming video off
of this crowd
good frame right dad yeah whatever
whatever the application may be
enterprise concern of our gaining
whatever it is there's so many different
pieces here I found even just using that
phone for the last couple of weeks and
yeah that I could actually view email
attachments finally without pinching and
canning all over knives okay so i just
use it to easily look at emails as well
so in terms of the direction of where
we're headed with this technology are
there any plans to collaborate with
tablet makers and other different form
factors may be in laptops as well we see
that as an ultimate destination of a
technology absolutely there's so many
reasons why you want to share
information as ice devices are
inherently a one-on-one experience yes
and our technology makes them into a
multi share multiviewer experience
message so really transforms we think it
transforms mobile devices individual use
to a shared experience yeah well I mean
consumer technology as a whole they are
just designed to augment things that
already exist that's why people love
Facebook people love sharing people of
communicating right so that just
enhances it but in terms of some of the
challenges that's the technology has
before it gains wives widespread
adoption what do you think are some of
the top ones awareness awareness of what
what this can do yeah that's that's
really probably the biggest yeah
probably certainly we've had to do a lot
to go from cinema
to this tiny chip yeah that operates yes
incredible on a cell phone down yeah but
the really done a great job with our
technology and Sampson allows you to
work for forgot three hours okay three
hours not bad with this case yeah so
we're going to look for more innovations
and more applications like we're in more
than 50 products today 50 public's yeah
wow that's fantastic so we think it'll
continue to go so right in terms of
technological progress you know everyone
wants faster better cheaper yeah you
know we've seen that obviously in the
CPU race as things continue to get
smaller decrease the power envelope like
how small are the actual projectors
themselves going to be able to get are
there any physical constraints and
limitations and and also to in terms of
the power probably the best illustration
is the first samsung phone that was
released into into local korean market a
couple of years ago with ya five and a
half minutes okay if it's lower
resolution was a lot thicker they'll
expel this phone has got a lot thinner
it's actually three times the brightness
of that first so 15 finland was that's
excellent and the bridge solution is
about I'm
when I have 22 times that original
arrest within three years yeah so we're
going to continue to see those trends
moving forward excellent we'll see them
a lot of progress happened in terms of
solid-state illumination LEDs lasers yes
in conjunction with our technology so we
think that you're going to continue to
see it gets smaller brighter and
and also get to new price points as well
fantastic and in terms of from a
hardware manufacturers perspective is it
expensive to license technology or to
embed it like a whole company's my face
procure we actually manufacture these
device okay actually my spare those
devices okay fantastic we're really cool
well I mean I think five years from now
it has a lot of potential but you know
talk about awareness Sandra that's great
well thank you very much for your time
Frank I really appreciate it thank you
very much for having on your welcome
we'll be in touch ok thank you alright
guys so start Darcy like you right here
