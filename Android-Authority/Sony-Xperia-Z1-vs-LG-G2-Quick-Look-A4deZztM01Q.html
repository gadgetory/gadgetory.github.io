might be as close and competition as i
can get a cha-cha vagar from android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the Sony Xperia z1 vs the LG g2
in this quick look since the g2 came out
pretty recently it can be considered the
main competitor to the Sony Xperia z1
while I both have similar experiences
their key differences come from
different philosophies the Sony Xperia
z1 takes on the design of the original
Xperia Z with its glass encased body
water and dust resistance and the flat
profile with very angular edges this is
a design only sony has been putting out
really and evokes a real black slate
look the signature Xperia power button
is on the side with the volume rockers
and the added dedicated camera button
it's in the button layout however that
LG wanted to shake things up with the g2
instead of having the buttons on the
sides the g two sports them on the back
while your index finger would land it
sounds weird but feels natural after a
very short time otherwise you get the
glossy plastic finish that can get
pretty smudgy and a little slippery
these are problems the experiencing one
would have to tho in feel it comes down
to your comfort either the flatness and
rigidity of the experience you want is
more comfortable or the more rounded
look what the unique one layout will be
better for you the battle of the
displays rages on with these 2 1080p
capable screens the Xperia z1 sports the
triluminos screen that is bolstered by
the X reality engine the result is a
display experience that is very akin to
a sony TV while colors might not totally
jump out at you they are more than easy
on the eyes and the brightness is
adequate enough compare that to the LG
g2's 5.2 inch screen which is a powerful
IPS display that brings great brightness
over time LG has been able to get a
color profile that is more saturated
than your average and you can see it in
the g2 really it comes down to what you
prefer your eyes to be looking at
whether it's the Sony cinematic quality
or the higher saturated and brighter IPS
as both of these phones came out
recently they benefit from the latest
processing package what we get in both
are the Snapdragon 800 clocked in at 2.2
gigahertz and the Adreno 330 with 2
gigabytes of RAM performance is great
across the board and either the more
feature-packed Optimus UI or the Xperia
timescape you I should go along without
any hitches both come with three
thousand million power batteries with
power saving features to boot but the
Xperia z1 is the one that can boast
mandible memory and water and dust
protection when it comes to the cameras
the Xperia z1 puts as much power as it
can into that small optic package you
see in the back corner the G lens is a
near 21 megapixel monster that is
supposed to bring the same quality as
Sony's compact cameras it also boasts
many enhancements that can be bolstered
by downloaded camera add-ons the LG g2
might not support as many app
enhancements but it has a trump card
optical image stabilization the result
is an easier time getting quick shots
and better low-light performance picture
quality should be great either way with
Sony packing power into its camera and
the g2 packing optimization and finally
we have the software while the Xperia z1
sports a bevy of new features and its
camera the timescape you I remains
pretty much how we remember it the
operating system that looks somewhat
like stock Android has a darker Sony S
look that includes Sony's own editions
of the Walkman gallery and overlay small
apps on the other hand LG has been
continuously adding to its Optimus UI
and continues to do so with the g2
qslide apps are aplenty and are much
like the Sony small apps you can create
quick memos and other q functions are
available too but the biggest addition
is the slide aside which puts aside
whole apps with a three-finger swipe
swipe back and you can pick among them
it comes down to either a robust feature
set or a simpler experience here but
both are a joy to use and so there you
have it the Sony Xperia z1 will soon be
put through its paces against the best
in the Android space on the LG g2 is
probably currently its closest
competitor with the Xperia z1 hoping to
propel Sony further into the top-tier
market we'll see how it stacks up when
it is released stay tuned for more Aoife
