this year and it's a really weird phone
it's totally different from Sony cuz
they used to be super streamlined and
flat and now they're really curvy and
they're kind of basing everything off of
this water design that they've come up
with well it's only been four or five
months now and they've already released
the Sony Xperia XZ 3 XT 3 is probably
what the XC 2 should have been it's now
got an OLED display which is pretty much
the marquee feature of this phone now
Sony's bravia line is a really really
great line of TVs and they use OLED
panels and I would have thought that
Sony would have brought those LEDs over
earlier still though you're left with
something that looks great vibrant and
it's actually fully HDR capable just
like it was in the XC 2 but it just
looks a lot better on this bright OLED
display they also managed to slim down
the bezels on the side of the screen so
it just looks a lot more compact and the
screen just looks a lot fuller at 6
inches now like I said it's been like
four months
so the internals of this phone are
pretty much the same save a few
different little changes it still got
Qualcomm latest processor still got 4
gigs of RAM it still got 64 gigabytes of
storage but the changes here are in the
camera and a couple other little
departments now the main camera is the
same it's still that nineteen megapixel
sensor but the selfie camera has been
upgraded to 13 megapixels and it's
actually got a TANF 1.9 aperture which
lets in more light than the last
generation the batteries also been
improved
it's 3300 milliamp hours so you should
get a little more battery life
especially since OLED czar generally a
little bit more battery capable they've
also made an improvement on the stereo
speakers because people were saying that
it didn't get quite loud enough last
year so they kind of boosted him a
little bit so you should get a little
more bass in trouble
besides the screen one of the biggest
changes in this phone is the software
it's got Android P out of the box and
that's kind of a big deal because we
haven't really seen that many phones
that came shipped with Android piece
stock of course with Android P you get
all those new AI features like guessing
which apps you're gonna use
next and it seems like they've built
that into a new edge feature but don't
worry it's not HTC edge sense and Sony's
version you just kind of tap where the
screen meets the body and it brings up a
little menu that guesses what apps
you're trying to use so you can kind of
just jump between apps a little more
quickly and those are really the major
changes to this phone you're still
getting all the crazy features that Sony
usually throws in their devices like the
high res audio codecs super slo-mo
camera mode and even the dynamic
vibration motor that debuted in the xe2
of course if you've won a phone that
does pretty much everything you're gonna
have to pay a pretty high price the
Xperia X III cost nine hundred dollars
which is a pretty high price to pay but
we did just see Samsung unveiled the
note 9 at a that was in dollars with
most of the same features so it's kind
of up to you whether or not you're
willing to shell out the money for this
thing you can pick up the Xperia XE 3 on
October 17th which is like 6 months away
from the Xperia xc2 but we just saw
blackberry and oneplus do the same thing
so it might be becoming the norm now
