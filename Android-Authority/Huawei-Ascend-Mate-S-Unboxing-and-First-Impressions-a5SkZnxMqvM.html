Authority and today we're unboxing this
guy right here this is the huawei mate S
this was actually just announced
yesterday by Huawei at the press event
here in Aoife 2015 in Berlin so we're
going to go ahead and unbox this guy
take a look at it and show you what's in
the box and also give you sort of a
first impressions of what I think about
the device so let's go ahead just get
right into it all right so it's going to
be kind of a faux unboxing here because
I did already kind of play with it a
little bit but it's going to give you
the idea regardless so first thing
you're going to see is the phone itself
obviously and we're just going to lift
that out and I'm going to set that to
the side for just a second and see what
else is in the box here so take out this
little tray and in the box you're going
to get the usual stuff here you have the
micro USB cable for charging and syncing
and then you also have the wall adapter
here and then there's also a pretty nice
set of earbuds here so and while we
actually made a pretty big deal about
these earbuds and they do look pretty
nice sort of very Apple earpods
but they're pretty nice looking earbuds
regardless and then other than that you
have a sim card removal tool and inside
this box here there's actually a case so
that's kind of nice that you get a case
included with the phone so it's a flip
cover case so pretty nice they included
that you don't really see that too often
with a lot of flagship or high-end
devices so you get some really nice
earbuds and a really nice case alright
so here is the device itself so the
first thing you going to notice is that
it's completely made of metal so it's
all metal unibody design and the first
thing that I sort of thought of when
looking at this phone was that I sort of
looks like the old one m7 from a few
years ago so it has sort of that same
sloping curved metal back it has
chamfered edges all around so there's
chamfered edges on the backside
chamfered edges on the front side and
it's also extremely thin not the
thinnest but it's pretty thin it's seven
point two millimeters thin and it
actually tapers down along the edges to
two point six five millimeters so that
is really thin and when you hold it it
feels extremely nice to hold and it's
also really easy to hold despite being a
5.5 inch smartphone so I really love the
build quality it feels very sleek in the
hand it doesn't feel slippery either for
being a metal phone there's actually
sort of a little bit of resistance seen
to the metal backing and of course the
chamfered edges also help out with that
as well so I really like the handling
with this it feels extremely nice and it
doesn't feel slippery at all on the
front of the phone you're looking at a
5.5 inch 1080p Super AMOLED screen and
while we was quick to point out the
contrast ratio so you're looking at 1.8
million to 1 contrast ratio and it's
also very saturated as well as you would
expect from a AMOLED screen and so far
it looks really good it's a nice looking
panel but one thing I will say from just
having this device for a short while is
that it doesn't get all that bright
especially compared to something like
the note 5 or the s6 it definitely isn't
quite as bright so outdoor visibility
might be a little bit of an issue with
this device but otherwise the screen
really looks great just to take a quick
tour around the device you have your 3.5
millimeter headphone jack up top the
power and volume keys are both on the
right side where they're easy to reach
and then on the bottom you have your
micro USB and what looks like dual
bottom mounted speakers but it's
actually just the right one that is a
speaker and the other one is a
microphone and then on the left side you
have a dual SIM tray so it is dual sim
capable and you actually get LTE on both
SIM cards which is really nice and a one
of the sim cards can also one of these
sim card slots can also be used as a
micro SD card slot for extra storage so
that's also pretty nice as well and then
along the back you obviously have the
camera optics there's a 13 megapixel
sensor with an RGB W sin sir and a dual
tone LED flash and also below the camera
you have the fingerprint scanner and eye
she really liked the fingerprint scanner
on the mate s here while we was sort of
touting its accuracy and its reliability
and it actually is extremely fast you
can sort of just basically tap the
fingerprint scanner and it'll unlock
your phone you don't even really have to
hold your finger on to it so that's
really how fast it is almost pretty much
instantaneous so I really like the
fingerprint scanner here it works
extremely well and also has other
functions besides just being able to
scan your fingerprint you can also use
it as sort of as a trackpad so if I
swipe down on it it'll actually pull
down the notification shade and I can
swipe it back up as well so there's a
lot of cool little gestures that you can
do you can also swipe through photos in
your gallery by swiping across the
fingerprint scanner so that's also
pretty cool as well so a lot of really
cool things you can do with the
fingerprint scanner there's a lot more
functionality to it than just being able
to scan your fingerprint now just to
recap the internal specs really quickly
you're looking at the high silicon here
on 935 processor so Huawei's own
in-house processor and three gigabytes
of RAM so performance should be really
good on this device and if history is
any indication of always in-house
chipsets are usually pretty good so and
so far I really haven't had any issues
it seems to be very smooth so everything
from you know gaming and media and all
that stuff that you want to do on this
phone should run perfectly fine I don't
think they're going to have any sort of
issues whatsoever with these specs on
this device storage wise you're looking
at 32 64 or 828 gigabytes of storage but
one thing to note about the hundred and
twenty eight gigabyte version is that it
actually comes with force touch as in
apples force touch so you're going to be
able to press a lot harder on the screen
to do certain functions like being able
to zoom in closer to an image without
actually pinching a zoom so things of
that nature but unfortunately I'm not
able to show it to you guys because this
is the 32 gigabyte version that I have
here and the force touch version is
actually going to be available only in
certain market so you probably won't see
it in the US for certain reasons that
you can probably already guess with the
software you're looking at android 5.1.1
with Huawei's emotion UI 3.1 on
and if you've ever used emotion UI
before you'll know exactly what to
expect here it's a very colorful
interface with a lot of very brightly
colored icons and a lot of software
tricks up and sleeve from a one-handed
mode to motion control and dual window
things of that nature and it also comes
with Huawei's own knuckle sense
technology which we first saw on the p8
so you can do things like draw letters
on the screen to open applications like
I can draw a C for example on the screen
if I wanted to open the camera app or
draw an e if I wanted to open the
internet browser so anything like that
and you can basically create your own
gestures to open whatever apps that you
want to open you can also double knock
on the screen with two knuckles to start
a video recording and double knock again
to stop a video recording also inside is
a pretty large 3000 milliamp hour
battery and that should be more than
enough to get the mate s through a full
day especially considering the screen is
only 1080p so I don't think battery life
is going to be an issue on this phone
but obviously we're gonna have to wait
till we test is advise further to really
see what the battery life is going to be
like but 3000 milliamp hours sounds like
it should be more than enough for the
mate s it's going to be available within
the coming weeks and pre-orders actually
start on September 15 so you'll be able
to get your hands on the mate s pretty
soon here but this has been a quick
unboxing and hands on first impressions
of the mate s hopefully you guys enjoyed
