clayton youngberg represent android
authority calm your number one source
for all things android today we're
bringing you a head-to-head comparison
smackdown between the verizon LG
intuition and the samsung galaxy s3
we're going to be comparing the hardware
software and then the internals and
specs of these two phones and tell you
which one might be better for you as
always we're going to let you decide but
we're going to run down some of the
basics of each phone now unfortunately i
don't have the verizon variants samsung
galaxy s3 i am rocking the international
quad-core variant we're still going to
treat this the same anyways the most
noticeable difference between both of
these devices is of course their size
we're rocking a insanely large 5-inch
display on the LG intuition as you can
see it is measured diagonally but is a
fairly wide phone in the hand it is
extremely large and it is just about
dwarfing the galaxy s3 now the galaxy s3
does have a four point eight inch
display which is very large by today's
standards and it still looks great
anyways we're going to go ahead and
delve into the specs and software of
these devices now as a lot of people
know the international galaxy s3 is
rocking vxi knows quad-core cpu clocked
at one point 4 gigahertz and the LG
intuition is running the Snapdragon s3
processor which is a little bit behind
the s4 that they're putting in v samsung
galaxy s3's but it's still clocked at
1.5 gigahertz a lot of dual core power
but it is powering a lot of pixels now
anyways side by side you can see that
the colors on each device are great the
brightness is great on each device and
then we are rocking different flavors of
Android where we are rocking the Android
for dot 0 on each device we've got four
dot 0 dot four on each device the galaxy
s3 is slated to get jelly bean soon
while the LG intuition is still up in
the air whether or not they're going to
follow through with some jelly bean but
I'd almost assume that they have to in
order to thrive in this market now
anyways both a very fluid response the
galaxy s3 is just a little bit more
responsive it's faster with its
quad-core but of course that's what
you're going to get as far as how they
feel in the hand obviously the galaxy s3
is a little bit more
you know form-fitting has a nice
curvature fits in my hand perfect and
then the LG intuition is this a little
bit more difficult to hold in your hand
you've actually got to use two hands and
it makes for not the best time using
your phone anyways the LG intuition is
rocking the Optimus skin and of course
the galaxy s3's rock can be touch with
skin over android for dot zero we'll go
ahead and go into our app tray on each
as you can see both open we have our
apps and widgets pain but LG has decided
to add in downloads I you know tab up
there so we can check out the apps that
we've actually downloaded as you can see
as far as speed and scrolling there is a
little bit more fluid motion on the
galaxy s3 it just looks a little better
but they're both fairly nice now we do
have the capacitive buttons on each as
you can see we've got the menu the back
in the home and on the LG we do have the
capacitive buttons with menu back home
and then our reasons are an actual
dedicated button whereas our reasons
come up by holding the home button on
the galaxy s3 anyways we'll go into the
settings that's the actual settings for
the app tray so I'm not going to do that
and go ahead and pull down the top
notification bar as you can see each of
these rock and android for dot 0 but the
notification bars are a little bit
different we do have our toggles up here
as well as on the LG and we can edit our
toggles and move them and then we can
also do the same on the galaxy s3 now
the LG intuition has a dedicated Wi-Fi
button right here and it's not really a
toggle up there but nonetheless both
give you quick access to all your
different settings your brightness
control we do have a slider on the
galaxy s3 for brightness whereas on the
LG intuition we have just three
different settings for brightness
anyways we'll go into the settings on
each of these phones as you can see they
are both skin differently there's a nice
white theme going on in the LG intuition
then we've got the black theme of the
galaxy s3 looking on the LG intuition
and the s3 we've got more options as
well as the data usage and our Bluetooth
and Wi-Fi options of course sound and
display all the native features of
Android for dot 0 we've got application
managers as well as power saving and
battery saving features on each as well
scroll all the way down to the about
phone and the about device on the galaxy
s3 Android
for dot 0 dot 4 will have to go into our
software information on the intuition
we'll have to see that we're running for
dot 0 dot 4 as well go back on each
device we have some different menus
because of the theme of the optimist but
both have different wallpaper
customizations you can choose the theme
and the font on each device the font
size as well and then we can configure
things about the lock screen now as far
as benchmarks go the galaxy s3 Trump's
the intuition whether or not you're
rocking the quad core or the dual core
the dual-core s4 is the you know higher
up processor than the s3 that's in the
intuition whether you have the verizon
version or the international version and
then of course the verizon version and
the other carrier variants are rocking
two gigabytes of RAM as opposed to one
gigabyte in the intuition so as far as
speeds go it's hands-down goes to the
galaxy s3 intuition runs nicely the s3
processor the Snapdragon s3 in the
intuition is quite responsive works very
nice and you know it's still a joy to
use a lot of people don't like the
intuition just because of its strange
aspect ratio its large size but you know
I'm sort of growing accustomed to it I
do think that I will get the galaxy s3
and i will return the intuition in about
a week and that's my honest opinion you
guys it's been a great phone but it is a
really funky size we got two hands that
we need to use when we're actually using
the device but it is still great i might
give it a try of course of course we've
got our roberti impending tuition which
is not as intuitive as the s-pen that's
going to be coming with the Galaxy Note
2 you know that's already with the
galaxy note 10.1 in the galaxy note
there's no dedicated slot for the pen
the Roberti impending to store the
stylus not so much we're going to have a
very large case but it does work fine
we've got our intuitive applications
such as the quick memo we can simply tap
the top button take a screenshot of
whatever screen we were using and then
we can edit this screenshot save it and
share it now we can take a screenshot on
the galaxy s3 simply by moving our hand
across the screen it's got gesture
support we also have gesture support on
the intuition
simply grab an icon and you can tilt
your device left and right to move it
across the screens we can also change
the icon style and the actual icon
itself for a lot of the apps but as you
can see LG kind of does have the same
sort of color scheme going on that the
galaxy s3 does with its TouchWiz
interface anyways we'll get a
side-by-side comparison get the sizes
there so you can see the intuitions just
a little bit taller this is the back
profile both phones rocking an
8-megapixel rear-facing camera we've got
a 1.9 megapixel front-facing on the
galaxy s3 and a 1.3 megapixel
front-facing on the LG intuition now of
course we're going to have our full
review of the LG intuition and we do
have our full review of the galaxy s3 so
make sure to check out each of those but
anyways we do have a lot of intuitive
camera features on each both capture and
1080p HD the 8 megapixels is really
great another cool thing about the
samsung galaxy s3 of course is its
removable battery option an option not
found on the LG intuition which
unfortunately you know you can't get
extended batteries and things of that
sort but there are cases that come with
other batteries and stuff so a lot of
the complaints that the LG intuition
receives can be solved in the future
with the addition of accessories like I
said you'll get cases that you can store
your stylus in of course you can get the
extended battery cases that you plug the
microUSB in from the case I was already
out for like the HTC One S and stuff
like that but anyways here is our SIM
slot on the intuition as you can see I
pop that open our sims in there sim goes
in the rear of the galaxy s3 this is our
clear talk enabled galaxy s3 now as far
as they displays of course we have a
much bigger well not much bigger but we
do have a bigger display on the LG
intuition whereas we have really nice
colors with the AMOLED type display on
the galaxy s3 and it's a lot more
refined our pixels aren't spread out
across this 5 inches the 4.8 inches
really lets you get the extra detail in
these icons and videos and games and
stuff like that and then the processor 2
back in the galaxy s3 really kind of
hands down in my opinion beats the
gee intuition okay anyways guys that was
our head to head comparison between both
of these badass phones available on
verizon's network go ahead and pick one
out they're both the same price 199 you
going to drop two hundred dollars and
get an awesome phone either way so tell
us which one you guys like anyways this
is clayton with android authority calm
stay tuned with us because we got plenty
more action where this came from</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
