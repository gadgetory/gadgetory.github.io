long-term investments with the ticket
prices being close to or even exceeding
the thousand dollar mark
so when Xiaomi launched its paka phone
brand and subsequently the Baka phone f1
nine months ago it's safe to say that
the Chinese giant shook up the market
but how does 2018 s budget beast hold up
in 2019 well in our second episode of
Redux we're going to find out Xiaomi is
well known for its great software
support and the pocket phone f1 is no
exception
the device has already had an OS upgrade
from 8.1 Oreo to a 9.0 PI and if the
company's track record is anything to go
by this phone should at least get
Android Q in q4 of 2019 Jay Manny the
head of product for the pocket phone
brand replied to a tweet on the 28th of
October 2018 saying that the f1 will at
least get P and Q so we'll have to hold
the brand to that when it comes to the
next big Android update general software
updates seem to come every two weeks and
some of those have had a fantastic
effect on pocket phone's camera which
we'll get to later a particularly
crucial update to those film fanatics of
U was released in February where the
phone finally got Widevine l1
certification allowing for Netflix and
Amazon Prime video playback at HD
resolutions before this only 480p was
offered so I'm glad that we got an issue
resolved the specs of the f1 easily
compete in 2019 as we have a year old
flagship SOC and plenty of RAM in both
the 6 and 8 gigabyte configurations as a
gaming phone the device performs well
and is still smooth and speedy with
minimal hangs so needless to say that
general performance is just as good
camera performance has improved
significantly since the launch of the
POC of f1 not only giving us 9 60 FPS
slo-mo but also in a beta 4k 60 image
quality sharpness dynamic range and
color accuracy of all dramatically
improved thanks to the far better image
processing portray mode is probably the
main weakness even after all of those
awesome improvements the omission of
white and zoom lenses on this device
makes it feel kind of outdated or even
seeing these extra focal lengths on low
to mid-range units so missing them here
is kind of a big deal the display is the
weakest factor of the pocke phone in my
opinion it's backlight bleeding and
shadowing issues can't be resolved via a
software update however the sharpness
and colors look pretty
even by 2019 standards the porcupine f1
does miss out on a few crucial features
that we see in 2019 smartphones such as
the Indus play fingerprint scanner water
droplet knotch hole punch or even glass
back with wireless charging but I feel
like those emissions are more than made
up for the fact that you get such a good
speck in a phone of that price battery
life is still great partly due to the
reasonably large four thousand milliamp
ourseleves here but also due to shammies
aggressive tasking
something that hasn't changed since
launch whether the lassi is good or bad
will depend on your personal preference
but a full day of usage is more than
achievable for pretty much everyone
brand new you can get a pack of nf1 for
$300 300 euros or 250 pounds on sites
like eBay and if you're willing to go
use you're going to save even more money
there this puts it in the mid-range
sector of the market inhabited by the
Galaxy a 50 the LG q7 plus and the Moto
g7 all devices that shadow in the raw
horsepower of the pocke phone f1 we
believe the f1 to be a fantastic value
even in today's market and considering
its slightly lower price than at launch
and with those added benefits from the
software updates we feel like it's
possibly a better value than it was when
it was first released the f1 takes so
many boxes in the spec department but
just in case the pocket for an f1 isn't
your cup of tea here are a couple of
alternatives that we recommend for
around 100 USD more the newly released
pixel 3a looks to be a great option for
you shutter box a refurbished LG G 7th
in queue is also a great option due to
its similar spec config and massive
feature set including weather resistance
the POC phone f1 is a fantastic phone in
2019 and so it misses out on a few
things you know the design isn't quite
as nice as a lot of people would like it
hasn't got a glass back it doesn't feel
very premium especially compared to some
of its mid-range contemporaries but I
feel like its form over function mantra
with still competitive specs and superb
value mean that it's definitely worth
the buy in 2019 we're excited to see
what the paco phone f2 will bring and
we'd like to hear your thoughts about
that in the comments below and with that
it's time for me to go thank you all so
