people thought it revolutionized the
tablet market with its accessible size
and very affordable price point well it
was only a matter of time before other
companies decided to adopt the same
general strategy and possibly do it even
better hey it's Josh of agar from
Android thorny what's going on everybody
and this is the HP Slate 7 as the name
suggests the HP Slate 7 is a 7 inch
tablet much like the Nexus 7 as a matter
of fact it looks a lot like the Google
tablet at first glance I'll try my best
to keep this from being a comparison but
the Nexus 7 does make a good benchmark
you get the front black slate with the
sizable bezel around the screen and
front facing camera up top in size it
has a similar profile but it's thicker
and noticeably heavier this is due to a
middle spine that joins the back in the
front a thick spine that allows for easy
gripping in one hand the power button SD
card slot and headphone jack are up top
the volume rockers are on the side and
the speaker grilles are on the bottom
the back is of a rubberized material
around the rear facing camera it's
almost as if HP took the somewhat
cheaper feeling Nexus 7 and gave it a
more industrial look and feel the
thicker profile makes it easier to hold
in one hand and they have to just helps
elevate its build quality the attractive
back can be found in some other colours
like a really vibrant red but this gray
still looks quite good HP can be
commended for making a sturdy feeling
and attractive seven-inch tablet if the
seven-inch tablet market is supposed to
be generally more affordable the HP
Slate 7 definitely fulfills the criteria
we'll get to the price later but know
that with a low price comes
accommodating specifications this starts
with the screen the seven-inch LCD is
actually lower in resolution than a vast
majority of other devices coming in at
1024 by 600 resolution at only 170 PPI
while it does look quite decent at a
distance away you can already notice
some fringing in the colors and that
only gets worse when you get closer just
about everything from shapes and text
looks jagged and pixelated even the
general user will notice this lowered
quality in the display experience you
pretty much do get what you're paying
for here considering that other options
only somewhat more expensive give a much
better screen performance the
performance of the slate 7 is decided
in range as HP outfitted this tablet
with the dual-core cortex a9 that clocks
in at 1.6 gigahertz this isn't a slow
performer by any means as it works just
fine for the budget slate 7 it slides
through its menus and elements just fine
though it takes longer for it to load
more intensive apps gaming is also just
decent due to the Mali 400 MP 4 which is
a respectable graphics package and the 1
gigabyte of RAM that gets you some
multitasking abilities all in all you'll
be able to get around typical tasks
without any problems but expect some
sutter and lag when you're trying to get
crazy benchmark scores are the swear you
would expect and - - puts it squarely
right above the 10,000 mark while Epic
Citadel at just high performance was
only able to maintain about 40 frames a
second Hardware on the slate 7 does get
a bit of a boost with an SD card slot
found at the top being able to extend
the included 8 or 16 gigabytes will help
people get more media usage which is
always nice otherwise you would expect a
standard bevy of other features like
Bluetooth which you do get but you don't
get GPS here making the slate 7 the last
choice of navigation and you also don't
get NFC perhaps a bit of a bizarre
oversight is the exclusion of a
gyroscope Beats Audio is perhaps the
only real Edition that differentiates
the slate 7 it does its job here adding
volume and some richness to music
through headphones too bad it can't do
the same for the outer speakers which
are just not loud enough for more than
just one or two people trying to listen
it's hard not to be disappointed by all
that is missing here as a concerted
effort to offer even the standard tablet
experience at such a low price point
could have propelled this tablet a 3500
milliamp hour battery is included in the
slate 7 which HP claims will keep the
tablet running for up to 5 hours this is
mostly true after about a couple hours
of usage mostly on YouTube it did get
down to about 45 percent life now no one
really expects cameras on tablets to be
very good but sometimes they are nice
additions not so on the slate 7 this 3
megapixel rear shooter is a far cry from
just about anything we see on devices
these days while it is in addition that
the slate 7 has over the nexus 7 it's
one you probably won't be using anyway
the app is that standard as it can get
with only really panorama as the added
mode and pictures are all full of grain
and lag good color reproduction even the
lack of autofocus adds to the troubles
in this camera the front-facing camera
is decidedly lower quality too capable
of only VGA resolution and consistently
washed out pictures if you really need a
camera on your tablet then you got one
here but you're likely better off just
taking out you're much better performing
camera phone in just about every case
and finally we come to the software
simple story here the jelly bean 4.1.2
powered HP Slate 7 keeps things about as
stock as possible there are pretty much
no changes to the original formula here
and without a proprietary ecosystem like
Amazon with its Kindle to back it up
this is about as vanilla as you can get
a lot of us do prefer the nexus
experience and you do get it here which
is nice but there's not much to say
otherwise finally we end on price I end
on this because it's important to know
all that HP had to strip away in order
to make this one of the most affordable
7-inch tablets on the market today at
169 dollars however it is only $30
cheaper than a nexus 7 with twice as
much storage and better performance
pretty much all around sure you will
lose a camera in that jump but it's up
to you if that is worth it honestly I
think so and so there you have it
I give HP props for putting themselves
out there to make an affordable tablet
it's just such a disappointment that
something so well-constructed doesn't
have anything to show for it underneath
perhaps it's useful for us to take a
look at it from at least one positive
angle maybe a tablet that is this
affordable would make a great learning
tool for children but the mere fact that
I had to think outside of the box just
to justify the slate 7 should tell you
everything you need to know about it
it's a very worthy try especially in
design and I hope it only gets better
