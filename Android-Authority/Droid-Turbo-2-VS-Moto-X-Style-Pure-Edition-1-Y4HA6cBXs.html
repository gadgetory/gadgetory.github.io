authority and Motorola just announced a
Verizon exclusive the Droid turbo to
which they claim as a shatterproof
screen it looks like a very interesting
phone and we for a few moments of
playing around with a device we couldn't
help to see the similarities between the
droid turbo 2 and the Moto X pure which
Motorola also released not too long ago
if you're in the market for a new
Motorola phone you've got a tough choice
to make so let's dive a little deeper
and compare these two phones
the Droid turbo 2 versus the Moto X pure
first off like I said the droid turbo 2
is a Verizon exclusive so unfortunately
if you're not a Verizon customer you
won't be able to activate the turbo 2 on
your carrier it's the opposite with the
Moto X pure however where one size fits
all in a sense no matter what SIM card
you put in your Moto X pure the phone
should work flawlessly so in terms of
design both phones have similar looks
and features we have the camera and LED
flash surrounded by this metal border
with the Motorola dimple below which
creates a good resting point for your
finger on the droid turbo 2 that dimple
is a little higher than it is on the
Moto X pure and it feels a little more
natural to hold but this does depend on
your hand size now both of these films
designs can be customized by moto maker
so for both phones you can choose
between soft silicone leather and wooden
backings the accent colors are also
available to change
besides the larger metal frame around
the droid turbo 2 only other visible
difference between the two is the
speakers on the Moto X pure you have a
beautiful audio experience as it
features dual front-facing stereo
speakers they get very loud and sound
crisp and clear whereas the droid turbo
2 only has one speaker located on the
bottom right it doesn't get as loud as
the Moto X pure as it's just one small
speaker and the quality isn't as great
but it's still a decent sounding speaker
everything else is the same
volume and power buttons on the right
with the power button having a grippy
texture to it
headphone jack on top with access to
your SIM card and expandable storage and
we've got our micro USB ports on the
bottom there are very minor differences
in terms of size and weight however the
droid turbo 2 is a little shorter than
the Moto X
pure although a little wider just buy a
couple millimeters the back of the Moto
X pure is a little more rounded which
makes it a little thick at eleven point
one millimeters and while the droid
turbo 2 is quite flat is a little
thinner now without a doubt the biggest
area of difference between these two
phones is the display the droid turbo 2
offers a 5.4 inch quad HD display while
the Moto X pure sports a much bigger 5.7
inch quad HD display both screens are
beautiful but we'll have to give the
edge to the droid turbo 2 the turbo 2
has an AMOLED screen versus a pure LCD
panel so colors displayed on the droid
turbo 2 are much more vibrant and
saturated with deeper blacks both
screens are beautiful but the droid
turbo 2 takes it even further of course
with what Motorola is calling moto
shatter shield motorola claims that this
phone's display is shatterproof and in
the time that we've had the phone we've
tortured this thing dropping it on
cement over and over and the display
remains good as new if you're somebody
who's a little clumsy and known for
dropping their phone all the time
you may want to lean a little more
towards the Droid turbo to taking a look
under the hood both phones seem to look
very fast
although the droid turbo 2 once again
appears to be able to outperform the
Moto X pure the turbo 2 packs the
Snapdragon 810 processor while the Moto
X pure is stuck with an 808 processor
both offered drinking's of ram but once
again the droid turbo 2 offers something
that just is not compared to the Moto X
pure a three thousand seven hundred and
sixty milliamp hour battery versus a
three thousand milliamp hour battery
motorola claims that the droid turbo 2
can last for up to two full days of use
but that all depends of course on how
you use the phone we were pretty happy
with the battery life on the Moto X pure
but with a 25% bigger battery on the
droid turbo 2 is definitely the winner
however both phones are capable of being
charged with Motorola's turbo charger
which is the fastest on the market right
now you should be able to get 13 hours
of charge in just 15 minutes using this
charger the software experience is the
same on both phones at the moment both
are running Android lollipop 5.1.1 with
a marshmallow update coming in the
future and Motorola's version of Android
is pretty similar to stock Android
almost identical both phones are very
fast at navigating around you won't be
able to notice much liker stutters
anywhere throughout the software and
while Motorola didn't do
too much tinkering with their skin they
did add some cool features that can be
found on both phones like motor display
the alert see of your missed
notifications when waving your hand in
front and the nice gestures to launch
apps like the flashlight and camera
really the only difference you'll notice
when navigating through these phones is
the extra verizon apps that come
pre-installed with the droid turbo 2 in
terms of cameras both phones offer the
same 21 megapixel rear shooter and the 5
megapixel front-facing shooter and they
do a great job pictures come out very
beautiful although it can have a little
trouble in low light areas feel free to
take a look at the full reviews of these
phones to get a better understanding at
how great these cameras actually are now
pricing is where the Moto X pure can
finally take the crown with the Droid
turbo - having the extra edge in most
apartments is obvious that it's going to
be a little more expensive Verizon has a
24-month installment plan of $26 per
month for the 32 gig and $30 per month
for the 64 gig so translating that to
full pricing we're looking at six
hundred and twenty-four dollars and
seven hundred and twenty dollars
respectively the Moto X pure however
starts pretty low at 399 for the 16 gig
model four hundred and forty nine for 32
gigs and 499 for the 64 gig variant both
the droid turbo 2 and the Moto X pure
are great phones and for the most part
are very similar the only main
differences being the bigger battery and
shadow proof screen found on the droid
turbo 2 these two advantages do come
with a price though literally as the
droid turbo 2 is going to cost you about
$200 more than the Moto X pure so you'll
have to ask yourself if these extra
features are worth it well thanks for

turbo 2 and the Moto X pure be sure to
