Hindy the android authority app guy it's
the end of June which means it's time
for another one of our best apps of the
month first on our list this month is a
game called despicable me minion rush
there was one thing everyone liked about
this movie it was the minions and now
they have their own game what's nice is
that it's also pretty fun upon first
glance one would say that this is just
another temple run rip off and they
would be right thankfully gameloft has
added enough additional content to set
it apart from all those other Temple Run
ripoffs the games look nice the
cutscenes are fun and we enjoyed playing
the game despite its overused game
mechanics next up is a live wallpaper
called and I hope I'm pronouncing this
right ditta licks this unique and fun
wallpaper has literally thousands of
permutations and is really one of the
most customizable that we've ever seen
plus it's one of the few live wallpapers
where the settings are actually fun to
use there are a lot of options you can
use squares hearts owls and they even
pay an o2 XDA developers unfortunately
there are too many settings for us to
cover them all here so if you're into
live wallpapers you should definitely
check this one out our regular viewers
should recognize our next app called
duolingo it happens to be in our best
apps for kids list this is because it's
a great app for kids but it can also be
a great app for adults especially ones
who are looking to learn a second
language and don't have the time to take
a class duolingo is a very easy app to
use each lesson is set up in a way that
allows people to quickly complete
lessons so you don't have to sit around
tethered to a computer for hours it also
supports a whole bunch of languages of
learning more languages is up your alley
it's worth giving this one a shot next
up is a unique little app called
floating notifications for those who
have used or remember facebook
messengers chat heads imagine that the
chat head functionality was available
for any app sent notifications and
that's what this app does any app that
sends notifications can become a
floating notification and instead of
dealing with them as you normally would
you can take care of them directly from
anywhere this can be great if you're in
a hurry you don't want to leave an app
are you just like floating notifications
when we did our best keyboards list we
got a lot of flack for not including
Google stock keyboard there was a reason
and that's because it wasn't out yet
when the video was made google keyboard
is quite simply the stock google
keyboard for android jellybean 4.2 that
said it's a solid keyboard with all the
features of the stuff
keyboard it has traced typing and has
auto correction it looks nice and it's
just there and it's solid the voice
dictation was actor and everything
seemed to work fairly well overall this
is definitely a must-have for any
vanilla Android fan now our next step
quick social is for anyone who loves
their social networks if you're on
Facebook Twitter and Google Plus then
pay attention because this app could be
for you it allows people to post updates
on all three networks all at once or
individually it is a very simple app you
sign into your various social networks
then you go to your notification bar
where you can post to any network at any
time you can also use the quick social
feature to post to all three all at once
there isn't much there besides that but
it's a powerful tool for heavy social
media users next up is a very unique app
called sources pro this graphics app is
a lot of fun if you're into fractals and
things like that you can create custom
images with a number of tools that you
can tweak over and over again until you
get them how you want them there is a
learning curve and it is pretty steep we
had to test this one for quite some time
before we got the hang of it but once
you do it's quite fun to use especially
if you're into creating art this could
be fun for creating quick animations or
even background images while PlayStation
super nintendo gameboy advance and other
consoles have perfectly good emulators
nintendo 64 has been strangely absent
there were a few but they were usually
too broken to work well super n64 looks
to change all that and so far it's
working this is far and wide the most
stable Nintendo 64 emulator to date by
that I mean it works most of the time
there are bugs and graphical problems
here and there but that's to be expected
since this is an early release however
despite the errors it still actually
played the games we tested and they
performed fairly well it is free so no
complaints there and it only looks to
get better for those who somehow don't
know vine is a new social network that
features six second videos instead of
regular status updates like all the
other ones is it unique no not really
because other sites have done this
before however fine now has an android
app and people seem to like it you can
get all the functionality in the app
that you need to you can check out
what's trending individual posts your
activity your profile and pretty much
everything else yes you can even create
and post vines from your device not
going to lie it was kind of fun and a
recent update now lets you use your
front facing camera Disney has a number
of games based on their hit game called
where's my water this one is called
where's my Mickey and it's essentially
the same game mechanics except for
you're trying to get Mickey some water
so he can do a bunch of different things
for those who don't know here's how it
works each level has a finite amount of
water he must dig pass through the dirt
to collect stars and get the water to
Mickey it can be surprisingly tricky but
nothing that's overly difficult is it
fun oh yeah and who doesn't like Mickey
Mouse if you take a look at ye olde
leaderboard you can see how these new
apps stack up against one another keep
in mind that these are not how we rated
them but how you the people have rated
them in the google play store if you
want to check them out the app links are
in the video description we try to keep
these end of the month lists even with
games and functional apps usually games
kind of rule the list and it was nice to
see some good functionality apps make
their way to the top this month
especially useful ones like quick social
and floating notifications there are
thousands of apps released every month
so there's every possibility that we may
have missed a good one if we did and you
want to talk about it leave us a comment
and let us know once again I'm Joe Hindy
