Friday debate podcast by android
authority discussing topics in android
every week I'm of course your host for
the fdp Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody and this week we're talking
about project file or as Joe Hindy
wanted to call it project fee which is
essentially the wireless service that
google has announced recently
piggybacking off of t-mobile and Sprint
networks they're basically making their
own mvn oh and we talked about its
implications how we feel about the
project by itself I almost like fee
there and also how we feel about
Wireless in general the state of mobile
networks today the first 15 minutes of
the show however are dedicated to us
traceur catching up over the about what
we did over the past week or so and
making a couple of announcements of what
we're doing in the next couple of months
one in particular is that we're going to
a special trade show that we've never
gone to before so I hope you guys are
looking forward to that if the audio
sounds a little bit different right now
just for this intro it's because i
forgot my microphone where i'm editing
so i'm using the alcatel one touch idol
3 which i'm reviewing at the moment to
do this particular intro but without any
further ado keep it tuned to android
authority for even more from the ftp
even and also some changes are coming to
the show and we'll let you know what
those are in a couple of weeks probably
at the most and don't forget that next
week we have the LG g4 launch so wait
for all of my coverage and also the
podcast on our reactions to it so now
without any further ado enjoy episode
number 14 of the fdp project 5
so you guys I think I'm gonna like
totally request an invite for that
project fee thing fee or phi i think if
i visit if I I think I might buy it
could go either way that's the thing it
depends if you say Wi-Fi or we fee damn
nice dude yeah but in the in the in
the once hit TV show burn notice one of
the characters names was fee and it was
spelled fi so oh that's work i swear i
saw it you don't need a do you have a
nexus 6 to use the project fire or fee
no oh I'm just gonna quick request an
invite I'm actually gonna do it right
now on the podcast so I'm going to click
really loud so you can hear it ready
there you go that was me requesting an
invite yet everything a helicopter ride
a is I know now it was more of a
whatever you call it what a grand grand
display there alright so how's uh how's
everybody doing this week we had a hell
of a show last weekend known arava is
not gonna be on the show this week he's
actually busy right now talking some
peeps but again just a big thanks to the
guy for being there last week despite
all of the crap that we gave him him
being up at six in the morning where he
is and then me saying his name wrong the
entire freaking time I'm still mad about
that he made it he made a comment after
words in our in our little podcast chat
room thing that there were actually
people who listen to this podcast who
liked the way you said his name better
than the way his name actually sounds
ever all I can Aramis house way better
than when Rob Navia yeah it's so much
more exotic oh man but yeah after last
weekend and of course Jose lollipop rant
I went over way better than I thought it
would I listened to it I was like man I
sound like a dumbass and then like
everyone was like man you really knocked
it out of the park I was like okay note
to self sound like a dumbass more often
you were dead on though I mean you got
all the points right everything most of
us are concerned about with with
lollipop you nailed it so well I mean
you know it's just yeah I was
mumbling on like a like a crack addict
for a little while so I know I did not
watch any playoff hockey this week I
listened to the theme music for the once
hit TV show in Canada called the
littlest hobo which is probably the most
relaxing TV theme song of all time way
that was an actual TV show I thought yes
sir I thought you were just Nate like
calling the song something funny like no
no no that it was an actual show it's
about a dog that goes from town to town
installs people's problems um Mike Myers
the guy who played Austin Powers
actually uh played in an episode of that
oh wow he played a kid in a wheelchair I
think see I keep up with 70s Canadian
television up-to-date ish alright so I'm
guessing uh going pretty well right now
for for you Joe I mean words are no a
hockey game today I don't know there was
a hockey game I still watch it fair
enough so yeah how about how about other
guys over there feisty how are things
going over and your neck of the woods
you know things are good over here just
finished up my work with the ADB on the
Android customization series it quite a
bit of fun for me I like diving into the
developer side of things and of course
real developers are going to look at
everything I said and you know shrug it
off laughs it off because it's the
simplest of tasks that we perform but
hey if you're looking to dig a little
bit deeper trying to figure out how your
battery is you know what's killing your
battery faster than it should or or you
know file transfers screen recording
said adb's kind of a slick tool well
they might have some ulterior motive
because if you're teaching people how to
get into the whole programming business
then they're gonna have more competition
a bit I don't know well I took it from a
very user perspective you know there was
no developing no programming involved to
just you know how to install an APK from
your pc over to your android device
using adb you know something that is
totally easier to do by other means but
hey if you're in that situation it's
great to know how to do it yeah not
enough all right that's not pop it over
to grow see how are things going over
there good not a whole lot to report
at all I just read a good article right
now sorry I'm a little distracted
apparently there is a something called
Project Elysium it is a project for a
virtual reality project for the oculus
rift or whatever people call it um and
where they're apparently it's an
Australian company and they're making it
so you can put in people who died and
like interact with them it sounds really
trippy well yeah that'd be uh that's a
little weird yeah it's really weird like
you could somehow like the idea is
though you'll be eventually able to like
send in like pictures and stuff and
they'll make like a virtual model of the
person and like resurrect them basically
in virtual reality and just thinking oh
my gosh are we really gonna go that far
it's not gonna be I mean you're gonna
see an avatar of someone that you knew
but it just doesn't sound like you're
gonna get all of them obviously I mean
well the idea is to try to replicate
their personality so you could actually
have like a conversation with them like
I said it's a very early stage thing but
they're trying to get funding and it to
me it sounds kind of so that's why
distracted i was reading this um and I'm
like what the hell nope but that sounds
like it could be trouble seriously I
think that the idea is your
ex-girlfriend put her in there that uh
no you know your personality and there's
laws against that thankfully but you
know it sounds like it's got major
issues possible yeah and you know the
plot twist is that after you're done
talking to them that program gets
uploaded to the walking dead video games
well that's what that one of the
comments in this article from one of the
readers was it be they said let's eat
this would be really fun if you could
import your dead relatives in to grand
theft auto oh nice list the fun it's
like wow yeah people on the internet are
very maccabi yeah geez just a little oh
yeah nothing going on from he just an
ordinary day just ordinary day reading
up on potentially very dangerous and
very bad technology well what a geek wad
really did anything and it's
interesting Oh grocery really just walks
all day long mr. Fitbit champion over
there I'm not that that I've been lazy
well actually I haven't been lazy I've
been working all day but I've been lazy
as far as fitness goes I went for a 10
minute jog and i'm still at only 8000
steps screw you guys how do i think i
think all of you sit at your couch every
day and just shake your arm to get the
counter going is like I was like I'm
just kind of like really I can't get to
10,000 steps in a day I mean like today
was my easy day Joe and I think I still
hit like 12 no 11 I hate you either your
Fitbit is broken or mine is because mine
was a lazy day too and I got a quarter
of what you did well a lazy day I still
like walked like a couple miles and then
I mowed my yard but it was a lazy earth
day he walks he walks a lazy man to pick
up milk and pretty gross she said walk
to the grocery store groceries other job
as a part-time mailman he walks around
delivering easily i only had three
neighborhoods to walk through today was
it was a lazy day today was a lazy day
no dogs chased me you know aggression
when you say something like that like oh
I'm having a lazy day and I still out
walk to you by four thousand steps it's
the same thing is like when my skinny
friends say a man I feel so fat after
eating a six thousand calorie dinner and
it doesn't stick to them at all like
invited to six thousand calorie dinner
I'd probably have a stroke there were no
dog chases today but yesterday while I
was walking at like 930 I walk to buy
this house and it's like 10 year old
punk kid was a walking by see said he
said go to bed old man yeah cuz i'm old
i go to my old man yes go to bed already
first I thought he was like he surely
isn't talking to me you know but I
walked a little further and he screamed
it again in my direction it's like okay
whatever I'm sorry but you you are old
if in your head when that kid said that
you said to yourself surely he's not
talking to me oh that's funny look up
ten-year-old I would assume is the one
with the freaking bedtime just just
saying yeah well yeah you'd like that oh
man kiss x anymore I have your olds next
door to me or up until three o'clock in
the morning on weekends I was like
really okay whatever oh that's funny
surely you can't be talking about me now
I must go home and consume some
succotash in warm milk how did you know
mr. you go to bed you old man Jesus he's
gonna finish his warm Malkin and thud
we're gonna hear in the middle of the
pocket I'm not gonna say a word I
believe I'm the oldest of our group I
got my phonograph playing in the
background and yeah got my reading
glasses on you guys don't have bedtimes
do you i'm just now that we're on this
topic brushy um josh it's 1130 and I'm
podcasting but if I had a bedtime I
wouldn't be here yeah okay Joe I could
yeah I could see that definitely um I
just wonder yeah like dude do bloggers
have been times like sometimes I wonder
um depends I mean yeah I like to get up
early so typically I am in bed between
10 and 11 but I'm also other people who
it can just very very well I mean it's
you know some days I'll be up to like
you know two or three in the morning and
then up again at like six and then other
times I'll beat a bit like eight o'clock
it just kind of depends on see that's
something your Fitbit would be with a
track is it yep you know what you have
kids just whatever you can sleep did you
do oh yeah that's true yeah crazy logs
into his Fitbit dashboard clicks the
sleep button and it goes LOL adam in
fact my sleep LOL no i bet you if i see
you have to have a bed time since we're
since we're completing this little round
of tangent certainly if i am not asleep
by 4am it's gonna be a lot it was
because you guys are all like when you
as you guys probably all go well I know
Joe doesn't go to bed super late
typically I don't think right oh yeah
except I have a more like a one am kind
of guy no I I stopped talking to all of
you guys at 1i yeah I said all of you
are super super late i'm pretty much the
opposite but then again i'm also up
usually at like four or five in the
morning well i'm going right nicely
padded psyched I'm waking up usually
when you people are going to bed you
people yeah yeah that's raises nocturnus
says to the other two white guys in the
Filipino you people yeah but yeah yeah
you know I'm a one of those people who
can easily switch my schedule though my
sleeps well you know that I mean I was
when we were at CES I easily you know
switched over to being up till four in
the morning oh yeah you know I I could
switch back that that was rough when I
got back home which back again oh yeah I
can imagine and I remember to like I
think one night it was just me and you
up because you were writing and I was
editing like I remember that's god well
you don't you know during events Josh
doesn't even sleep he like takes like
micro sleeps like he'll be like working
and then just like crash and then like
about 20 minutes later he's up and he's
working again like he didn't even miss a
beat almost 2 million people like that
it works very well for him but I would
like to say that I was all by design but
how obvious it was it and I always just
wake up two hours later from a quick nap
saying the name of the phone that I'm
trying to hit for the little G flex 2 0
over here i'm i'm actually trying to
like the main development for me is
there a couple funny videos coming up I
I have a couple videos one for android
authority in one technically for myself
on the car that I got to review now the
funny situation with this car it's we
got it from Hyundai and it's a it was a
beautiful car hyundai sonata limited
edition not limited edition but said
limited on the back because i had
everything in it thirty-two thousand
dollar card for everything that it was
it came with that's a really good price
and that would be part of my car
view that I'm doing for sort of a
personal endeavor of my own but the main
crux of it was we were supposed to
review Android auto they brought us a
car without it it was the worst thing
like it was the worst thing at the time
and then they said well I mean you did
sign for two weeks so go ahead and just
use the car and we'll talk about getting
you android auto later it's like all
right so I started looking at their blu
link gap and that's what the video is
going to be about and what smart phone
connectivity is like in cars right now
are the systems we have better or could
they still be better than what Android
auto can can can offer so that's kind of
what's going on there but aside from
that I'm trying my best to finally get
back into gaming again I have these
peaks and valleys where I game a lot and
then I don't because one thing that I'll
be proud to say on the podcast right now
is actually we're going to e3 yes yes we
are yeah so we're all super stoked about
that finally you guys can come to my
neck of the woods in LA and we'll have a
good time and a side note 16 17 18
that's III 19 my birthday in June so
yeah for me it was awesome too because
my birthday is at june seven oh man so i
turned 30 so it's like lots of Awesome
30th birthday present there you go yeah
for sure antiques dreams come true i
mean i've been obsessing about III since
back in the days when you uh you know
you opened up you did order to get you
three news you opened up magazine that
came like a week later Game Informer or
something yeah there be a game informer
yes I had a subscription to game yeah
man reeju back back then there you
didn't have you know I mean yes the
internet existed but a lot of people
didn't have you know reliable you know
well even when I was little it didn't
really exist that much I mean not like
it does today it was very different yeah
and so yeah these III events were I mean
they were there were articles but like
video no good luck with the hat I'm not
sure you know a dial-up connection good
luck watching video I mean I know for I
mean uh if i'm not mistaken Joey or
you're coming along this trip right i'm
going to try folks okay um so you know
given that Joe will be hopefully be
there obviously we're gonna culturally
you know android gaming android apps
that are being shown you know
bull but we're obviously gonna you know
branch off and see all the games that we
want to see but obviously yeah we're
visiting Nintendo I've already made that
very clear to Darcy we're going to the
done though darn it well I've been
trying to keep up with what will
possibly be shown there I see ya there
obviously certain games that are super
like like like really anticipated and
one in particular that I'm anticipating
is the witcher 3 um now I never finished
the witcher 1 and I'm like a third into
which or two so I was like I have to
start gaming against a catch up so I'm
not behind when I could eat three so I
picked up a couple games the other day I
got shadow of mordor before three
already came out know which would 3 wild
hunt that's gonna it didn't come out
already it's it's not it's uncommon for
upcoming someone's off to the googles
Yeah right where is it you know yeah
this is how much we don't want to talk
about our topic this week for 15 minutes
because I swear I saw it on Steam the
other day unless it was just like no pre
order dated pretty honor that's what oh
is it is the I see ya it doesn't matter
to me anyway because i still haven't
beat sure to that's our need to go back
and do that exactly i reinstalled it on
my steam and i wanna i really want to
get into it that way i know it's coming
yeah I guess you're right it doesn't
come until when is it coming that I mean
asked me right around then right cuz
it's been well ok well I just looked at
it it says may 19 so it's gonna be there
before but before e3 so I say I thought
it was coming soon yeah so technically
i'm wrong but still I'm trying to catch
either of us were right we're really bad
about dates around here so maybe 19 ok
so that's fine but at the same time you
know I want to make sure to catch up
with a lot of stuff so that you know
when I go there I'm not I'm not so
behind on games that I can't talk to
anybody about him and stuff like that so
you know picking of that Mortal Kombat
ten I'm really hoping to get started on
that soon more Kombat X rather but yeah
you know it's just small update on my
side and just just kind of excited to
say that we're all that we're going to
be able to go to e3 and see what happens
there um but ok now we can go ahead and
jump into our topic
brushy you uh we went back to our poll
for today right yep all right how did
the results go on that pole um pretty
much everyone wanted to talk about
project Phi or fee as that Joe calls it
um but there were a lot of people who in
the comments that said that they wanted
that you know they were hoping that we
talked about some of the others too just
because project fee is or Phi now I'm
saying he tall table it was off the
tongue better than projects 50 plus you
know a plus B doesn't have that douchey
connotation that like you get from like
a frat house like I'm from Kappa beta
phi hahaha well I subscribe to project
file like nope p screw you see it struck
me the other Road you know fee fie foe
fum their levels no wireless carriers
the big giant in the room right anyway
you know what that's like right that's
that's a great connection but you know
the it's not you know it's it's us
specific that is the specific thing and
obviously we have a lot of you know
listeners that are not in the US so you
know so you guys one of the least touch
on some of the other stuff but I mean I
think it's still interesting even you
know to everyone but it obviously is
more kind of a u.s. you know topic well
I was I was thinking about it a lot
today and to be honest I do actually
think we can fill the hour with project
Phi and um they're gonna be a number of
different ways that we can look at it
but since you the fans wanted us to talk
about it that's the other reason why I
was like let's let's see how far we can
go with this also um so to start us off
crush was the one who did the article
basically reporting on the the emergence
of project file want you going to give
us a rundown as to what exactly this is
oh sure you're gonna put me on the spot
alright so basically uh I mean who
hasn't heard it I mean all the rumors
were going long before it ever got
announced but basically Google is
started its own MVNO and it's using
sprint and tmobile networks with a
combination of Wi-Fi the idea is to
create a network that can seamlessly
switch between them and if i'm not
mistaken without dropping the call
basically is the idea
so you know you can be in the middle of
a call at all of a sudden oh you have a
stronger Wi-Fi connection it pulls you
on and get you don't lose anything you
know where you were at and there's a lot
of other little perks involved like if
you bought it spritz prepaid so let's
say you by five gigabytes of data but
you only use three gigabytes well
they'll refund you heck even if you use
like three point two gigabytes they'll
refund you the difference you know they
don't round up or anything and so
basically the idea is to get a service
where you're going to be covered by
someone pretty much everywhere you go is
the idea with no drop you know dead
drops or whatever you want to call it
yeah it's pretty much the rundown this
it's pretty straightforward and it's
it's there's also like I said there's
them they're opening up things like you
can use it in 120 plus countries
obviously it's still only for us people
but if they're traveling abroad also
there's some cool stuff like to use any
device that you have hangouts installed
you can you can use with a project Phi
you have to have a nexus 6 phone at the
moment um but that's probably right now
it's invite-only program kind of like
like the in ba inbox by Gmail was but i
think by the time it opens up to the
public you know widespread i imagine
we'll see you know samsung galaxy s6 and
other partners you know come on board
yeah shocked if we didn't well to be
fair the Nexus 6 has that functionality
built in but it's cuz yeah it works with
sprint it works with yeah I had all the
right carrier stuff and so it was just
set up perfectly which was interesting
to me because it seemed to me that
Google had some forward-thinking when it
was building the Nexus 6 00 i'm sure i'm
sure they were planning this long before
you know came announced i mean we've
been hearing rumors about this for you
know really it different rumors about
this for years ya know it you know to
some degree you know that for years
we've been hearing or how Google was
gonna get involved in the wireless
karabus and so I'm sure you know you
know they don't just wake up one day say
hey let's do this now you know I'm sure
this was years in planning and so the
Nexus 6 would probably planned all along
for this yeah definitely a few a few
details so even if the Nexus 6 is the
only device that
be able to switch between the different
networks they obviously being Wi-Fi
hotspots like imagine at starbucks or
tmobile or sprints just to be able to
jump among among those the other core
functionality of it not even mentioning
the data plans the actual cost of the
service and the ability to use it across
all Google Hangouts I imagine those will
be able to be used on any device you
just have to have that yeah that's some
good that was kind of my ex I didn't
really clarify it but yeah anything as
Google Hangouts you can use with your
number so like you could call someone
from your laptop using your number even
if your phones in another room or you
know heck it's not even anywhere near
you you know miles away exactly so
that's kind of cool it's like it's like
google voice on a SIM cards as well
simply well that's basically what they
did is they use that technology and then
you know when that got baked into
hangouts you know basically it's
utilizing that part of that technology
for it okay and just one last
clarification detail of 20 bucks gets
you unlimited talk and text and then
it's ten dollars per every gig there we
go and then you get refunded if you
don't use a certain amount of eggs all
right cool so with all of that in mind
so now Google is jumping into the
wireless game and yes they are
piggybacking off of the networks that
sprint and t-mobile have that's part of
the reason why they are able to go to
120 plus countries with 2g connectivity
that's what t-mobile does so I'm gonna
throw it to our other guys feisty let's
start with you any general let's start
off with some general reactions how do
you feel about project Phi with all
these details we have this far I'm going
to split this up into two parts first
you're going to get my initial reaction
when I first read it what are you guys
thinking seriously why are you doing
this it's terrible my initial reaction
was this is horrid well you know it's
limited to one phone I know more will
come but it's limited to one phone it's
an invite system the price tag is pretty
much what you're going to pay anywhere
else anyways you stick with tmobile for
example you can already go to those 220
other countries and there was one little
piece of wording in here that was like
for twenty dollars a month you get
unlimited talk text and usage of your
own Wi-Fi
that you're already paying for oh that's
why I added that at the end yeah uh you
know it's just you guys said it you know
part two I've had a chance to a day and
a half to think about it now and it
makes sense it's a great evolution of
where google voice into hangouts has
been going but it it's not revolutionary
it's good it's not revolutionary and I
can't use it now a personal note I look
at their coverage map as I look at any
of the other coverage maps I live just
outside of a big city not far out by by
the way just outside but it's kind of a
mountainous area and i get 0 signal at
my house zero whatsoever from any of
these carriers so i'm already using the
Wi-Fi over the hangouts that's my only
option does that make you know project
phi good for me I don't know i'm i mean
i've already i'm already using it so to
speak for free I just add yeah um I'm
stuttering on out of frustration because
I don't like what I'm seeing so far ok
so well I mean did the coverage that
t-mobile and Sprint have or rather lack
it is one of the glaring problems with
this particular thing I mean I I know a
bunch of people I think crush aren't you
on verizon for that particular reason or
um no there are a lot of people my area
I'm actually on AT&amp;amp;T Oh your knees well
actually I'm not on ATM on cricket
because AT&amp;amp;T sucks but it's the same
thing it's yeah they're using the same
networks right well a cricket is owned
by AT&amp;amp;T yeah so well yeah the UH it's
the coverage map and I I did feel that
way also I kept thinking to myself all I
live in LA obviously so this is a huge
hub for out for tmobile and I only ever
really frequent places that you would
have that kind of coverage same thing
with sprint it would seem to me that if
Google really wanted to make a splash
with this particular program they would
want you know 18 T and Verizon and I
guess something we can touch on a little
bit later is whether or not they would
be able to reel in those people but
obviously t-mobile and Sprint have been
friendly as to the Google ecosystem how
about you Joe how do you feel about
project fee will uh will do it properly
for each person baby thank you no I'm
gonna do this feisty style and go with
my initial reaction and then after I
thought about it my initial reaction was
actually 180 degrees from feisty I was
so excited I was like project fee fie
foe Frick um I'm so excited about this
here cuz like yo I'm used to seeing what
Google has done in so many other
ecosystem obel and what Google Drive did
to cloud storage and you know what
Google Plus did the social networking
and I'm like they're gonna do the same
thing to wireless carriers and then part
two I read about what they're going to
do and I was like well this is very
disappointing that this is that scene in
the bedroom where the guys all like I
swear to go there's never happened to me
before it's exactly like that and um and
then as I continue bringing a par three
now part 3 what is what Abel is it
figured it out it's it's it's an average
MVNO you know like other NVA knows
charge right around the same thing I
mean you can get what would be the
equivalent to you know it's unlimited
whatever blah blah through straight talk
and all that stuff for like 50 60 bucks
and and then I had time to think about
it the more I think about project fee
the more I don't like it like there's
just more things about it that just kind
of like you know shake my angry bushes
and um I don't know why I just said that
right but like it's those things like
you have to look and you look at the
whole Google ecosystem you know they you
know are the the e cosa and Android
itself you know they did the next s
where they you know drop the SD card
slot they wanted people to be more cloud
oriented they have google play music and
you know Google Drive and Google Docs
were all cloud based stuff Google is all
web and then they come in charge you for
web connection like that doesn't make
any sense to me it's like a catch-22 so
the more ingrained you are into Google
services the more Google's mobile
service is going to cost you like just
Google is going to cost you even more
money with you and that seems really
messed up to me especially from a
company that you know over the last year
has been launching balloons into almost
space to beam Wi-Fi down to this planet
for free and then to come out with
something like this where it's 10
gigabyte or one or ten dollars per
gigabyte and at the end of the day this
is how I look at it what you get is you
get accessed for you know unlimited talk
and text for twenty dollars and zero
gigabytes of data and then anything that
use after that is overage charges is
essentially all it is overage charges
for what you for what data you use it's
off of Wi-Fi and it's essentially
republic Wireless but more expensive
what you get refunded for what gigs in
that ten dollar span that extra ten
dollar span like like grocery said if
you use if you go over one gigabyte and
then you use maybe like point2 of a
gigabyte you get those eight dollars
back is what that look equated yes yeah
so well I mean I look at other you know
I mean there are most people and I
understand that most people don't use
more than three four five six gigs a
month um but everybody I know and this
is anecdotal I I just said that this is
anecdotal so anybody in the youtube
comments will get mad at me for this
everybody I know uses between 10 and 40
gigs of data every month like my brother
doesn't have cable TV he watches netflix
on his phone oh I what to ask who are
these people oh yeah this is a good to
cuz I don't even hardly use like a half
a gig I mean I don't know I sit in front
of a dual screen monitor desktop on a 50
megabit connection all day long and I
still use 10 gigs a month and I think of
cuz you know my brother is on my
t-mobile plane because we have that two
lines unlimited everything for a hundred
dollars oh yeah and if if we moved to
project fee my phone bill this month
would be over five hundred dollars and
you know it oh yeah i'm using 50.2
gigabytes thanks for the eight bucks
back you freaking bankrupting jerk-offs
like it would cost me more than brent
what the hell is eight dollars back
going to do for me so you know it's it's
one of those things where you know
project eight it just just like pretty
much everything else google has done
you know it's for a certain type of
person if you travel a lot if you don't
use a lot of mobile data you know if
you're really ingrained into google
services but not so much that you're
like streaming music on google music all
day long then it's going to you know
then i suppose it could probably be
pretty good but at the end of the day
like I just it just doesn't feel like a
step forward in any meaningful way
outside I mean there's a couple cool
little features like the switching
between the networks and the Wi-Fi is
kind of cool I guess and I heard from
somewhere that they do a VPN to like
there's VPN built into it hmm and I
you're like oh man that's gonna be so
cool people need more VPN like of course
I need VPN they're being freaking
they're they're jacking into Wi-Fi
networks on the random like you're gonna
need protection if you're gonna force
somebody on to you know a random
starbucks as they're driving by you
don't know who's on that starbucks
connection at your drive you could be in
the ski be part of town it could be like
a jerk in there trying to snip your
packets and stuff so I mean I don't
consider the VPN something like
revolutionary or innovative I think it's
something that has to be there for this
not to be the worst idea of all time
yeah i agree with that part and and you
know what i do agree with with your
assessment like if you are the kind of
person who uses let's say more than five
gigabytes at any given month then i
agree that that hope you probably will
not like the pricing the pricing tier of
project phi um but that being said
though okay so i have tmobile and ATT
the main reason being because i just
like to have two phones on me like let's
say half the time I don't do it all the
time but I have I have them available
and I pay like 90 bucks from my t-mobile
because I paid the extra for tethering
and then ATT I just keep it pretty base
even with the ATT base that I have I
feel like if I only use let's say three
gigabytes knowing that i'm using Wi-Fi
at home I'm locally downloading my
google play music so i'm not really
streaming it i could save like 50 bucks
alone compared to my t-mobile my
t-mobile plan now of course tethering is
a whole different story and they haven't
talked
that but the thing that makes me laugh
about this is the very people who could
benefit the most from it or not the
people who would know the most about
project Phi yeah no you know what I mean
ya know you were nerds we use lots of
mobile data we are on the internet
frequently project Phi is not for us
that's the crazy actually I don't know I
would almost consider it personally but
see like i said i don't i'm at home most
of the time you know or well you know
like Wi-Fi like every other person your
age krushi you're not you know you don't
use your your mobile for uh for the
facebooks and uh candy crush's like us
kids good well and I do it I do stuff on
Wi-Fi and I am old that is true hahaha
dude you're not even two years older
than me not on a 10 year yeah told you
you know it must be true guys you know
you made me think how could people even
live with you said that you have people
in your family Joe that don't have a
connection besides there I don't know
how you could even do that and I just
looked you had me curious I just looked
up how many gigabytes i use on time
warner and last month was 600 gigs so do
i can get over that there's a project at
arab aight almost every month but that's
bad might before that was a terrible
well is between the netflix in the
YouTube ins I mean I find out a lot of
60 I don't know a lot of steam games and
stuff oh yeah that'll do it too but
hello the problem is and we don't even
wear cord cutters too so yeah too but
I'm not trying to tell like a sob story
or anything but you know my brother you
know he works one of them you know fast
food fast foody kind of jobs and doesn't
make the cash money's been so yeah I
mean yeah and you know I mean work
together on a phone plan you know he
Forks out 50 bucks a month and gets
internet and essentially cable TV well
not essentially cable TV but you know
television content you know and then
adding actual cable television an actual
internet that is comparable to the 40
megabits you know internet that he gets
from t-mobile would cost him an extra
one hundred and twenty dollars a month
and I mean he just doesn't
want to do that he doesn't have you know
that much extra leeway in his paychecks
I've known people who've done that all
sigh I had a friend a year ago whose
mother she she just basically her entire
digital life was on a note 2 and it was
via t-mobile's unlimited plans and
whatnot and she had just just a fine
time with it you know I shudder to think
how much that woman would be spending on
project Phi good lord ya know exactly
like you look into those other use cases
and and the reason why I bring up such
use cases cuz i know not a lot of people
are like that right now but that's the
way it's gonna be in the future you know
and like not like too far into the
future either and i guess that gives
google time to change unless they really
want to like keep this and you know i
don't even know how to pronounce the
word a lot i've only ever seen as well
niche niche niche yeah niche okay sorry
I'm an idiot sometimes and that's one of
those nice nice nice nike alright so
okay but it is really an IG product
somewhere near out is sneezing got have
Americans um but uh you know it's you
look into the future everything's on the
cloud everything is you know in cloud
storage everything is being streamed
these days and it's just gonna get more
and more prevalent and I think that when
you have a mobile service that doesn't
embrace that inevitable future as sling
TV mm um I think it's just I think it's
a step backwards especially you know and
it's disappointing especially from
google a company that has so many times
over the last 15 years been the catalyst
for giant steps forward including the
giant step forward to the cloud which
makes this step backward even possible
well to me it's okay so well one thought
that came to mind there is okay so
something I've I when I first saw this I
I did think this is sort of like a half
a hat I like that like a like a
half-completed idea and gosh that is how
i roll all the time just go with a pro
okay this is like a half-completed idea
they have the right they have the right
idea they just haven't really hash tout
all of the details yet now the part of
it that I think is really great is that
they're basically telling the wireless
carriers and I'm going to get into this
a little bit later with you guys they're
pretty much telling the wireless carrier
is that their current models suck and
maybe the only one may be the only one
that doesn't really fit that description
at the moment is t-mobile because they
have been doing some pretty great stuff
but then again t-mobile is the one that
has been the catalyst for change in
other carriers like you know the ATT
next program you know not having to pay
the subsidy or not having to worry about
the subsidies name or just pay the phone
little by little over two years instead
of you know getting roped into a
contract now everyone's doing it even
verizon's doing it of all people and now
Google is trying to create this change
where they're trying to consolidate the
network's while providing an
easy-to-understand wireless service now
the whole idea of it going from why
fights it let's say 4G and back again
you know without any drops or anything
like that that's more of a nerdy side
but but that makes me think that I think
Google what they're trying to do is
future proof their product their service
for the idea that Wi-Fi hotspots now now
you guys can chime in after I say this
if you don't agree with me or if or if
you do Wi-Fi hotspots will probably
become just as ubiquitous as the mobile
networks themselves oh yeah you
definitely will yeah they definitely
will it's that the problem is is that
you know public Wi-Fi is like the number
one security risk for all people surfing
the web outside of their homes well
that's why they had the language in
there that said especially places with
Google Fiber I remember that was
specifically put into that into into
their literature google fiber that was
that was a huge step forward that I mean
circa you know completion date is circa
2200 at this point the year twenty two
hundred and we're gonna do one
metropolitan area every two years until
Larry page's great-great grandchild is
the CEO well I think the
I mean the the whole idea that somebody
uses all mobile data and that could
really jack up the cost it seems to me a
move that Google would have known would
suck so that's why it makes me think
that these mobile hot there's Wi-Fi
hotspots in establishments across the
country let's say like we already have
starbucks and forgot six McDonald's is
doing it now too they are going to be
places that you'll always have a refuge
and you'll always be able to in pretty
much any major establishment to be able
to not have to worry about using those
gigabytes and have to pay so much I'm
imagining a conversation at guys having
with his wife someday down the road when
he engages with project 5e um honey I'm
gonna go run to mcdonalds why well the
new season of house of cards is out in
the cables down and I don't really want
to pay any more from mobile data so i'm
gonna go spend the rest of my evening
eating apple pies and taking advantage
of the free refills watching netflix
like a de lo it's just it's it seems
like a lot of complicated stuff like it
seems like over you know over management
uh uh le you know that again half
completed thoughts this is how we roll
at the ftp podcast folks um you know it
seems like it'd be easier just to be
able to stick to a connection and not
have to worry about it like i mean if
you want to jump from Wi-Fi to mobile
that's fine you know especially if you
put in the security things in there to
make it viable I admit that that is a
good idea but when you charge for the
mobile debt when you charge so much for
the mobile data um it goes right back to
the same thing that people were
complaining about years ago about how
you know tiered data plans are stupid
and how people you know can't use their
phones the way they want to use them
because I have to make sure instead of
you know oh I don't want to go over and
get charged more money now it's oh I
have to go find a Wi-Fi hotspot first
it's the same problem with a different
name you know if on it I'm on a
different page than you i don't think
the pricing is that bad yeah that's what
i was going to say like it is dumb it is
i mean yes there are unlimited
for like sprint and tmobile but if
you're someone like myself who doesn't
have access to t-mobile or sprint sprint
a little bit but sprint I would never go
back to and that's a story for another
time but anyway if you don't have access
to those or you're in a bad area for
Sprint t-mobile there's not a whole lot
of unlimited plans out there and if you
look at the price if you add like two
gigabytes you know you're paying two
gigabytes 40 bucks by time you're done
so you know you're because you're paying
you know ten dollars for each gig and
then the twenty dollar fee to be on fee
or fire whatever live TV uh anyway
that's forty dollars that's about what
you're paying like cricket it's 35 and
get 2.5 gigabytes so that's a little
more but it's pretty comparable to other
MVNOs so I think your complaint really i
mean it's it's valid but i think i think
we're kind of what i think basically
you're real upset is that it's just not
any different than any other MVNO right
i mean it's not i don't think it's any
worse it just may not be better well
it's it's worse hey it's not and i
already said that i already said that
it's not any better well i know but you
make it sound like they're uh charging a
bajillion dollars you know compared to
everyone else I don't think they are yes
there are unlimited class but it's the
way they're doing it you know it's the
whole like you know that they try to
make them they try to make something
that's not that great sound great you
know it's it's it's way that that's the
complaint if they came up right out and
said look you know we're gonna charge
you for every gigabyte of data you use
starting at zero you know if they were
up front honest about it I probably
would have stopped ranting about it five
minutes ago but you know it's the whole
like you know yeah we're gonna switch
back and forth from Wi-Fi to you know to
mobile data to save you money money that
you're charging me you know it's like
when a bookie like really taking a bet
pair paying a bet or take a paying
someone's winnings by taking another bet
you know like opal the bits free because
you already won this last one you know
it's like it just seems like hmm i don't
think project x is to save money though
i don't think that's really the idea
behind it no the idea
it's idea of improving coverage yet you
know and preventing draw my charges then
why charged for data at all why not just
put a flat rate there you need 20 you
know like they could have done it a lot
of different ways is what I'm saying is
they could have done the twenty dollars
and then Wi-Fi only they could have done
thirty dollars for a gig you know forty
dollars two gigs and then like is
certainly the thing and then it is sort
of nice to see what it doesn't know how
many different and then and a certain
point just say screw it unlimited data
so that so this is like me can i change
this can enjoy the expanded networks can
enjoy that the new technology and not
have to stay behind it where i am now
because i use too much data for it well
that's the thing like I I realized that
we were gonna get to that point I think
that we have been spoiled by the word
unlimited we we completely have been
because if there's one thing that that
that really makes the phone carriers
that the while the mobile carriers clamp
down on their customers more than
anything it's the cost of data the cost
of bandwidth and one thing we've never
done for users is help educate them on
how to keep their mobile costs down now
obviously it's not something like water
that is a resource that we have to
really especially here in California for
God's sake it's something that we have
to actually conserve but the same time
it is the same thing that will make
these wireless carriers uh you know bump
up the prices on everything and it makes
it makes all of it makes everything more
expensive when there's no bandwidth to
go around and just the cost of being
able to send it all out I think we're
spoiled by the word unlimited to be
honest and if somebody is able to learn
how to use the Wi-Fi at home and then
maybe only use two gigabytes well
there's forty dollars and otherwise an
unlimited plan would cost 55 and they're
already saving fifteen dollars based
upon how much they were going to use
that month anywhere that's just that's
just my thought I honestly do think that
the word unlimited is thrown around way
to watch when it comes to mobile that's
one of those things it's a wholly
different conversation but the problem
isn't that it cost them too much is that
they're still developing their
infrastructure and they're doing it at a
not very good
they're not doing it they're not
upgrading their infrastructure to meet
with demands because you know that this
whole thing has happened with the ISPs
already and uh in my neck of the woods
the only ISP that still throttles data
is AT&amp;amp;T u-verse nobody else cares
because they have the bandwidth there
because they they made the proper
adjustments to their infrastructure they
limit people to speeds and this is this
is the thing that I don't understand why
does white if bandwidth is such a huge
deal if not everybody can have them you
know all the data is why aren't people
like you know white just drop it down to
25 megabits like we need any more than
that you know instead of limiting how
much data we can consume why not just
limit the speed of the data that we
already have so that more people can
access it um for those who don't know
bandwidth is essentially like a freeway
you know and only so much data can come
through it but if everyone's limited to
just a certain number of roads on that
giant freeway then there's more space
for everybody instead of everybody
trying to gain as much as humanly
possible cuz I saw somebody who's
getting like 90 megabit on a t-mobile
LTE connection why why you don't need
that I agree with HD on netflix on a 6
megabit connection you don't need more
than 25 and lock it down to 25 to you
know 25 down slow angry Joe smash it is
because no I think the idea that I have
to watch how much data i use every month
is freaking absurd like I'm sorry like
you know the whole spoiled by a limited
I'm probably spoiled by and limited I'll
give you that one but uh it's it's a
it's the internet this is 2015 we live
in an era where everything is on the
internet and by limiting the amount of
data that people are allowed to have
every month it's essentially saying you
can only have so much you know internet
at it I it's just it's so silly to me no
I agree and I and I and don't get me
wrong i'm not i'm not advocating for
everyone to be limited but you know it's
just this whole idea that people get up
in arms whenever either on the one
and you brought up another good point
like on the one hand if you take away
this idea of unlimited people get pissed
if you have if you have this idea that
everyone gets this super high-speed but
in avila even even to your point even if
we were to slow down people speeds in
order to open up the traffic for
everybody rather than worry about how
much data worried about the speed that
everyone does there's oh man there's
gonna be so many so many pissed-off
people then why is my why is my phone
not going at 99 miles per hour why is it
not going at 20 right at that point well
here's the thing there are already so
many pissed-off people I had a guy on
Google+ today literally chew me out over
this because he's sick and tired of
going into the city and having you know
his data just drops down to like 56k
speeds because it's a huge congested
area and I guess you know he was coming
from the same frame mind that you are
where people are paying for data than
they're using less data and then
congested areas get to ease up a little
bit my idea you know I mean it's the
same thing we're at the end of the day
the ideas reach for the same goal to
ease up the congestion right yeah thanks
for bein if you think about it that's
what buys anything for is that if that
guy is getting bad you know bad data
would switch to different cellular
network in he'd no longer have the issue
and also if he's going to be paying 10
bucks per gigabyte it'll be more to the
point I was making earlier not
necessarily saying that this is ideal
for everybody but if everybody is aware
of how much they're going to end up
spending then it would also use up the
traffic in that way as well true I don't
know I mean I guess to me I just feel
like the I understand how ambient you
know I think I don't think it's
affordable for an MVNO to offer
unlimited data I think they you know
because they're you know they're buying
you know their data in buckets basically
from carriers and I just don't think
that's that that's feasible at this
point maybe eventually but I think at
this point it's not you know and because
I mean no one's I mean no MVNO has has
unlimited it's not a single like correct
sir who is okay with straight to a
simple mobile go ahead what was that Phi
C go ahead
sorry I'm with simple mobile it is
unlimited now they do throttle it after
your monthly at X amount okay yes
actually you're right there are quite a
few that have well even I think cricket
is technically it's just that you get
like a 128k after lose your amount but i
don't think that i guess i don't
consider that truly unlimited because I
mean it's crappy after a little while so
you might as well it can still look it
it can still load a facebook feed you
know or you know it so you can still
post a tweet on on a 2g network and you
know what's funny good point so
something I just thought of if google it
I care you know what this whole
conversation could have been avoided if
Google had done one thing if they had
given us free 2g ya mean I sex like yeah
you're right if it would have had put a
toggle in there turn off the 4g let me
surf on the Wi-Fi you know on the wifis
for free and then the 2g network for
free well and avoid the 4g networks
entirely and not charge for it how
awesome would that be though who's you
know that i used to say that that's not
the case right now though well yeah I
mean honestly they haven't fully
announced everything you have to realize
that it's not available for another like
week like one cricket was first well
back when it was a yo wireless or
whatever uh they weren't very specific
on their terms but then it came out to
light that yes you could continue to use
it after you use juice your base amount
and so who knows I mean considering
sprint and t-mobile both have the
structure for that it may be you know
cuz we might be making we might be
making you know an issue out of
something that isn't an issue it's hard
to say at this point I'm willing to bet
that Google will that the project fire
is going to take on that model where you
put in the money that is then used and
then when that money runs out yeah you
know I I think cuz that's a pretty
common way of doing pay as you go ah
like yeah I wanted to do a temperature
check over there feisty how are you
doing in a front row seat into this
heavyweight bout yeah I'm sorry yeah we
Joe and I kind of don't know no problem
it was letting you guys set the
groundwork so you realize it is Friday
sunny day picnic podcast guys supposed
to be friends
process of trying to find a new name for
the show and for everything for all you
fans who have been using hashtag fdp I'm
sorry if that does change the near
future no but yeah well I just got your
popcorn yeah I I wonder like real bag
you guys do realize I don't think it's a
bad idea I don't think probably cuz this
it's something I've had to deal with all
day two days people like well you
obviously think it sucks no no I think
its lackluster I don't think that I just
think it's boring it's it's not in my
own personal my own personal opinion on
it is I actually agree with you you know
I never actually stayed in my opinion I
think it's a great concept but
implementation yeah i agree with you i
don't think it's exciting to me it's no
better and no worse than any other MVNO
it's there's get ipad i mean to me but
what I'm excited about is their
technology behind it the idea to
seamlessly switch between is really
potentially useful especially coming
from where I live okay I envision a
network whether it's you know project
Phi or whether it's someone else
eventually that can give me this and
maybe no one can wear imagine if you had
one you know service that could
seamlessly you know that bought
basically minutes from all the major
carriers and even like regional carriers
like US cellular and ghost handoff
between all of them and so basically no
matter where you went while traveling
you would be guaranteed to get something
you know even it wasn't a great
connection you would always have a
connection and you know you would have
you know minimal drops for me I live in
a small for those who don't know
obviously all you guys who were you know
host you know no but for our listeners I
live in a cornfield basically we don't
have houses around here they're just
kept cornfields and cow okay a little
more than that but I live in a small
town in the Midwest near a big city but
not in the city anyway um I have where
I'm at in my town there is a TT coverage
there's a rise and their sprint there's
usle there's everyone but t-mobile but
you go 20 minutes over and there's a
town where US cellular
is it in fact there's actually a whole
like section where US cellular is it um
all around me US cellular and I don't
have you a cellular so I just when I'm
in those areas I just go off grid
basically um or go to people's my
friends who live in that area I just use
their Wi-Fi connections and whatnot and
so to me the idea of something that
could just seamlessly jump on to us
several years network and then jump back
to verizon's and then jump back to
that's awesome you know and I'm sure
there's many other people out there who
live in these areas that were the where
you may not have access to really strong
just one carrier you know dominating the
area and that would feel the same as me
I mean I would be willing to pay a
premium for that you know and so to me
the technology of being able to unite
all the networks basically under one
service is awesome and that's what I'm
excited about it's not necessarily
project Phi or fee or foe it's what it's
capable of the technology behind it
basically if that makes sense yeah no
gesture certainly does yes and that's it
isn't it the weird thing that was like
they had that technology you're right is
really cool like I really liked you you
know the idea of being able to jump from
from the thing I don't like being
charged a whole bunch more than I pay
now for it but I like the idea and I
like the premise and I even like the
built-in security tools like the built
in VPN to keep yourself safe on the
Wi-Fi networks is really really awesome
what's weird is that this despite all of
that project Phi is still average I'm
going to defend them a little bit here
I'm going to defend google just a bit
and basically my argument is on what
Grusha was talking about the
infrastructure of course in Portland
here were a potential Google Fiber town
and I've been watching how they're
getting everything implemented now of
course they're laying their own lines
where needed and putting up their own
substations whatnot it's a struggle and
what one of the biggest things making it
possible here in Portland is that the
metro system is offering up for free use
of their stations and their lines and
they're there along the tracks that can
lay lines for free while and I mean
that's huge absolutely huge and that's
the one of the only reasons that it's
going to
if it even comes to be because of some
other political stuff if it comes to be
that's one of the only reasons it will
happen and that's kind of where Google
is stuck right now I think if
politically speaking they could launch
their own equipment their own actual
infrastructure to give Wi-Fi and to give
cellular to this country and never mind
the rest of the world sorry let's talk
about the u.s. just for now if they
could do that I think that they would
isn't it in Mountain View somebody'll
have to correct me if i'm wrong or look
this up but i'm pretty sure in mountain
view google had set up an entire free
wireless to the entire city and
politically whoever it was the you know
the telcos of some sort came in and
lobbied and had it shut down so google
had to turn off free wireless to the
city just you know because the paying
telcos and the ones that were accustomed
to have gouges for money are the ones
that blocked them and just like you know
moving forward project five it's a you
know they're an mvno they're not their
own telco and they're stuck at you guys
already said this but you know they're
purchasing the minutes and the bandwidth
from the other companies if giving it
for free isn't really what they can do
here is it's a little bit out of their
hands oh no I can do prefer kind of a
Joe touched all not for free but cheaper
and stuff you know what I mean
everything you were asking for Joe is it
if they could do it but it would have to
be at a loss because of what crush you
said they've they've got to pay upstream
for the service in the first place I
know well you know I think my don't mind
paying for unlimited down like I don't
mind paying what it would take to give
me unlimited data on that network I'm
just upset that I don't have that option
that I can't make that switch to
something as potentially awesome his
project feisty could be they don't suck
and I can't use it I can't use in until
they give me an unlimited data option I
can never use it and that's it's
frustrating you know kiss you just said
you know Google's bottleneck they have
to do this thing dude if they charge
ninety dollars a month for unlimited
data I'd switch to it no problem I
thought I do
right now he's lonely yeah it was no I
don't mind switching you know to
something new and something better but
if I'm switching to something that's
gonna ultimately cost me more money for
what is essentially until the
infrastructure that Google's trying to
work out here gets finished um I mean
it's just asking me to pay more money
for the same kind of stuff and it is uh
you know oh and you got to think of the
battery drain to switching from network
to network all day long you know they
all technology supposedly because that
they did mention that supposedly they
have some kind of way to help with that
so it's not an issue supposedly I did a
way to help with the nexus 5 camera yeah
like I said that they suppose well again
the really and the memory leak and
lollipop look well again this is when I
see it after I graduate that's why i
said--that's why I didn't that's why i
said supposedly it's a buzz ah but
that's the thing like just real quick
sorry Gracie I just wanted to say like
it's almost self-defeating for Google to
call it project 5 rather than something
that's completed you know that's exactly
what I was saying is that something we
all touched on earlier this is not a
complete idea exactly part of an idea
but you know Google does that a lot it's
um I think it's about the long term here
this is to set up you know for the days
when they do have you know google fiber
and maybe even blue you know balloons in
the air that you know beaming down Wi-Fi
I think it's to set up for you know what
will happen in a decade from now not
necessarily you know and I think there's
just a baby step and a way to kind of
test it and let's just face it i mean
will be honest here most of google stuff
our beta tests you know most of their
you basically by the you know you're
buying into being a beta tester i'm a
lot of things oh yeah for sure to google
that's the phone no devil and I
acknowledge it it's you know I I do
acknowledge this an experimental thing
too I just you know I just kind of wish
they were a little bit more like you
know google music with it instead of
yeah you know like Verizon with it well
I think the nut I do think it's kind of
funny if you think about it that in this
one step basically Google found a way to
complete sprint and t-mobile merger on
their own Erina
that's basically what they did but you
know I kind of like I said the
technology the idea to switch between um
I was thinking just for those who are
still hanging in on with us that are not
us-based I was even thinking like the
technology from granted I don't know a
lot about European carriers are just
know basics so anyone who knows a little
more weigh-in but you know i know that
in Europe there are quite a few carriers
I mean tons compared to what we're used
to yeah and the idea of this kind of
technology uniting carriers like you
know if they were like you know in a
country like Romania for example where
are one of our editors Bogdan lives I
know there's several the quite a few
he's talked about and the idea for like
some of those to unite with some of the
small carriers in like you know the
neighboring countries you know near
Romania if there could all enter into
some kind of similar sharing program
where could jump back and forth I don't
know the technology is what I'm excited
about I guess because I think it has a
lot of Merit beyond just the u.s. even
you know yeah they're essentially
turning the main carriers and that the
ones who'll the spectrum into um Oh what
are they called not the ISPs but the
ones the ISPs get the internet from mmm
what do they got everyone off top I know
your yeah I'm being the the gods of the
Internet essentially I don't think you
know and think this is another was
half-baked ideas that we have here on
the ftp podcast um what if google's just
trying to turn the major carriers into
the internet gods of the mobile space
you know instead of interfacing directly
with customers just interface directly
with somebody like Google to switch back
and forth between the networks at will
and I think that'd be awesome if like
they're that big really good the system
I said oh never get wait for it I would
love that I think that there would be
really hard to get the carriers to
cooperate at this level but it would be
amazing if there was a future where you
could like basically have a service
where you don't necessarily it hops into
all of them and they just pay whoever
instead of signing up for these carriers
google or whoever pays these carriers
for hey okay this this much was used on
your network and basically we no longer
directly sign up for any of the carriers
that would be awesome you know we are
really it's exactly what unfortunately
um no one would want to get along that's
the thing I i love that feisty was able
to say
part about that because it makes it
makes complete sense that these phone
companies is wireless this wireless
carriers would would would blow back on
a plan like this if Google did want to
sort of put everyone under an umbrella
but even on the other side of the coin
uh we're saying that Google is going to
unite all of these carriers and it's
going to be a good thing but also
there's the whole idea that Google might
new it's always a problem with google
the whole idea that it is a monopoly and
if it was able to succeed in uniting the
carriers I mean there's always gonna be
blowback on that too so what if it was
more like an approach like basically
which is what kind of Joe was saying I
think what if it was an idea basically
the idea of right now you know you have
multiple isps and they dial into the
same you know internet and the what are
your four giant carriers that cover all
of North America yeah what if it was
basically the same concept like you had
four or five different companies Google
whoever else got involved and then they
dealt with these networks so Verizon
instead of being a carrier and ATT
instead of being carrier we're basically
just parts of that network and when very
soon we use that part they would get
paid you know unfortunately like I said
this is an awesome idea in a way but we
know it's it's it's not it'll never
happen because it's never ever gonna
happen because I figured a way to opera
that level yeah well profit too they
need what they could I think they could
make a profit off of it you know it it's
just digging deeper into it you know
like they'd be able to light fire all of
their customer service reps they would
need to make my stories anymore they
could dedicate all of that stuff instead
of having an awesome network yeah I'm
creating their infrastructure and that
would ultimately get rid of the
congestion issue that makes Josh hate
unlimited data so much I do not enjoy it
and just like that we solved the whole
carrier problem I have one more concept
to throw in there at you crushing and
this is more for Joe with than anything
I like things you need you've mentioned
and I saw your Google+ stream earlier
today as well you know your focus was
that you know Google is putting out this
in certain terms expensive network and
there at the same time they offer all of
their services that eat so much data
what if google did not charge for data
to their services that would help talk
about monopoly sure but that might
change things around t-mobile's already
doing with music streaming yeah they
don't charge for the certain music
streaming services it's actually really
great um see I don't know how I'd feel
about that because my biggest it down
the biggest net uses Netflix personally
but any know that be actually really
cool it throw in some throwing some
google drive space along with it
unfettered a data access to the Google
services that would actually be a pretty
nifty idea I like that that's something
unique at least so yeah basically we get
some of the idea that there was a lot of
potential in project x it's just that
the current implementation is
implementation did I say that right yeah
yeah implement yeah I'm getting tired ha
it's a dress implementation by they
should be uh anyway uh it's just that
right now what we have is weak you know
it's funny the way you say it because we
technically don't even have it yet true
I mean we're kind of speculating I mean
cuz and you know what what we get during
the initial you know stage well they'd
well just an invite program and what we
get when it becomes a public program
could be very different to you know yeah
are not necessarily it could look very
very different who knows he'll maybe
they could get AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon to jump
in to at that point the amazing to me
yeah good luck but well I mean but they
AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon have mvno services so I
mean it's possible um I you know I'm
sure it would be more it would raise the
prices even more than Joe would have
even more to Hulk smash about if they
did that all right they did that and
skyrocketed the prices and you guys want
to talk about into a podcast you'd have
to invite lon for that week cuz
just like I'm not attending no you know
and it's not just like cuz I don't want
to it's because I don't think you guys
want me to admit that there are times
were up there are people who don't want
to be in the same room as I am and that
would be one of those days Joe smash I
can't wait for you three if you go yeah
that's gonna be fun there's gonna be
really fun alright cool well thoroughly
and spiritedly we've we've talked about
projects five um we're on a roll with
these podcasts these days man I love it
but in any case I imagine that we've
covered it so all viewed all of the
let's say two thousand people who voted
on that pole I think over fifty percent
asked for project fine and you got it ah
so uh thank you for listening to the
Friday debate podcast fdp as you can
hashtag it on social media of course um
as for next week I did want to put this
out there um I will be in New York for
for the LG launch and yeah I will be
back in time to be able to do an episode
but I'm gonna put this out there I'm
still trying to figure out the logistics
because obviously the time around the
launch is going to be really hectic
there's a yeah there's a possibility
that now the main possibility is I come
back on time on on Wednesday and
Thursday and be able to record with us
our usual panel by then hopefully you
guys or anyone who any one of our fellow
writers and youtubers are going to have
seen my videos right and we can talk at
length about the LG g4 um but the the
more fun thing that I feel like might
happen is I might be able to get a few
of our industry friends in on a podcast
as well if you remember we did one at
Mobile World Congress with pocket now
and nicole scott from mobile geeks so
i've actually been talking to some
people who i know i'm going to be seeing
at the LG lunch so that might happen as
well so we'll keep you posted on that
but in any case we will still have the
poll available for future episodes as
well especially a wonder isn't something
as big as let's say project phi or a g4
happening but nonetheless i want to give
the thanks again to all of our house
John and Andrew and remember to keep it
into android authority for all of the
best coverage including the Friday
debate podcast and everything we do on
YouTube but don't forget to head on over
to android authority calm because as we
always end this podcast together
everybody we are your source for all
things android android did you just not
try nah she was that oh wait a crush she
did I say at all ice I did oh it didn't
come through for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
