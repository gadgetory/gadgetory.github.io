Authority what's going on everybody
coming to you from the Seattle Space
Needle and every photo and video that
you're seeing in this camera shoot I was
taken on the cameras of the Samsung
Galaxy s6 and the s6 edge so it's
important to note right off the bat that
the cameras on both Samsung flagship
devices are identically the same so
you're going to see a mixture of photos
and videos from the galaxy s6 and the s6
edge because they both perform exactly
the same you'll notice that these photos
right now that you're seeing are from my
galaxy s6 review from the Korean
friendship Belle and I'm showing you
these photos again so that you can get a
taste of what coloration you get from
these photos now I did have HDR on auto
in these particular photos especially
since it was an overcast day but even
then having HDR auto on means that you
can take out the guesswork from meetings
turn on HDR or not and it will tell you
in a little indicator in the viewfinder
if you do have HDR on or off now another
thing that is worth mentioning is in
this particular video you're going to
see a lot of photos that were taken
while I was taking videos in the 1080p
our resolution with the video mode you
are able to take photos while you're
doing video which is a great feature I
think but the photos will come out at
1080 resolution rather than the much
higher one in this 16 megapixel camera
now we move forward to Seattle where
there's still a lot of great coloration
this is a wonderful camera to have out
in the daylight and even in low-light
situations it does perform pretty well
but I will show you some situations
where it did not that being said f 1.9
aperture for the front and rear cameras
means that you are going to get some
pretty good shots in most situations
even indoors but in these outdoor shots
you're really going to see that I had
quite a bit of fun using this as my
daily driver camera I didn't even need
to bring out my actual DSLR camera in
order to have some fun taking pictures
of the sights in Seattle San Francisco
and earlier as you saw the Korean
friendship Belle now the videos that
you're seeing will primarily be in 1080p
resolution the reason being I wanted to
make sure I use all of the features of
the Samsung camera like HDR during
videos and when you're using the 4k
resolution video recording you are
unable to use those particular features
but it is still a nice camera to
used for video I have some really nice
videos from here from both sides but one
thing that I will show you here is the
warping on the sides when I'm walking
through the campus of University of
Washington the video warping does occur
from time to time even if you have video
stabilization on or off it's not really
that big of a deal but something I knew
that you guys wanted would want to see
and then of course you have slow-motion
video which is available here you can
take a capture of a regular video in the
slow-motion mode and then be able to
fine tune the level of the slow-motion
as you can see here I have the original
120 and then it brought it down to the
slower one on the right here are some
examples of the front-facing camera I
have this picture with Darcy lock of a
and with the F 1.9 you still have a
little bit of that nice depth of field
in the background but still it is a
great camera to use for getting selfies
in particular moments and speaking of
the f 1.9 aperture especially in the
rear camera you'll be able to get a nice
depth of field look in your photos very
akin to a DSLR shooter with a nice lens
and you are able to pinpoint the portion
of the viewfinder that you want to have
in focus but of course if you go into
the pro mode you'll be able to achieve
the same effect by using the manual
focus slider which is also a very nice
touch the theme of which that year was
the age of space that's how we all named
Space Needle looking out to the west of
it's lovely and very authentic Seattle
rainy day we're now having towards
Elliott Bay part of it
panorama is using either of these
cameras really does a great job and even
though you should be moving just the
phone itself rather than your entire
body which would lead to a lot of the
stitching problems that you might see
especially in this particular photo if
the subjects are moving about a lot you
will still see those stitches and that's
not really that big of a deal something
that we expect from panoramic cameras
but still if you have a still image kind
of like this this landscape or this from
the Space Needle in Seattle you're going
to get a great panorama photo and it all
looks pretty great the same goes for the
front-facing camera in all but the
lowest light situations you'll be able
to see that the wide selfie is able to
get you a nice look at your group if
you're going to take a group portrait
but it is a little bit fidgety so you
might need to take a few tries in order
to get the stitching at the minimum now
as I mentioned before I did want to show
the benefit of using the pro mode now we
have these cherry blossoms that I had to
bump up the exposure on but one thing
want to mention is when you're using the
pro mode in the Samsung Galaxy s6 you
have to make sure that you have your
metering on spot metering because if you
have it on matrix or on a weighted scale
it's not going to really bump up the
exposure when you bring that slider up
you have to pinpoint that one spot of
the subject that you want to be brighter
and then it's from there that you can
mess with the exposure slider
and now in the low-light situations
you'll see in these two particular
photos that despite being indoors there
was still quite a bit of decent lighting
so the camera was still able to pull out
a pretty nice photo now when you get
outside as long as you have a prominent
light source within your scene you will
so get a nice photo like this one of
Pawnee City Hall and also an example
from the Griffith Observatory with the
sunset on the side there so if you're
taking things like landscapes and
whatnot with a prominent light source
within the scene you will still get a
pretty nice photo and at F 1.9 aperture
you are able to still get some nice
decent indoor let's say at parties and
dinners shots but unfortunately just
like with DSLRs it will still have a law
of diminishing returns especially with
the front-facing camera which shows more
noise than the rear one especially
because of its lower resolution and with
the lower shutter speed in order to
compensate for the low-light situation
you will get motion blur in photos like
you can see here but really those are
all issues that are very common no
matter what kind of camera you're using
the noise and the grain will rise up
when the light comes down and the same
goes for the front-facing camera as I
said already you can see here there's a
lot of green and noise in this
particular selfie indoors and then this
one was enhanced using the auto enhance
within the gallery and you can really
see that when it tries to enhance the
photo the noise in the ground only gets
more exacerbated
and as long as we continue showing how
well these cameras perform in typical
situations why not end this video with a
bunch of foodie pictures yes the Samsung
Galaxy s6 and s6 edge cameras are even
better than the ones that came before it
in the s5 and the s4 but it might also
be one of the best cameras available in
android right now as I have said in
plenty of situations in the past it is
the post-processing that really makes or
breaks a photo from a camera on an
Android device and as a couple of my
colleagues in the industry have said
already when you're using the s6 and the
s6 edge camera you can't really tell
that this is an actual Android phone
because these pictures are not ones that
you would expect to get from other
players in the game now that being said
I can't endorse enough how well this
camera really makes this phone very
appealing and even then one of the best
things that I could say as I said at the
beginning of this video is that without
my DSLR camera having the s6 and s6 edge
in my pocket really made me feel
comfortable knowing that I was going to
get some great photos and videos no
matter where I was without my real lens
camera so as always thank you guys very
much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this camera shootout of the samsung
galaxy s6 and the s6 edge because both
of the camera setups are the same I went
ahead and did a long-form version of a
camera shoot out here because I really
wanted to show how well these cameras
performed and it was kind of a
revelation for me to know that when I
was out in Seattle I didn't need to have
my DSLR camera with me because the s6
and the s6 edge we're going to perform
just as well as I needed them to to
capture my memories I will do the same
of this type of video for the HTC One m9
and for future flagships but until then
you can see the reviews of the samsung
galaxy s6 and the s6 edge by lon over on
the side there and make sure you check
