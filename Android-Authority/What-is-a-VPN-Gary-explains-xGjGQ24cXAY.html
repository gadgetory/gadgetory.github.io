Authority now VPN stands for virtual
private network and maybe you've heard
that term in association to privacy and
to geolocation but what exactly is it
how does it work and what can it do for
you well let me explain now before we
dive into VPNs let me tell you a little
bit how the internet works now at home
you've probably got some kind of route
or modem from your telephone company
from your internet service provider and
then that's connected to your desktop
maybe by an Ethernet cable to your
smartphone over Wi-Fi maybe to your
laptop over Wi-Fi and so on now inside
of your house when your laptop talk to
your PC or your phone talk to your PC
that's part of your private network and
that doesn't go out onto the internet it
stays inside your house but the moment
you open a web page somewhere out on the
internet that data flows through your
modem down into your local phone company
and then out across the internet and it
will travel across the internet until it
gets to the server the server will then
reply with some information that will
come back through the internet into your
local telecommunications provider down
through to your modem and then back onto
your PC or onto your Android smartphone
now while all that data is rushing
around the internet it needs to know
where it's going and four things to know
where they're going and they need an
address it's the same with the postal
service is the same when you want to go
and visit somebody and it's the same
with data on the internet now there are
different layers of addressing or
different types of addressing that go on
but at the highest level each of these
packets of information have what's
called an IP address now the IP address
is you've probably seen them there those
four digits from 0 to 255 with dots in
between them so maybe 1 7 8.30 4.67 dot
120 something like that now your modem
your router has probably been assigned
an IP address from your ISP and what
happens in is that when your data goes
through the internet every piece of
equipment it touches every router
every server it touches knows that IP
address especially when it gets to the
web server at the other end that web
server will probably log that IP
ress and log what it is that you've
requested there is done that is not
because it's trying to spy on you but
because actually trying to connect
collect data about the number of people
that I clicked into the website when the
peak periods are and for data analysis
basically for traffic analysis but of
course there's another thing that we
need to know about IP address and that
is they're assigned in blocks so if you
have an IP address all of your neighbors
and all the people in your area will
have the same IP addresses within the
same block and there is a database that
tells you where these blocks of
addresses are assigned that means that
when the data arrives at this webserver
you're connecting to it has a pretty
good idea of where you are from
certainly at the country level most
definitely at the city level and maybe
even down to within a couple of blocks
of where your actual house is if you
don't believe me go to what is my IP
address comm and you'll see what
information that can be found out for
about you just by going to that web page
just from your IP address
now of course normally that's not a
problem the fact that I go to Twitter
isn't going to cause any problems for
anybody however if I start to access
stuff that is maybe a bit more sensitive
maybe I have a physical problem I want
to read about all needs I may have an
emotional problem maybe I want to look
about a top topic that is taboo in my
culture in the country that I live in
then suddenly these different that these
servers know where I'm from and know
about my IP address is a bit more
concerning more than that most
governments throughout the world have a
system where they can demand from an ISP
the actual person that was assigned a
particular IP address on a particular
date so if they then come in and they
say well we want to find out who was
reading about this particular topic they
can come to my ISP and say give us that
data depending which country in
depending on which laws are enacted that
can be a quicker or a longer protest can
be more difficult can be with more
supervision with less supervision but
basically every state around the world
has access to that information there's
not only governments we need to be
worried about for example if you're in a
coffee shop you're sitting in Starbucks
and you're thinking great I've got
coffee I've got free internet now these
open public Wi-Fi hotspots are
quite dangerous it's not difficult for
anybody with a bit of technical
knowledge to take a laptop and sit in a
coffee shop and to capture all of the
data packets that are flowing around in
the Airways and because the earth the
Wi-Fi point is open they actually know
that data is encryption it's very easy
to get hold of passwords to get hold of
lifts or lists of websites that are
being accessed it's even possible to get
hold of contents of emails now of course
there are software levels of encryption
for example whatsapp just implemented
end-to-end encryption so that was
captured it would be more difficult for
the hacker to get the contents of your
messages however an open free heighth
Wi-Fi hotspot is basically open for
access both for good and for bad things
so please please do not do any online
banking or access website like PayPal
when you are connected to your coffee
shops Wi-Fi just don't do it ok now
another interesting thing about IP
addresses and about geolocation is that
if I try to access content that is a
video content particularly that is for a
particular country if I'm outside of
that country I don't have access to it
and let's just take a simple example
let's say I'm traveling and I want to
get access to my video streaming service
I can't if I'm outside of the country
now that that's because the IP addresses
that arrived at the video streaming
server it says that my IP address
isn't in this country I'm going to block
access that some types of content is
blocked depending on which country
you're in and another interesting thing
actually is that pricing is different
depending on which country you're in now
you can try to buy some maybe some cloud
storage or maybe an online service and
if you try to buy it in maybe in the
United States it will be a different set
of pricing if you try to buy it in
Europe and also in fact expressvpn
recently a study where they found out
that actually if you buy airplane
tickets the price of exactly the same
flight or exactly the same number of
people from exactly the same Airport is
different depending on which country you
actually connect from when you try to
buy those tickets so geo fencing
geolocation actually changes things
about how we access the Internet how we
purchase services and how we buy goods
depending on where we are now what a VPN
does is it allows you to create a tunnel
a connection from your home computer to
a server somewhere else in the world and
that connection is encrypted and then
when I access something on the Internet
it goes through that tunnel and then it
arrived at that other server and then it
goes on to the Internet and it will
finally arrive at the web server or the
service I'm trying to use but the IP
address will no longer be my IP address
that's on that data packet it will
actually be the IP address of the VPN
server and what happens is that when it
replies it replies to the VPN server the
VPN services are I know who this is for
it actually need to go back down this
encrypted connection to this client who
has connected to me now that allows for
a whole bunch of possibilities for
example first of all your local
telecommunications provider and your
local government have no idea about the
sites that you're accessing when you go
through the VPN it's all encrypted now
once it goes beyond the VPN once it
comes out the VPN server of course it
then goes back into the open it goes
back pass through all the different
routers and things it needs to get to
the website and the website itself will
register the fact that certain address
has come to it but the address now
will be that of the VPN server it also
means that actually it thinks I'm in a
different country so if I'm trying to
access media videos streaming content if
I'm trying to buy things then actually
it might set the prices or give me
access or block access now depending on
where the VPN server is not depending on
where I am and thirdly if I'm using open
Wi-Fi then actually now that initial
connection from my laptop out to the
Internet is actually completely
encrypted so if there was somebody
sitting in the coffee shop connecting
with a tablet trying to a laptop trying
to connect catch all the packets
actually they won't be able to get that
much because it will all be encrypted
now how does this work what do you need
to do what the first thing need to do is
get yourself a VPN service and there are
a myriad of different VPN services
available on the internet person
recommend Express VPN they're really
good guys now when you connect when you
subscribe what happens is you get given
a username a password and a list of
servers servers in Europe servers in
America server servers in South America
servers and Asia servers all around the
world and basically you say I want to
connect now create a virtual private
network a tunnel from my laptop from my
PC from my hand Royd smart phone to this
particular server in this particular
country now on Android that's really
easy to do in fact expressvpn have an
app you just download the app you put in
username a parcel and then you just tap
the server that you want to connect to
and it will create that tunnel that
connect that encrypted connection to
that server you can also do it manually
through the settings page you can create
VPN connections and that's the same on
Windows you can do that Windows and do
it on OS 10 you can do it on Linux you
can do it in Chrome OS you can even do
it on certain types of Reuters so
actually a VPN is available across many
many types of devices and then once that
connection is made all your data traffic
all of your stuff you're doing we'll go
through that VPN out into the Internet
in a different country and then further
abroad where it needs to go now this all
sounds great but are there some
downsides now there are a few downsides
the first one and of course is that
you're sending your traffic deliberately
maybe in the opposite direction to where
the services that you need so if I'm in
Europe and maybe I make a connection to
a VPN that's in Asia and then I try to
access a website that in America what's
happening now is I have to send the data
halfway across the world and then half
across the world again to get to that
server so of course is going to be
slower ok your routing the traffic all
over the place and it's going to be
slower than if you were connecting
directly to that service now also it
could be slower because the VPN provider
has a limited number of servers and it
has a limited number or bandwidth so
therefore if there are lots of clients
or it's a particularly busy time of day
then connecting is going to be slower
because I'm actually busy with all the
other people now while it is an
expensive VPN service provider and a
cheap one is the amount of bandwidth and
the number of servers they've got so
that's something to watch for when
you're choosing a VP
service provider and of course the other
thing is that some countries actually
find have made a VPNs illegal I won't
mention them now but you do it won't
take much for you to do some research to
find out if you're in certain countries
you try to connect via a VPN actually
that is a founder productivity and
actually that active in itself could get
you into trouble more than maybe
accessing certain types or website and
the other thing is that some services
actually block access when they see that
a VPN is being user netflix but in the
news recently because it's making
strides to try to block VPN access and
when it sees an address but it's
recognized previously as a VPN server it
will just block access and say you can't
get in here so as a summary whenever you
connect to the internet an IP address is
used to route traffic to the server and
back again the server will probably log
that address and it will also be known
by your phone company the government has
access to that data if it uses the right
legal framework to ask the phone company
for that information but also just the
mere fact that you've used an IP address
it actually can give away quite a lot of
information about where you are when
you're using public Wi-Fi hotspots when
you're buying things online or these
things are open and these things are
controlled depending on where you are in
the world which means you may not have
access certain things you may have to
pay higher prices for certain things now
a VPN allows you to connect to another
server in another country and then to
connect further onto the internet it has
the advantage that a different
geolocation which means you can get
around certain access restrictions and
it's encrypted which means that if you
were using like your local coffee shop
those day that data is now encrypted my
