competitor the Oppo find 7 finds itself
up against one of Samsung's best H notch
of Agartha mandroid thority what's going
on everybody and this is the Oppo find 7
versus the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 in this
quick look of the Oppo find 7 and the
Galaxy Note 3 we find two different
design philosophies at work here we have
the smooth and rounded lines of the note
three contrasting with the more angular
designs found on the find seven and just
like the fine 5 before at the fine 7
features a very minimalistic look and a
premium feel on top without too many
embellishments the premium version of
the fine 7 comes with a carbon fiber
backplate that features a woven pattern
reminding us a little bit of Motorola's
droid line from back in the day but the
note 3 offers an equally nice feel in
the hand this time with its faux leather
textured plastic back cover the front of
the fine 7 is all black with no logos or
physical buttons to draw the attention
from that large screen the note 3 in
contrast does feature samsung's
trademark button setup with home flanked
by back and menu in terms of dimensions
the fine 7 is about a millimeter taller
than Samsung's flagship but is also
noticeably narrower which makes it a bit
easier to hold in the hand but the note
3 is almost a millimeter thinner than
the 5s find 7 the difference in way
between the two devices is almost
negligible though as only 3 grams really
separates the feel in both for many note
3 users its flavor of the large screen
experience eventually started to feel
normal and it because it is so close in
size and general feel to the fine 7 we
want to be surprised if the same happens
with oboes newest offering the premium
version of the fine 7 takes the lead in
the display comparison at least if
higher pixel density is paramount to you
the 5.5 inch fine 7 is one of the first
devices to ship with a 2560 by 1440
display known as quad HD by Oppo which
translates to a whopping 538 pixel per
inch pixel density I had a great time
with the display and it turned out to be
one of the most photogenic performers
I've handled in the opposite corner the
5.7 inch note 3 is just 1080p with a
pixel density of 386 that doesn't keep
the screen from being one of the top
performers available now however no one
will really notice or care about the
difference in the sharpness but the
difference
certainly exists and you can see the
close-up images showing this difference
at Android authorities calm in terms of
performance nominally the fine seven has
a slight advantage over the note three
thanks to its upgraded Snapdragon 801
processor this is the same processor
that's powering the new Galaxy S five
and Xperia z2 by Sony so the fine 7 is
in select company a version of the fine
7 though is available with the
Snapdragon 800 and a 1080p display
making that light version more in line
with current smartphones and the specs
are 2.5 gigahertz and the speed in a
crate 400 variation CPU and the audrina
330 with three gigabytes of RAM
now the Galaxy Note 3 comes with three
gigabytes of RAM also but the SOC is the
Snapdragon 800 instead now in theory the
biggest difference between the two are
pretty much just the higher speeds of
the 801 but in practice both are
lightning fast and are going to be able
to handle most tasks without nary a
hiccup now both phones have large
removable batteries but even without
replacing the battery you should still
get more than a full day of usage from
either phone there is a 3000 milliamp
hour unit in the fine 7 while the note 3
offers a slight advantage by packing an
extra 200 million powers and even better
the find 7 comes with a special fast
charging technology that according to
Opel makes it best-in-class you should
be able to charge up the fine 7 from 0
to 75 percent in just 30 minutes well a
mere 5 minutes of charging should give
you power for 2 hours of talktime now of
course the note 3 gets the advantage of
having a little friend the s-pen it is
the real differentiating factor here for
these two as those who want a stylus
experience will definitely have to go
for the note faster charging is an
interesting prospect indeed though
putting points back in the 5 7 s corner
in this case as we come to the camera
comparison the 13 megapixel Sony Exmor
RS sensor of the fine 7 is combined with
powerful software features it's really a
promising setup that we cannot wait to
try out for ourselves and on the front
you do get a 5 megapixel camera with the
wide lens that enables an 80 degrees
field of view now both cameras here have
2.0 aperture lenses great for low-light
photography and for obtaining that
blurred effect that plenty of people
love in the background there's also an
interesting feature called the super
zoom in the fine 7 which combines 10
hole images taken at the same time to
create one massive 50 megapixel image
with a lot of detail another notable
feature included is the ability to shoot
in RAW format
now the Galaxy Note 3 is holding its own
here you also get a 13 megapixel rear
camera and great image quality with a
variety of software features all of
which were probably already familiar to
current Samsung users the ability to
record in 4k video did come first in the
Snapdragon version of the note 3 and it
is here that both of these cameras share
a similarity and finally in Software
Defined 7 runs Android 4.3 jelly bean
with opus color OS on top now color OS
has come a long way since the original
fine 5 and the Oppo n1 and is going to
get another update pretty soon but
elbows enhancements found here include
support for various gestures as well as
a range of widgets and other smaller
enhancements now color OS is actually a
pretty full feature software suite that
is actually quite thoughtful including
the gesture panel that you bring down
from the drop down that allows you to
program any number of drawings for a
number of different functions and on the
Galaxy Note 3 you get the well-known
TouchWiz Samsung is currently rolling
out Android 4.4 to the device bringing
small design changes and KitKat specific
functionality however you're still
getting pretty much the same experiences
ever here with useful features like
multi window and all the S Pen
functionality predicated by perhaps less
use features like for example the smart
squirrel and so there you have it for
this quick look at the Oppo find 7 and
the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 S Pen aside
you're looking at the closest
competition the fine 7 probably has in
terms of size and feel as well as sheer
feature set within the software
experience in either phone you'll get a
great experience so it's pretty much up
to you what flavor of excessively large
phone is better suited to your tastes
stay tuned for all of the Oppo find 7
coverage here from the launch event in
Beijing China
