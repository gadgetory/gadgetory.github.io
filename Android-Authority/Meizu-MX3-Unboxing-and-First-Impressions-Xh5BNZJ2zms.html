see Chinese manufacturers bring their
flagship devices to the western states
but when it came to CES 2014 it became
clear to us that they're all coming we
saw offerings from alcatel from Huawei
and we are already big fans and Friends
of OBO as you seen with their fine 5 in
there and one but one particular phone
at the show floor really caught our eye
and we got our hands on it so it's josh
Vegard from android authority what's
going on everybody and it's time to
unbox and give our first impressions on
the meizu mx3 well as you know how I do
no scissors need it over here just going
to go ahead and cut through the plastic
over here you know how I do here and
slowly bring up the lid now this should
obviously come as a little surprise that
we're seeing the instructions in Chinese
language here obviously I cannot read
that but essentially what they're saying
is you can pop out the back cover and it
is from there that you can insert your
sim card so we're going to do that a
little bit later and have that ready for
the full review but here it is a very
nice simplistic and colorful packaging
we have a large flap right here that
does house kind of a snapshot of what
the phone can offer in English
thankfully and from there we have the
phone right underneath so let's go ahead
and take this phone out and there it is
the MX three with the booklets right
underneath and here it is a nice black
slate look at the front with the little
home button at the bottom here that will
allow you to go back and forth it's a
nice white circle right over here that
does look quite nice and of course the
back with the camera right centered and
meizu MX right here like I said at CES
this kind of looks like what an iphone 3
would look like if Apple finally decided
to adopt larger screens and this is a
5-inch screen that we're seeing on the
front with 1080p resolution and a lot of
power underneath
so the fly me OS as we found out at CES
2014 did have some unique features to it
in the sense that meizu kind of put
their own type of navigation into it
it's not necessarily like a stock
Android build made to look like mazes
general feel but you know as you can see
here we already have as we were getting
into the phone the notification
drop-down does not come all the way down
unless you have anything there and kind
of coming through right here just the
operating systems so that's just sort of
the quick setup here and like I said it
does look nice and as you saw there down
here we have the soft keys made for all
that you need and if you want to take a
look at the multitasking you swipe from
away from the home button and up to up
to the screen and that allows you to
take a look at the different ones that
you have of course you can swipe up to
get those out of the way and swipe back
down if you want to go back to the homes
if you want to go back a screen then you
swipe up from the home button up to the
screen and that allows for you to go
back to the previous screen which in
this case was just the home screen if we
go through here and just kind of take a
look at a couple things we have the menu
button here on the right side that gives
you the general menu we can always go to
in the phone app here that's one of the
buttons then of course the back button
which brings us back so after that it's
really just a matter of you know little
swipes here and there that kind of give
it a unique feel in terms of the
operating system itself but of course
this is Android underneath as far as
first impressions ago we really do have
to give it to mizzou for creating a
pretty attractive product our thoughts
from CES 2014 still hold up here as the
simplistic look with the white on the
back and the black slate look up front
like they're really do still hold up
it's only been a couple weeks but we are
super excited to have this phone in our
hands because of how it looks and the
other reason why it is great as you can
see plainly right here is because of
that bezel it's a very very thin bezel
on the right sides there might be a
little bit of real estate on top and
bottom but it does not detract from the
handling of this phone one
it's a very very nice phone to have in
the hand and with this nice very nice
looking screen right here the colors
just look really nice and it's a very
very good way of expressing the fly me
OS which has a bit of a flatter look
that really kind of exudes from this
display so overall we are still excited
this home button down here with the led
around it is also a very nice touch and
gives this phone a little bit of a
different outlook in terms of navigation
and looks in the Android space so that
is the meizu mx3 this is the phone
coming out of China that should be
coming to the US a little bit later this
year perhaps but it has been selling
like crazy over the last few months in
Asia so we wanted to get our hands on it
because it really got our eye out at CES
2014 keep it tuned to android authority
for all of the best coverage our
unboxing first impressions like this one
the upcoming review of the mx3 as you
can already be excited for just like we
are and of course for all of our other
coverage so make sure you stay tuned to
this channel because we are your source
