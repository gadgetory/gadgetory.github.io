holidays everybody
we're revisiting the Google Nexus 5
after all you guys have been wanting
some new videos on this and we have had
an idea for some time for a new type of
segments where we talk about a phone
however it is just like a snapshot of
the reasons why you should buy or
shouldn't buy a particular phone after
all we already have full coverage of the
Nexus 5 including not only the 4.4.1
update that came out recently but also
our full review and a couple of
comparisons so all the information that
you need out there is pretty much there
we have a lot of very comprehensive
coverage however sometimes you just need
a quick glance as to why you need a
particular phone and that is exactly
what we're doing so just remember this
is a snapshot I'm just gonna be spewing
out basically reasons why you should get
this phone and then after that reasons
why you should not so if you need a more
in-depth look at the Nexus 5 well you
can find it in other videos here at the
Android authority channel you have a
really nice feeling body here in the
Nexus 5 with a soft touch plastic bag
mix this in landscape that makes it look
really nice and after that it feels nice
in the hand a 5-inch screen where 1080p
resolution up front brings great quality
to all of your media whether you're
playing it or watching it and on the
inside you have just the powerful beast
of the Snapdragon 800 powering what is a
flagship device at a very good price
underneath that all you have Android
KitKat 4.4 version on here that has been
updated to improve what was already a
somewhat decent camera and made it quite
good after that however when it comes to
the software you have some new
integrations with Google now as for
example you're on the home screens and
you just say ok Google and there you go
you can have your search right away
it also looks a little bit better with
some new aesthetics and on top of all of
that is of course the price you have an
LTE capable phone here which is a
massive upgrade from the Nexus 4 and
thus you have a phone that is fast on
the inside on the mobile networks and at
$349 for the price for the base price
you have one of the best steals of
flagship devices in the Android space
today
well no phone is perfect and the Nexus 5
is definitely one of them after all the
battery life is its main detractor here
as the smaller capacity battery inside
doesn't allow for a very
assistant experience now it will be
decent but it won't be as consistent as
other very long-lasting devices out
there after that the very things that
people might like about the minimalistic
design inside and out of the next five
might also be its undoing the body is
pretty understated and minimalistic and
thus if you want to stand out because of
the way your phone looks you're probably
not going to get that here after that
the sound experience is also very
underwhelming as it provides less rich
audio than all the ones out there and
it's also not quite as loud as we would
like it to be and the camera after being
updated from 4.4.1 has gotten a little
bit of an improvement but it's still far
from the best and finally when it comes
to stock Android quite simply it is just
not for everyone
stock Android provides a lot of great
functionality but if you prefer the farm
beyond features of other phones like the
galaxy s4 then you won't be able to get
those here obviously because stock
Android is about as simplistic as it can
get and so there you have it for this
quick snapshot the top reasons to buy or
not to buy the Nexus 5 we just wanted to
give you a quick snapshot of this it's a
segment we wanted to do for a little
while so that you can get the gist of a
phone after we've done the rest of our
coverage of course if you want a more
in-depth look at the phone we always
have the full review and full
comparisons available for you at the
Android thority channel if you liked
this segment hit the like button down
below and also sound off in the comments
to tell us what we could do a little bit
differently here as it is a new segment
and next week you just might see me do
this for a bunch of other phones after
all it is the holidays and if you're
looking for a particular phone that you
might buy for yourself or for somebody
else we can give you the gist on a bunch
of them so stay tuned to Android
authority for all of the best coverage
stay here for our reviews our segments
just like this and even our event
coverage as CES is around the corner
happy holidays everybody I hope you have
a Merry Christmas or whatever holiday
you may you may celebrate and stay safe
this upcoming next couple weeks with all
of the festivities and remember Android
Authority is your source for all things
