original android hangout show on google+
I'm dare cross and I'm Dan Charlton and
I'm Johnathan Franklin welcome to our
i/o 2013 recap of at least the last two
days we have a whole bunch of
information to go over all sorts of
awesome cool stuff we found out such as
some cuoco system numbers nine hundred
million activations some things for
developers because this year's i/o is
all about Google services and their API
and things they can do without operating
Android we found out things about maps
and game services and play music and
search and hangouts not this kind of
hang out that we're doing and all sorts
of Google+ Google TV all sorts of
goodies so we'll get to that information
here as we go throughout the show as
we're talking about all the goodies of
i/o let us know in the comments if I oh
met your expectations what you thought
of it if it was you know thumbs up
thumbs down something you were hoping to
see maybe a device and then you didn't
see it so let us know in the comments
and we'll check them out from time to
time throughout the show and try to do
our best to answer them so sedan give us
some ecosystem numbers why what's his
900 million that I mentioned yes so 900
million Android devices have been
activated to date that is up from 400
million last year so last year there's
been a half a billion Android devices
activated where is in the previous what
four years there was just under a half
million so it's definitely still
accelerating at a very impressive pace
um in addition to that google also
announced that they had 48 billion app
downloads via google play store or
formerly android market put that in
perspective that's vs 50 billion from
ios app store so well iOS has been
around long
android has gotten just two billion less
downloads via google play those numbers
do not include downloads via amazon's
app store or any number of other
third-party app stores so within a
perspective there's definitely been a
lot more android apps downloaded then
there had been iOS apps downloaded so
that's definitely good news for android
and for android developers looking to
put out apps for android um they
definitely started things off gearing it
all towards developers and bolstering
the ecosystems throughout Google making
things better for developers in terms of
interacting with our AP is a lot of new
developer tools that we're going to talk
a little bit more about later and then
after the conference Google stated that
Android was intentionally absent because
they wanted to show specifically how
much they could improve the platform
just through google play services so
really there they're trying to push
Android make Android better without even
having to upgrade the operating system
and I definitely think that's the right
strategy for them to take especially
given all the fragmentation problems and
and you know different oem's with their
overlays and everything else this is way
for them to offer a consistent level of
Google services regardless of effort so
John tell us more about the stuff that
they've been putting out for developers
yeah that's really whether they really
kicked the keynote off talking about
everything they've done and everything
that I'm about to mention was
distributed by a Google Play services so
that's definitely worth mentioning
because it doesn't require a new android
version to be able to get it out to
users and you're not going to wait for
any software updates the other thing is
that it does give an advantage to
devices that have Google's suite of
services installed so if you fork
Android like Amazon or you know what
they be remembering say Samsung then
it's bad news for you so one of the
first things that they mentioned was
three new location api's and it's a
fused location provider and geofencing
in an activity recognition and pretty
much every one of them is really aimed
at cutting how much power usage
that it requires to get a location lock
and then you get past two locks or more
accuracy and the activity recognition
allows them to differentiate between
some whether somebody's walking or
biking or driving so it should
definitely have a lot of benefits
especially for apps like Fitbit or
something like a fitness tracker um they
expended on Google+ sign-in a little bit
and the other big one that they
announced was Google Cloud messaging
improvements like a persistent
connection upstream messaging which
that's kind of aimed at cutting cutting
out matter and data usage but it also
syncs notifications across devices which
should be pretty nice you know overall
once developers start to use it but the
really big thing that they put out for
developers is a completely new
integrated development environment
called Android studio and they pretty
much had a complete nerdgasm as soon as
Hugo said it but it's based on IntelliJ
beans instead of being eclipsed and a
lot of developers had already kind of
gone to IntelliJ the only real drawback
was that they had to pay for first as a
clip to me free and eclipses kind of had
a lot of plugins so it's a huge really
the first ID even android seen aside
from eclipse and then it brings up
really rich set of tools you know
developers can very easily see what
strings and their design layouts across
multiple device types really make though
what those changes they can really very
quickly see on 10 inch tablet 7-inch
tablets 3.7 inch foam typical exactly
what their text sizes and everything is
changing so what does it really mean for
users I mean it doesn't sound exciting
but you know developers are going to be
able to make their applications faster
they'll be able to do a much better job
optimizing particularly for multiple
screen sizes which has been a big
complaint for developers versus save
windows for iOS I mean in the end you're
just going to get better apps in the end
so a better app ecosystem really is the
goal of this and especially in terms of
design
should start to see developers really
get some applications that are a lot
more compelling than what you have now
yeah it should grow especially saying
it's geared to Android and what's the
plugins and extensions really build on
top of this environment it should kind
of get rid of a lot of the complaints
that people have had especially from
Java and down yeah this also really
shows the maturity of the Android
platform in that way like you don't just
put out your own ide for a hobbyist
platform you put it up for a serious
serious on operating system and that's
what Google is doing here so it's
definitely refreshing as a developer to
see them doing very very much in the
clips one of the biggest selling points
of a cliff was it the fact that it was
free it was not that it was the best it
was just free so it's nice to see a
really compelling option for developers
to be able to make something that's
really nice developer console got a lot
of improvements and this is also one of
those things that users might not get
excited about but it's ultimately going
to make better apps they have a lot of
optimization tips and better analytics
for developers so if you have to
optimize the tablets if you haven't
uploaded say tablet screen shots or if
you have a lot of users from say Russia
or wherever else they're using their app
but they don't actually have a
translation that's geared to that
country it'll let them know to try to
help them ultimately get more installs
and get more sales and you know full and
more revenue then you'll get better
metrics better revenue tracking just a
really clear picture of how your app is
doing and the biggest one of the biggest
ones was they can actually do beta
testing now and they can do a staged
rollout so when you get your app you can
go in and help load it and get on and
this kind of goes off of Google Plus to
you can share it to say your circles and
you can get alpha beta testers to get
your app ready you know it will
negatively affect your reviews on the
Play Store and developers can also roll
out to just a small percentage of their
user base that way the feedback they get
can really let them know make sure there
aren't any kings in the app you know and
just get flooded with a bunch of
negative reviews or anything that's gone
you know what John that that's actually
very nice because we're
how many of us have gone and tried the
beta version of a new app and had to go
to a third party place maybe the
developers website or your downloading a
new app you know from the Play Store you
have the standard version that you're
running and then you have the new
version 3.0 beta you know it's a
completely different app you know so if
I could look around read it and places
like that with us that their post out to
social trying to trying to find people
to test for him and it's getting beta
testers as a developer sometimes yeah so
you're gonna be able to get easy beta
testers and more importantly you're
going to be able to ensure that you're
getting apps from a trusted source
because Google play's a trusted source
and some guy post in the dropbox link
not you know not to say he's not
trustworthy but bad things could always
happen you know yeah very much so and i
right not long after they announced all
the developer stuff Hugo Barra walked
out and pulled out his galaxy s4 and
demonstrate this home screen and showed
off and any people were kind of looking
at it because it was bone stock Android
and that's what you want to get it's a
galaxy s4 Google edition it is you know
straight up galaxy s4 complete with
hardware buttons menu button back button
but it runs bone stock Android they
didn't call it a nexus but they did say
it would get prompt software updates and
if you're interested in it it will be
available in june for six hundred forty
nine dollars from google play and it
will work on both t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T
including their LTE network so it's not
going to be limited to hspa+ so what I
want to know right now is from you guys
watching or listening is do you want the
stock android samsung galaxy s4 you know
a lot of people hate on TouchWiz you
know we don't like TouchWiz I'll say we
Austin here and probably a lot of you
watching your big android fans you know
you don't like TouchWiz so to get the
power of the galaxy s4 on
stock rom where you know you don't have
to wait a couple months for it to get
completely stable on cyanogenmod you
know you don't have to wait for somebody
to unlock the bootloader using a you
know some type of exploit you know it
comes unlockable it comes stock Android
you know it's going to work so let me
know you know is this something you want
is this worth 650 bucks now what now
you're dropping your comments in I have
a have a thought on this so does this go
I think now this will help get stock or
get an AOSP rom on the go to samsung
galaxy s4 because they don't have to sit
there and and you know fight with
Samsung to get you know good Hardware
working they don't have to sit there and
you know try to you know come make new
binaries or compiled binaries in enough
to fight with source they basically just
can you know wit winzip ramat in epic
yeah I mean I mean that's a that's an
important question though samsung and
google going to release the source for
the full build or are they just
promising prompt updates and a non open
source wrong I mean it is open source
that that that's growing yeah I mean if
it's open source then there's absolutely
nothing standing in the way of porting
now but every but if it's not I mean and
it's not you could if it's not you can
still port the wrong course actually
just take the system jump in there you
go we know I mean yeah you can all right
I'll stop in for the carrier trying to
port to it it should work straight up so
so this will actually make for a more
stable you know insert AOSP rom here in
the future it really you know it really
will because oh definitely you're gonna
have that code working code already
available yeah that's it I took three
with one of our viewer comments here we
stock HTC One not into plastic bones I
have to agree with that because you know
I'm a samsung well you're right i don't
like TouchWiz my problem isn't TouchWiz
it's I I don't think they make
particularly high quality devices
in terms of like the physical quality of
the device and on top of that I don't
like touch wits well yeah if HTC want
would have put out a version of the one
with stock I would have dropped my nexus
for today I would drop it in a heartbeat
especially if they got rid of the two
buttons like happen with software is the
ideal you know they're there was a there
was a brief rumor that was shot down by
HTC execs but that doesn't mean that I
mean how many times have exact shot down
rumors because they weren't ready to
launch it but there was a rumor uh today
saying that you know hey you know
basically plastic socks don't spend 650
bucks we have something cool coming to
and and then you know everybody's like
oh my god HTC is getting a stock Android
device as well and then summit HTC execs
like no no exective say no we aren't
building a Nexus device ya say we are
building a stock Android device yeah
that's what he said he said the hero
building a Nexus device he didn't say
we're not gonna put out a phone that
runs stock Android yeah we never get
dogs we did and may say he could roam
for the one don't and and people forget
that's not uncharted territory for HTC
that is a brand new thing for samsung to
be doing but HTC has done it before they
released two phones on tmobile that were
totally stock Android but HTC devices
right the jail was them now what do you
guys think about this so let's say I
mean it people drop 650 bucks in this
cuz they really want it let's say I mean
are they gonna sell a whole lot probably
not but let's say they sell enough that
like oh wow people actually want this
you know it would make somebody's day
off could this spinoff some type of
trend where other manufacturers might
contact google and say hey we'd like to
have an alternative stock device for you
to sell as well i mean do you think they
need to contact google they can just do
it it's not like they have to pay for
this dress but very true very true they
don't have either they don't have to
if they don't need the license it it's
free and open source anybody can get my
only my only concern is that Americans
especially are so addicted to the
subsidized model I don't think it has a
chance and the problem with that it's
almost the reverse of what you said is
what happens if it doesn't do well which
is probably not going to sell a lot of
devices except maybe developers or
somebody that's grandfathered into an
unlimited plan and was going to buy
retail anyway there's nothing stopping
AT&amp;amp;T from subsidizing this and i don't i
don't know but i imagine t-mobile will
finance that just like they do every
other device t-mobile problem yeah
that's good all right so so as we said
earlier let let me know if you're
interested in this and we'll add it to
the list of wow someone would pale all
this money for it because you know what
I frankly think it's awesome but I don't
like hardware keys you know and I don't
like I don't like a hardware menu button
it being more than a hardware back
button or that ugly home button in the
center or that in that ugly home but but
anybody you know what some people do so
oh yeah they sell a crapload of devices
so apparently lots of you need it yeah
yeah that I you know it's it's the
number one selling Android phone for two
years in a row so chances are the s4
will be again so yeah so apparently
people like it but anyways all right so
let's talk about so John and talked
about the development part of i/o
because you know it's a developer
conference and it's not about going
there to get free tech gadgets and
goodies though there's some people too
yeah but so Google this year wanted to
let everybody know that look at all of
these enhancements to Android we can do
with Google Play service services with
api's with development tools look at all
this awesomeness we can bring the
platform without actually pushing out a
new version of Android so it's to know
it's a developer conference and they're
you know they're heavily pushing that
but need to make a
the non-developers happy you know they
had some awesome announcements and I'm
gonna go over some of them here so
there's a new google maps out there
which long story short it's completely
redesigned from the ground up and it it
it has google earth built into it it's
awesome i mean it so if you haven't
signed up for the the preview yet say
it's just the preview it's not they're
still adding things to it it's still not
done yeah i think it was like a beta
public beta you can sign up for the
preview in i got access to it this
morning so i signed up yesterday so it
took a day wait wait Google is doing a
public beta rather than just releasing a
product and calling it a beta for like
six years now little british shocking
new trend alright so directions are
completely in Hayden redone and enhanced
there's edge to edge like content the
whole entire thing is a matte you don't
have you know I'll bar up top or a bar
on the side everything's upon an overlay
so its content everywhere there's you
know pictures of the location down below
that you're viewing um there's live
traffic alerts and if your zoom out the
whole entire way it's you know live is
can be live clouds I mean obviously you
know there's done live it's really made
up cloud cover it'sit's you how we
pulled from like weather services so it
might be like synthetically real but
it's not actually satellite picture oh
yeah it's not actually satellite
pictures of cloud I didn't mean that i
meant live coverage of clouds you know
yeah obviously you know there's not some
moon base google sitting there like
taking you know satellite imagery of the
earth and do have a lot of satellites
that's how they get all their images for
google earth but they don't have any
satellites intent that far out yeah so
anyway so well you gotta check it out
it's really cool so you can put in your
location let's say you're looking for a
local restaurant maybe you want to get
some wings or something and boom it it
the data is just right there with local
reviews with information was in a
walking directions on how to get
they're driving directions the time from
where you're at I mean it's it's amazing
it's a very very well done app I I'm
impressed with it I I can't wait to see
something like this come to to mobile I
mean yeah it's worth mentioning this is
the mobile maps mobile would get this
these updates sometimes the summer yes
so you gotta check it out and you can
you can you can put in your like Google
already knows sure if your your avid
user of Google now then google has your
home address in your work address so if
you're sitting there at your house you
know you just type in home and it knows
your home address or how do I get here
from work you know and it knows your
address you know it you don't have to
type in you know one two three four fake
street yeah you have typed it all out um
so we were talking about you know Google
services how they're able to do things
with API well one of the things that
they're able to do now is a Google Play
game services which is part of you know
the Google services the green gear icon
that you have so what a google play
services Google Play game services do
well they allow you to sync gains across
devices you can uh it once games support
this you can do multiplayer games and
you can invite somebody to a game you
can you can send somebody message and
hey I want to play this game you can go
do a game room lobby or you can have it
randomly find another Google Play user
to play with it was cloud save so your
game data is saved out to the cloud
leaderboards if you're uh if you want to
if you not add I oh right now but you
wanna you know be at i/o like like our
friend Russell Holly did he he played a
game scored really high and then his
picture showed up on the scoreboard at
i/o so he was you know they're
indirectly pretty cool um and could the
games are you are this allows for the
ability of games be cross-platform so
games can be played on on you know
chrome iOS as well as you know Android
obviously
I tested this out um yesterday with one
of my buddies I tested out osmosis HD
because that game was updated and
supported it and we but just happened to
both have it installed and if there was
need it had a little multiplayer
function where we went in there and we
could eat each other and you know uh
absorb each other I guess is the correct
term and you had the ability to share
that with here with your circles if you
wanted to it was kind of cool um so
let's so let's talk about one of my most
favorite pieces of software that got
updated um much mean I love mall
thatthat's thatthat's I can't say one is
more of my favorite than the other but
google play music was rumored for a long
time to get a subscription service and
we finally found out it was called it's
called all access which it's come a long
name google play music all access but
hey whatever it's still it's still all
part of google play musical not as mad
as the sprint samsung galaxy s3 epic
touch 4g LTE yeah they were just nice i
don't think i wouldn't ever been beaten
so uh right now you can sign up for a
music subscription for you get a 30-day
free trial and if you decide to buy it
by june thirtieth you get a discount did
you the pricing is 7 99 per month if you
sign up by june thirtieth and after june
thirtieth it is 999 per month so it's
kind of cool it allows you to you can
make radio stations based on a song
based on you know Jean rah and it has
recommendations and the best thing is is
once you use the more you use the the
listen now service the better becomes
the more it you know it's google right
learns it it learns about your listening
habits and the songs you like in and
everything so it gets better the more
you use it and you'll get better
recommendations to explore a certain
artist or a certain genre or you know
and then you can create radio stations
or you can just go down to your
recommended stuff and pick an artist and
pick a song and start playing it you
don't have to make a radio
so it has to those features built in you
can pick a song or you can you know have
it do a radius it's kind of like I like
Pandora kind of like Spotify like in one
really I i like it i've i've been using
the hell out of it the past day and a
half how about you guys have you tried
it out yet I have not tried it out yet
although I am very very impressed with
the new group of music app in general
the UI yet so so John it is not Tron
anymore buddy where we talked about that
last week it's definitely not trying
it's definitely very much in line with
what they did with the new play store
I've been the one that has used Spotify
for a while Spotify is really just now
getting up a web app so if you're only
chrome or chrome eyes like the Linux
client to Spotify kind of sucks but our
do doesn't you know kind of like Google
has been doing if you're using audio you
know how you i'm talking about it has
the library approach or Spotify his
organization to playlist is just
platelets like you have to make
playlists for every single thing that
you add so the organization is just crap
so I feel like this is a really good
compromise of the two so long as they
stay on top of the streaming no because
audios the biggest problem was that the
mobile apps just aren't that good so as
long as Google delivers on both the web
and mobile I think they'll see a lot of
people cross over to it because there's
a glaring faults and audio and Spotify
and Pandora really alright so let's
answer a couple questions here we have a
few getting backed up here relevant to
games up Damon hard ass hole a little
bit ago do we think ingress data had
anything to do with any of the stuff
that came out at Google IL well
you know what ingress is definitely Dana
mining stuff i mean it's it's fun to
play but it's definitely data mining i
mean that that's what yeah that's what
Google does um I would say it's only
been doing it for six months you know
they might not have had the chance to
release a whole product or improve a
product upon that data I mean it maybe
next year I'll is my guess what do you
guys think it's a tough speculation you
know yeah I I think ingress is one of
those things with their gathering data
and eventually it's going to become
obvious what for and we'll all be
shocked and impressed but I don't think
we've seen it yet and uh so you guys
remember speaking of music remember
Sebastian from Wow then I'm drawing a
blank here where um the previous show
guess that I've drawn a blank here what
what company he represented wife Doris
doubletwist Wow yeah doubletwist yeah
they're talking about their music
streaming service we had him on here a
month or so ago and 46 coolio wanted to
know where his beautiful golden locks of
hair where I'm sure they're on his head
you know since he's not here right now
unless he shaved it uh and and Michael
wanted to know how many games support
the new Google Play game services and
that's actually a very good question and
I think that sounds like a task for the
android authority app guy Joe Hindy who
actually is probably watching us right
now so I think that would be that would
be a nice feature to review gains that
support the new play services i I've
seen a list of maybe like 20 games or so
maybe maybe not review all of them but
the top games then do some honorable
mentions I think that might be
beneficial so I'll twist his arm and see
if he can get that for you Michael uh
besides throwing Jill under the bus at
the last second so that's a let's talk
about some more some more app updates
and new services that that launched at
IL so who doesn't love google search
when that's the heart of that's the
heart of google that they're a search
company that provides tons of data
search what Google does search really
well you know I mean they ever know I
guess occasionally I mean they might you
know be working on a car drives itself
but from time to time they do search uh
and you know Microsoft has this thing
called Bing apparently that doesn't get
on competition right across the street
from I oh yeah yeah yeah so anyway so
Google search got updated the Android
app to display new cards and soon coming
to Chrome which I believe if you're on
the latest like either canary build or
dev channel you can actually test this
out now but you can do a search by
saying okay Google hey where'd you hear
that from before just like glass right
you say ok Google and then you do your
search and its search has been updated
and improved a lot it's now a they're
calling it conversational search where
it can answer your question you don't
you know you don't have to phrase it
like a search you know you can do normal
language questions and it will come real
you know converse with you and it can
even anticipate your next search result
you know based on your history based on
based on you and and based on you know
what what what you ask so it's almost no
machine learning it's in it's an AI the
knowledge graph is really growing and I
can't wait to test it out i'm not on the
latest developer build of chrome or
canary bill but I've seen some people
testing it and it looks amazing besides
the demo we saw so on the phones is it
always listening I can just pick it up
and say ok Google and he'll start
searching no no this is just for the web
Brewer for Chrome for cry now the I i
was mentioning new cards google search
got updated to include TV new TV
episodes new books and new movies and as
well as new music
albums that come out based on most
likely based on things that you like so
let's say you like Daft Punk and when
their new album comes out which should
be soon if very very soon I think it's
available on iTunes right now and that
the single was available on Google Play
but it if you were when the album comes
out maybe you'll get another now card I
haven't seen one yet um that says hey
you're you know favorite band as an
album out ya go buy it here you know
it's been maybe we'll have a link to the
play store to get it I have seen some
new search cards I had to search cards
pop up saying hey you were recently
searching for stuff about Doctor Who
continue your search here and it showed
a bunch of preview results and I saw one
for Android asking if I want to continue
an Android search and I was curious what
that's about cuz I don't remember
actually just typing in Android usually
it's followed by something else but
that's fine i mean it wanted me to
search for android so it knows me it
knows things i like uh I can't wait to
try it like I said on the desktop if
you're on a canary build right now or a
dev build that has this capability which
I believe one of the two does uh let me
know yeah let me know how it goes uh my
friend Ferran Lee was talking about it
yesterday and he needs that it was
pretty awesome oh okay so let's talk
about in hangouts so well a little bit
of a I don't know I it is a botched
rollout the right wording on that er I
know that it's botched it's just a
half-assed well in that kind of botched
alright so so a gone perfect roll out
yeah i mean i think the service that
they released works well
I haven't encountered any real problems
with it there are some things that I
design choices I guess that I disagree
with I'd like to get more insight into
more users on my like list of people
available I know I can click the new
hangout button and then scroll through
everybody not even everybody just
circles mostly and a few other people
but yeah I'd like to be able to more
easily get to all of my contacts out of
it but like it no works I don't have any
problems with it but it didn't really
unify anything because they didn't give
it a messenger they didn't give it a
talk in gmail they didn't actually
upgrade up everybody's talk apps on
Android I had to go to the Play Store
and push it down to my own well III
don't think it's a I don't think it's a
mandatory update because some people
might not want to update so you have to
you know specifically go and look for it
oh I did specifically go and look for it
and still was unable to install it
through google play store then i dunno
ended with some enviro services yeah
shoot down to the phone yes ah a lot of
devices had issues and they've been
rolling out small updates uh having
Nexus 4 I shouldn't be having an issue
on Google's freaking device well you
know what on my wife's Galaxy Nexus she
wasn't able to install its it
incompatible the first day yesterday
this this morning it said it was
compatible in my nexus 7 sometime in the
afternoon got it it became compatible so
they were rolling it out slowly I mean
think about it they they were had their
have to roll this out to almost a
billion devices so of course it will
take a while well you know it's going to
take a while and III think that you know
I was a little frustrated first I didn't
have access yesterday when I it work I
by the time I came home I did my problem
with it is not so much the way they
rolled out the application to devices
that's been frustrating but you know
ultimately that's kind of whatever my
problem is they're pushing these oh look
we have this new unified chat system but
they didn't bother unifying
it's also replace the old school let's
talk about unification here so gmail
hasn't been upgraded yet it they are
playing to upgrade gmail but yeah one
thing at a time here so that you want
the service for like 60 no we're looking
that is yours we've been hearing about
the service that is coming Dan now some
people were reporting having the talk
icon still there on my next 27 I had the
talk icon still there but actually if I
tapped on that icon if I had a short cut
out on the home screen and tap on the
icon it actually launched hangouts and
most likely if I rebooted the machine it
would have cleared the you know app
cache and boom it have been gone but I
mean now just because it was a shortcut
on the desktop um now now the mesh and
messenger icon is still there well
that's Google+ messenger and a I don't
remember who but a googler commented on
that saying that right now they're
migrating over the backlog of messenger
conversations and once all the
conversations are on the back end are
migrated to the new platform then a
Google+ update will come out and
messenger will go away that's a
laughable excuse absolutely laughable
google has one of the most sophisticated
networks on the planet they are
literally writing the book on how to
build a large-scale network to be able
to do instantaneous global data transfer
to say oh no I'm sorry we can't do this
because we're migrating the data are you
kidding me really all Google does is
migrate data around the world all the
time they custom built a network
specifically to be able to do that with
maximum efficiency unparalleled
efficiency and oh sorry we couldn't roll
this out by guy owe because we're still
migrating the data apparently we didn't
think to start this a week in advance
like really this is just oh we didn't
bother to think about that because we're
putting out this new unified thing so
you know why would we bother thinking
about the eight different services that
we're trying to unify in advance of
releasing this the other thing that
could have done is like they done with
other
like Google search will give you a crowd
if there's an app update they could have
done that in talk they could have done
that with a Google+ update that when you
go to messenger it says hey we're moving
over to hangouts or don't you go install
Vince yeah because if I think about the
average user and you have to take into
account most people just don't really
install app updates like i'll go on most
people's phones and open up the Play
Store and there's like 23 app updates
waiting on them because they just don't
bother updating their phone so putting
it inside an application is about the
best way to get them to migrate and this
book it's probably going to take months
before you actually see average users
even pay enough attention to update talk
to a so you know and is with anything
I'm sure it's going to get better over
time such as SMS support right now we
know if we look at the application
permissions it has permission to read
your text messages it has permission to
send text messages that feature
obviously isn't available yet but the
fact the app has permission to do that
and I won't mention her name but eh but
eh gurgler that we all know and love
said that SMS support is coming very
soon then a few hours after she said
that she updated her post saying oops
sorry we have nothing to comment on this
at this time but she didn't delete the
original portion of that yeah we love
you we love what you do if you happen to
see this so keep up the great work and
thanks for thanks for letting us know
that it isn't coming soon I mean this
isn't a surprise they had kind of
alluded to the fact that voice
immigration wasn't going to be there
released but that it was going to be you
know in the pipeline and realistically I
think I another friend of my another
developer posted some insight on this
where point out that really the point
here isn't to integrate with SMS it's to
replace SMS
yeah why are people still texting just
send me a hangout message you know um I
would say the same thing but then I
looked I looked at an option there's an
option to have google hangout messages
be sent to you via SMS if hangout is
idle I said to myself why would you want
this why do I want hang out messages to
be sent by text message to me and then
and then I realized well not everybody
in the world is blessed with the same
type of data that we are here in the US
not everybody has the same type of
coverage and also some places data plans
are expensive saying text messages no
might not be you know that they normally
aren't so you know we're in one that's
true because carriers are screwing their
cups oh well okay but somebody down in
in Guam you know might not have the best
not work you know no and that's that's
absolutely sure I get that but it's not
any more difficult for a carrier to move
a hangout sighs message from point A to
point B that it is an SMS sighs message
from point A to point B they're just
simple text in fact i'd be willing to
bet that the Hangout sighs message is
probably encountered in a way that makes
it smaller than the SMS all right so
what about somebody that maybe has a
feature phone or has a not a dummy phone
you know non-smartphone they want to get
hang out text messages you know sent to
them oh I feel that those people and we
built them them out of the 1990s horsham
google voice let's just be hypothetical
here could be the trump card that pretty
much puts an end to every other whatsapp
other kind of message because it would
be the one application that you could
still send a text to your grandma if you
felt like it and be in the same exact
application because google voice will
allow you to do that absolutely
absolutely with Google boys they can
integrate it as a selection where you
know you pick your contact that you want
to hang out with
then you pick which of your various you
know contact information for them you
want to contact you want to text their
cell phone number call their work phone
number you have directly through a
hangout send them a message in hangouts
to their gmail address or to their work
email address if they have that in there
on google apps I'd like to be able to
pick and choose which of your various
means of communicating with that person
you want to do all from one interface we
with that if we will did that they could
quite literally make phone numbers
obsolete you have my gmail address you
can call me you can email me you can SMS
me you can instant message me you can
contact me in all of these different
ways that I'm getting google I'd give
them my phone number through voice I
give them my email address obviously and
then they've got they've got all this
information why bother with a phone
number alright so so let's talk about
another product that is near and dear to
our hearts because well those of you
that are watching on YouTube it might be
near and dear to your heart but those of
you that are watching on Google+ right
now we're listening to us later in her
and have a Google+ account let's talk
about the the Google+ overhaul and 41
features Vic said we're added to to
Google+ we're not going to go over all
41 because well frankly we probably
don't know all 41 but also for for time
you know we don't want to have this be
the Google+ shell so for all Google+
newzeas check out our friends at Google
Plus daily I'm sure they know all 41 of
those right there all right so some of
the backgrounds like you're screaming
find out a lot about it to your stream
you know I wasn't going to start with
the stream because it screams a hot
topic or we're never gonna get off the
damn thing let's talk about that stream
alright man there's there's two kinds of
people in this world one they love the
new string changes or two oh my god kill
it with fire I mean there is not and
there's no hybrid no middle ground you
either love the new changes or you or
you're gonna adapt to the new changes
and eventually love them where you're
never going to love them and you hate
those damn things like there's so much
rage yesterday
I'm sure still today about oh my god
this is ridiculous and you don't want
I'm gonna make two comments about it and
you guys can go ahead and let us know
what you think and as I'm ranting and
raving about this here go ahead and let
us know in the comments what do you
think about the new UI changes on
google+ I think it's great because it
allows me to see more content I follow a
lot of people I circle a lot of people
and a couple fat like 3000 some people
so my stream is constantly it's a stream
its flow and it's a moving right so I
miss a lot of posts I miss a lot of
content the fact that I have to go up
into the corner and click refresh while
might be annoying means that means I
made a conscious decision that I don't
want to see what's on my screen anymore
show me something new so that means I
either looked at it all or none of it
amused me so I wanted to see something
new whereas before it's constantly
scrolling if I look away for a second
and I look back I might have missed it
so it allows me to see more content and
I've interacted with a lot more posts
the past day than I have in a long time
so I think it's cool for engagement I
like it for engagement now having
scrollbar ception we have three
scrollbars beside each other and if you
scroll down in one to where you can't
scroll anymore because the other
scrollbar needs to be scrolled down and
as you're scrolling that down if you
accidentally scroll down the page you're
screwed the whole thing went away so
that needs to be free the crowbar
ception needs to be fixed having a
scroll bar inside a scroll bar in a
scroll bar sucks but you know what
you'll watch where you're scrolling you
really tell that's very true yes so uh I
mean what do you guys think about the
stream you know am I am I drunker yeah
you know I'm really kind of ambivalent
about the new UI the multi columns I
could take it or leave it it really
doesn't bother me but I'm not like yes
is the greatest thing ever but you know
I it's also not the end of the world I
do find having to click the new button
annoying just because I
dream doesn't flow as fast as yours and
so I hate having to click every time
like oh there's been one more post click
Next oh there's been a little more cost
click Next Great Lake I don't want to do
that every five minutes I wanted to just
populate especially if I'm not like it
that that screen or that window isn't my
focus if I'm doing something in another
way though I want to just see stuff
populating like that so I'd prefer that
there was an option so uh Damon Hart uh
you know he said I think there is too
much going on the stream which the ridge
said I wish there was two columns
instead of three well my friend you if
you don't like three columns narrow your
window there's this yeah there's a
simple fix for that all you got to do is
just suck your window in just narrow
your window and you can narrow it down
to two columns right now I actually find
myself trying to figure out if I like to
or like three and everyone's long i go
back to care at all i don't want if you
want yeah you can narrow down to one so
yeah just because you click the drop
down more and go down to three column
doesn't mean 3k who actually show you
can have a like the three but I have a
22 inch monitor so I can understand what
somebody out all that app Todd wooden I
just wished the time stamps you know
like the most recent post would be like
most recent you know let's say left to
right right the inconsistent there is
but the next list of cards goes
navigationally back in time consistently
instead of having new slightly older
slightly older slightly older slight in
kind of jumbling them up if it was just
a consistent timestamp and had the card
split for the content either I would
absolutely love it and the clicking the
refresh new isn't really my thing I kind
of liked how it would all the fresh as
long as it's not sitting here kicking me
up to the top I just it would be nice
little what's new and just make it like
a timestamp that highlights what has
been done since I've been scrolled down
on stream and just go to like the last
point you just have it instead of having
to refresh it just shows me where the
post I'll have missed since that points
I mean like a little face you get
enhanced that show you where the other
person last red yeah
oh wait you mean using the same example
had one product in another one too all
right so let's talk about some other
Google+ features let's talk about let's
talk about auto awesome and auto enhance
in those are just awesome names I'm
sorry alright so so auto-awesome can do
a lot of different things for you so
let's say you take let's say you take a
couple landscape photos where it's kind
of like a panorama photo but without a
panorama you know you just take a
picture this way take picture this way
and it's not a panoramic photo but it
could have been well auto-awesome says
huh well you know we're gonna make this
a panoramic photo for this guy or girl
and it turns into a panoramic photo for
you that that's one feature it does now
have you ever taken a whole bunch of
photos of somebody know you're trying to
get that perfect shot he end up you know
taking one with her there you know
facing one way or they're turning one
way then you take another one they're
turning another way so you have a bunch
of similar photos and you look through
them all you try to figure out you know
which pose was the best what you know
which way they're facing which pose were
the best if you have dogs kids Kats
whatever well Google Plus with auto
awesome says wouldn't it be awesome if
they didn't have to choose which of
these poses they liked why don't we why
don't we turn that into an animated gif
and it does and you know I made one last
night and I kind of made NASA and myself
but it was funny i SAT here I wanted
that so unusual for you I was like yeah
this way then this way looking down
looking up I like so what it would have
went to although awesome everything
together I'm like dancing and stuff whoa
I thought I thought it was great and I'm
gonna do it again because it's fun um I
took a photos of my coworker today just
testing it out again and it made this
really awesome animated gif of her
making all sorts of faces and stuff so
that's a really cool feature I can't
wait to use it you know for snapping
photos of my kids and stuff auto enhance
well it it auto enhanced is your phone
um it pretty much does what says uh no
so what what does it do it you know
noise reductions if you take a grainy
photo at night your low light it'll help
with that with noise reduction skin
softening you know it'll uh you know
it'll don't do touch-ups for you hope
get rid of those blemishes not really
but uh yeah it did it it does you know
applies a light filter like it
automatically for you now don't worry
bro shelter yeah now you can turn this
off but it doesn't overwrite here it
doesn't overwrite your original photo it
just touches it up for you and if you
want to go and look at the difference
between the two you just click on the
photo up in the top top left corner you
can click on the little auto enhance
icon and see the original and see the
one that's enhanced and decide to keep
it if you want to keep it or not I think
it's neat said this happens but this
won't happen on your old photos you have
to go do that automatically but it will
happen on anything new that is uploaded
either through instant offload which is
now called auto backup or it'll be
uploaded or you upload it yourself
manually so and speaking of auto backup
I like the fact that they can change
that because now Dan's gonna have a
comment on this because Dan doesn't like
dumb but a lot of people were confused
about instant upload a lot of people
thought oh my god my photos are getting
shared to the world no it was just
getting shared to you and you could
choose to never touch it again or share
it to yourself or delete it or not it
was a private photo but a lot of people
thought oh my god my photos are
instantly uploaded and shared so Google
put a nice big yellow box they're saying
no this is a private album just for you
apparently that wasn't good enough so
now it's called auto backup because
that's really what it does it
automatically backs up your photo submit
now hopefully people won't think it's
automatically sharing their photos oh
let's see then another another big
Google+ update well photos again yeah
we'll keep talking about photos because
that's huge um 15 gigabyte of cloud
storage for full sized photos which you
can store unlimited
photos at the 2048 x 2048 resolution you
now have 15 gig to store your full size
photos that 15 gigs is rolled together
with your what used to be five gigabytes
of drive storage and on average about 10
gigabytes of gmail storage it's all now
rolled into one which is something we
talked about last week is something that
we all they wanted to see ya yeah
definitely yeah so how yeah we talked
about a lot of the stuff last week you
know yeah oh she likes you know metal um
uh so we did talk about some Google TV
stuff last week and we weren't a hundred
percent wrong but we won a hundred
percent right either so Google TV is
basically just being called Android now
which you know we kind of said that um
it's good you TV is going to be updated
to the latest version of Android but
here's the neat thing Google TV isn't
dying it's not going away it's getting
turned into I can a software package and
add on so you can occur now what's that
looks like OS x server now well sure I
never used in a sec syrup because I no
longer an independent distribution you
buy regular OS X and then you buy the
server at on from the whatever ok ok
yeah yeah yeah so you have a you have a
regular Android device I mean I don't
know if there's restrictions on what can
get this you know add-on so i don't know
if i can put installed on my phone but
but but a manufacturer you know makes a
Google TV device put stock android on it
and then after they put stock android on
it they use uh you know we'll call it a
development toolkit a software package
and adeline I don't really know the
official terminology yet but all I know
is it google TV and android are
completely separate and you add it's an
add-on so that's that's as much smarter
way to package it yes in so we'll see uh
you know right now a google TV said that
current market devices will be upgraded
to jelly bean we're not really sure what
that means market devices be that that's
a killer once they're currently on sale
at yeah that's a careful choice
words I would like to assume that that's
what that means but you got to remember
that all those marvel you know chips
that were running I don't know if they
can run I mean well I'm not gonna make a
speculation but c'mon jelly bean yeah I
see us i can probably were in jelly bean
critic yes my jelly bean yeah whoa we'll
see um um I'm curious what happens in
the near future but we do know that
that's exciting you're going to get the
latest version of Android and it can get
prompt or updates because it's a it's a
separate software package you don't have
to worry about a forked version of
Android being maintained yeah I mean not
just faster updates but in updates to
Android independent who updates from
google TV right and as far as the future
of Google TV this means that the google
TV like staff developers that whole team
they don't have to worry about
maintaining their underlying operating
system they can just focus on the
service that they're trying to build and
dan any app it's just Android it doesn't
have to be a special and you know as a
special exactly that also be the Andy
yet the Google TV devices that you're
buying are no longer restricted to these
12 applications it's the full market
yeah and this add-on will have you know
you know uh specific google TV apps
you've on you'll come to know and love
such as you know primetime yeah because
that's that you know that's a
proprietary you know Google TV app so uh
I think that's really it for Google i/o
well you know we had a lot a lot of fun
a lot of geeking out a lot of exciting
stuff but you know what what didn't we
see that we thought we were going to see
you know a lot of people thought we're
gonna see all sorts of devices you know
we ended up seeing a galaxy s4 you know
running stock Android you know we we
didn't see new Nexus 7 we didn't see
well i'm gonna say the other
bastardizations the things that people
thought we were going to see you know we
didn't see a new version andhra we were
fairly confident the fort we're fairly
cough from the 4.3 exists but we didn't
see it latest rumors this evening coming
out of i/o say that on jun 10th a white
Nexus 4 will be unveiled and Android 4.3
will be unveiled as well
and Google did announced at i/o that the
next version of android would support le
Bluetooth low-energy Bluetooth smart
smart ready whatever you want to call it
so they did make that announcement so we
do know it's coming and brew maria's
it'll be here in a month less than that
is it just me or does it seem like
Google should have right io was a lot
earlier this year than it was last year
two months yeah is it just me or does it
seem like they should have had it at the
end of June like that it's asked you
historically it was always in May uh
they pushed it I don't remember why they
pushed it back two months last year I
don't remember but it normally it was an
a but they pushed it back so i I'm
hearing these rumors about a next
version of android and another device
coming on the tenth of June you know
they got Maps going but we are gonna see
it until later this summer yeah hangouts
mostly there but they still haven't done
all of these other pieces of the puzzle
when we have a lot of my stuff that's
kind of ready but not so much well is it
finance I'm better off a month from now
when all this stuff was actually ready
for prime time it's gonna allow them to
make another major announcement to stay
in the media longer you know and it's
going to be after you know apples
developer conference so well actually
the June tenth date I'm not sure when
that is now it's sometime in June okay
pick up it was a clear lake in this year
okay well then the maybe I'll try to
steal the show WWE CA I mean wwd it's
funny because I Oh kind of felt like da
vida de see this year in like WWDC last
year really was kind of it was kind of
developer focused I guess Google did put
more of a developer focus on Io than
WWDC did but there weren't any huge
announcements at WWDC last year just
kind of like this year product wise
which is not necessarily a bad thing I
think Google might be pushing to get the
consumer devices in their own
announcement closer to the holiday
season to try to help sell the nexus
line of better because they say a phone
tablet left you a new Chromebook at the
exact same time and you know kind of get
some industry splash at a time where
people are already going to spend more
money just because it's closer to the
end of the year then maybe that's the
route they're trying to take with their
consumer products I don't yeah I I
definitely don't have a problem with
them not but he got any hardware at this
event I dad yeah I I DeHaan whether I
remember I didn't find any of it
particularly healing even the new Nexus
7 right like I've got an exercise I
don't need to replace it yet so I and I
think it's smart for them to kind of
unify their product launches in the
November timeframe new late october
early november when they released their
phone they really 10 inch tablet but
then they had the nexus 7 was hanging
off on the front end of that I think if
this year they try and need to buy all
three at the one time that's smart for
that but I mean my problem with with
what was there it wasn't so much to what
we didn't see it was what we saw was
only halfway done
alright so one last thing about IO in
our before we close here is the closing
remarks of Larry Page he made us
remember why you know Google's awesome
well why we love Google if you and I'm
not gonna try to paraphrase what he said
because it was a great speech it really
was and you know it made us love Google
more than we already do so go check it
out watch his closing remarks and and
remember you know he basically says that
Google should be trying to build awesome
things that we don't even know what the
hell they are you know shouldn't be
worried about fighting about stupid
patents and fighting about you know you
know YouTube and screw gold and micro
shafted I mean who the hell cares about
that stuff focus on things that we can't
even dream of and to go watch it I I
really enjoyed it yeah and the fact that
he did a question and answer session was
just something that was yeah yeah the QA
analyst pretty nice definitely all right
Dan 32nd patent wars are real quick
because you know we ought even know
Larry Page says we shouldn't focus on it
we focus on it for at least a minute or
two because well it's it's news yes so
there was a a pretty big case called CLS
bank versus Alice Corp so not any actors
in the smartphone world but the Federal
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on bank
and that means that's the entire panel
all of the judges on the entire Court of
Appeals there uh basically ruling that
the material at issue in this particular
case wasn't patentable because it said
blah blah blah on a computer and for
those who aren't familiar a lot of
people have been patenting things where
it's generic and obvious things that
everybody is known or been using for the
last hundreds of years and tacked on on
a computer at the end and then said oh
it's totally new concept and gotten
patents issued so this is the federal
court striking down that concept but
only sort of the ultimate decision was
pretty convoluted there were several
different
concurring opinions it makes it pretty
obvious that this needs to go to the
Supreme Court especially since now this
is the federal court of appeals reneging
on a problem that they themselves
created because software patents weren't
originally a thing until they open the
door to them in the first place so
hopefully we'll finally see some some
progress on this and get a real ruling
from the Supreme Court on the topic in
other legal news youtube / google sent a
cease and desist letter to microsoft
telling them to take down their YouTube
a Windows Phone app that it violates the
youtube's terms of services so basically
Google is saying we're not developing
for your unpopular and cracking platform
and no you can't rip us off and make
your own knockoff version of YouTube
that blocks add strips ads and allows
you to download the video I mean what
Microsoft is actively promoting poyo
