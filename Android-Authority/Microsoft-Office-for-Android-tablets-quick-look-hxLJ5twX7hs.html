handy the Android authority app guy
we're going to take a quick look at
Microsoft Office for Android tablets
there are a total of three applications
so we're just going to quickly glaze
over all three of them let's get started
okay let's do Microsoft Word first the
interface is actually very similar to
the desktop version the opening page the
tabs across the top of the editor and
the same screens all look like miniature
replicas of the desktop version this is
great for those who are used to the
desktop version but may get on the
nerves of fans of holo or material
design because this is certainly not
those things there are three basic
versions that you can have if you don't
sign into a Microsoft account you can
only use this as a document viewer
signing in lets you create and edit
documents if you sign up for the office
365 subscription you'll unlock some
additional formatting features in my
experience the basic free version is
good enough for most people you still
have most formatting along with the
ability to insert images and other stuff
to make documents look good performance
was actually surprisingly good but that
was only after some hiccups in the very
beginning if you have the office 365
subscription you're obviously going to
have more stuff than everybody else but
the basic formatting stuff is there
overall it's definitely cleaner than I
expected I found the templates were
useful and this is actually a decent
showing by Microsoft so far excel is a
lot like Word in terms of interface it
is essentially a mobile copy of their
desktop app so fans will know their way
around also like Word and PowerPoint an
office 365 subscription will get you
more features and if you don't sign in
with a Microsoft account you can only
use this as a document viewer I found
the templates to be much more helpful
here for starting out it's not that the
basic functions are hard to use but
having a base to start from seem to be
more useful in Excel than the other two
the interface was easy to understand and
inputting information never felt tedious
or difficult much like word you have
access to a lot of basic formatting and
small stuff like inserting images there
is also algorithms built in if you need
them the controls for spreadsheets are
very spread out which I actually liked
because it made things easier to manage
on a touchscreen interface than if
everything were all squeezed into one
little area overall like word it was
much better than I was expecting
last up is PowerPoint and pretty much
all of the same stuff applies here you
can view
things without a Microsoft account but
you do need one to edit stuff in an
office 365 subscription is required to
get all of the features it is also
pretty much a copy of the desktop
version to be perfectly honest I wasn't
expecting much in PowerPoint because
presentation software has historically
never been very good on Android much
like the other two I was pleasantly
surprised by the ease of use and control
I had over presentations although I
actually did have PowerPoint crash on me
once while trying to play a slideshow
but it is important to keep in mind that
these are early builds and are probably
going to receive bug fixes and
performance improvements as time goes
over all it is PowerPoint and it feels
like a PowerPoint application overall I
was impressed with Microsoft Office as
long as you have a Microsoft account and
sign in with it you'll have access to
about 90% of the functionality and more
importantly the functionality that
you're probably actually going to use
kudos to Microsoft for not taking the
cheap route and making all the important
features locked up behind a paywall
after seeing how this works in comparing
it to the mobile version I can see now
why Microsoft decided to wait to release
this for tablets the tablet versions are
beyond a shadow of a doubt way more
powerful than the phone versions and I
think that's what they were going for
that said there were some pickups here
and there when the apps first load up
they're a little bit sluggish until
everything gets going and that may
bother some people who are in a rush and
like I said a moment ago PowerPoint did
crash on me once there are those who may
try to get angry about having to sign
into a Microsoft account to use these
applications but you may recall that you
have to sign into a Google account to
use pretty much any Google application
and this is really no different it is a
bit inconvenient especially if you don't
have a Microsoft account but it's not
necessarily a bad thing overall this is
a positive addition to the Google Play
Store especially for those who use
Microsoft Office onedrive or otherwise
married into the Microsoft ecosystem
it's not for everyone obviously but
Microsoft finally has a real and
functional Microsoft Office and I
personally couldn't be happier about it
and that about does it for this video
folks if you want to download the
Microsoft Office suite we'll have those
links in the video description below and
