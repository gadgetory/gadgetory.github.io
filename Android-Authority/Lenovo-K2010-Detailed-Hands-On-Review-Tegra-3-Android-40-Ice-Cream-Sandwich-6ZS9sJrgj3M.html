live from CES 2012 we're here in the
Lenovo booth currently and we're looking
at one of the latest devices now this is
the K 2010 now this is a Tegra 3 tablet
with quad core processing we're looking
at a 1920 x 1200 inch or 1200 pixel 10
inch display it's an IPS LCD really
really crisp really really bright the
thing performs just beautifully now this
is an Android 4.2 and which tablet it's
going to be coming out in q2 they say no
official release date yet now what makes
this device special is that it's got a
full connectivity suite with the sim
card functionality for 3G connectivity
we're looking at a full size SD card
reader as well now this is going to
support SDXC so we're going to have 64
gigabyte 128 gigabyte and 256 gigabyte
SD cards coming out for this pretty soon
now it's 11 millimeters thin it's got a
5 megapixel on the rear and a 1.3 front
facing for video chatting and what
really makes it special too is that this
is the first tablet that's packing 2
gigs of ram and that's really a lot of
RAM for any device like this nice and
smooth we also have a full-sized USB
port as well which is great if you want
have a game controller or anything like
that now it is a little bit heavier but
with such powerful hardware it more than
makes up for it another cool thing is
that it is looking like and they've
actually confirmed for us they are going
to be making a keyboard dock the battery
life of this guy is going to be about 10
hours and when the keyboard dock comes
out on the market is going to make it a
20-hour tablet so this is the little
bouquet 2010 we're here from Lenovo at
CES 2012 and my name is Darcy la cuvee
