authority what's going on everybody and
today we are going to look at the QX
lens line for the xperia smartphones and
actually for most other smartphones that
support NFC a Wi-Fi direct they are able
to connect to other smartphones mostly
because of this bracket that you see
right here this is the i believe it's
the qx100 that i'm using right now yes
the qx100 the one with the ten-time zoom
and as you can see here the bracket
comes right off so these are the two
different parts that are needed in order
to get your land spot to your phone
including the experience experience so
just to be certain i'm going to go ahead
and put the bracket on there separately
and here goes the xperia z1 so what you
do is you take the bracket there's a
little arrow right here that denotes
where you're supposed to be putting the
bracket start off with there because it
will stretch out and then come on to
oops I retracted one of them there you
go it comes right out and comes right
back onto the phone on the other side
and now you are set up so it pretty much
looks like this after that what happens
is you turn on the NFC of the actual
lends itself and it's on right here and
then you tap as you can see it retracted
so it's there and then you tap that side
to the phone and it will automatically
find
the camera lens
it's worth noting that when it comes to
using the lens on the xperia smartphone
a dedicated camera button on here is for
the phone there is actually a button
right next to those zoom controls i can
see on the side right here that you have
to use for the lens itself it comes with
its own hardware so if we're going to
use it we'll just hold kind of like this
you can stabilize with your other hand
and you use the button on the side in
order to take the pictures
there's one right there
from what I can tell in terms of looking
at the picture on the actual device
itself the picture pi is actually quite
good the very high quality obviously you
have 20-plus megapixels and even either
the smartphone camera or e or this one
so if you want an extra boost in quality
this lens is a great way to do it and
the fact that it does connect to a bunch
of other smartphones as well or has the
capability to should allow you to get
even more from your smartphone
photography so we're going to try and
get the pictures out of the the qx100
lens that is on here so we can show you
what the quality is like but for now
once you stay tuned to android authority
we're live here at etha in berlin here
at the sony booth taking a look at the
sony QX lenses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
