thority what's going on everybody and
today we are going to look at the QX
lens line for the Xperia smartphones and
actually for most other smartphones that
support NFC and Wi-Fi direct they are
able to connect to other smartphones
mostly because of this bracket that you
see right here this is the I believe
it's the QX 100 that I'm using right now
yes the cubes will hunter the one with
the ten times zoom and as you can see
here the bracket comes well right off so
these are the two different parts that
are needed in order to get your Lance
pod to your phone including the
experience experience so just to be
certain I'm going to go ahead and put
the bracket on there separately and here
is the Xperia z1 so what you do is you
take the bracket there's a little arrow
right here that denotes where you're
supposed to be putting the bracket start
off with there because it will stretch
out and then come on - oops I retracted
one of them
comes right out and comes right back on
through the phone on the other side and
now you are set up so it pretty much
looks like this after that what happens
is you turn on the NFC of the actual
lens itself and it's on right here and
then you tap as you can see it retracted
so it's there and then you tap that side
to the phone and it will automatically
find
the camera lights it's worth noting that
when it comes to using the lens on the
Xperia smartphone a dedicated camera
button on here is for the phone there is
actually a button right next to those
zoom controls I can see on the side
right here that you have to use for the
lens itself it comes with its following
hardware so if we're going to use it
we'll just hold kind of like this you
can stabilize with your other hand
and you use these the button on the side
in order to take the pictures
one right there
from what I can tell in terms of looking
at the picture on the actual device
itself the picture ply is actually quite
good
the it's very high quality obviously you
have 20-plus megapixels and even either
the smartphone camera already or this
one so if you want an extra boost in
quality this this lens is a great way to
do it and the fact that it does connect
to a bunch of other smartphones as well
or has the capability to should allow
you to get even more from the smartphone
photography so we're going to try and
get the pictures out of the the QX 100
lens that is on here so we can show you
what the quality is like but for now
once you stay tuned to Android thority
we're live here at Aoife in Berlin here
at the Sony booth taking a look at the
sony QX lenses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
