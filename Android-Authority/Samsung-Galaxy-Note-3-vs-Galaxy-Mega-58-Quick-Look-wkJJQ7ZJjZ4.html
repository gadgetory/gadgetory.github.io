Samsung but you don't need the s-pen or
all of that extra stuff hey it's Josh of
Agartha mandroid authority what's going
on everybody and this is the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 versus the Galaxy mega 5.8
in this quick look the galaxy mega 5.8
is essentially the same phone as the
Galaxy Note 2 except it doesn't come
with the s-pen and sports lower
specifications in terms of design this
is quite simply a bigger version of the
various glossy plastic Galaxy devices
that we all know and love or hate the
rounded pebble look is here with a
removable back cover that gives access
to the removable battery and card slots
the button layout is classic Samsung and
then we see the new Galaxy Note 3 which
was given essentially new life in terms
of design with more decisive flatness
and edges the Galaxy Note 3 also comes
with a great new backing that is almost
reminiscent of leather but is actually
just textured plastic undoubtedly the
Galaxy Note 3 feels and looks better
than the mega with its now somewhat
dated look but these phones are
virtually the same when it comes to size
and thus either one could please those
who actually do need a bigger phone but
it is in the display that the size is
given merit and it's here that the
Galaxy Note 3 simply excels the 1080p
display is the same one that was found
on the galaxy s4 only bigger
this means high saturation and very
vivid colors unfortunately for the
Galaxy mega it didn't get nearly the
same kind of treatment and was given a
TFT capacitive screen capable of only
960 by 540 resolution making it a rather
poor performer all around it's not a
horrid screen but definitely pales in
comparison to the stellar note 3 display
under the hood the story is pretty
similar the note 3 being the flagship
big device for Samsung has been given
the full power treatment it has the
Snapdragon 800 clocked in at 2.3
gigahertz the Adreno 330 and 3 gigabytes
of RAM for all your S Pen and
multitasking needs this package
definitely sets the bar in performance
and the mega can just barely keep up
powered by a dual-core 1.4 gigahertz
Broadcom processor and half the RAM the
rest of the lowered specs all around
pretty much or what keep the mega afloat
it's a big phone with lower to medium
performance that can be enough for the
average user but even then they might be
reaching both come with removable
batteries and expandable memory though
the mega can't handle dual SIM cards for
you big communicators out there the
camera situation is also a matter of
flagship versus mid-range device as the
galaxy note reads camera
with 13 megapixel optics and a robust
features package its quality puts it
among the best the mega 5.8 on the other
hand sports an 8 megapixel camera that
derives from the galaxy s4 without
having all of the additions pictures are
adequate from the mega but the updated
note 3 is sure to have better photos due
to its new enhancements and finally in
software we have two TouchWiz versions
the galaxy mega doesn't come with nearly
as many additions to its navigation as
the galaxy note 3 as it is better
considered a much larger version of the
galaxy s3 no air gestures or air views
are available thus leaving the mega with
a very classical TouchWiz experience the
note 3 on the other hand gets a ton of
additions to its s-pen enabled interface
including an enhanced multi window and
pen functions like memos and scrapbooks
even if you're not too familiar with the
s-pen there's just so much missing from
the mega that the note 3 remains the
much more attractive package and so
there you have it two similarly sized
devices with very different packages
underneath while the Galaxy Note 3
undoubtedly sets the bar very high for
the rest of the galaxy line the mega can
still be a worthy device for anyone that
really just likes handling how large
your hardware and doesn't need much else
it's performance leaves a lot to be
desired but then again there are varying
degrees of demand thank you for watching
all of our quick looks and the ephah
