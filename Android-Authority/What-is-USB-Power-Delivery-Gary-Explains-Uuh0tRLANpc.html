authority now back in the day the power
that came out of your USB port was
really quite simple it was running at 5
volts it gave out naught point 5 amps
which means it gave you 2.5 watts of
power and that was that however things
have moved on significantly since then
especially once you include USB power
delivery so the question for us today is
what is USB power delivery and how does
it work well let me explain okay first
of all let's get some terminology out of
the way when we're talking about power
we're talking about is watts and you
calculate the Watts by multiplying the
amps by the voltage so as I said just a
few moments ago USB originally was five
volts at naught point five amps so 5
times by naught point five half of five
is 2.5 watts now the idea behind USB
power delivery is a system where you can
get up to hundred watts so from two
point 500 Watts through a USB port now
before we get into the details of USB
power delivery let's look at all the
different standards that come with USB
and how much power each different
standard allows a port to supply so
starting with USB 2.0 5 volt naught
point 5 amps 500 milliamps which gave
you 2.5 watts of power
now when USB 3 came along that 5 volts
remain the same but it could actually
provide up to 900 more point 9 amps of
power which would give you 4.5 watts
there's also a standard called the USB
battery charging standard and we'll talk
about that in a moment
now with USB battery charging it's 5
volts at 1.5 amps which gives you 7.5
watts of power and then if you've got a
USB type-c cable just connected to a USB
3 port then you can get 5 amp 5 volts at
3 amps giving you 15 watts of power but
if you have a USB type-c cable connected
to a USB power delivery system then you
can get up to 20 volts 5 amps which
gives you 100 watts now the key thing
here to remember about power delivery is
that it's the only one that changes the
voltage level all of them including the
battery charging standards still remain
at 5 volts
okay and there but power delivery can
actually up that up to 20 volts now just
mentioning quickly about the power
battery charging standard that was
basically a system that only works with
charge as it doesn't work on computers
that only works on charges and by
shorting the data pins together because
you can't transfer data over it the
device that was charging could speak to
it and realize that this is a battery
charging compliant charger and therefore
it could deliver up to 7.5 watts
now all USB type-c cables are 3 amp
compliant now the important thing to
know about power is it only works over
true USB type-c cables that means you go
to USB type-c oval plug at one end and
the USB type-c oval plug at the other
end now you've got a cave with a type a
at one and in a type C at the other and
that cannot be used for USB power
delivery and the reason for that is
because USB power delivery actually uses
some extra pins in USB type-c to
negotiate the power level so what
happens when you do have type a at 1 in
and type C the other in there are some
resistors in the plugs which tell the
devices what type of cable this is now
in the past has been a problem that
people companies have been putting the
wrong resistors in there and the result
has been although the cable itself can
support 3 amps what happens when you
plug that into a device let's say like
your PC into the motherboard and then
you've got a phone at the other end that
wants three amps it can actually say oh
this is a three amp cable and it
actually requests that three amps from
your motherboard now remember of course
USB normal USB is only up to anon USB
type 3 is up to only naught point nine
amps and that can actually cause your
motherboard or your charger to overload
that's why it's important these cables
stick to the default power resistor
configurations on them now as I mention
what happens with USB type-c there's
extra pins called the control pins that
actually may talk to each other and
through these pins they're separating
the data pins separate than the power
pins separate than the video pin they
are there just to full control and what
happens is the two devices when they've
both got USB type-c can talk to each
other and say hey I want this amount of
voltage I want this amount of current
and then they negotiate what they want
now up until 45 watt even after 60 watts
you a three amp cable is absolutely fine
now if you're using something bigger
than that
then you're gonna have to go up to a 5
amp cable but anything from 45 60 watts
in might in some cases we'll be able to
use that 3 amp cable of course here
we're talking about powering laptops
with my powering monitors which I'm
about powering things more than just
your smartphone now the original pixel
used a USB power delivery and I did a
test just for this video just to confirm
that power delivery worked very very
well and that it was able to charge the
battery from 0 up to a hundred percent
in just 97 minutes just over an hour and
a half which is great for a full charge
but again that only works if you've got
a USB the power delivery compliant
charger and you're using a USB C cable
with those USB C plugs at both ends now
finally at the end it's worth talking
about Qualcomm quick charge Qualcomm
quick charge had a similar idea going on
it was able to up the voltage more than
5 volts he could go up to 9 and 12 and
so on and that was able to provide
charge for phones now of course what
actually happened is that that
technically breaks the USB specification
not technically allowed to do that and
in fact Google make a statement about
this in their Android compliancy
document about what is a compliant
Android phone or not let me read it to
you
We strongly recommend to not support
proprietary charging methods that modify
the voltage bus beyond default levels or
alter sync
source roles as such may result in
interoperability issues with the charges
or devices that support the standard USB
power delivery methods while this is
called out as strongly recommended in
future Android versions we might require
all type C devices to support full
interoperability with standard type C
charges so Google basically tried to say
if you want to be called an Android
phone you have to support USB power
delivery and that's course what they've
done with their pixel devices now at the
moment it is still strongly recommended
which is kind of their strongest
language they could use without actually
saying this is an actual requirement now
that wording can be found in the
in the androids seven compliancy
document it can also be found in the
Android 8 complaint a document so as of
yet Google haven't forced manufacturers
down this path but as they say they
could do in the future
now core coms response to this is
actually for quick charge for quick
charge for works side by side with USB
power delivery and what that means is
that if you have a quick charge for
charger and you plug it into a power
delivery device that say like a pixel
then the the charge will recognize that
it's not going to be using quick charge
it's a switch over to using power to do
so it allows both systems to run side by
side and Qualcomm have done that in a
hope that they can still sell their
quick charge technology to manufacturers
but still kind of remain compliant so
that when you use your charger for other
devices is still able to deliver the
right amount of voltage and right amount
of current and devices still work
without suddenly staying on and this
isn't quick charge I'll just resort back
to 2.5 watts so actually that's a pretty
good move from Qualcomm
so in summary basically we're now
hopefully moving towards an era of a
kind of a universal power supply a
situation where USB power delivery can
be used to power monitors hard disks
laptops charge up phones and as long as
you've got that USB
c-type cable at both ends then you'll be
able to supply get in and the full
amount of power be able to be taken and
the good thing about USB power delivery
is the consumer doesn't need to worry
about the voltages and the amps as long
as a charger says I support 45 watts or
this charger support 18 watts then the
USB power delivery system can kapkan
talk between the two to actually deliver
the right amount of voltage and an amp
so basic if you were buying a
replacement charge or we were at a
friend's house you want to plug in
something including even a laptop or
even an external hard drive as long as
it's USB type-c power delivery compliant
and it's got the number of watts that
you need from your original charger than
that spare charger the replacement
charger that one your boring will work
exactly the same way so that gives us
this kind of a universal power supply
