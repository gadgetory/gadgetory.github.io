close and while it was definitely a
chore going across the entire mess of
Berlin to find some of the best products
we have 16 picks across three different
sites yes we have entered authorities
picks coming up first but we also have
tab times and sound guys giving out
awards for some products beyond the
world of Android this is your best of
Aoife 2016 so we're kicking off the
Android authority woods with one of the
most standout products at the show
lenovo unique and quirky yoga book which
features two tablets slate in a 2:1 form
factor and runs either Windows 10 or
Android you've got a main screen with a
10.1 inch full HD display and then
unlike other two-in-ones you've actually
got a secondary touch display the second
screen is where the magic really happens
Lenovo's managed to create a touch
keyboard that somewhat successfully
provides haptic feedback but with the
touch of a button it converts to a slate
that you can draw on and if you so wish
you can even put a pad on there and draw
on it to have both a physical and
digital copy as far as unique products
go definitely a worthy winner to say
that Android smartphones were pretty
thin on the ground
Aoife this year would be an
understatement with both Samsung and LG
sidestepping the show for standalone
events before and after however lenovo
was on deck and they dropped the Moto C
play the Moto Z play is essentially the
follow-up to the Moto G for play but it
brings all the coolness of modularity
and familiarity of the Moto Z range at a
lower price point if you want a
modularity that didn't break the bank
and one access to all those fancy Lenovo
modules then look no further as the Moto
Z play definitely takes those boxes we
keep the lenovo party going as we take a
look at the tap three plus the yoga line
of tablets has always been a bit of a
favorite android authority simply
because it's a tablet that can literally
stand on its own in that area where the
kickstand is you have a wonderful large
battery along with a wonderful sound
experience because of the enhanced
speakers and with a quad HD display it
is a nice tablet to use for work and
play it does lose the projector but then
it also loses a bit of its price so for
a pretty affordable tablet the yoga Tab
3 plus is actually one of the better
ones that we saw at the show simply
because like I said already it can
literally stand on it
but then we bring it over to Samsung
with the gear s3 now the gear s2 was an
alternative to the Apple watch at last
year's Aoife and this year we get an
even bigger quite literally version of
the gear s2 classic the gear s3 retains
a lot of the look from the gear s2
classic with its clicky rotating bezel
that has the ridges and it's a pretty
large device when compared to the
original gear s2 but it also comes with
a number of new features along with that
lovely look it also comes with LTE
connectivity in the gear s3 frontier and
you also get Samsung pay across the
board with the gear s 3s so if you're
looking for a really fun way to pay for
a lot of stuff the gear s3 might be the
watch that you're looking for but it
also looks really good to boot onto the
next award and let's just first say this
when nubia invited us to have briefing
on their new flagship we did not expect
to be giving them award which goes to
show any company is worthy of an award
when they truly innovate anubius
certainly delivered on this with the new
beers at 11 which is arguably the
world's first truly bezel a smart phone
using a patented arced design the Nubia
Z 11 has no bezels either side of the
display and this also means a company
was able to add touch gestures to the
side of the phone kind of in a way that
Samsung's managed to do with the galaxy
s7 edge a worthy award for a very unique
smartphone in recent time sony has been
pretty much under the hammer trying to
deliver on a flagship worthy of the name
with minor incremental updates and a
very similar design but a tea for 2016
that got flipped on its head following
on from the xperia x range earlier this
year sony delivered the Xperia X Z or X
Z depending on where you live and how
you pronounce it now the specs are not
entirely new but the design is the
software is top-notch and there's a lot
of really exciting stuff going on in
this new device hopefully indicative of
where Sony takes intends to take things
in the near future what truly sets the
xperia x s8 apart though is its new 5
axis stabilization on the 23 megapixel
camera this is the world's first and
it's definitely something we're looking
forward to playing around with a little
bit more if you've somehow forgotten
about Android wear it's still alive and
kicking and it was there definitely at
Aoife 2016 with the assist
then watch three asus has always put out
a pretty nice line of Zen watches and
the
third iteration comes in with ip67
certification which means you can
actually let it take a splash or a
tumble and it will still keep kicking
the Zen watch three offers three buttons
along the right side of the watch and
you have a choice of either a silicon or
leather strap and a choice of silver
bronze or rose gold for the dials
other notable specs include a 1.3 9 inch
AMOLED display a 340 milliamp hour
battery and of course Android wear which
is still growing and continues to really
pump out some very nice devices one of
which is definitely the azuz then watch
three and on to the final Android 30
award and yes the three doodle Pro
technically is an Android but the
possibilities are endless the new pen
basically allows you to draw and doodle
absolutely anything in 3d with a wider
choice of materials including wood
copper bronze nylon and polycarbonate
plastic to show just how easy it is to
use 3doodler even mocked up our android
authority logo in plastic in just a
couple of minutes they made a case for
the galaxy s7 edge in just 10 minutes
and created a 3d version of the android
aura mascot definitely a cool product
and if you've been looking for a way to
create customized and unique cases or
accessories for your smartphone or
beyond the three doodle pro could be the
answer and if you've been looking to
dive outside of the world of Android tab
times is where you should be
you have tablets computing and really
just all the tech all the time at tab
times so we have four awards that were
giving out a tee for 2016 with tablets
dying breed fewer companies are making
dedicated Android tablet and are rather
focusing on two-in-ones and other form
factors yet Huawei's new media pod aims
to offer just this sporting a metal
build quad HD display and a large 5100
milliamp hour battery the media pod has
a lot to offer if you're after an
android tablet that is like other huawei
products it comes with a fingerprint
sensor that also supports gestures it's
running Android marshmallow with
Huawei's emui 4.1 on top has quite a
powerful carryin 950 processor with 4
gigabytes of RAM a choice of either 32
gigabytes or 64 gigabytes of expandable
storage and a mali t88 GPU that offers
surprisingly good performance and gaming
wanna know more check out a full media
pod m3 review but if a tablet is not
exactly your style and you are looking
for something a little bit more
traditional
then the Lenovo yoga 9 10 is a pretty
impressive two-in-one
laptops / tablet it's got all the specs
you could ever wish for including a
thirteen point nine inch display that
comes in either full HD or 4k resolution
that's a touchscreen and it has really
really thin bezels on three of the four
sides it's also rocking a intel core i7
cable a processor and a massive battery
that should keep you powering on all day
long when it comes to comparisons you
can think of it as a Dell XPS 15 but a
lot lighter and a lot more affordable
you might notice a bit of a trend in
these awards as the laptops or the
convertibles or tablets are getting
smaller and smaller and there's not one
thinner or smaller than the Acer swift 7
this might be just one of my favorite
devices at Aoife 2016 and this was one
of the first devices that I dived
outside of Android with and it just had
a lot of fun with this nine point nine
eight a millimeter thin laptop it
features a 13.3 inch non touch full HD
IPS display with Gorilla Glass
protection and it has a full sized
keyboard with a very large trackpad but
under the hood you get the latest Intel
i7 processor with a gigabytes of RAM and
a solid-state drive coming in at 256
gigabytes of storage the Swift 7 does
come with two USB C port and a headphone
jack for all you audio lovers out there
and speaking of which there is Dolby
audio enhancement in those speakers on
the bottom which do ensure some pretty
good audio considering how a supremely
thin this laptop is you could just take
it just about anywhere and it's also so
stylish that it's definitely going to
turn some heads from the insanely thin
to the ludicrously large as there's no
other way to describe Asus other
standout creation the world's first
curved notebook before you rush out to
buy it it's worth knowing that this is
one monstrous machine and the chances of
you actually ever using it as a notebook
are probably slim to none what makes it
so monstrous it's a 21 inch curved
display and it also comes with two
geforce 1080p GPUs a built in mechanical
keyboard it weighs in at 7.7 kilograms
and that's before you include the two
power supplies it needs to run although
the weight does include the five system
fans and the eight heat pipes in the
machine itself it's got a ton of other
specs and if you're a gamer this is
probably the best laptop for you if you
can even get it on your lap that is
audiophiles take off your headphones cuz
it's time for these sound guys Awards
there are a lot of sound products at you
for 2016 and we got a look at quite a
few of them and four of them really
stood out to us so if you are a lover
of audio and music these might be
products that you're really looking for
we're kicking the audio section of these
Awards off with a visit to Harman Kardon
and the new AKG and 40 in ear headphones
that come with a customizable listening
experience one a boost in the bass
linear sound or a boost in those highs
well everything is possible thanks to
tweakable sound filters which basically
have filtered down from higher price
points and the award-winning n60 noise
cancelling headphones basically allowing
you to experience high res audio
straight from your smartphone definitely
a worthy winner in our book from the
sleek - something out of this world
quite literally if you've been hunting
for an undeniably quirky in-ear pair of
headphones that showcase good audio the
I scene 10 definitely deliver made by
Audis boutique headphone brand known for
making some of the best planar
headphones in the world
the I scene 10 deliver what many people
thought was impossible for the
uninitiated planet magnetics offer a
larger surface area from which sound can
resonate and considering the technology
itself headphones utilizing planner
magnetics often quite large but someone
clearly forgot to tell Audis the result
the world's first planar in-ear
headphones a well deserved award for a
company that has truly innovated in
audio a tee for 2016
especially when considering the world of
android right now you're probably
becoming very aware of the word deck
well Raj has a deck amp l1 which is a
way of adding a DAC an amplifier to your
existing audio solution essentially it's
offering high res audio on the go but it
is the first device of its kind to
feature dual decks and amplifiers with
each pair responsible for one channel of
stereo audio so you're going to get some
really high quality audio in either ear
it does come with the input options of
either ISB mini Toslink or 3.5
millimeter line in with the output
connectivity options being 3.5
millimeter or mini XLR so you audio
files out there will really be able to
get some awesome audio out of the are
each a DAC amp l1 no matter what you're
using to actually play the music or the
audio that you're listening to now our
last pick for audio is by far one of the
most unique and the simple way to think
about it is to imagine just how
different your favorite song sounds when
you listen to it on headphones compared
to when you hear it in the club thanks
to the unique acoustic variables in each
individual venue and of course their
sound system the same song can sound
incredibly different depending on where
you're here
doing it now Sennheiser has introduced
its am be a venue modeling solution
which essentially maps out the interior
of a venue as well as a sound system and
recreates that when you're listening to
a song on your headphones it's a pretty
impressive solution and it's amazing to
hear just how differently the same song
can sound depending on where you're
listening to it this kind of 3d
immersive audio experience is just dying
to be picked up by the likes of Spotify
or Pandora and it will absolutely change
the way you think of your music on your
phone in the future and so there you
have it 16 of the best products that we
found at Eva 2016 not just from Android
to computing but also to audio and
everything in between these products
stood out for a variety of reasons from
the hundreds that we saw at the mists of
Berlin at Aoife 2016 and believe you me
there were a ton of them and it's really
hard to go through all of them to find
some of the best the cream of the crop
