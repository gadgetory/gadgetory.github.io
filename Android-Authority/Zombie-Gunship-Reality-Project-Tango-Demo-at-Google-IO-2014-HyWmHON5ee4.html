manager for Olympic software and we
developed the game zombie gunship
reality in partnership with project
tango so in our game you pretty much
takes the pretty much in control of a
gunship and you move around a 3d map and
shoot up some zombies
so what's really awesome with some
project tango is that we used an
accelerometer and the odometry to
determine your position and rotation in
space so we can actually like move
forward and like zoom all the way down
here to shoot up the zombies down here
and what's really awesome about this
technologies that we can also move
around and pretty much do a funny
and see the Statue of Liberty over here
if we want to get closer we can actually
walk towards her
and just blast all these zombies here at
the kingdom come
we can also toggle weapon so right now
we're shooting with a 25 millimeter we
got a 40 millimeter here and then we got
this deadly 105 which has a little
loading reloading delay as it should
we got three seconds left on the clock
and I'm going to call in an air strike
back up to just wipe out all the zombies
and that's the end of our demo for
zombie gunship reality
