brought to you by full sail university
the one plus two is unveiled and from 4
gigabytes of RAM on the premium 64
gigabyte model to a snapdragon 810
processor 13 megapixel camera equipped
with F 2 point 0 aperture optical image
stabilization laser autofocus there's a
lot to like about the oneplus 2 you've
got to admit it's missing some things
though now let's start off with NFC one
trend that looks set to rise in the next
18 months is mobile payments and NFC
near field communications plays a
crucial part of making this a reality
unfortunately the 1+2 doesn't come with
NFC built into the handset meaning
mobile payments do become a major
feature the 1+2 could be left aside
what's up with no wireless charging
wireless or quick charging is a dual
feature that we're seeing many companies
adopt instead of a removable battery
while wireless charging is less widely
adopted it is becoming a standard in
several premium flights of devices and
quick charging is proven to be essential
in handsets that do not have a removable
battery speaking about a removable
battery the case of a removable versus
non removable battery has been contested
for many years and Samsung's decision to
avoid a removable battery and its
flagship handset earlier this year saw
the feature become even more contested
in the case of the oneplus to the non
removable battery is unsurprising given
that the oneplus one battery was also
non removable but despite the slightly
increased capacity the lack of quick
charging or the ability to swap out your
battery may be a running concern for
some now this is not a concern for me
but I know some of you will be very
disappointed at the lack of quad HD
resolution with the 1+2 aiming to
challenge future flagships the lack of
quad HD resolution may yet prove to be
the difference-maker the better
resolution would have delivered a more
dense experience 534 ppi versus 401 ppi
that would have prevented a challenge
from other handsets in the same price
bracket let's talk expandable storage
the cost for expandable storage only
really applies to the entry level 1 + 2
which costs three hundred and twenty
nine dollars us and has 16 gigabytes of
storage as well as 3 gigabytes of RAM
while users of the premium version with
gigabytes of ram and 64 gigabytes of
internal storage should find the
capacity plenty users of the lower
version may find the 16 gigabyte too
limiting for daily use so let's get down
to the bottom line here some of you will
be very disappointed at some of those
lack of features especially the
expandable storage and let's talk about
that many people will say intuitively
hey why would you sort of gouge the
pockets of your loyal users why would
you poke them in the eye but not
providing a 32 gigabyte option or
expandable storage you're just pissing
off your loyal users but the
counterintuitive truth is really the
truth and that is that they're not just
utilitarian devices these phones there
are also fashion symbols they are a sign
of our social status and we tend to buy
the phone that best projects the image
that we want to show to the world and
we're more concerned with that than we
are with internal storage now many of
you will have known me for my how to
become TV and XDA developer TV days
where basically I was interviewing
software developers for living many of
the best developers on the planet and
the thing that became painfully clear
was that there was a serious gap between
the theory and the practical knowledge
that new graduates new developers had
and that made it really difficult for
them to actually make good products and
this is what our sponsor full sail
university is trying to address the
mobile development bachelor's degree
program offered on campus and online
teaches students how to develop apps and
utilities through courses that cover
both iOS and Android development all
students graduate with multiple
completed software products and the web
design and development bachelor's degree
program also offered on campus and
online teaches front and design and
back-end development along with coding
formats programming languages and more
all students have hands-on access to
technology from day one they receive a
laptop computer at an institutional
discount along with relevant software
and tools to learn more about full sales
