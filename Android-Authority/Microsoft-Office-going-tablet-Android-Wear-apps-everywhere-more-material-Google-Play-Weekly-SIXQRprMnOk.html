Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Google Play weekly this
week we have Android we're comin out of
the ears and a whole lot more great news
so let's roll that intro first up this
week Android wear has a dedicated
section in the Google Play Store now
woot woot in this section securely sits
about two dozen applications that are
ready for Android wear among them is the
popular ifttt the official app for the
Guardian duolingo and the official
Android wear app which we'll talk about
here in a minute 24 doesn't seem like a
lot but Android wear has only been a
thing for a couple of weeks expect this
number to grow quickly in the future
speaking of Google they also went ahead
and bought Songza this week google
purchased the music start up for about
15 million dollars as last week Songza
is known for their specially curated
music section where they have experts in
each genre that create playlists for
people to listen to we imagine that soon
these curators were removed into google
play music to improve their radio
selections eventually Google's latest
update Wednesday went off without a
hitch this week and this week it was
Google Docs Google sheets and YouTube
that got updated for Google Docs and
Google sheets a huge update rolled out
that overhauls the UI this is among many
updates we expect from google apps in
the coming weeks as they switch over to
the new material design standard along
with that each app can now edit and
create Word and Excel files from
Microsoft Office respectively which is
great news if you use those things
YouTube's update was smaller but it's
arguably more fun with their latest
update the YouTube mobile app now has
google TV and google movies integration
and you can now stream content from
those there aren't any sort option jet
so if you have a big collection
everything is just kind of jumbled
together and sorted by when you purchase
them but we're sure that's a problem
that'll be fixed in later updates last
up this week is some really good news
Microsoft Office will soon have tablet
supports you want to review this
application a few months ago one of the
things you guys hated the most about it
was that it didn't have tablet support
now Microsoft is currently seeking beta
testers to test the tablet version of
microsoft office we don't know when this
will translate to a release to the
general public but if you'd like to try
to get into the beta we'll have a link
for that in the written companion below
so who wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the written
companion which is in the video
description below the official android
wear application was released this last
week and if you have a SmartWatch that
runs the OS then you should probably
have this application also it doesn't do
much but it does help the integration of
your Android device with your Android
wear device and that includes voice
preferences notification settings and
configuration McGillis infinity was
released this last week and it won an
award for being the most innovative game
we're not sure who gave out that award
but so far the game has rave reviews and
people seem to enjoy playing it the
concept is simple you use your fingers
to control various planets and you can
do what you want as long as the colors
don't touch each other it's a little too
minimal for my tastes but I know a lot
of people like this kind of stuff and
it's 299 in the ghumao next up is the
Android L keyboard that was released to
the google play store by an XDA member
earlier this week the ratings are pretty
good and it seems to be usable by people
who aren't on the Developer Preview it's
also free in all of its freeness so if
you want to have androids latest
keyboard if this is what you're looking
for heads up is an application that
allows you to have the Android L style
pop out notifications without actually
having Android L there are a few books
that are still being worked out but in
general the application seems to be well
received it's a buck in the Google Play
Store and if you've been wanting the
Android L style pop-up notifications and
this is the way to go until Android L
actually comes out eat24 is an awesome
application that lets you order food for
pickup or delivery it's also been
updated with the ability to order things
with your Android wear SmartWatch and
that was demoed at Google i/o even if
you don't have Android wear it's a
really fun application to see what's in
your area and the folks e 24 are
generally cool and fun check out their
application it's free
