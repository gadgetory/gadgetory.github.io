clayton over to android authority calm
and today i'm bringing you the AO KP rom
for the galaxy nexus and on top of the
AOKP rom i've also flashed the galaxy s3
theme pack now it's actually been done
is a developer has taken a lot of the
native apps and the TouchWiz launcher
and some of the framework from the
galaxy s3 and actually put it in a theme
for the Galaxy Nexus as you see we have
our icons and of course i modified my
soft keys because i'm running the aokp
but we have our settings here with the
theme of the galaxy s3 see all of our
TouchWiz icons and all of our icons are
different we go down to our about phone
and you can see we're running Android
404 and we're running the aokp with the
number 38 to build 38
if we go to our dock we have our apps
and widgets and we can go across and you
can see here that we have some of the
galaxy s3's apps we have our s voice
pattern and we've got our task manager
and downloads and so if we go to our
task manager and see here that we have
our active applications downloaded we
have our Ram where you can clear our
memory and we have our storage options
and this is all themed exactly how it is
on TouchWiz for the galaxy s3 the Ice
Cream Sandwich TouchWiz you can go to
our s voice which is actually the APK
that is included on the galaxy s3 we'll
just have to go through our disclaimer
and everything but it works perfectly
and we'll go through our little
instructions here gives us some
suggestions about how to use s voice and
these are all the things you can do with
the S voice you can say hi galaxy hi
galaxy
and there you have it it works perfectly
fine you can do commands with it and
everything else we've got our super user
of course because it's rooted this also
comes with a brand-new flipboard app and
of course our downloads it's got the
icons for the camera and we can just
drag one to the screen and we have our
options down there like create folder
create page we can drag it to the create
folder and that's how the folders are
created and we can just drag another
thing to the folder and when we open it
it brings it up on the bottom kind of
like it does on the Galaxy Tab 10.1 to
any ice cream sandwich running TouchWiz
we have our Apollo music player CM
nightly our cyanogenmod and mr. Mads the
developer so we included some of his
stuff this is solid explorer it's
included in the theme pack and it's just
a really nice like a root explorer in
file manager a lot of cool features so
that's a nice little extra that comes
with the theme pack let's go back
anyways we can go to our widgets and we
have all of the widgets that are
included in the galaxy s3 and then some
they're included with a okp roms and
we've got apollo music and stuff and
their little menu has market search and
uninstall but the menu for the apps has
a few more such as downloaded
applications different ways of a sorting
your apps that you have and that's
basically if folks if you liked the
review I would subscribe to android
authority coms youtube and check our
website for more updates about the
galaxy s3 the Galaxy Nexus and basically
any phone you guys have got out there so
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
