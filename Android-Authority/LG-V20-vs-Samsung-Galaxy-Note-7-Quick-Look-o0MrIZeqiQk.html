authority and we're taking a quick
hands-on look at LG's biggest phone of
the year with the V 20 and comparing it
to Samsung's biggest phone of the year
with the note 7 the B 20 has been
completely redesigned with an all-metal
build and it's utilizing the same grade
of metal that we see in aircrafts is
extremely lightweight and durable and
allows it to still be military 810g
compliant against drop so it can really
take a beating the design isn't quite as
unique as last year's v10 but it's a
really good looking phone and feels very
sturdy in the hand
even though LG is done with a full metal
design on the b20 it's actually not
unibody and there's a button on the side
that lets you pop off the metal
backplate giving you access to the
removable battery and micro SD card slot
so despite LG switching to a metal
design they've still managed to figure
out a really elegant way of keeping the
features that people typically identify
with LG with the note 7 you have
Samsung's typical design with glass
panels on the front and back and a metal
frame sandwiched in between which is
very different from the all-metal build
of the b20 but it feels fantastic and
extremely comfortable to hold
it is a heavy fingerprint magnet but
aside from that Samsung has done a
really great job with refining their
glass and metal design and the note 7 is
definitely one of the most beautiful
looking phones that they have ever made
in note 7 doesn't have a removable
battery like the b20 but it does carry a
microSD card slot and water and dust
resistance the build quality on these
two phones are top-notch but despite
having the same screen size the note 7
is quite a bit smaller and a lot more
manageable in one hand along the bottom
you'll notice that both of these phones
have USB type-c a single firing speaker
and a headphone jack and of course with
the note 7 you also have that dedicated
slot for the s-pen the s-pen on the note
7 has been improved in a lot of ways it
has a much finer tip more levels of
pressure sensitivity and most
importantly it can no longer be put in
backwards you can also now use it to
magnify the screen translate text or
images and create gifs or gifts to send
to your friends both of the 20 and the
note 7 share a 5.7 inch display with a
resolution of 2560 by 1440 but with the
v 20 you're dealing with an IPS LCD
while on the note seven you have a Super
AMOLED display with a b20 you also have
a secondary display that can show you
the time date battery life notifications
and system shortcuts when the screen is
turned off and app shortcuts and your
most recently used apps when the screen
is turned on the note 7 doesn't have a
secondary display but it's always on
display feature can do a lot of the same
things from showing you the time 8
battery life and any unread
notifications that you might have and
because it's an AMOLED screen it looks
much sleeker than the b20 secondary
display which is very prone to light
bleed
they're both running Snapdragon 820 s
with 4 gigabytes of RAM which is really
no surprise because pretty much every
flagship that came out this year shipped
with these specs so performance
shouldn't really be much of an issue on
either one one of the more interesting
features of the b20 is its built-in quad
DAC and we don't really know exactly how
well this works just yet but it's
supposed to deliver a very high quality
audio experience when listening to
headphones while the back of the v20 is
a dual lens camera setup with a 16
megapixel main sensor and an 8 megapixel
wide-angle camera similar to what we saw
early this year on the g5 but the v20
brings back the same manual video
controls from the v10 but you're getting
an improved interface and a lot more
features including built-in focus
peaking which is extremely useful the
front camera is a 5 megapixel sensor but
there's only one front-facing camera
this time but you still have the option
of switching between a standard and a
wide-angle when taking selfies with the
galaxy note 7 you're getting a much more
traditional camera setup with a 12
megapixel sensor and f 1.7 aperture it's
the same sensor from the galaxy s7 which
takes fantastic photos and on the note 7
they've revamp the camera app with an
interface that's a lot cleaner and much
easier to navigate especially with one
hand one of the biggest highlights of
the b20 when it gets released is that
it's going to be the very first Android
phone to ship with Android new get out
of the box which means you get all the
features of Android new get like direct
reply from the notification shade
customizable toggles multi window
support and doze on-the-go
LG skin however is still a little on the
cartoony side and still feels the same
as what we saw on the g5 so it's
definitely in need of an update to
better match Android new get the note 7
is
on Android marshmallow with Samsung's
TouchWiz skin and it'll most likely get
updated to nougat but it's tough to say
when and how quickly it'll get that
update on the bright side TouchWiz is
actually a really nice experience on the
note 7 it's a lot cleaner and areas like
the notification shade and Settings menu
are much more streamlined and they've
also done a really great job with
reducing some of the unnecessary bloat
where the LGV 20 is bringing a lot to
the table and is shaping up to be a
phone that can go toe-to-toe with the
best flagships on the market and it can
definitely hold its own and get
Samsung's very powerful note 7 despite
being a very different phone what do you
