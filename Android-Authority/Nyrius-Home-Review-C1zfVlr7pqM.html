it's hard to find a product that really
solves a problem a lot of products out
there are just revisions to current
products or there's slight enhancements
the guy's an iris is really trying to
break the mold and provide you with a
new solution that many people aren't
using it and this is Wireless HDMI now
they're making some extremely bold
claims like zero lag and also 1080p
resolution streaming up to a hundred
feet how does this really stack up
well I'm Kevin the tech ninja are you
about to find out welcome to my dojo
this is the nearest nav s50 to inside
the box you'll find the digital wireless
HD transmitter it's made out of plastic
when it's active it only has one status
light it also has a stand if you choose
to stand it up it does a great job as
staying hidden and it's great to see a
product that does not have multiple
flashing lights for a change on the back
it has ports for power an IR remote
extender HDMI input and also two sources
four HDMI output what goes hand-in-hand
with the digital wireless HD transmitter
is the external IR remote extender now
the way it works is when I press a
button on a remote control pointing at
the wireless transmitter it sends a
signal to the external IR remote
extender and then it Ford's that signal
to the DVR in my case this also works
for wireless gaming controllers too I
tested it with the PlayStation 4 a bit
more on this later in the review the
next piece to the puzzle is the digital
wireless HD receiver with built-in IR
remote extender the receiver is much
smaller than the transmitter the front
has that IR receiver we just talked
about and once we flip it over to the
top we have our power and source buttons
and also a status light on the back it
just has the power input and the port
for the HDMI output
those are the main things that come in
the box we also have a few power
adapters and one five-foot HDMI cable a
remote control to switch inputs and
power for screws and screw anchors and
also your one-year warranty information
let's start off with the basics the nav
s 502 is a transmitter and receiver set
up the transmitter connects to your
video source and the video receiver
connects to your output source you're
transmitting source can be anything that
provides you with video like DVD players
DVRs computer and game systems once that
is connected you connect to your output
source normally that's a TV or monitor
and grant it when everything is plugged
in correctly
within a few seconds you'll get video
and sound through the receiver to your
source now the second thing that's very
important it's so important that you can
put it on there box is determining the
latency latency is a time interval
between the stimulation and response
from a general point of view as a time
delay between the cause and the effect
of some physical change in the system
being observed this type of measurement
is used in technology often most of the
time is referred to as lag for gamers
lag is something you cannot live with it
caused you to miss that critical turn
missed that note and Guitar Hero or if
you play battlefield like me it will
cost you your life that's a challenge to
you Jase for watching TV with a
transmitter lag won't affect you that
much
satellite TV has a ton of lag but since
you don't have time sensitive input to
the cable box it really doesn't matter
we're talking milliseconds here not
seconds with that being said the Avs 502
s works perfectly with my TV I was able
to use my DVR turn the channels and I
had full control of my input now this is
being broadcast in 1080p resolution my
monitor is a widescreen monitor that is
a little bit higher than 1080p so it
doesn't fill it up but if you have a
1080p display or whatever source you're
putting it to then it will look just
fine
the video was fantastic and didn't
notice any artifacts that are normally
see also the sound came out of the
speakers without any noticeable fidelity
loss the range on the unit says about a
hundred feet without taking a
measurement stick and walking downstairs
I'm sure I'm very close to the limit but
everything looks fantastic and for video
and TV and succeeded my expectations so
this covers the first claim it is indeed
plug and play Gaming is a different
animal altogether the setup is the same
as a DVR or any other source the
wireless controller sends the signal
through the IR receiver I've done a lot
of testing with games different types as
well we've had shooting games I've had
sport games I've had driving games -
just to test the latency out I also even
relocated the receiver to be closer to
the transmitter just to be sure a range
will not be an issue I pretty much had
these things in the same room on the end
of my testing and now I can't put a
finger on why sometimes latency is so
pronounced there are some points I got
so frustrated that I was about to turn
the game off and then suddenly it starts
working it's really weird now there are
way more good times than bad but this
does happen enough to where I need to
mention it what I did discover is that
if you're on the edge of that 100 foot
range gaming is the first thing that
suffers there are times when the
controller no longer is connected
because I'm out of range but flipping
over to the DVR works just fine don't
let a few hiccups scare you I've been
able to put in sessions that last over
an hour playing PlayStation 4 if you are
buying this for gaming exclusively you
would have good success but be sure
you're within that 100 foot range also
prepare yourself for some frustrating
moments if you can get past the
inconsistencies I'm sure you can fire
yourself a suitable gaming box I was
very skeptical at first about the zero
lag statement but you know what it is
very possible with this I've had many
moments of zero lag I just wish it was
more a few additional cons that I came
up with while using this box daily for
about a week for some reason maybe once
or twice a day the Box loses connection
and the only way to get it back is
simply doing that trick that we do with
every product you disconnected and
reconnect it and after a few seconds it
reconfigures and you're back up and
running I just can't figure out why
disconnects in the first place the
transmitter and the receiver gets a bit
hot sometimes now it's nothing you
really should worry about but if you do
have this unit inside of one of those
entertainment centers that has a door
when you open it up it feels like it was
an oven in there it does kick out a lot
of heat now I don't think it's gonna
overheat it's something that I felt the
need to mention because electronics
getting too hot could cause for some
problems down the line the last con is
sort of nitpicky the IR extenders are a
bit short I was unable to tuck away my
transmitter because I needed extenders
in front of my DVR I just felt the
extenders should have been a bit longer
I ranted an issue when the extenders did
not reach the PlayStation and the DVR so
I had to move the PlayStation closer to
the DVR so it reaches not a major issue
but it was annoying nonetheless all in
all if you have a need for wireless hdmi
this is the best bet sure it has some
weird bugs but what doesn't these days
the firm was upgradable so I'm sure
there will be updates coming down online
to remedy some of these problems as
always guys my name is Kevin a tech
ninja make sure you check out my youtube
channel the tech ninja and also go ahead
