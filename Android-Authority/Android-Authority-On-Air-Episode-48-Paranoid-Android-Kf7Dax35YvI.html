original android hangout show on google+
I'm Derek Ross and I'm Scott Anderson we
are joined with fellow android authority
blogger nate swanner this week is a
first-time guest on the show welcome
Nate thank you as well as Johnathan
Franklin and Dan Charlton our hardware
guru / apple hater / you name it
whatever he wants to yell about he has
some stuff to yell about tonight too and
we're joined with Aaron gascogne from
paranoid android welcome Aaron who just
dropped out that's our luck that's why I
live shows are fun cuz you never know
what's gonna happen all right so those
are you watching live Aaron just left
obviously he will be back in a minute
fingers crossed confidence hi um he was
out a little bit of internet
connectivity issues ah so he's actually
joining from his tablet because I his
his laptop we're having some sound
issues so hopefully he'll be back in a
few seconds but we're going to get to
the PA stuff a little bit later on in
the show we have a bunch of questions
lined up for him from our audience if
you are to just tuning in now and you
have some paranoid android questions for
erin go ahead and add those to our
comments either on youtube or on Google+
and we'll check those out and add those
to the queue of our questions here in a
little bit once Erin obviously comes
back since uh you just disconnected but
hey that's what that's what make live
shows fun okay so so this week on the
show well we're going to talk about some
app updates you know they may be boring
but hey there's some cool new apps that
got updated in Vedas that came out this
week we're going to talk about some nice
rumors with devices is always maybe a
big note we're going to talk about some
root and rom and stuff such as HTC hatin
on the dev scene we're going to do some
ingress giveaways and some LG some HTC
MCM
all sorts of fun stuff this week so stay
tuned for a good show so uh so Dan I
hear we don't have a whole lot of you
know Google ecosystem news this week but
we do have some mobile industry you have
to talk about yeah so I google and apple
and really everybody else in the world
has been posting their fourth quarter
earnings except for Apple who keeps a
very strange calendar which makes this
their first quarter um and google posted
there's a few days ago and their stock
was up like forty or fifty dollars over
the last two days afterwards in
comparison Apple posted their earnings
last night just after the closing bell
had over my eight over the last 24 hours
they've lost sixty five dollars per
share in value which translates to
roughly twelve and a half thirteen
percent uh or sixty plus billion dollars
in 24 hours putting that in a little bit
bigger perspective back when they
launched the iphone five they were at
seven hundred dollars a share so in the
time since they lost launched the iphone
5 they have lost 235 billion dollars
that phone cost them 235 billion dollars
or roughly the entire value of microsoft
the iphone 5 costs Apple Microsoft you
know what was really interesting
watching it was good apples tanking and
Google stock going up almost all of it
happened after hours oh yeah they were
pretty stagnant during the day and then
after hours was when will give yourself
any button after Alan that last quarter
when Google posted their earnings in the
middle of the day their stock plummeted
right afterwards Deering's reports
weren't bad or anything that it was just
weird to get the reports that and so
people freaked out typically companies
post their earnings reports shortly
after the closing bell specifically so
that way everything does happen in
after-hours trading yeah and in Google
when they posted there after out there
are their earnings call
sorry they are after the earnings call
and they talked about the third
financials and everything the next day
and after hours trading their their
stock went up was like 50 bucks like
forty-eight dollars or something like
that it was like four dollars then
another tendering trade next time yeah
yeah so so if you own google stock
you're loving it right now um and if you
own apple stock yeah you're pretty much
not loving it right now oh my god I'm
interesting to see what happens over the
next few months you know when rumored
new devices are supposed to come out
from each company I mean obviously
anything can happen next week we could
be on the show crying tears that Apple
stock is up fifty dollars a share and
Google's is down in who knows I'm sure
you know the markets a guess in a gamble
but it's interesting to see after the
earrings call come out what each
company's results were and to see how
the market was affected by it absolutely
absolute mess of profit their hugely
profitable economy they sitting on 137
billion dollars in cash like they've got
tons of tons of money they certainly
aren't hurt it it's just you know
schadenfreude to watch their stock fall
apart now no other industry news so we
heard that this week as well there's a
whole lot of Android malware out there
now now dan how much malware is that
actually well there are analysts
suggesting that there's going to be over
1 million Android malware applications
and before people start freaking out
let's remember that in North America
roughly zero-point-three percent of
people have ever been affected by
Android malware ever so if you're not
getting your applications from shady
back alley Russian or Chinese intern at
sorry corners of the Internet yeah then
you don't have problems with Android
bail but with a million Android malware
applications that means there are more
Android malware applications than there
are applications for Windows 8
yeah so so there's more malware for
Android and then there's total apps that
exist for the windows phone so yes I
mean there's also 500 million over 500
million devices running Android right
now so when you say so we there's only a
million apps that arm our but there's
500 million devices that numbers
actually really really small when you
look at the total amount of apps that
people have installed mean it's very
billions and billions of apps installed
it's very very small it sounds like a
lot and yes they're absolutely are more
than a million different malware
applications for windows out there
floating around the internet everybody
remembers droid raw hard are likely that
you'll get one of those that you'll get
an android health care all right so so
so on to some Android news here Erin is
coming back he had some internet
connectivity issues she sent me a
private message he's going to where the
internet is plentiful and fast I wonder
where those you know so he wasn't Zac
you will be back shortly once he reaches
the promised land there's me he's
probably going to Kansas City I he's
going Kansas City if he's going to get
some google fiber or Dan or is he going
to get some google wireless he might be
getting some google wireless so so let's
talk about that so so Google for a while
has been rumored to be launching in
conjunction with DISH Network their own
wireless service you know we've heard
people talk about it in the industry
over the past few months a lot of
speculation a lot of guessing a lot of
fanboy hopes and fingers crossed ah and
then today the wall street journal let
the world know that aha they actually
are building a wireless network thanks
to some FCC's document snooping we know
it's definitely the case but the
interesting thing about it is it's not
yellin a shin wide rollout Norwegian
rollout nor a state or city rollout it's
more of a few you know acres of land
roll out maybe it's confined to the
Google Mountain View campus arm the
purpose of this
well we don't know it's for some type of
experiment some type of test and you
know what I love it when Google tests
and experiments stuff so far they're
using the band that is I said if you
care about band numbers and all that
good stuff it's a 25-24 megahertz to 26
25 megahertz so that band there are
somewhere around the 2.5 gigahertz band
the only company in the country that
uses them so yet 2.6 have 2.5 2.6 band
gigahertz band the only company in the
u.s. that actually has that spectrum is
clearwire so speculation begin what is
Google doing with clearwire are they
doing something with clearwire are they
going to work with clearwire to evolve a
nationwide wireless service or nothing
at all are they just playing around and
that's what Googlers do what do what do
you think dan what the what's it's going
to turn into I think they're probably
just playing around with it um clearwire
spectrum one of the problems with it is
that it is such a high frequency and so
it has relatively low penetration um so
my guess is they're probably doing some
investigation for basically how to get
those high frequency spectrums to work
better in doing penetration testing and
doing cell phone testing with it so I
don't think that they're really planning
to do like launch their own cell phone
network and somehow steal all of
clearwire spectrum um I think that
they're just planning to do some testing
probably specifically around penetration
testing and probably working with
basically working with spectrum and
providing fiber back holes to that yeah
um so I think that their interest in it
is more just we need some spectrum to
play with to do other stuff but not
actually the cell phone parts of it I
guess only time she'll tell you know uh
or Aaron will when he gets back from
using that service in a few minutes
right yeah because he is out in
California all right so uh so Scott do
you want to talk about all these awesome
android app updates since you're our
resident app guy that wakes up in the
morning it feels a little
blue inside as he doesn't see his phone
telling him there's an app update sure I
don't feel blue I thought they'd over
Christmas break when all the developers
were spending time with their family
you're waking up every day feeling sad
because your phone wasn't saying every
day without my family and feeling sad oh
okay ah well Temple Run 2 is you know
that game the original temple run a lot
of downloads a lot of media lettuce came
out with their second version and it's
kind of cool as anybody tried it I know
people that play it and like they just
do it to past time and then I'm anything
else do they're not like really enjoyed
or anything um I've never really been
particularly like I've seen it I'm just
like it yeah well dumper run to that got
released kind of a big app go test it
out I'm gonna test out if the show as
well reddit news got updated for those
of you don't know read news I mean there
are three or four big reddit apps but
reddit news is really really nice in my
opinion I know John you use it too mmhmm
yeah Isles between reddit news and read
it sink I think those are probably the
top two most popular you know I really
need to try ready to read it sink I hear
all these good things about and I'm
still a big bacon reader guy it's one of
those things where that's the first one
I found I liked it and I've just used it
ever since but if you know if the grass
is greener on the other side I need to
try it yeah I would say that Arnott
synchronous reddit is fun all those
absurd so what okay since there are a
whole bunch of reddit apps is to get the
audience involved here let us know in
the comments what reddit app you use if
you use reddit if you're redditor you
know there's four or five big ones out
there what's your go-to reddit app of
choice so read news got updated it was a
pretty big update as slide-out
navigation new improved design for posts
load more comments multiple account
support which is nice swipe comments to
go back to the post list and overflow
context menus for posts and comments
also font size options that's really
nice q1 really small or really big
depending on what kind of device you're
using double tap to zoom on a picture
which is also a great addition and then
hushed is basically an app that allows
you to buy disposable anonymous phone
numbers for a time frame right from your
smartphone it's good for secret agents
like Dan and police officers like John
and stalkers like Derek I am a stalker
but um who would otherwise have their
number blocked or people that do some
questionable things on phone calls it
keeps you from having to buy a burner a
burner phone that yet yes so Nate those
things that we were talking about doing
we got this cover now I don't think
about burner anymore good cuz i was
going to get expensive so who uses
tasker just a little you know I put the
guys here in the and the hang out here
now um well you know and also if you're
watching the show on YouTube and let us
know or in Google+ let us know if you
use tasker oh we have some interesting
tasker news coming up here for you yeah
um tasker I mean I wait did you use
tester first of all yeah I haven't used
to ask her in a long time ah back home
when I have my galaxy nexus you know
back when times were good and fun and
then I'd enter the dark ages on the DNA
uh I don't use tasker anymore but but
i'll have to check out the new updated
beta the holo UI i loved holla hall is
great and tasker is awesome for
automating pretty much anything based on
location gesture time of day context I
mean it's how about anybody use tasker
like a like Scott said I use it off and
on I used to do the same way back when
it first came out so like a year a half
ago yeah and was super impressed was at
the time
so I mean maybe I should give another
try now but the other hand by device
gets great battery life so I just don't
see the point the one reason that I the
beta I mean played around it still
doesn't really feel like it's been
designed you know so if you were
disappointed with the UI it still has
some it doesn't it's the same as it's
always been as a it doesn't efficiently
guide you through you know the context
of the actions to actually create a task
it feels like more work than it's worth
when there but the tasker can go do some
cool things to beside just save battery
life so let's say you get the the google
TV Tasker plugin alright so you come
home you lay your phone down on your NFC
tag let's say that you have somewhere
maybe on your desk so that turns on your
Wi-Fi it connects to Wi-Fi it pings your
google tv turns on your google TV and
puts it on the news because it's six
o'clock and you watch the six o'clock
news as you get home things you know
neat little things like that now so
there's all sorts of ways to have fun
with it up but as Dan said 'yeah Tasker
was really good for saving battery life
back in the day and that's why I really
don't use it anymore yeah um I mainly
went off and on because of the UI but
yeah one weather was updated to version
two it brought a new improved UI and
more compatible with ICS and also
tablets pork which is awesome and a lock
screen widget for for dot to and of and
also improved ongoing notifications and
few other things as well I'm so da dope
pebble launched or started shipping
products this week Scott not pebbles the
Kickstarter SmartWatch that raised 10
million dollars in and sold sold out all
their Kickstarter pre-orders and they
ship they started shipping this week
than their first 500 the first day the
second day now another big batch and so
forth and their their android app
launched and what went live now
smartwatches are a neat
and I anike market I'm gonna say a neat
product that maybe we're gonna see a lot
of in the next year I you know there's
already other products you know like
metawatch or you know Sony and you know
but but uh pebble was it was pretty
cheap was a hundred a hundred dollars or
a hundred fifty dollars now if you want
one and it does basic things it's not I
don't it's not that cool yet I mean
it'll do let you know you have an
incoming email a call messages the
weather of the time you can download
different clocks all that means it's
cool stuff but is it enough to make you
want to wear a watch again I mean I
don't wanna watch in 20 years you know I
how about you guys what do you think of
you know smartwatches you know theres a
river that Google's making a SmartWatch
and you know Apple might be working on
wine and then you know we have things
like pebble hitting you know I mean if
all these things are in conjunction with
your current smartphone or tablet you
know would it make you wear one again
would you want to wear one no don't
watch because I find it uncomfortable
I'm you too and I guess well you
wouldn't put anything under body that
you're not used to I guess so it might
be at something that you have to get
used to if it does serve the purpose
that you know outweighs the learning
curve of getting used to it you know
what I mean I mean if it did a lot then
I've you up for it one of the things
that people stopped wearing watches
force because their phone can tell time
this exactly the consolidation of
utility in one place I mean why it's got
me I can understand a blue bluetooth
headset as a peripheral device because
that has a single functionality but you
know as far as just tethering multiple
devices to tap into your smartphone I
just don't see that as a market that's
going to really expand that much yeah I
i I'm curious what happens in the in the
near future you know we'll we'll find
out I mean I'll tell you what I might
say one where watch but the mock-ups
somebody made for Google time they're
not real but basically it's google now
interface running on your watch and it
looks pretty neat
you wear it you know pray for a week and
then I'd trust not want to wear it
anymore but we'll see what happens in
the near future so Aaron's still not
back yet for the Paranoid Android Q&amp;amp;A
session we both sorts of stuff lined up
form so we're going to go through a
couple more boring segments here let's
uh let's let's talk about some device
news um we had we had some rumors this
week about the Galaxy Note 8 for the
longest time we're hearing is going to
be the galaxy note 7 and then we saw
some leaked images and specs of the
Galaxy Note 8 and it really looks like a
galaxy note 2 with galaxy s3 physical
buttons I mean that's that's what I
think it's who knows if it's good to
it's real or not obviously it's a leaked
image you know we'll probably find out
more Mobile World Congress but why are
they releasing an 8-inch know right we
have a the original note we have a note
to which is 5.5 inch screen which our
buddy John here has and then we have the
note 10.1 so now we're going to have a
mid-sized note which I'm of mid-sized
even the right words those things are
damn big anyways so 7 makes more sense
for that fact well these how big how
BIG's the air the ipad mini 7.7 right
that's almost eighty seven point eight
seven point nine point eight okay so is
that what that's target adapter is that
targeted towards the ipad mini then I I
really I think we've talked about this
in previous shows but I don't really
think it's targeted at anything
necessarily I think they are just
throwing things with Velcro at a semi
velcro wall and they're trying to see if
anything sticks and they have the money
to do that and they have the user base
to do that so I think currently they're
the same hey why not and I think that's
maybe why they did the note the original
one and they'll come up why not and then
it really caught on they were like hey
yeah i really like bigger phones so i
don't know what you guys think
I mean I think that they've made an
eight-point something inch tablet before
so I don't think that the 8-inch note is
is really a problem it fits nice sort of
slot in their line between the five
point whatever inched up to and the
10-point whatever inch note so I mean I
think it makes sense I just worry that
like they've got so many lines now
they've got the galaxy ly they've got
the note line like this is getting
ridiculous out just how many freaking
devices they're shoving out I met I made
a post a while bad that I thought if
they would have put out a note 7 that it
would be probably the most popular
7-inch android tablet if they'd probably
if they've priced it right yeah and you
know I would say if they keep it at
least under 300 but I aim for 250 or so
but for students you know let's say that
someone that didn't have the note 2 or
felt like the note 2 was too big a
7-inch tablet that you could take into a
class or a business meeting and write
down your notes and everything on is
kind of a big usage case for a lot of
people that are using tablets in class
or enterprise or you know it just kind
of strikes a good balance of being
pocketable enough to do that and yeah
but I think that that size versus the
multi-window I think that really works
well for Portability and usability I'd
actually like memo you know try one out
just to see for multi window you know on
it 7-inch tablet yeah i'm curious how
that actually works out i think is you
know you guys are saying you know for
portability and usability i think it it
might be the sweet spot for that yeah i
mean the multi window works really nice
on the note 2 is a phone sigh I mean it
can only get better yeah probably a
pretty useful device really you know and
remember the nexus 7 fits in your pocket
so it's not too big you know an 8-inch
tablet you know tiny little bit bigger
and might fit in some people's pockets
still maybe a baptism oh yeah it depends
on the bezel and it depends on a pole
like a good strangely narrows so Dan if
you're wearing your what dammit if
you're wearing your skinny jeans you
know you're not going to put in a nexus
7 in your in your pocket you know I
can't fit a nexus 7 averey against
pocket that I haven't but I'm saying but
when you're wearing your you know your
your sexy skinny jeans you know you're
not gonna be able to do that you know
you're assuming that I have any such
genius all I've seen pictures dan I've
seen pictures I doubt that i haven't
seen pictures oh not a lot of pictures
be available later right so so we have a
question here in the comments any rumors
on nexus for availability i once a so
much as a rumor but a remark on larry
page at the google earnings call
basically said yeah that sucks he he he
acknowledged that Google as a company
needs to do better with device
availability as a very political answer
acknowledging yes its sucks that people
can't buy devices from us they want it's
a something that they need to work on
their can continue to work on political
answer left little answer right yadda
yadda yadda so at least he acknowledged
in the earnings call but additionally I
think speaking of the earnings call I
think he also hinted at Motorola coming
out with this rumored Motorola X Google
X whatever you want to call it phone
talking about how phones shouldn't go
splat when you drop them phone should be
very durable you know battery should be
the top priority battery should last
forever and it should last all day long
into the next day you shouldn't have to
worry about it and those are things that
Motorola has been rumored to be working
on such as a ceramic phone that wants
something is more durable a flexible
display don't have display that bends
and folds in your pocket but something
that can give you know when you drop it
it's not going to break those those are
rumors do they mean anything is that
what he was talking about I don't know
but hey it's nice to speculate I'm
excited for for google i/o to see what
happens doesn't lock so moving on to
additional devices on the lg optimus g
pro which think of that as the nexus 4
pro since the optimus G is the same
phone as the nexus 4 about you know
besides the outside shell in a radio um
you know exact same Hardware internally
it looks like the g pro is going to be
coming out in japan so it's going to be
big in japan as the saying goes ah how's
about you it's going to be it it's going
to have a 5-inch screen 1080p yes then
the nexus 4 in the optimus g2 currently
doesn't do that they rock a 720p so it's
going to have a bigger battery higher
density screen a bigger battery bigger
process or a bigger camera more storage
so it's gonna it's a you know it's a pro
edition it's off course it's going to be
a little bit better all around um the
end it's coming out as we said on NT doc
calm l and uh think it all the good
stuff they get the butterfly J without
verizon bastardizing it you know I yeah
all that all that good sir but speaking
of the butterfly J so it's cousin the m7
leaked all over the place this week we
had screenshots of the phone we had
renders of the phone we had screenshots
of the UI since five show up all over
the web thanks to a charity trusted
source on XDA and Twitter he posted
images of what he says was the was the
m7 and then he was posting images of
sense 5 running on the HTC droid DNA and
what the was the story behind that is
that he had in his possession the sprint
variant of the m7 and he is porting
basically taking all the files working
other the internal rom files importing
it over to the droid DNA which would be
running sense 5 then and android 4.1
point2 um he says he's working on it he
hasn't released it yet because he
doesn't want to get kicked in the face
by HTC because they're doing some funny
stuff right now which we'll talk about
in a minute so what's interesting about
this rumor
evleaks a kind of trusted source on
Twitter guys he said that the m7 was
going to be released for verizon for
sprint and AT&amp;amp;T and not not Teemo yet
but what's it funny about that is the
HTC m7 looks almost exactly like the
droid DNA has almost exactly the same
features so why would verizon's get to
phone why would verizon get two phones
that are this very very similar over the
course of a couple months I don't
believe that rumor that's just my
thoughts about you guys no I think
you're probably right OH get a lot more
sense for it to go to tmobile AT&amp;amp;T en
because it needs to replace the one the
HTC once it's the successor yes I don't
see that happening that's but since five
I hate sin so you know I've said it
before on the show I hate sense I hate
sense i hate sense since five is a
little more minimal i would I've loved
it no but I'd like it better than sense
for it you know it doesn't look bad if
you guys seen the screenshots of it the
Scott ornate or John mmhmm yeah that's
how it looks like they changed up to the
you know the classic clock widget that
they've always had and put in what looks
like a fairly nice actually I mean it
almost looks like a sort of weather
widget that you get out of a market app
I think it looks less there's less
animations only me that's my two
obviously we haven't seen anything
animated but it looks like there's less
it's less graphically intense so it's on
almost luring cleaner yeah there's
there's not as much wow and pizzazz on
an icon you know it's dumb down a little
bit and then that's following me that's
a direction that a lot of the industry
me Google included has gone to in its
work form is that they go a little bit
less skeuomorphism like Mac OS X and iOS
and it's kind of getting away from
Apple's design and going with something
that just brings you right into the
content and doesn't you know the UI just
doesn't get in to get in the way of you
doing what you want to do and I had
support the design direction because
we've seen it with hollow I mean I
personally like it better
that way I've always liked that even
with linux distributions where we had
the option of a dumb down xfce versus
que te or something i went for the
lightweight one personally absolutely I
like still so we had another rumor on
this past week about a new Nexus 10 arm
the new Nexus 10 basically is just going
to have a better newer cpu and GPU I
people have said in the past that you
can max out the video on the Nexus 10
because it has four million pixels and
the GPU can't handle it and if you try
you can make it lag so there's a rumor
now saying that hey google was a fix for
that and it's going to be a nexus 10
with a new GPU and a new new new cpu so
we'll see what happens at Google i/o
obviously yeah i mean i think that
releases of a google i/o is one thing
that previous one was released months
ago so refreshing it six months later it
is it's pretty standard right yeah
that's that's fairly standard and I
think that they'll publish I move more
towards a you know one or two sorel
ESA's a year but they do one at i/o and
then one in in october november but i
don't know that they'll be fresh
everything both of those times you know
yeah the a bursting if they did nothing
you're pushing in with it we have a lot
of pics a little bit of a industry shake
up here um go back up in and talk about
something that's just happened very very
recently John or scotter dan you want to
talk about that for a little bit yeah
and that is he is basically cracking
down
on since major arms in general um again
the information was on Twitter and a
couple other read it read it as well and
James D software the owner he's the
owner of HTC are you you calm there he
was ordered by lawyers representing HTC
to take talents and the websites
basically a repository of sense based
roms and they instructed him to take
that down and hand over the domain could
be overkill by lawyers stretching in or
you know is at the beginning of HTC
cracking down on roms that modify HTC's
proprietary sense software we have yet
to see but they've done this they've
done this in the past other websites as
well and I think the biggest concerns
websites that leaked out pre-release
roms more so than modifying finished
drawings because ACC's generally taking
a pretty hands-off approach with it yeah
I mean the thing that they're going
after is people who are distributing HTC
software non people who are distributing
modified versions of HTC software but
people who are distributing HTC's
software proprietary thought form they
are proprietary software and keep in
mind that they just signed a big deal
with Apple so I would not be surprised
if part of that agreement requires them
to be more strict about going after
their proprietary software which in this
case is apple's proprietary software
yeah or at least i'm quite certain that
apple believes it's entirely their
proprietary software the wrong chef
developers I've you know because there's
so many ways I it's like XD a root wiki
Android forms that you never want to not
put it to a stop and the biggest concern
is if pre-release software there was a
block and I'm not as for me with how it
is now but in the case of HTC software
even with finished phones they would you
know like back when people used to
customize the quick settings and I'm
stuff those developers have done and
have not enabled in finished software
and current phones that you know the
community kind of enabled and added on
to and things like that where I mean
there's I guess some threat of people
seeing stuff that it's really not ready
to come out yet or whatever by the
community but then sense is really easy
to port between versions as well and
that's probably the bigger verte issue
is because I don't really recall seeing
as much of it with TouchWiz or blur but
you it's pretty easy to take cell phone
that was running since 2.1 and port 3.5
to it or others because there were
really easy guides to sit there and say
this is how you do it move these files
and I think HTC just wants to put a stop
to that that's inside of it I mean
they're going after the developers on
XDA and routes between two people that
are redistributing their software yeah
right this isn't about people who are
modifying their software people who are
cutting up and playing this is somebody
that was hosting an ruu from HTC and it
had HTC the name of the website right
like even if they weren't going after
what is distributing then going after
the owner of HTC are you you DOM is not
surprising they're going to be able to
seize that domain pretty obviously
mm-hmm I I think we'll find out more
information over the next coming days or
week so that you know HTC offers files
to you know redo your phone from you
know I'll think of it as like reflashing
your phone from from a bricked phone
then are you you file and HTC wants to
be the only one posting those you know
we're not as a consumer we're not really
supposed to have them it's their
proprietary software so do I agree with
it yeah whatever i don't care i mean
that sucks that it happened and we'll
find out you know over the next coming
weeks but remember you know HTC also
doesn't want to bite the hand that feeds
them as well because they're also very
developer friendly and isn't you know
since they did they they release their
kernels sometimes timely but with HTC
you can unlock pretty much said rarely
rarely hey the DNA didn't it was
shockingly fast but but with HTC dev
though you can the HTC dev com you can
unlock every single phone they'd ever
made except for like two you know the
one which happen to one asset the one
asks are 1 X on AT&amp;amp;T and was even a
legal ears you know this everything
that's not on a chance here for us yeah
yeah but there you know I I don't know
i'm curious as to what happens in the
next next few days or weeks so so Aaron
went and found new internet just an
update on him and we're actually trying
to get him back in here uh he is unable
to join he found fast internet he said
he's on 10 megabit up and 10 megabit
down the Internet's flow and it's the
places that dreams are made of he said
but he havin problems joining and I
don't know what to do I've invited them
back you just you can't join from where
he's at so uh well we can kill the
Hangout and restart it to try to get him
back in here or we just continue what do
you guys want to do get splice it
together and then splice it together 40
it's doable alright so if you're
watching on YouTube we love you if
you're watching on google+ we love you
um we're going to be living out quick
this show the broadcast on YouTube to
try to get the main man in here the
whole reason we're doing this tonight
and see if we can get him back in here
and either way we're either way we're
gonna spring we're gonna come back for a
few minutes um wrap up the show so
hopefully uh all of you come back sorry
about that but you know technical
difficulties you know at least we didn't
blue screen on stage like Microsoft does
we'll be back in a minute IE crashes oh
okay and we're back we have technical
difficulties resolved we have our main
man here Aaron from paranoid and
Lloyd we're ready to start all things
paranoid android we're going to give you
guys a second here to rejoin the show
restart watching us here and then we're
going to get into Q&amp;amp;A session one last
thing of news here before we get into
paranoid android one to mention that if
you haven't registered your samsung
galaxy s3 yet you can still get some
free tectiles registering your phone and
a free flip coming that's gotta go to
the samsung's website and enter your I'm
imie number and watch your inbox you get
6 free programmable tectiles and a flip
cover so Mazel do that if you have a
sammie device it's a pretty uh pretty
nice free stuff ok you're paying mr.
before we start Derek with a question
for the audience thoughts on the
upcoming Ubuntu and Firefox phones oh
okay all right yeah we can hit on that
real quick so I got to see the bunch of
phone yeah at CES um very intuitive UI
different than anything that we have
available right now it's all
gesture-based um besides being cool I
don't know how we're that will go
because ecosystem makes the product so
it might take it two years before it's
even mass used well we're not be going
to see an official device for another
year so who knows that I don't know it's
a it's it's cool but is the average
person going to use it yeah probably not
that's my opinion well it took a bunch
of desktop adoption even though it's by
far the top linux distributions just
nothing compared to windows and mac OS x
yeah it could be as big as like the deaf
community that the routing in rommerz
out there no or it won't be that big
it'll be just a small a smaller
percentage of that I say some diehard
about two fans you know we'll run it I
don't know if they'll use it as a daily
driver
they find out there's no ecosystem
that's just my opinion Aaron you're
you're a big Linux guy what do you think
on about ubuntu phone oh it's not going
to take off if it doesn't have a driving
force behind it their hardware is going
to be behind and Android is too popular
ya know and I think the same is true the
Mozilla phone I mean it's seriously
expect the same as the nexus one the
nexus one yeah it said is milk or one
gigahertz processor and a half a
megabyte iraq yeah that's poor is only
1.5 gigahertz quad-core processor and 2
gigabytes of ram the other thing the
only way these platforms has ever legit
chance and getting development is you no
html5 I mean once I mean html5 is pretty
much the only way that any of them have
a snowball's chance in hell of seeing
applications yeah but look at facebook
who just ran away from html5 because it
didn't work very well for oh yeah well
the manufacturers have to agree on
standards to get html5 to interact with
hardware better yeah until it at html5
is not done yet yeah exactly until that
day comes they don't have a chance
obviously that'll be when it really
doesn't matter anymore as much anyway
all right so let's uh let's talk about
paranoid android the reason that
everybody was here earlier and hopefully
all came back after our our technical
difficulties Aaron went to the promised
land he got his his fast internet the
audio is work and he's ready to answer
are some questions so Aaron thank you
for doing whatever you had to do to make
it back to join us on the show I greatly
appreciate that and a problem so so
let's uh let's get started with paranoid
android so my my first my earliest
memory of paranoid android was back on
the Galaxy Nexus shortly after rom
started appearing for it I remember
seeing this this thread called paranoid
android in you know that somebody called
moles or
I mean her was talking about you know uh
not tablet mode but a hybrid mode for
the Galaxy Nexus and this was after
somebody had already released a tablet
mode for the Galaxy Nexus and everyone's
like oh that's cool but you know
sometimes it's hard to read then we see
this new rom coming out that talked
about a hybrid mode where you know it it
was a not phone UI not tablet UI but it
was you know it was half-and-half and
and people were talking about oh you
know if you run it with large fonts it's
okay and then you know then the next
week we heard this thing about you know
her appt DPI and do a build up prop at
its and then boom it just took off and
then and then hybrid mode settings / in
app settings in and you guys just uh you
know have changed so much since then nah
so it's how many guys are are on the
team right now currently is for four of
you okay okay and how long have you been
on the team about hymens okay and you uh
you maintain the the grouper the Nexus 7
and then the Colombian x 7 3g and the 3g
ok and the tilapia okay nice okay very
good and how many devices do you guys
Paranoid Android officially support
officially only Nexus devices but we
have been ported to the galaxy s3 and
the note 1 and 2 ok and now and that's a
little different from from what i
remember in the past you know you would
find paranoid android on well basically
if CM was on it there's a good chance
somebody would be trying to pour an
unofficial you know paranoid android to
that and you guys you guys changed it at
some point you you're basing the rom off
of parent or I'm sorry off of
cyanogenmod and then a while ago you
guys decided to base it off of AOSP can
you tell us a little bit about that why
those changes took place the reason
before that because as you added more
phone features it's been harder and
harder to read more to see I'm changes
on top of it so the get murders were
just a real pain so because when you go
in our interaction is how to go sheriff
asp
I guess that makes sense you know you're
so you because you're you know whatever
they're changing week to week and you're
changing week tweaked you know you
you're having a you know fight for lack
of better words you know to get things
to work because you don't know what's
coming in the pipeline you know and
depending on what your cherry-picking
from cm and if they're a release
something did that change is something
to break something and you got to fight
with it and I mean is it was a creating
issues for you guys just yeah it was the
biggest issue but we'd have random
things out a break we'd have random cm
issues and then just the ticket murders
were a real pain so it's a lot easier
right now going off of straight off of
AOSP and this time around we actually
beat them to the punch RCM I mean our
printer and we had beta before CM had CM
10.1 not this time oh I'm we're actually
ahead of them well that's a bragging
right because cm is a driving force in
the Android ecosystem that that's nice
to be able to no doubt that is hey you
know we beat the big guys know that
that's that's nice yeah so we had to
wait on that way to push us back another
two months or something to wait for CM
temper I wanted to become stable before
we can go on top of it so yeah that
makes sense then so that's why you're
moving to your own you know your own
Fork of a OSP that way you don't have to
wait for somebody else okay um so what
do you uh you know city okay p will we
usually talk about that for a second
they have so many customizations I mean
you can customize just almost too much
in my opinion unless you're Scott
Anderson he he loves aokp um CM you know
there are more they're less customized
but they're more stable than they okay p
instead of in my opinion so we're in
there would paranoid android fit you see
you know even less customization or more
customization more stable alternative
bility we're very stable 24 straight a
recipe we don't have any use other
device modifications like a prince but
that kind of thing terms of
customizability hopefully right around
cm but we have a different feature set
so we're more about hybrid innovation
unique features we don't have things
like battery percentage um different
lock screen options weather and status
bar that kind of thing but but but some
of your features are pretty awesome
especially the new
that everyone's ranting and raving about
don't talk a little bit about some of
the features that paranoid android has
and is as well as this this new pie that
we keep hearing all about our biggest
feature would be the hybrid mode which
allows you to do / at BPI / a play out
which means you can have tablet layout
with a smaller larger font and any app
you choose like a good example would
have been the old you to left the tablet
you I had a 3d carousel so it's really
nice effect and everything so we enable
that and then on top of that we are
perhaps color so you could change your
navigation buttons to match themes and
things like that a good example of that
was on Google now the whole background
was white total has stainless cleaner
parents and then once you finish that we
started the pie you I the pie UI is
assisting our replacement so it's made
to completely get rid of tablet UI or
phone UI yeah but if that's too i call
it and another way of navigation it's
based on the ASP browser code which was
a beef introduced in ICS but from then
it's nowhere close to it that was maybe
twelve hundred lines are this 2,500
lines and we read most of the original
code well yeah I remember that whenever
the ICS browser came out that had the
labs feature that allows you to to have
you know the pop out you know radio up
nope i type controls and and all people
like that that was neat say so so you
guys took that as a base and then you
could be rotating point but now we're a
hundred and ten comic commits that 2500
lines later o ver easy so yeah no one
can say that he just you know took that
and ported you you know totally rewrote
it and did it all you know it sounds
like it's your own yes now we hear a lot
of people talking about the LMT launcher
ever since you know pi you know ever
since paranoid android started coming
out with the PI teasers and then then
the PI betas you know I'll people start
saying all that this is just like you
know LMT launcher you don't need pie you
know now and then people start getting
in a war
orabell which is better and did you take
code from this and yada yada yada and
you know you want to you know and then
lighten us that there aren't aware what
what that's all about well LMT is closed
source for ones they have no code
stillage it is also based on AOSP think
ASV browser code well I can say we've
completely rewritten it and I don't know
if you noticed but resealing the newer
betas they've been using features from
us they now have a status bar thing with
the clock and notifications and we also
share some of our code with them the
code for our Cubs targets we can go sat
on axis we've shared that with the LMP
developer and he's also implement that
on his on his application so you guys
are now working together then I wouldn't
quite working together but we're open
for collaboration good very very
political I like that so yeah so some of
the features of pie I I actually put it
on my my nexus 7 here um put it on there
last last Saturday night I was bored my
city I keep I keep seeing this pie thing
I gotta I gotta find out all about it
you know so so I I went I put it on
there and it first I was like ah this is
kind of neat it it's cool it's it's a
definitely something different and you
know and then I said you know what
there's a few features that I'm missing
I want my toggles I want my
notifications and then lo and behold you
guys like you guys read my mind you know
within a couple days you guys added that
you added notifications you added an
easy way to get to your settings to get
to all your toggles you guys like
totally rewrote that is that is that
right correct yeah and there's still a
little bit more work to be done the
toggles need to be added to the chevron
the second Chevron for the pie on that
we have our own custom views for
notification and quick toggles ltb
expand a little bit but we're getting
close yeah so if you can see here those
you watching it well with the
reflections going to be bad but when I
let go on that they're gonna like
they're gonna pop out from the side
there so you yeah um and you can go in
and you can customize those if I want
sound their GPS their bluetooth and so
forth so just like
other roms allow you to customize that
too but they they wrote their own code
for that and i like i like how also
reading are reading our minds i guess we
also had talked about the ability to
yeah be nice if if i wanted to flick the
pie menu out from the right side or the
left side of the top or the bottom you
know no matter where i was that i could
flick it out and when we talked last
that feature wasn't available and now lo
and behold you can now do that and that
that's pretty cool why i like that and
now when we talked last you would send
out there might be some problems
implementing yep you guys were able to
get past that yeah we got around it but
like that it is a touch target if you
enable as possible can cause
incompatible issues with certain apps
and they have swipe gestures in them
yeah I what was I doing I was uh I was
swiping on my my desktop early a desktop
my home screen and I was trying to go to
a different screen in the pine then you
popped out as a good but uh yeah I
understand that what you're saying now
that's all we have the option to have
multiple sides you can have top and
bottom you can do whatever you feel the
most for your situation yeah and I
changed it cuz i dont depending on how I
hold my device you know I change it to
cook from my fit I actually use it on
the bottom and use it on the top I'm
sorry on the bottom and on the on the
learn the right now and it works really
well for me I I like it now I'm still
besides being cool i'm still trying to
see what other uses i can find for that
extra you know inch of inch of space but
it I you know I i love it it looks
awesome the fact that i can just flick
out and you know i like i like might be
able to see my battery percentage there
the date and the time my notifications
are right there i can swipe up to a
month i like it if you guys are doing
great things and it's getting a lot
better for me i haven't used the regular
nav bars in three or four days i have my
on the right side i can use completely
one-handed and i love it now I bet
that's really what we're the breaking
point is you'd have to use it for a few
days because
right now I know that if I'm in a nap
and I want to get back to the home
screen it seems it's almost like a
little bit of a hassle to swipe up or
swipe to the side to then hit home
whereas before I could just tap a button
you know soft key and it would take me
to the home but as you get better with
it I'm finding my it's it's easier in me
well not easier but it's just as easy
you know you get used to it now what
John you said you had a question for
Erin here yeah just with the last
especially lately with the rom itself
and the applications like the PI menu
and paranoid preferences um under your
for you know four man team as far as all
that goes is software development kind
of obviously this is a hobby for all of
you but is it something that uh you do
kind of as a career and just decide to
do this in your spare time or is it like
a hobbyist thing that got them kind of
developing on android roms in general or
because I mean it's quality code there
you know I know it's a lot of lines of
code you have to put out so um three of
us Duke of our computer science screen
sharing makers one of us electrical
engineering major so we're all in the
industry on to butcher students so this
kind of our hobby for me it's very
educational I learned more doing this
and doing during school so are you
looking to then pursue a career with
Android development then after this
since you've learned so much ideally but
there's not many hiring opportunities
for that ok well there you go will help
android authority uh job services whoa
uh well we'll let you know when uh when
we know when we find us a staffing
agency that is interested in um but yeah
with that that's it no you got to use
what resources you have available and
you know we'll we'll let people know
that you know these guys know what
they're doing and you know they're
talented young programmers they're doing
innovative interesting things the PA
preferences the Paranoid Android
preferences app is awesome the fact you
can customize
completely almost seemed you know any
app very very cool and like I said
that's all open sourced any industry
report that whatever I choose the only
thing is that we ask is that you don't
include it with any build prop tax or
DPI changes or tablet mode or anything
because it does conflict and it looks
about in our image whether or not the
coast will pull the open source and free
to use you guys have a github available
or something of this get some ways the
PA prefs application is closed source or
working with team pic and open source
version now the dash that you brought
that up there is a Play Store paid
version available how much is the PA
prefs a premium app all about 294 last
time I checked okay you got you guys a
plan to add some type of bonus features
to that or maybe they're already there
for people that are supporting the devs
and everything like that right right now
it's only appropriate viewers you can
see all the athletes and edit their
properties so instead of having to go
for the entire list it's just a quick or
easy way to do it we plan on adding beta
features and not just looking to show
that in time well good good and you know
what this is a nice way to support the
devs you know I mean you're you could
always you know give them a few bucks on
a paypal link but you know why not you
know by their app if you're a fan of the
ROM and you know you get a few extra
features out of it as well you know
there might not be groundbreaking
features but the cool you know a little
tiny little additions here and there you
know yeah the planets not having a core
feature tied to the pro version we
considered having pi beta of Pi tied to
it we decided that was the dance of
community and decided just have it
completely open now when not you know I
know it's a it's against the law almost
to say so what is this going to be out
you know like no ETA s is the the
patented cyanogenmod rule and how much
I'm assuming you guys follow that as
well when a stable version of you know
paranoid android 3.0 is going to be
available well the run itself is stable
a hybrid engine is one hundred percent
stay boil the rest of the rama stable so
for the run itself i say where r see
status when pi is more of a beta Sarah
so what's pireas rrc sense we can look
further into three point up okay
everything else is done fully tested bed
everything okay I is the last the last
week what makes sense it's a it's big
changes big changes now do you guys for
see yourself doing you know a lot of
popular roms do big roms you know have
big followings they do nightly build so
you know they have a bill bought that
runs every day and commits a you know
pulls down meal Garrett commits and
builds them and says hey here's here's
the latest thing you guys think you're
going to get into doing something like
that in the future um we do use the XA
villa by which is have been a real big
help because we know we're limited our
computing power but for in terms of
nightly since it's only four of us it's
Ron without changing quick enough but
you really need night leaves so on
averages maybe four or five come in
today and there anything major if
there's a major bug or she will try to
find a boat as soon as possible but for
most things it can wait okay and our
gear is actually down right now so we're
kind of using our get as a in place code
system sometimes you wouldn't really
want to build a nightly like that but
now Dan as a former re-emerging kernel
developer as a convo for Dan you have
any questions for Aaron you have any an
insight of what what these guys are
doing yeah so um we talked a little bit
about this last week but I think they're
still interesting questions um I'd ask
you a little bit about how deep the
changes are into the code um I know we
talked about it being mostly framework
related changes but can you speak a
little bit more just sort of what are
the challenges from a technical
standpoint of doing this level of a
change um compatibility we're trying to
stay on the edge with the Google not
breaking any apps and so far he's been
successful so that probably the biggest
thing and we use a whole bunch of
undocumented or under documented ap is
that's been a big issue but we have a
really good team we know we're doing
this is our second try at hybrid we've
all read on a third time try hybrid two
will be part of PA three point out that
was completely written from scratch and
all native code it's also thirty percent
Master System it's very clean that one
we reduce our code size are heap size
it's a very more optimized experience
and once we merge that in going forward
the changes aren't that bad at first are
used to be really messy and spread out
but we've condensed it and gotten a
minimum needed to function on hybrid
popular good good but you to sort this
to say Iran like CM or AOKP for your
challenge to the baguette merges and
things like that but the co's out there
if you want to go for it I've been it
personally I've ported it to different
roms and things like that it's not
impossible one thing I would really
noticed with CM especially I know AOSP
has to let you move a ton faster just
because it took I mean especially with
cm9 and Ice Cream Sandwich came out it
about time they really got stable work
even for the Nexus devices that's when
Google dump jellybean out on everyone is
they were adding so many more features
every on a daily basis almost you know
that it kind of slowed them down to a
crawl almost yeah yeah because of that
we're missing like key features like the
weather things in the battery percent
even focusing on are you innovative
features once the point I was out and
stable beacons are looking in
implementing CM features and different
rom community trysts then some can be
overkill feature wise I mean so it's not
some not such a bad thing to be close to
stock a lot of people really prefer it
yeah definitely I mean especially as a
stockist but getting better so yeah ever
since four-point-oh came out a lot of
the stuff that's just really become
unnecessary the one thing that we do
miss the most is very person that's on
the to do this is just there's so many
other things to do um in terms of the
community features our toggles we're
more less creature can put on those on
we have we implemented the CM version of
the navbar editor so we have that in and
we have a powerup color so we have all
the navbar colors and like that we have
our own version of black screen targets
that we're not used to seeing more FB
version we have our own which is more we
wanted to preserve the Google always
unlocked so you can unlike anyone the
circle so we have more of a launcher row
on the lock screen so we have our own
version of that arm we will want to
pioneer expanded desktop so we have that
in Iran we also have our own
implementation of a killer alden recents
where we place a resource button with a
new button that kills all your apps
except the last one we double press to
kill the last app so again that was one
of our unique features that we had and
weary after to the version 3 I actually
have a question about expanded desktop
and pod nope now currently from if I'm
wrong here to enable pie I need to have
expanded desktop enable correct on the
current versions yes in the next version
we do have the ability if you have the
pie on the left or right side to keep
the status bar okay because right now I
was curious as to why it's it you have
to go to two separate places to enable
but if thats good those changes coming
then that make that makes perfect sense
then the reason we have like that now is
we didn't want any UI clashes where if
you brought down the notification or
quick settings tray how would actually
show up over the button so you can push
push it up okay if you have it on the
bottom things like that so we're trying
to avoid that kind of thing okay well
that's good explanation now I know
because I also confused at first but now
that I know that things are in the
pipeline in in the build i have now
super alpha beta secret double secret
probation version yeah i'll have to
check that out um but yeah I i flashed a
new version right before the show here
and I interesting off to check that out
so I can see you're saying saying then
on this version that i have now i can i
enabled and have the bottom and turn off
or turn off expanded desktop yeah the
plan implementation is you'll set your
you go to stock UI
I and you put your navbar size 20 and
then enable pie and the pie would be a
bear pie with no that s information but
you also have your size for up top
interesting okay i will check that out
and the next day we also fix all the
keyboard issues where the keyboard
wouldn't disappear and we fix motifs
with lock screen issues where you have
your status bar on the black screen and
get your notifications and that kind of
thing okay great also you mean you guys
are constantly making changes fixes
adding to it so yeah I'm curiously the
next version will have a quick pop up
for notifications where when you're
enabled pie and expanded desktop a brief
pop-up will show you car notification
and I'll be clickable so you have quick
access to that without having to pull up
pike to your new notification that you
know and that that that's actually great
that that solves a lot of the the issues
with not being able to easily as easy
get to your notification so that that
solves that right there yeah it's an
ownership we're working on it yeah I
like it that's good yet another Anglin
and we working also working on a
vertical text mode for pie some people
don't like the circle text so it's in
the two on the to-do list very good no k
alright um if we don't have any other
questions for Aaron here Aaron told us
so what they have planned in the
pipeline coming down in the future and
the answered a whole bunch of questions
about paranoid android if and as well as
they're an innovative features such as
pie and made Parappa settings um nobody
has any other questions for him go ahead
and wrap this up here dan nate scott
jawn uh what's your website for paranoid
android where can people go to find more
information about it I'm roms fine
downloads the official page is actually
a google plus page okay we do have a
website but we tend to use google plus
marks it's just easier to have comments
and that kind of thing that's just
paranoid android on google + 0 +
paranoid android correct and then to
find your your rom you have to download
it from like XD a routine XDA &amp;amp; goo that
i am yeah
actually I get mom we're actually good
friends with other guys that more so Dan
than me I guess but we know we we know
them we've actually had the google the
Gouda i am guys on the show in the past
so I assume it's also in goo manager for
people that wanna download it through
that correct and it's yeah now Scott
you've been running it on your your
nexus 4 for the past hour and a half
correct yes how is that hour and a half
been little you know I'm so used to a
different realm it's it's different and
definitely the settings you can dive a
lot more you know Mizer's my initial
impressions I haven't dug real deep but
I mean it seems like that there's a lot
more to it and a lot more
customizability with regards to setting
it up I'm excited to dive a little bit
deeper into it tomorrow and your bus
ride to work going there to this / app
settings and just start just start
tapping on everything all the everything
and break it no illegal items it keeps
them back as the lack of that Live Paint
unicorn wallpaper that he keeps on this
phone all the time for every device we
also have a prebuilt setup / app
settings a certain apps on certain size
to buy his work better so this also did
pretty good default set in there so for
like certain devices chrome for example
you could have the UI with the tabs on
top versus the full screen you I oh and
gmail is probably the best example on
phones gmail works so much better with a
dual paying you I so that should be a
default setup yeah I noticed that I I
don't see all the cool stuff on the
Nexus 7 because i already have tablet UI
for all my apps it's really it's really
cool for you know for phones for the
nexus 4 and Galaxy Nexus worth really
well know to just because the screen
real estate and like eat I'd like Aaron
said is gmails the most significant
application it's just it doesn't even
make sense the gmail navigates the way
it does on phones after using it
that okay I will Erin thank you for
joining us again maybe we'll have you
back on the show some other time when
you guys release some more cool stuff
for your rom and perhaps a big news you
want to announce you're always welcome
to come back anytime you want and talk
about anything android related well

much technical difficulties getting here
but it was great to have you it's all
right thank you very much anything else
you want to say any shoutouts or
anything cheers oh there's the team
you've been a lot of work than going in
everyone should appreciate the effort by
her pro app but really it really does

developers definitely starts all right
