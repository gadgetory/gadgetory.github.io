first year that we've actually seen a
number of flexible displays actually
making their way into consumer products
so we figured we do a roundup of all
these new flexible phones that are
coming out so stay tuned so the first
phone that we're gonna talk about is a
Samsung Galaxy fold and this was
Samsung's first foray into this whole
foldable phone market they're really the
first one that basically said yeah we're
gonna make this consumer ready phone it
is a mass-market phone and you can buy
it in April so basically the Galaxy fold
folds closed as if you were kind of like
closing a clamshell and it's got the
screens on the inside as opposed to on
the outside of the phone now if you open
the phone you basically get this long
tablet with a little notch in the top
right corner for the cameras and then
whatnot and you can basically turn your
phone which is like a pretty big phone
already into this 7.3 inch tablet which
is pretty massive you got to say but
it's not as big as the second phone on
our list which is the huawei mate X now
the while we may X surprise everyone
basically because it folds backwards it
doesn't close like a clamshell it really
folds kind of to be outside of itself
and this phone is really interesting
because the main display is still really
huge it's over six inches and it
basically works as a giant phone and
when you unfold it you get this 8 inch
tablet which is even bigger than
Samsung's offering and we have to play
with it for a little bit it's got this
little hinge design on the side that
allows you to hold it and also has the
cameras housed in there so it's really
easy to use and we're really excited
about the huawei mate X just a quick
note that our MWC coverage is brought to
you by digit daily your daily dose of
tech straight to your inbox check out
the description below to learn more next
we got this TCL foldable phone concept
and we didn't get to play with this
phone we didn't even really get to see
it fold but TCL just wanted to show off
that they can also make a foldable phone
and they're aiming to make it more
affordable so the Samsung Galaxy fold
and the huawei mate X are extremely
expensive they're like $2,000 or more
and TCL is saying no we want to make
this more for the mass-market so they're
not releasing anything right now they're
not announcing any consumer ID products
but they did say that they want to make
a much cheaper foldable phone option
that will probably be coming in like
2020 or so let's forget the Oppo
prototype foldable phone and it looks a
lot like the huawei mate X and they
didn't actually show it off here MWC but
I think
got a little hasty and just revealed it
on Weibo which is this Chinese social
media website because they saw all these
other manufacturers dropping these
foldable phones and they really wanted
to get into the market so an executive
at Oppo actually released these pictures
and we've only really seen pictures so
far I think we maybe have like a clip a
video but it looks a lot like the huawei
mate X and we're excited to see what
they can do with their foldable phone
concept and next we've got their royale
flex pay and you probably remember this
phone because it was basically the first
foldable phone concept that we actually
saw we saw at CES and even a little bit
before that we got a little briefing
with it but they're also here at MWC
2019 and it seems like they've updated
the software on their foldable phone so
it works a lot more smoothly than it did
before
so they're really rapid prototyping this
thing and it's nice to see that they are
upgrading it over time now a number of
other brands are definitely going to get
into this foldable space a lot of people
have said yeah we need to compete we
need to make sure that we're in the mix
because honestly there's gonna be a ton
of big manufacturers that are gonna be
releasing foldable phones in 2019 and
2020 it really seems like this is a
brand new product category that's gonna
take off this year so excited to see
what other manufacturers decide to jump
into the fray so that's been it for are
foldable roundup here at MBC 2019 we've
got a ton of other coverage of every
other phone regular phone that's been
released here at MWC make sure you head
over to our YouTube channel stay over at
Android authority comm for all the news
all the exciting features coming to
these phones this year and I will catch
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
