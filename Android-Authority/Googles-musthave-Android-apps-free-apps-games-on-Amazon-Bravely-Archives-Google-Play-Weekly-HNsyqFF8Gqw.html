ladies and gentlemen I'm Joe handy the
Android authority app guy once again
happy new years everybody and welcome
back to Google Play weekly in her first
headline this week Temple Run VR has
officially been released for the gear VR
this means that the only people who can
play it are those who have the gear VR
innovator Edition as well as a Galaxy
Note 4 or in other words about 12 people
even though it's a release that only a
few people can use it shows that there
are game developers interested in this
whole VR thing that's been going on if
you can get it it should be in the
oculus store right now the fans of
bravely default may be interested to
know that bravely archives DS report is
coming to Android in Japan the release
is slated for sometime in the next month
which is really exciting if you live in
Japan it takes place several hundred
years in the future from the original
bravely games and involves you
collecting memories from crystals
there's no word yet on a release outside
of japan but given the popularity of the
game on the Nintendo 3ds we imagine it's
a route they're strongly considering so
don't lose hope yet it's official folks
Play Store developers can no longer use
customer reviews in their app
descriptions we reported on the news a
couple of weeks ago but it has been made
official the changes have been made to
their support page under the keyword
spam section over all the rules now
prohibit customer reviews referencing
other applications and those absurd
lists of keywords that some developers
like to use app descriptions are going
to get a whole lot cleaner here very
soon and it's about time because I never
cared with Cindy 98 thought anyway to
celebrate the new year the Amazon App
Store is giving away one hundred and ten
dollars worth of free applications ok
folks I'm filming this on Thursday and
you're probably going to see it on
Friday or later so I'm not 100% positive
that this is still going to be going on
however at the time of the making of
this video it totally still is you can
grab up applications like build calc jet
FitPro and mini piano along with games
like Republic Kingdom rush frontiers and
Riptide gp2 get your hands on these
quick especially the games because they
are some quality titles in our last bit
of news this week Google has released a
list of the 127 must-have Android
applications it's a very interesting
list that includes such classics as push
bullets Spotify YouTube Netflix and some
lesser-known ones like
Zillo cook pad recipes and new mochi a
lot of it is fairly obvious stuff but
this is still a great list to show
people who are new to android or a way
to find some stuff that you may not have
heard of there are even a few games
available if you want to check those out
we'll have the link for it in the video
description below its who wants to see
some trending applications as usual if
you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the video description below first up
this week is Looney Tunes - by Zynga
it's a runner game similar to Temple Run
except you play as your favorite
characters from Looney Tunes as you play
you complete goals and unlock new levels
it's a great game for kids or pretty
much anyone who likes Looney Tunes just
beware of the bugs because it is an
early release sky gamblers is an air
combat game somewhat similar in style
and mechanics to the old Star Fox games
it boasts a long campaign mode along
with a number of online modes to enjoy
that graphics are pretty good as well
much like Looney Tunes - this is a new
title which means there are some bugs
that the developers still need to work
out so do keep that in mind
coin desk is a Bitcoin app that lets you
keep track of things like the value of
bitcoins along with news analysis
currency conversion and price
notifications it's a very simple
application with a bare-bones layout
which is great for those who want to
keep track but also want to keep things
simple as an application Bitcoin
enthusiasts should definitely check out

allows you to get more in depth with
filters shift differs from most by
