handy the Android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 158 so let's get right
into those headlines
hooya has officially quit the hardware
business and is now a publishing company
so far they have published three games
all of them exclusive to the Nvidia
shield console none of them are overly
amazing or anything and they tend to
feature retro graphics and rock steady
gameplay still it'll be interesting to
see what Lea comes out with over the
coming months and years many of us still
miss androids first really good gaming
console sunrise calendar closed its
doors for good this last week we knew it
was coming after they announced as much
a few months ago but now it's officially
dead and gone the good news though is
that many of the more unique features
are currently being added to Microsoft's
outlook it's obviously not the same
thing but the memory of sunrise will
live on in another application you can
expect these new features to hit outlook
sooner or later the new Nexus launcher
that was going around a week or two ago
is now called pixel launcher on top of
essentially confirming what we already
knew about the Nexus name change the app
now appears to work slightly better than
before the calendar icon now shows the
actual dates and it seems to be a little
bit smoother is downloadable now if you
want it giant has released a new Android
emulator called guide remix OS player
the basic concept is that you run jive
remix OS on Microsoft Windows and then
use it to run Android absent games it
works similarly to most Android
emulators except for these guys have a
history of doing things the right way
it's about the only emulator that uses
Android marshmallow and it's also
completely free to use YouTube is
apparently preparing to enter the social
media space a blog post from Google
indicated that content creators will be
able to post things like text only
content gifs live video and other types
of content that you normally don't see
on YouTube the idea is to give creators
a better method to communicate with
subscribers without having to go to
other sites like Facebook and Twitter
it's only available to a few people
right now to test it out movies is a
navbar audio visualizer application that
shows a visualizer on your navbar the
visualizer does react to the music that
you play on your device and it's a
pretty fun little thing to look at it
features the ability to customize the
visualizer to your specifications and it
also work on things like video apps such
as YouTube there are even options to
have it work on apps that hide the
navbar such as Spotify it's free to
download with a pro version going for a
dollar ninety-nine movies isn't
necessarily useful but it looks pretty
awesome Viji Volken beta is actually
just a popular mobile van glory but with
some Vulcan fake tin as many of you know
Vulkan API is a new addition into
android nougats and the BG vulcan beta
may well be the very first game to use
it it's exactly the same as the MOBA
that we all know and love already so the
gameplay experience and mechanics don't
change at all it's had some
compatibility issues with devices that
are supposed to have Vulcan supports but
otherwise it works pretty well Google
cast preview is kind of like a beta
except that it's meant to be more stable
it essentially gives people the
opportunity to try new features in
Google's chromecast platform before
they're available to everybody else to
activate it you simply need to allow for
the preview email in the notification
settings and then follow the
instructions in the email that you get
it should be relatively bug free since
it's not meant to be a beta release in
any case it's completely free to use and
totally worth a shot animation Throwdown
is a card collecting game in this title
you'll be able to collect cards that
feature many popular cartoon characters
and then you duel it out against other
players for supremacy the game manages
to keep the quirky humor from each
series intact and there are some
mechanics that allow you to combine
cards for stronger attacks it's
essentially a massive amount of
fanservice for fans of these TV shows
but it's free to download and it has a
ton of things to do
it's totally worth a shot desk doc is
one of the more unique Android apps that
we've seen released this year you'll be
able to use this application to share
your mouse between your PC and your
Android device the setup is relatively
easy and you should have it up and
running in just a few minutes once it's
all set up it'll be like your Android
device is just another monitor on your
setup and then you can move your mouse
right on over to it it's compatible with
devices running Android 4.1 and up and
there is no route required the pro
version goes for five dollars and forty
nine cents and it contains some extra
features for even more Android apps and
