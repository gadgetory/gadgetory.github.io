johanna the android authority app guy
and we're doing something a little bit
different this month instead of having
to app lists for apps and then games
we're going to have one that has both
apps and games in it if you want to
check out the full list of either one we
have those linked up in the video
description below otherwise let's get
started
drop recipes is a new cooking app it's
claim to fame is support for smart home
gadgets like the drop scale and
connected ovens like bosch and GE
appliances the application also includes
a variety of recipes one of the best
step-by-step instruction guides that
we've ever seen ingredients substitution
and photo and video content there really
isn't much wrong with this one
and it should also expand its recipe
library over time like most other
cooking apps DVD Netflix is a new
application from you guessed it Netflix
it revives its old DVD service in the
application lets you order a DVD or to
watch them return them and then take out
some more how often and how many DVDs
you have access to depends on your
subscription tier the lowest one is one
DVD at a time twice per month while the
highest tier Nets you two discs at a
time and an unlimited number of rentals
per month this is an excellent service
for movie fans who don't want to drop
money on digital rentals or just prefer
physical media Netflix offers a month
for free as a trial files go beta is a
new application from Google it's kind of
like clean master - all of the horrible
crappy parts that don't actually work
the application cleans out junk files on
a person's device and that includes the
contents of the download folder
duplicate photos junk files and more it
also recommends applications for users
to uninstall based on how long it's been
since they used them the application is
best for those on older devices or in
developing markets with phones that
don't have a ton of storage the
application is totally free to use model
a and 3d pro is a basic 3d modeling app
it creates 3d models of various things
and it's a little difficult to use it
first however it can do some pretty
decent basic stuff some of the other
features include Jeff creation using the
models minecraft skin support and obj
files supports it's not as powerful as
desktop software and there are a few
bugs here and there because
it's still new still the application is
a lot of fun to play with and it's also
entirely free with no in-app purchases
there is the occasional ad though
unrolled me is the Android app version
of the popular service by the same name
it shows you all of your email
subscriptions whether their spam or
intentional you can quickly unsubscribe
from various mailing lists very quickly
this one is also one of those rare
applications that everyone should
definitely try at least once it helps
clean out your inbox get rid of spam and
manage your subscriptions in a way that
you can't find in most other apps the
application is also free with no in-app
purchases there are some ads but they're
not overly annoying Animal Crossing
pocket camp is Nintendo's latest big
game release in fact the game already
has over 5 million downloads just a
couple of weeks after release the
central mechanic is sim building you've
built up a little campsite and from
there animals show up and you can
explore things and various other
activities the reception is very
positive so far however Nintendo did
make this one a freemium game that may
be a dark spot on an otherwise great
game release but most don't seem to mind
final fantasy dimensions 2 is a unique
game it plays like a freemium gotcha
style mobile RPG however Square Enix
stripped out all of the annoying parts
like microtransactions any hint of a
stamina system and other such freemium
elements it is honestly weird playing a
freemium game with no freemium elements
to it but aside from that it does
feature decent retro style graphics a
long story line and an excellent
soundtrack along with some other stuff
it is a very polarizing release but
mostly because it's also fairly
expensive at $14.99 Monument Valley 2 is
probably going to be a contender for
game of the year and the anticipation
was higher than average for pretty much
any other mobile game the second game
plays very similarly to the first it has
the same gorgeous puzzles with more or
less the same gameplay style there is a
second character and that changes how
you move through the puzzles however it
very much feels like an extension of the
first one as opposed to a new game like
its predecessor it's also a shorter game
that focuses more on the experience
rather than the difficulty that may some
players but we still think it's worth
the $4.99 of admission
South Park phone destroyer is the latest
TV
show themed mobile game this one
features gotcha mechanics players will
collect various versions of the various
characters from the show it also
includes strategy elements online PvP a
single-player storyline some
customizations and other stuff
thankfully it does include the kind of
witty banter that you would expect from
a South Park property however at the end
of the day it is still a freemium game
that doesn't make it bad but one should
adjust one's expectations accordingly
words with friends too is the third game
in the popular word game franchise and
no that is not a typo this one follows
the same Scrabble style gameplay as its
predecessors however it also adds a few
gameplay modes challenges and more the
game also includes 50,000 new words that
previous games don't have otherwise the
experience is basically the same you
take a turn spell a word and then your
opponent builds off the word with the
existing letters on the board it's a fun
game as long as you don't mind it being
aimed at the casual players and that
about does it for this one folks don't
forget to subscribe and ring the bell to
get the latest android authority videos
as soon as they come out the links for
everything are in the video description
below if you so happen and need them as
always thanks for watching everybody and
have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
