brought to you by domain.com we've got
to admit it this thing dominates the
tablet market but what would the Samsung
Galaxy Tab s2
need to do to challenge the mighty iPad
well it's not rocket science it all
comes down to the basic argument that
would work for the Galaxy s6 and s6 edge
should work for the tab 2 and let's
start with less blow wear and lag and
this was the biggest issue with the
original Tab s and one that's largely
been fixed in the galaxy s6 and that
software the software experience and the
tab S was so bad that two gigabytes of
the three gigabytes of RAM was always in
use by the system and as a result lag
was present almost everywhere similar to
the Galaxy s5
fast-forward to the galaxy s6 and
Samsung's latest handset have been
completely stripped back in addition to
less bloatware TouchWiz has been
streamlined on the galaxy s6 and
Samsung's in-house Exynos 7420 processor
has been optimized to work with the
handset if the same experience came to
the Galaxy Tab s2 it might just be the
best Android tablet ever made next up is
a glass build now there's no denying
that the Galaxy s6 and arguably more so
the s6 edge is a sexy-looking smartphone
with a metal build and glass panels
combining to produce a beautiful
smartphone leaked renders of the tab s2
suggest it will have metal sides but is
unclear on whether it will be glass
let's hope it will be glass the problem
for Samsung is that the company has so
many tablet ranges including the tab a
the tab s the Note 10.1 the note Pro etc
looking all these ranges there's
absolutely no way to instantly recognize
which is the premium tablet yet spec
wise the tab S is arguably the best if
going for glass the tab s2 would
instantly make the Tab s line the
flagship tablet now we've got to talk
about the camera smartphone cameras may
have improved a lot but tablet cameras
have been reduced a little more than a
mediocre sensor now a common trend in
advertising is for OEMs to make
comparisons to the iPhone or iPad
and by upgrading the camera on the tab
s2 or even adding the Galaxy s6 camera
if possible Samsung would provide a
major feature bump now perhaps this is a
bit of a dream but what I'd like to see
is an edge screen tablet the concept of
the edge screen on the galaxy s6 edge is
simple the curved part of the screen can
display a night clock a stream of
information such as Twitter trends or
latest news or notifications including
edge lighting when a contact calls an
edge screen on a larger tablet display
would mean that actually the curved
display has uses for almost anyone
whether it's notifications information
or just a night clock the possibilities
are really endless
the original tab ass is still one of the
best Android tablets ever made but the
next tab S is a chance for Samsung to
put pressure on Apple tablets have
largely failed to live up to their
initial expectations of killing the PC
market and largely it's because the iPad
has dominated the tablet market where
Apple hasn't really had to innovate
other than bringing the iPhone
experience to a larger screen neither
have other OEMs and the market is
calling for someone to push the
boundaries of what's possible with
tablets Apple is pretty much kept the
iPad design consistent ever since it
first debuted in 2010 and the lack of
premium build anywhere else has pretty
much meant that no tablet has ever
challenged it yet a galaxy s6 inspired
to have s with the glass build would be
a challenger and adding the edge screen
it would force Apple into innovating the
following iPad so my question for you is
if Samsung could actually put an edge
display on the new tab s2 would you care
would you actually buy it because of the
edge screen let me know in the comments
below so you guys may or may not know
that we've been branching out into other
properties and we have a sound guys it's
a great name because you all know
exactly what sound guys is about you
know what you're gonna get when you go
there and we got the dot-com which is
really the best way to go for a business

tells your story with the same level of
trust as a.com or.net domain name
