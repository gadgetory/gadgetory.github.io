handy the Android authority app guy
today we're gonna take a look at an app
that's been around for a while but
recent updates have added a whole bunch
of new features
it's called boat browser and we're gonna
check it out right now let's talk about
what this browser is capable of doing
first and foremost it is a browser and
therefore is capable of doing all the
usual browser things like bookmarks
history adding new tabs and you know
browsing the web where this app really
shines are the other things that you can
do to start there is an app store built
into both browser much like opera
browser you can search for apps games
themes and add-ons the apps and games
are nothing special but the themes and
add-ons can help turn the browser into a
much more customized experience
another great feature are the gestures
you can create your own or just use the
ones that come stock to control the
browser in many cases for sites or
actions you perform regularly gesturing
can be much faster for instance to go to
google you can just draw a lowercase G
the last thing we'll talk about are some
of the newer features you can backup
your bookmarks to cloud storage or to
your SD card and transfer them between
devices this can be set up to be done
automatically as well it can also pair
with Firefox browser to import bookmarks
if you'd rather do it that way so you
may be wondering how you can use this
well it is a browser so you can use it
like a browser it can compete feature
for feature with a lot of the big-name
browsers it has add-ons like Firefox
various bookmark syncing methods like
Chrome and an app store like opera this
allows for a comprehensive browsing
experience
it also helps having small things like
gesture controls day and night modes and
theming this allows for a more unique
browsing experience than many browsers
offer and it also happens to be pretty
quick in the web browsing department so
here's what we liked about it the new
bookmarks syncing options are a
phenomenal step forward you really can't
have a good browser these days unless
you have a number of ways of syncing
importing and exporting bookmarks both
browser does that we really liked the
gesture controls the stock ones are
useful but you can create a gesture for
any action or website within the browser
we created one that went to Android
Authority comm when we swiped a
lowercase a and we imagine people could
get a lot out of functionality like that
the last thing are the small things like
theming and add-ons like the bookmark
syncing the best browsers these days
have ad
and themes the selection is small for
now but we imagine it'll grow over time
add-ons
add functionality and theming help you
customize the look these are all good
things so here is what we didn't enjoy
so much first and foremost is the design
there is nothing inherently wrong with
it because it is just like all the other
ones and that is the problem it is just
like the other ones it looks very much
like the Opera browser with the speed
dial front page in the tab placement the
design isn't bad and the customization
helps but if you wanted something that
looked different you may be disappointed
the only other thing we could find wrong
where the gesture controls can be a
little fluky for instance gesturing the
G to go to Google took me several tries
before it finally worked you have to be
pretty on the money with the JETRO
controls otherwise they won't work it's
not a deal-breaker but sloppiness is not
an option with the gesture controls
overall boat browser is actually a great
browser if you're getting tired of the
stock offering or the third-party
browser you've been using then we
recommend you give this one a shot it's
quick it's packed with features and
there are both paid and free options so
you can take it for a test drive before
you buy the features the design is
pretty typical for browsers these days
but it does come with add-ons and themes
to help liven things up a little bit
when it's all said and done it's a
pleasant browsing experience and one we
would recommend once again I'm Joe hindi
