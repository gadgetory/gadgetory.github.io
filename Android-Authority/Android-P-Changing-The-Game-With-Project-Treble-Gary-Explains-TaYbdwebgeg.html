pee just around the corner we're really
starting to see the benefits of project
treble hello there my name's Gary Sims
and this is Android authority now if you
would like to understand more about
project treble and how it will give us
faster Android upgrades in the future
please let me explain when I was at
Google i/o this summer I was able to
catch up with Ely an mal chief who is
the leader of project treble over there
at Google I don't have spend some time
talking about project treble and I was
able to capture some of that on camera
so as we look now at project treble and
what it means for the future of our
Android versions I'm going to be also
showing you some of the things that
iliyan had to say about the subject okay
so first of all one of the biggest
complaints that there is about Android
is this version fragmentation that you
kind of get one phone is kind of running
one version then another phone is
running an older version and the OEMs
don't seem to upgrade particularly the
major version numbers don't seem to come
through and if they do come through it
can be very slow it's very trickle-down
process sometimes maybe taking a year or
even more from when Google release a
version of Android until it finally hits
a handset now there are several
different reasons why that protis can be
slow some of it is actually the fault of
the carriers however there is also some
technical issues that project treble
aimed to solve let's listen to what ely
an has to say
great to see you i tell me a little bit
our project rebel yeah
project trouble is how we
our solving androids biggest problem
which is that of version fragmentation
which you know I hope everyone watching
this video is painfully familiar with
the problem at its heart is two parts
there's a technical problem and I'm
popular
the technical problem is really because
Android grew far too quickly
in its rapid growth we didn't have time
to design it so that its top piece is
properly abstracted away from its bottom
piece with the bottom piece being that
which is specific to the hardware that
India is running on yeah and this is
what we did
we introduced upwards of 60 interfaces
that we introduced to the other
why that's important it's because these
interfaces enable us to develop the top
piece of it independently from the
bottom piece and assign the bottom piece
to the companies that properly own it
such as Paul Tom companies that make
mobile CPUs so as you can see with
project treble there's been in now a
hard line drawn we separate the parts
that Google work on the framework and
all that kind of stuff and the parts of
the OEMs and the SOC manufacturers work
on in fact this hardware abstraction
layer has over 60 interfaces defined
that allow the OEMs to create drivers
and hooks into the hardware that they
know will work with what Google is
expecting on the up half of the whole
Android operating system and this has
been no mean feat because before that
kind of demarcation line was absolutely
all over the place some parts were in
the framework some parts were down in
the kernel and it was a real mishmash of
where the kind of line would be drawn
between Google and let's say an OEM like
Qualcomm and as well as aligning all
those interfaces to be in one place
there's also been the issue of speed
these interfaces have to be very very
fast every time you have an interface it
can potentially slow things down because
you have to transfer data and it has to
take this kind of route through this
interface now these interfaces that
they've designed are actually very very
far so that when you're doing things
like multi media and this cameras and
video and sound all that kind of stuff
can flow through these interfaces with
very very little impact on the overall
performance Android releases happen in
and then a company like a company that
makes mobile CPUs like Qualcomm it would
take me a few months to do their work
and then they already are at the end of
year so into a device manufacturer you
don't have enough time to do your work
and launch a device for the holiday
season so what we should've is this year
absorb that
work by the mobile CPUs so that it
happens in parallel events and therefore
gaining several months over quarter
leave for ODS and three four months is
an eternity in our industry and that in
turn allows the device makers to do
their customizations on top of top of
Android with plenty of time to launch
and upgrade and as you heard Allianz say
that means we've saved three or four
months in the overall cycle of the kind
of release of Google until it hits the
OEMs and hopefully that means for
Android P and further on we should see
much faster updates now obviously as I
said there's still the issue of some of
the carrier's who have to go and do all
their testing and they add in all their
stuff they want to add on top but in
terms of the relationship between Google
and the SOC makers like call Corp and
Google and an actual om like oneplus
like Sony then that relationship now is
much closer technically we're talking
now so that the actual changes in Google
can flow through to the end-user much
quicker and we really did see the
benefit of Android pay when the Android
P beta was released because it came out
on phones from seven different OEMs at
the same time as Google released it and
that's partly because now OMS have to be
able to run the open-source version of
Android on all of their phones it's one
of the requirements for getting Android
certification and because the
open-source version is being updated all
the time and the OEMs can stay in sync
with how these changes are happening
they can always make sure that their
phones run the latest version and then
when finally Google kind of you know
draw a line and said right this is
version eight or this is version nine
whatever they're gonna do then actually
the OEMs are already prepared because
they've been keeping up to date with
Google's development and their phone
already runs Google's latest version and
you know evidenced by the fact that we
have to pick slaw
so that's Android P will be on seven
different devices and that's cool
basically down to the work of Trevor yes
also the OEMs of course but there's a
lot of heed of that because he's coming
out now on the pixel but also all these
other devices at the same time yes I
mean the entire Android organization had
to do a lot a lot a lot of work to make
this happen and I'm happy about finally
the results
manifesto and today you have it project
treble now firstly I'm really looking
forward to seeing how this will impact
the upgrades to our handsets we should
be seeing much more faster upgrades we
should see what hands it's released with
the latest version of Android on them
rather than one from you know kind of a
year ago and I think this is a very very
positive step for the Android ecosystem
