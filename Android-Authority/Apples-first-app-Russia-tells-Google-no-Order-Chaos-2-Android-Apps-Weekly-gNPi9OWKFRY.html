show is brought to you by tangram
productivity browser hello again ladies
and gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority Afghan welcome back to the
107th episode of the Android apps weekly
show let's get right into it google has
released three applications aimed
directly at android marshmallow two of
them deal with midi sounds and the third
one is a direct share application
they're not in the Play Store but are
more like examples for other developers
google has also announced that they're
now selling google play gift cards in
india while this doesn't necessarily fix
the problem of not allowing people to
use debit cards it should help alleviate
the problem a great deal they're
available in select retailers and online
at snapdeal.com earlier this week the
Russian Federal anti-monopoly Service
decreed that google must unbundle google
apps from devices so that it only ships
with Google Play this would ostensibly
allow users to choose their own
applications instead of being pressured
into using google services the long
awaited minecraft story mode game from
Telltale Games now has an official
release date and it's October 15th of
this year we've seen trailers and tell
tale has a good reputation for making
awesome games prepare your wallet folks
because this one is going to be awesome
Mark Zuckerberg announced this week that
Facebook will be getting a dislike
button unfortunately it won't be used to
show distaste but rather to show
sympathy because Zuckerberg doesn't want
Facebook to turn into a site like reddit
it's in testing now so it's not far away
from being released before even more
Android apps and games news updates and
new releases don't forget to check out

okay folks to take a look at the apps
and games that made a big splash this
week as usual if you want to check any
of these apps or games out you can find
those links in the video description
below first up this week is chariot
Jarrett is a console game that first
made its appearance on Xbox one and ps4
but now it has been ported to android
you play as a princess and you're tasked
with carrying
wagon through all kinds of scenarios the
graphics are colorful and well done the
controls are simple to learn in the game
has a ton of dark and quirky humor the
only problem is that it's an Nvidia
shield console exclusive game laughs
Order &amp;amp; Chaos Online was one of the most
popular MMORPGs to grace the google play
store and now order and chaos to us out
there are a lot of the same elements as
the first one with co-op game play pvp
battling and plenty of hero combinations
to choose from game Ops has expanded on
the campaign mode with a metric ton of
things to do and the graphics got a
slight boost as well it's free to play
with in-app purchases and has favorable
reviews so far nibblers is the latest
game out of romeo and the first since
they laid off about a third of their
employees a few weeks ago this is a
candy crush style match 3 game with a
combat component where you must match
3-2 defeat bad guys it follows a simple
story of fish battling lizards much like
the birds battled the pigs and angry
birds the graphics are colorful in this
game is good for kids as well as adults
it's free to play if you're interested
oh ho boy Apple released their first
application to the Google Play Store and
surprise surprise it's an application
aimed to get people away from Android
the application works pretty much as the
name implies without too much of a
hassle so if you actually need it for
its intended purpose it does work well
most of the time hilariously the android
community has responded in kind if a bit
predictably with a sea of 1 star ratings
making this the most hated application
since Facebook home welcome to Google
Play Apple enjoy your stay last up this
week is a new application out of
Microsoft called send this is an email
application that tries to treat emails
like instant messages to give it more of
a natural quick and ergonomic feeling
this is similar to an application we
looked at a while back called we mail so
if you've used that you kind of know
what this is like unfortunately it's
invite-only right now so if you want to
check it out you'll have to get in line
