the next big device coming around the
corner that I can get excited about
and I would always say it's not a device
it's a new category not always sure what
the new category would be but I think it
might be safe to say that that category
is not a device but artificial
intelligence because what I just saw is
fun creepy scary and awesome all at the
same time meet Google duplex in the
first demo the AI driven voice for
Google assistant called for a woman who
wanted to make a haircut appointment I'm
looking for something I'm a third the
demo showed the AI voice understanding
the voice of the human on the other end
of the call and made the correct
responses to the real person's answers
Google's assistance voice even put in
words like um to make it sound like a
more real human after the phone call was
completed Google assistant sent a
notification to the original user
informing them that the haircut
appointment was confirmed impressive but
it gets better
now in the second demonstration is where
things got pretty crazy because the
Google AI tried to make a restaurant
reservation on behalf of its user and
called a small restaurant the person at
that restaurant the real person who
answered the phone clearly was not a
native English speaker had a pretty
thick accent and the way they spoke was
sometimes a little bit confusing
hi I'd like to reserve a table for
Wednesday the 7th it's for four people
well people win at 6 p.m. Oh actually
really sir for like a per like a 5
people four people below you can come
how long is the way usually to be beated
the Google a I understood the context of
the conversation smoothly confirmed all
the details of the infirm
and successfully made that reservation
that call that communication would have
been difficult for some regular human
beings and the Google AI did it smoothly
in such a way that the person on the
other end the real person would have an
exceedingly difficult time believing or
understanding that the person they were
speaking to was not a real person
holy crap it's just great right so
where's the scary part well it is scary
when you begin to apply the law of
unintended consequences yes many people
will use this tool to book hair
appointments and restaurant reservations
for sure but at the past 15 years is any
indication what people will do they will
use this as another insulation another
wall another barrier between them and
the real world we have a whole
generation of young people digital
natives who don't know what life was
like before the internet and they are
deeply probably you are deeply immersed
in a digital world much much more than
maybe is healthy and I think that tools
like this make it even easier to go
deeper into that world and not develop
the real life skills that you need to
connect with people you see when you
connect with me here many of you talked
to me on Twitter and in the comments
like you know me like we know each other
like there's a relationship there's not
not really you know the person on this
screen the image and persona that I
present on this screen but that's not me
that is just a inadequate facsimile of
Who I am
but there is an emotional payoff and
make you feel something I may make you
laugh I may inform you all those things
but that is a sick inappropriate
substitute for connecting with someone
in the real world in the flesh and tools
like this just make it easier to avoid
that altogether that's my fear I really
see it I see it in my teenagers I see in
the students that I've taught I'm
worried I'm really worried what do you
guys think about it let me know in the
comments below because I think we're
starting with a slippery slope it's easy
to use a tool like this to make a hair
appointment but this kind of technology
going to be used
much deeper things and I'm worried let
me know what you think now lately here
on our show we have been getting pretty
serious about online privacy and you
should know that using Google Chrome's
incognito mode alone is not going to
protect you from government surveillance
or if you have a nosy Internet service
provider what can help you with that is
Express VPN what is a VPN VPN stands for
virtual private network and if you're
using a good VPN hackers can't target
you or skim your personal data even over
public Wi-Fi networks advertisers can't
harvest information about you or your
browsing patterns and finally
governments and companies can't see what
you're doing online if you want to try
