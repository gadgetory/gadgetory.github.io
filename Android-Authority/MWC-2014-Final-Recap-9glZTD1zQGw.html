by bitdefender mobile security hey just
roger guard from android thought it
what's going on everybody and i'm here
of course with darcy lock evade we're
here at the Mobile World Congress ready
to bring you our final recap in a way
we're going to tell you what we've been
doing today on the final day as
everybody is filtering out of the entire
venue the fira gran vía there are just
suits and luggage everywhere so the
taxes are all trickling out users just a
line of yellow way over there but it's
just a very long day for us obviously
and there are some very particular
reasons why we had to talk to a lot of
companies but for very very special
reasons and all that Darcy go ahead and
recount what that was all about yeah so
I mean essentially our role is to serve
you you know our visitors our viewers
and we are doing that this year by
stepping up our award program and we
gave away eight different awards this
year best flagship phone best mid-range
best budget three best tablet awards we
also had wearable so yeah basically what
we did is that we went through all the
halls and this is a big place and so we
have them through and we got video and
Josh took some more pictures and yeah we
just give away all the awards and we had
to find out shake it in hand with the
manufacturers yes yeah see every single
one of them just were very elated to
grab the awards they look pretty awesome
by the way so but you'll see in a best
of awards video for mobile world
congress which devices actually got the
awards and you'll be able to see exactly
why which we're going to talk about but
yeah just it's really nice to meet the
people at these companies and yes
obviously they're happy to keep receive
what they're receiving is a siren over
there they really earned it you know and
really happy to give them the
recognition they deserve if we spent a
lot of time thinking sorry guys we spent
a lot of time going over the halls you
know pouring over the products like
literally looking at like dozens upon
dozens of products and today we've got a
chance to go back to Sony I get some
hands-on time with the Sony Xperia z2
and tablet Z 2 which are amazing yeah
they're absolutely wonderful and you
know we did talk about Samsung a little
bit earlier on the previous recap video
which is why we wanted to make sure to
bring you our thoughts on the z2 now the
reason why I told you yesterday that you
know the s5 is getting a lot of traction
it's just because you have to talk about
what they put in there you know how are
you not going to talk about a heart rate
monitor nope but when it comes to the z2
this is the best way for me to put it
while Samsung puts in a lot of features
that you like I said have to talk about
their adding to the formula on top of
Android on top of everything and you're
just going to get all these additions no
matter what you are going to talk about
them when it comes to sony Sony takes
the formula that's already in place that
is really pretty good and they just
continue to refine it um there-there
design language as gotten even better
especially with the move to an IPS
screen and that also has a much smaller
bezel it just looks incredible on that
black slate and then after that the
speed of the software with the
Snapdragon 801 in there it just it just
works really great it flies absolutely
flies I've never I've never had what I
would say is a smoother transition and
said literally everything in the phone
it just seems solvable fastest camera
just in terms of implementation from
clicking the actual camera yeah all the
way to taking a picture mm-hmm I mean
focusing on all the quality that is
debatable you know relative to the new
stuffs after everything else yeah we're
gonna have to compare it you know once
we get the device and that is definitely
going to happen you'll be seeing camera
comparisons up to just all of so many of
them later and and we're definitely
stepping up our game in terms of that
imaging is very important to everybody
and we'll number one yeah and with these
new developments in the Android space of
just like super high megapixel counts
you know Samsung update up to 16 but
Sonja already brought up to 20.7 you
know so we really want to see just
exactly where this image this smartphone
imaging is going to go and even a
company like Huawei was focusing on the
selfie game so yeah every company is
trying to make sure that optics is a big
and we got this incredible stuff yeah
and all the manufacturers are bringing
their a-game even guys like alcatel
Holloway I mean we're seeing some really
exceptional devices Nokia's Android
devices although not really pure Android
not even close no google play services
no google play services um you know they
we asked them you know what how about uh
how about if a app is not available the
Nokia Store they said well you could
think they were being really like hands
off about it there was Google right
across the way I asked him about it i
saw the badge you know questions like oh
what's this you know yeah and they said
you you could side loaded but we're not
supposed to say that that's why things
you know microsoft's just sitting in the
background like no yeah it's uh it's
really interesting to see Nokia jump
into the game that phone okay so it's
like the 928 that I that I reviewed a
while back in terms of the design is
very blocky designed very flat
everywhere but you know that's that's
nice that's what Nokia does and really
build quality yeah and if you wanted
nokia built on an android phone this is
the first one to come out personally i'm
i'm not exactly sure if it's ready for
primetime just yet but then again it's
only coming out and select markets
anyway so this could be a step from from
from nokia into just the awesome
direction of android so that's what
we're really looking forward to their
but yeah we are winding down our our
best of mwc is essentially our awards
video and we're going to give you that
in a little bit but we just wanted to
