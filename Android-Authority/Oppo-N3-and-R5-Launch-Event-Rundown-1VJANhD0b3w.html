blockbuster announcements here at their
launch event in Singapore and I'm here
to bring you the rundown of this event
you're probably watching our hands on
videos right now but it's josh regard
from android authority what's going on
everybody and welcome to the oppo launch
event n 3 and r 5 rundown so we're ready
talking about the actual devices
themselves as far as the hands-on goes
you already seeing those particular
videos and you'll see that the end three
returns with the n1 aesthetic but it has
been shrunken down a little bit which i
think is a wonderful future of that
particular phone but the rotating camera
on the top also returns as well and as
far as the presentation goes there were
a lot a lot of presentations about the
camera itself that not only has the
rotation that is now automated with a
motor but also is available with a very
good optic package underneath 16
megapixels of what you get there and
there was a lot of hubbub about the kind
of certifications that it has from very
particular photography companies that
sort of backed it with their technology
so there's a big presentation about that
even a photographer from New York came
up and talked about how the n3 was
better than the DSLR photos that he was
taking that's something that might be up
for some debate but all in all the entry
does bring back a very nice camera but
also has a couple of other features
underneath that include the old click
that you can use in order to rotate the
camera the presentation for the most
part did really showcase the m3 and
number of the other features have been
enhanced from the n1 to be even better
like the o touch area that now has a
fingerprint scanner and can also be used
in order to rotate the camera back and
forth the skyline a notification light
also returns as well and they did a
really good job of really showcasing all
the different types of features that are
available on the n3 and then of course
one of the more questionable choices was
to have the phones actually appear from
the stage and as you can see here once
the once the devices actually appeared
everyone made a bum rush for the stage
when I was at the fine seven launch
unfortunately what happened was they
came down from the ceiling from where I
was sitting and I was right next to it
and when everybody had to bum-rush those
phones I almost got trampled so I'm
still questioning whether or not it's a
good idea to have that particular aspect
because then ten minutes after people
take their photos they tell everybody to
leave anyway and go back to their seats
but nonetheless everyone got a good look
at the m3 and I already got my first
look on it that you're watching probably
or have already watched on our YouTube
channel but the m3 was definitely the
focus of the the event but for kind of a
surprise that hopeful brought out a
second smartphone and what's definitely
surprise to everybody in the audience
that the heavy r5 the r5 is the thinnest
smartphone available and actually they
had a really nice presentation but all
of the different phones that had a claim
to fame about being the smallest one
starting off with the motorola razr
version 3 which i thought was really
cool and it went all the way down to the
iphone floor and then finally came the
are five four point eight nine
millimeters is pretty incredible to have
a phone that small and be able to use it
still pretty well everyone already
started talking about right after the
event if it would Bend easily or
anything like that if it was actually a
sturdy phone but from the hands on as
you probably saw already I said that the
phone actually had a lot of weight to it
there was actually a lot to the phone
that was contrary to it being so thin
and that's the reason why I think that
stiff feel that the or five has and
actually
you will allow it to be a very sturdy
phone as well as the fact that that
aluminum alloy allows it to be a very
attractive one on top of all of that but
nonetheless the par-5 was really the
main story in terms of the surprise here
even though the entry got a lot of the
presentation the r5 was still a very
nice little little tidbit that came up
when it came to pose of launch events a
day here in singapore now the r5 and the
m3 were also announced in terms of their
prices and unfortunately I do think that
the price for the m3 is just a little
bit high 649 dollars for a phone that
has a lot of different quirks to it that
may or may not prove useful for a number
of people out there especially the
rotating camera as was the case with the
m1 but then with the r5 it is at four
hundred ninety nine dollars which i
think is not a horrible price for the
phone so she with the premium materials
that is being made of but these are more
expensive than other phones that opal
has put out whether or not that's going
to really really affect the sales is
really something that is up to you the
consumer obviously so speaking of which
you can still see our hands on videos on
there I do have a couple of verses
videos for the end three in particular
for you but I am going to have those
available for you a little bit later
today but for now you can enjoy the
hands-on videos I did have a good time
with both of these phones i actually
really think the n3 is a wonderful
upgrade from the n1 and i'm looking
forward to having my own unit for it as
well there are 5 while it does have a
great aesthetic too and i think it's a
wonderful phone a very solid phone in
fact i do think that the thinness is its
main claim to fame and if the thinness
doesn't really add too much to the
functionality in fact it actually loses
the headphone jack so you can argue that
the fitness makes them lose some
functionality and it's not necessarily
the kind that i would
get the m3 offers more honestly but of
course it has that much higher price
point but nonetheless we have the
experiences own right behind me here and
everyone is getting their hands on these
two particular phones along with a lot
of other opal products and I'm going to
take a look at as well like the blu-ray
players and whatnot products that I new
Opel already had but obviously I'm in
the mobile space so all I know really
are their phones and whatnot so really
it's been an interesting time here in
Singapore I'm going to be flying back
tomorrow but I just wanted to give you
this look at the actual event to give
you the rundown and so have you
basically experienced what I experienced
here over the last of the course of the
last like hour and a half to two hours
