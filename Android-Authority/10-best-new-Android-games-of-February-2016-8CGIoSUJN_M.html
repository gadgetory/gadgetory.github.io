handy the Android authority app guy it's
about that time to round up the best
android games from february of 2016
adventures of mana is a hack and slash
RPG that was first released in the early
1990s for Gameboy it has been revamped
and re-released for mobile and now you
can pick it up whenever you want much
like other Square Enix games you'll have
a virtual joystick to move around with
and plenty of weapons and magic to use
against various bad guys and obstacles
it also has gamepad support if you want
that it's a tad expensive but the
nostalgic value is high and there are no
in-app purchases Altos adventure is a
side-scrolling infinite runner where you
must ski down a mountainside for as long
as possible
you'll be tasked with collecting llamas
which have gotten loose and are now
running rampant and you'll be able to do
tricks off of large jumps it features
very well done vector style graphics
with muted colors which adds to the
game's ambiance it's free to download
with in-app purchases and it's a pretty
decent little time waster bombing
bastards touch is a Bomberman clone
where you must navigate puzzles plant
bombs avoid bad guys and pick up
power-ups to make your way through each
level it has a total of 30 levels that
span five worlds and there are plenty of
bad guys to bomb and power-ups to
collect there are also five boss battles
that you'll get to play through what
makes this game special is that it's
entirely free with no in-app purchases
and it's rare to see a game this good
for that price digimon heroes has been
in the Google Play Store for less than a
month and it already has over 500,000
downloads which is pretty impressive
this is a card collecting game mixed
with a match-three game where you must
solve a match-three puzzle to deal
damage to your opponents in terms of
sheer mechanics it's fairly similar to
Pokemon shuffle except with digimon
elements baked in it's a decent time
waster if you're into digimon although
to be honest we prefer an actual digimon
game down-well is a unique platformer
where you're falling down a well on your
way down you'll hop on two platforms
kill bad guys discover secret caves and
use your gun boost to avoid obstacles in
order to survive to the next level
it has charming retro style graphics and
simple on-screen controls the game is
also built in such a way that it's
different every time you play even if
you start over it's $3.00 with no end
purchases and it's a solid time waster
final fantasy 9 is perhaps the most
prolific release yet from Square Enix on
mobile it features the entire story of
Final Fantasy 9 in its original glory
with many aspects of the graphics and
controls updated to accommodate mobile
displays some have lamented its lack of
tablet support and other small issues
and for $20 we don't blame them
nevertheless this is probably the best
jrpg on android right now in terms of
longevity and complexity grand theft
auto liberty City Stories is the latest
GTA release on Android and so far it
seems to be pretty good it looks in
place pretty much like any grand theft
auto title except rockstar has tweaked
things like the mobile controls and
Mission lengths to better adjust the
gameplay to mobile devices it has a ton
of content to play through decent
graphics and that classic GTA charm it's
$6.99 but it also has no in-app
purchases Skybound is the latest in the
lego ninjago series it adds to the
storyline just like the previous Ninjago
games and also contains decent graphics
easy controls and a fun premise it's
technically a platformer but there are
stealth elements where you can hide
behind stuff and catch enemies off-guard
or avoid them altogether it's a lot of
fun and looks in place fantastically
considering that it's a free game with
no in-app purchases spin circle is a
minimal puzzle game er you must spin the
circles in orbit around a central point
and avoid being hit by the squares it's
a simple idea but it's executed well and
it should work on virtually any phone
which makes it an accessible game for
pretty much everybody you tap and hold
each side of the screen to change
direction and speed and the game has
difficulty settings as well it's also
free to download which is nice last on
our list this month is splash cars this
fun little time waster has you driving
around town literally painting the town
because your car spews paint that colors
everything you'll be chased by cops and
you'll have to avoid them you can also
turn regular folks to your side
it contains simple mechanics with
on-screen controls and it shouldn't be
too hard to get in and just play it also
has power-ups and plenty of car options
for you to choose from once again I'm
