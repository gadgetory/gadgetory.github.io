Hindy the android authority app guy we
are in the dog days of summer which
means not a lot of stuff is going on but
we did have a few awesome releases in
July so we're gonna take a look at the
best new Android apps and games from
July of 2015 review released Angry Birds
to this month and has decided that this
one will be the actual sequel to the
original game as such there are some
gameplay improvements and concepts to
help freshen up these stale franchise
including multistage levels and even
boss battles we know that angry birds is
kind of old and tired but it is still a
decent time waster that's free to
download and it's good for kids boxer
calendar is a new calendar application
out of the same developers who released
box or email the calendar app itself is
fairly simple with multiple viewing
options material design theming and
customization options widgets and
support for Google and Exchange
calendars what its main feature is the
ability to send your availability
quickly to just about anyone although
this feature does require that you use
the Box your email application as well
it's free but do beware of those release
day bugs five nights at Freddy's 4 marks
the second release of the franchise this
year this one kind of goes back to the
origin story as you must keep watch over
a bedroom while checking the closet two
hallways and of course the bed behind
you despite being a very simple game it
manages to be quite challenging and it
does leave you a bit on edge it's the
shock value game with a cheap price tag
and high entertainment value if you like
scary stuff forsaken world mobiles an
MMORPG that has you going on quests
duking it out with bad guys and finding
hidden treasures the gameplay is simple
and easy to use and involves using other
manual movements or tap to move while
you do a range of other things it's an
easy game to play with a lot of quests
to do there is also a mount system
decent graphics and online multiplayer
options it's a strong option if you're
into mmorpgs Cody formerly known as XBMC
left beta earlier this month it is now a
standalone release on the Google Play
Store for those who don't know Cody is a
full-fledged media center application
that allows you to play all of your
media as well as install third-party
plugins for additional functionality
there are some bugs here and there but
for the most part it works very well
although smaller devices may not get the
best experience Microsoft hyperlapse has
received a lot of press over the last
month thanks to its somewhat unique
functionality this app takes a lot of
images in rapid succession and then
stitches them together to create a
time-lapse video there are other apps
that can do this but this one does it
better
most and it's a fun little tool to have
in the old app drawer it's also totally
free with no in-app purchases Microsoft
had a busy month because on top of
hyperlapse they also released tossed up
from their garage projects this empty
little application helps you communicate
with people very quickly and efficiently
to help set up things like meetings take
quick yes or no votes and ask for
opinions it suffered from some early
release day bugs but most of them appear
to have been sorted out by now it's not
overly powerful but definitely useful
for quick info disney released an
official Star Wars application earlier
this month it's most likely in
preparation of the upcoming Star Wars
movie the app is meant to act as a hub
for all things Star Wars and includes
news updates and event announcements the
app also comes with a ton of extra stuff
for Star Wars fans including themes
whether animated gifs and a whole lot
more if you like Star Wars give this a
shot because it is totally free
vainglory is a moment that was released
on android earlier this month it
features a variety of Heroes which
allows for a variety of tactics along
with online multiplayer practice mode
and a whole lot more the graphics are
pretty decent and the controls are easy
enough to get the hang of the developers
have also promised new content and
heroes to come on a regular basis which
will be nice if they pull through it's
free to play and actually really good it
lasts up this month is Wi-Fi mapper this
is an application that helps you find
Wi-Fi hotspots for you to connect to
this is great for those who don't have
home web or are looking for internet on
the go it's crowd-sourced which allows
you to add new hot spots as you find
them if you so choose you can also
measure how well each one does so you
know which ones are the best ones to
connect to it had some early release
date bugs but otherwise it's a very
useful application once again I'm Joe
