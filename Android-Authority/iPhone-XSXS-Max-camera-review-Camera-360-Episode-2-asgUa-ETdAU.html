authority and welcome back to another
episode of camera 360 this is episode 2
and on this show we attempt to break
down a smartphone camera in about three
minutes time there's 60 seconds in a
minute and there's three of those
minutes so hence the name camera 360
hopefully that clears up any confusion
about the title of the show that you
guys might have had in the first episode
so on the show we're gonna give you the
gist of everything that you need to know
about a smartphone camera while keeping
everything short and sweet we're gonna
talk about the features the camera app
and of course the image quality
today's phone is the iPhone 10s and 10's
max let's go ahead and hop right in
alright so before we get started let's
go over some of the main camera specs
the iPhone 10s / 10s Macs have dual 12
megapixel wide and telephoto cameras on
the rear the wide angle is F 1.8 while
the telephoto is F 2.4 the front-facing
camera is 7 megapixels and has an
aperture of f-22 now that we've gotten
that out of the way let's kick things
off with the camera app Apple's camera
app whether you love it or hate it
has always been about simplicity there's
no manual mode which some may not like
but for the everyday user it keeps the
experience straightforward the app is
clean and pretty self-explanatory the
shutter button camera rotation and image
preview buttons are accompanied by a
carousel of shooting modes
these include photo portrait square
panorama time-lapse slow-motion and
video additional settings will show up
along the opposite side of the screen
you can adjust the exposure by tapping
the focus and dragging your finger up
and down anything you need is usually
just a tap or two away daylight
conditions are where smartphone cameras
tend to perform at their best and the
iPhone does a great job here but it
doesn't necessarily step over the
competition photos are generally well
exposed have vibrant colors great detail
and very little noise but the cameras
dynamic range isn't great shadows tend
to be pretty harsh as you can see in
this photo at the beach and this photo
here is actually pretty under
posed even though was taken outdoors
when there was still plenty of light
HDR usually helps with boosting dynamic
range but the iPhones HDR capabilities
weren't exactly thrilling when there
isn't a huge difference in lighting
across the frame the phone does
perfectly fine but when there's quite a
bit of contrast between bright and dark
areas the darker areas don't show very
much detail at all in low-light the
iPhone does fairly well there's good
exposure and detail remains relatively
sharp there is some noticeable noise
when you zoom in but in this case that's
kind of a good thing because it means
the phone is not trying to over soften
the image to compensate of course the
front-facing camera is equally as
important especially for selfie purposes
and the front-facing camera on the
iPhone is more than adequate but it has
some major flaws the biggest one is a
tendency to over soften skin white
balance intent can sometimes be all over
the place as well when it comes to video
recording the iPhone performance about
the same as it does in photos it
produces a sharp image with good detail
good exposure and natural colors having
4k video recording at 60 frames per
second is also a huge bonus and not
something that all smartphone cameras
have the image stabilization is decent
but nothing to be overly impressed by so
with all that being said that are
premature app up episode 2 of camera 360
overall we gave the iPhone 10s / 10s max
a 7 point 7 out of 10 if you want to
find out why make sure to check out the
written version linked in the
description below which covers the
camera much more in depth and if you
want to see the full resolution images
for yourself we'll also have that linked
below as well thanks for watching and
we'll see you guys in the next episode
of camera 360</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
