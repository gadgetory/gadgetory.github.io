handy the Android authority app guard in
this quick video we're going to take a
look at the best Nintendo DS emulators
for Android plastic DSM you later is
pretty much the only emulator you should
consider it's solid stable or at least
more solid and stable than most it still
has issues but not nearly as many as
everyone else NDS for Droid is another
DS emulator project this one is open
source but it still has quite a few
problems it is free unlike drastic so
those who don't want to spend any money
could give it a shot but really spend
the $8 open NDS emulator is another open
source Nintendo DS emulator that is also
free much like NDS 4 or this one has a
lot of stability issues and is probably
only worth a shot if you really don't
want to spend any money
pretend ods emulator is a far second in
terms of stability and performance it's
also free and it's based on the NDS for
Droid open source project with some
additional tweaks at it in it's not
great but it's the best free option
available that's it for this video folks
I did promise it'd be a short one the
video probably won't be updated but the
article will be if we find any more
decent in tend ODS emulators so check
back there from time to time if you
haven't yet don't forget to follow us on
social media and subscribe to the
YouTube channel as always thanks for
watching everybody and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
