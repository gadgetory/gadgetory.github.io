actually I met damn it for the first
time earlier today on his way home from
from Thanksgiving he was traveling to DC
and on his way home through PA I took
about an hour drive to meet him this
morning I was a lot of fun little bit of
Android geeking out over some quiznos
yeah yeah it's nice good lunch finally
you know actually get you in person sit
around talking about it I'm sure hey I
know we talked about so rarely yeah so
what's a Jeff how was your thanksgiving
yours good work no dealing with family

away from ease go see the little family
he's a little bit of bird and nothing
well as good a little bit bird yeah hurt
in there No so it's a Josh how was your
thanksgiving it was good a really
interesting thing talking about meeting
another android fanatic i was at in
plano texas hanging out with some old
high school buds and i went to go pick
up nexus 4 from t-mobile the guy ringing
me out recognize me from google plus you
know i never met each other yeah James
Jody Barnes and he just looks me go Oh
Joey's Jody's actually one of our
friends Joey right now that's yeah I met
Jody at the big Android BBQ with John a
few weeks back yeah Jody's one of our
buddies that yeah it was a trip I was
like I'm from Austin I'm a teacher he
goes are you on google+ I go yeah I am
because you're uh you're Josh I'm when
you assess like uh yes he's a stalker
it's cool that's that's pretty awesome
said Jodi usually turns into the show so
he's probably watching right now very
cool yeah and then Scott how about a but
up north there anything exciting
thanksgiving i went down south to Iowa
for a couple days I had a good time with
the family the Android numbers
in relatives is growing so I oh I OS
devices are definitely you know some
people of the five but uh Android
devices are growing and we had a lot of
talk about it's those fun you know my
two little cousins were walking around
their iPads and I was there with with my
nexus 4 and my uncle had a kindle fire
and we were fine using the Wi-Fi there
but my little cousins like we can't go
Wi-Fi they came up to me they're they're
older cousin to help them out I looked
at as a consequence an iOS device and I
said Uncle Jim you know how house your
house your android device go my spot you
know it was a big laugh at house nice
guy and helped milk humorously cut a
couple of close friends of mine and
family have converted from iOS to
Android this year keep fighting the good
fight you know okay by me as I am I am
outnumbered probably ten to one right
word it's like me to other band
directors and all of our private lesson
teachers everybody uses apple and every
time I start talking about Android they
go oh um so when are you going to get an
iphone like normal people never just
remember just remember real almost as if
you soft market yeah alright so let's
get into into the meat of the show here
so this goddess I'm a Android ecosystem
information yeah google play music
google basically reached a deal with
armonia i think that's how you spell it
or say it on a european publishing group
and this adds 5.5 million songs to the
Play Store and what's really big about
this is Google's not really taking it
country by country um they're trying to
do this all in one big swoop which in
the future I hope it continues to be
like this but it'll be a little bit more
delayed but they got it up and running
in 35 different countries which is
awesome and I'm excited about that yeah
yeah google is sort of trying to change
the paradigm in the music industry where
they're trying this sort of method it
we're going to license your music period
but like no further qualifications on
that we're licensing it to sell it all
around the world because we work and you
know we're business all around the world
where is everybody else that does
online sales like this Amazon Apple all
of that could piece it together country
by country it's it's a lot of hassle
just to get the licenses in place to be
able to sell all the music let alone
actually running the store look at how
long it took for Spotify to come to
America because of having to make that
was nine years in cali a while and I
wonder what at what point google said
hey we should really just attack
everything as opposed to you know label
by label we got our free you know I'm
sure Google doesn't doesn't seek out a
recording industry recording studio to
to not bring into the Play Store now
they gotta reach a deal to you know I
mean it ultimately they want to have the
best content system the best ecosystem
available it's only a matter of dollars
and cents and in coming up with the
right contract I'm sure yeah especially
coming into it as late in the game
technically speaking as they did you
know and you had iTunes totally turned
the music industry on its head when it
came out and finally somebody's trying
to like you said change of paradigm
further so they can be you know on top
of the heap yet again because they've
got a lot of room to make up they've got
a lot of ground that they need to catch
up to especially against amazon and
itunes and there's no moving on we gotta
kind of a tear down by the android
police they did a teardown of the google
play store the APK and it looks like
we're going to have to be required to
have a Google+ account to do app reviews
um a couple things i like about this no
more anonymous reviews actually i mean
some people like anonymous reviews other
people don't because they can actually
see who did the review and they can
actually you know it means something as
opposed to a whole bunch of people
spamming and just go in one star 1 star
things like that i'm pretty excited
about this i mean this is a big push for
Google+ what are you guys think from a
developer aspect it means you can
actually follow up with that guy had
color did something negative follow up
with that person and say hey look you
know I did changes or what can we do to
to find out what your problem is or talk
to person through how to get some logs
about it so good developers means to
actually get some real meaningful
feedback
balance plus you have to have a facebook
account to comment on all kinds of crap
all over the internet so i really don't
see a problem with this and you know
what i think it's going to be great for
if i actually like a nap really well i
can just share a little review feedback
in directly with my circles on google+
versus having to go write a separate
review elsewhere you know so further
real quick and dirty hey I like this for
these reasons you know don't need a
full-blown blog article about yeah I
think that's great I think it's a I
think it's a step in the right direction
and you know it cuts down on anonymous
spam comments or unhelpful comments you
know if only we could do away with some
of those on YouTube you know I think the
world is our place yeah you're not just
the the sort of the anonymous anyone's
but the you know the app maker who fills
out 47 review saying how awesome the app
is I would be able to do that
either I think this is great just cuz
you know they haven't used google plus
for a really long time you know when you
get a new phone and it asks you sign up
for google plus it's important that
google finally tries to tie all the
services truly together like we just saw
them roll out where you can invite or
share a nap so people can install it
straight from your stream requiring you
to have Google+ to review and comment
things like that only further pushes
their their social aspect which is
something that a lot of people you know
despite having met a guy that I've never
met in real life in a city that I never
go to all of my other friends still say
0 google+ is a failed service and I just
disagree with that on merit and so the
more that they can get people to use the
ecosystem the better it's going to
benefit them and then hopefully the
network users as well so you can finally
start seeing some real uptick in
involvement and stuff like that
yeah um also moving on we got some black
friday deals over the weekend basically
they're ongoing I don't know when
they're gonna end but uh officesuite pro
usually 1499 is 699 quickoffice pro is
1499 it's now 99 cents swiftkey for
phone or tablet it's usually 399 and
it's 99 cents groove IP is 499 ants on
sale for 249 reddit sync pro is two
dollars and it's on sale for one dollar
and there are a lot of apps there are
also big deals on money off of in-app
purchases which is kind of nice if you
guys do in app purchases I don't but I'm
actually finally you bought the the
full version of groove IP due to the
sale I've I've also used the free lite
version payment yeah but it wasn't you
know it was down to 250 you know from
five bucks I figured why not I mean
there's there's probably another
probably hundred apps out there that are
only how many there's so many games and
you know productivity apps as well it's
got a really look for them yeah I think
they also have discounts on books movies
and music in the Play Store yeah they
got some really good deals on also
there's a couple of TV seasons TV show
seasons that are ten dollars on fifth
seasons which is actually pretty good um
like there's eighty percent off books
and music there are some really good
deals too so let's talk about ingress
you're probably here for ingress ingress
uh recently launched and if you don't
know what it is real quick and dirty
virgin is it's a augmented reality game
and there is a high demand for you know
it's gone you know almost viral I think
especially on google+ for the past week
it's been the number one or at least the
top five trending topic every single day
all day long like people are sharing
ingress information they're asking for
invites they're asking for codes there
you know sharing tips and tricks and
people are forming their own little like
social pockets of resistance or
enlightened around the world but so so
what what is
real quick um it's an augmented reality
game so that means you hold your your
phone out in front of you and you see
something on your phone that you don't
see with with with your eye and in real
life so you look on your phone and you
see little dots of energy you see
portals you see fields that people
created but obviously the other they're
not really there or if you or if you buy
into the role playing enough you know
they are there is a lot of people are
really getting heavily involved in it
and that's awesome I think that's very
cool so anyways CERN did some stuff and
with a large hadron collider and all
sorts of weird funky stuff happened to
now there's new energy particles coming
all over the world and there's portals
appearing you know by places of interest
landmarks post office part of our Mina's
things like that museums and where these
portals are people go and capture the
portal they drop down devices to make it
their own and then you link other
portals together and create big fields
basically to try to harness the minds
that are maybe being corrupted maybe not
that's a part of part of the game the
one group of people called the
enlightened think that this new energy
is good and it's the next you know its
evolutionary human race it's good for
the humans and the resistance says hold
on wait a second this has changed in
humanity you know we don't want to do
this so you choose a faction choose a
side and it's a global game that is you
know real time you can chat with people
in your region and your and your locally
and in work with people you really have
to work with people locally especially
when you start to grow your your fields
your your grid when you want to take
over more territory you have to work
with people in the next town over you
know the next region over as your you
know portals get bigger and bigger so
it's fun to play um I think Jeff is
playing it right now or somebody or
somebodies playing better job ended up
just I just heard Josh get some XM's
he's leveling right now yeah god but
yeah it's fun um and you know what it's
gonna get you some exercise or spend gas
depending on which way you do it you
know but you know you're not really
allowed to drive and look at your phone
it's legal a lot of states yeah
so uh get caught so right now it's
invite only you can request an invite
from anger scom you can you know maybe
wait a week or so or more depending on
you know how many people are signing up
for this game some people are getting
invites early some people are still
waiting and waiting and waiting other
people are getting very creative and
asking for invites and special ways on
google+ in other they're they're getting
recognized by Googlers that are handing
out invites and you know they're making
a copies artwork or there are cool
graphic or they're telling a neat story
to invoke interest in the game and in
various Googlers are then giving them
invites for for their participation and
also for helping the hashtag continue to
trend so so they're getting invites that
way but if you aren't lucky enough if
you're not talented enough to do artwork
you're not creative enough to we're just
lazy we have the solution for you we
have a handful codes to give away for
ingress we're going to give away to this
week and we're going away to next week
and maybe to the week after or so we're
keep tuning in to the show if you don't
win tonight so I'm gonna defer to Jeff
here my buddy that is going to hook you
guys up with the first code now later in
the show we're going to give away
another code so if you don't win this
code now don't worry keep watching keep
paying attention you might want to open
up your ingress app now you might want
to get to the section where it says
enter your passcode and we'll give you a
few seconds you like I said if you don't
win this code we're gonna later in the
show we're going to give you another
chance to win your ingress invite and
then if you do win please let us know
let us know in the comments here on
YouTube if you're watching there if
you're watching all hopefully on Google+
we can interact with you let us know
there that you won the code and how
awesome Jeff is and all that good stuff
so so Jeff we ready ready alright so so
what so so take take over to take
control dry for a second alright so
basically I'm going to read out the coat
and the first one to successfully enter
it wins it um so how long is the code
what's that how long is the code
Cody is way seven characters long oh the
suspense is killing me okay son to the
first code is is a case sensitive it's
not case-sensitive you can enter it does
alphanumeric it's alphanumeric i'm gonna
read out letters like alpha for a Bravo
for be um so I'm not gonna read them out
just like that so first code is whiskey
bravo kilo-alpha x-ray Victor Charlie
Juliet have at it do do do not do so uh
any chance you'll get a code that's like
12 to 4 1 2 3 4 have we exhausted all
those options already yeah those codes
have went away the first day I'll tell
you what uh what uh there was a thread
on google+ about a week ago where codes
are being given out and man to fight
fight for those codes was tough I I
tried all night long and then get one
but I eventually got one from sharing it
an android with the ingress logo on his
on his chest and and I i guess i was
craving hough to get fingers invite i've
been playing ever since all right so
while we're waiting uh guys are guys are
requesting it to be repeated alright
repeater i said just also do it again in
case you missed it is whiskey bravo
kilo-alpha x-ray Victor Charlie Juliet
that's Juliette with a J crap I thought
I was doing it with an R oh that's a
great comment what is in ingress it what
are it is an ingress so alright so
either one the code is bad or you're not
you're not typing it incorrectly or Jeff
messed up which it could be Jeff it
could be jeff's full
yes I don't think it's Jeff oh my god
yeah ok if it's uh if it's already used
up I mean yeah its shape is it does not
work for you then somebody already got
it some money oh yeah it's it's a
one-time code so one person out there
one viewer is going to get the code it's
gonna be the first one who enters it so
chances are somebody already snagged
because that was a brand new code that
has never been used so congrats to the
be lucky winner let us know you are so
weak bursa it let us know you are so we
can high-five you virtually enjoy the
resistance because it's situation join
you evil aura stones haha or
enlightenment you know whatever if you
do another giveaway later it's nice yeah
yeah so I so continuing on let's talk
about another app here so uh sign engine
mods Apollo music app was released to
the Play Store beginning of the week
last week or this week I'm sorry on
monday is in the Apollo app is
cyanogenmod open source music app and up
until recently it was only available
through cyanogenmod and they said well
you know this app is awesome it should
be available to anybody they don't have
to root their phone to be able to use it
they don't have to be running a CM rom
to use it let's make it available to the
Play Store so they did and it was a hit
and then it was removed later in the
week and the developer released a
statement saying hey just to let those
if you notice that the Apollo and the
Apollo plus a poor no longer available
in the Play Store musicmatch filed a
complaint and had them removed for
alleged copyright infringement due to
the way that Apollo fetches song lyrics
the developers currently says he's
looking into the best way to handle this
and he'll try to get it back up there as
soon as possible that's only knows for
now so hopefully he can get that
resolved and get it back up there was
nice to have a nice you know open source
music Apple they're available for people
to get that aren't rock and CM currently
can I ask something real quick yeah this
is just just to you guys do any of you
use music locally on your phone or does
everybody stream
Pandora Google Play sometimes I cash it
um like depending on if i want to or not
but i have about three albums or the
equivalent to that many songs cached on
my phone i still consider that cloud
based up yeah cuz it's cash from for me
the big thing is I really like Apollo
and I like how it looks and I like how
it functions and i've been using see him
for a while but if Google's never going
to open up a music API then then that
makes it dead on arrival for me makes
Apollo yes I agree completely well um I
hope it doesn't this is the unofficial
music API that allows you but yea I'd
love to see something Google just go and
get up I used the app a few times when
it first came out and CM roms like both
of our ICS c n9 i guess there's one when
it first came out and I used it then for
a little bit though that's cool but wait
a second I have no music locally anymore
it's all on haha through google music
and then since then I've been removing
the CM bloatware as i like to call it
every single time i flash new nightly
I'd go in the first thing I did was
remove Apollo the second thing I removed
with browser and the second thing i
removed was Trey vishay I didn't want
those apps and I'll use them so i
deleted them every time i flashed new
night um it's a great app but it's
useless to me like you said josh i have
all my music in the cloud but through
google so that's it's no point of you
having it yeah so they'll asleep but you
know not everybody has clap yeah maybe
they live in an area with edge only and
they need to download all of their their
music locally edges player to stream
music you know what then it was on the
way home today from from breezewood
until i lost service you want the next
five of course no service is not
sufficient to stay just lost I lost
service and you want five or six songs
played it was great I loved it and I'm
sufficient to stream it but then i
looked at my galaxy nexus beside me and
I and I looked at my speed test on the
4g LTE that got 18 you know Meg
down and I looked at my nexus 4 in the
other hand that had zero service and a
little part of me died is this but
that's a ranch relay didn't show if we
have dinner yeah it's just interesting
to be like I I totally agree with what
you're saying but like if we look at
sample sizes and people who only use
music locally who are also using cm10 so
they can use Apollo like I feel like
streaming in google music google play
music is is kind of a power user thing
which is also kind of a what a person
who flashes does so yeah I kind of get
torn up like well if you're using music
local you're probably not using google
play music anyways you probably still
using cents on your phone or something
like that alright so one last app here
then we'll move on to some more exciting
stuff if you are an Amazon shopper and
you wanted a better tablet experience
now you have that the Amazon mobile app
it was updated to a really nice tablet
UI actually it makes shopping easier if
you wanted to use the tablet UI for for
shopping there you go so uh so Scott
tell us about some devices some
interesting information I just proposed
reduction what somebody on YouTube does
say that they nab the code no I
apologize in advance I butcher this name
looks like oh hey kale um we'll just say
okay actually the initials are okay so
congrats okay um via we are glad we're
glad you want o + watchers who aren't
seeing somebody in the comments so it
really did clay that it wasn't a fake
code with rigorous the Amazon mobile I
complained about it and two days later
they change it so you know I move us
forward guys thank you Scott you're very
appreciative somebody has to and I'm
glad you took that role your job is not
even though Google would prefer that you
used google shopper squad sorry nah you
keep you know doing things like that
you're gonna redeem yourself from that
Nexus back door thing the other week oh
we're talking about like a blacked out
alright so let's talk about some devices
okay Galaxy Nexus ya q android for dot
to November 20th began rolling out over
the air and you can also manually
download it as a factory much for the
OTA update you can own you can apply
that VA TB side load if you didn't get
it yet you know and you're waiting to
get it ok and then with regards to LTE
that was rumored for a long time the
nexus 4 does have some type of LTE
support it supports LTE on AWS Canadian
LTT providers right now are able to get
it some carriers in south and Latin
America and t-mobile a thousand thirteen
metro pcs and Verizon um also AT&amp;amp;T there
are there are a couple markets I believe
that they are running that uh the Bell I
think they were behind on rolling out
AWS there and then they failed to buy a
tmobile and had to pay them five billion
dollars and a crapload of AWS spectrum
right which is all that just by AT&amp;amp;T is
not doing anything with the remaining
AWS mobile is going to put their LTE
there a metro pcs already has ltd there
but alongside a cdma backbone that's not
gonna help you with the nexus 4 and
horizon has some that they may or may
not use to put LTE on down the road um
but again you've got to see the my
problem and they have no like immediate
plans to use that spectrum so so the big
thing about this is is we slow in in the
eye fix a teardown is that it was
lacking a amplifier so how how how well
does it actually work I wonder work I
wonder do you have to have great signal
for it to work if you think so if you
move outside of the four-bar range let's
say and you're down to like the one bar
range is it going to be 0 service you
know what I mean like how well is it
that's definitely a frame the hell out
of your battery oh yeah yeah anything
also doesn't have a date I would be a
lie fa it might be a long
jig it does have a dedicated antenna for
it either so it's kind of bleaching
around the hspa+ that's an essay bad and
you God also remember which I'm sure it
doesn't really affect too many people
watching this but it's a it's actually
illegal to do since it's not a ratified
banda unity to use regulators actually
care about that but no no no I'm not
saying they're gonna come knock on your
door or anything in Canada not me I
don't think any Mounties are gonna come
in a knock on your door but listen we're
doing you know we were doing tomorrow
there's some some frequency scans here
we noticed an unregistered device in the
Vista your house was you know using a an
LTE service from an unknown young to my
room yeah I don't think that's gonna
happen but yeah as we're saying yeah I
mean your battery's gonna probably
suffer and you I'm just assuming you
move far enough away from the from the
tower and you know you're not gonna yeah
yeah you're not gonna you're gonna lose
service no obviously I don't know this
and matches my assumption I could be
talking out my but not talking about do
not yours and see how long your battery
lasts well first I got to go visit cali
wsl TV around now I wonder um would
carriers at all be able to sense that
you're doing it Oh or it I mean you by
the data pole I guess they could whoa
this is pulling way faster than our
typical Network polls um it'd be
difficult for them to isolate that if
they weren't looking for it okay um
nexus 4 went on sale on tmobile their
webpage and what yeah and it sold out
hours after the google play store yes
and so so Google said hey we don't have
it for sale but we know somebody who
does and they link to it and then
deep-fried butter took the f5 button
took over and t-mobile skoda they are
the really bizarre thing I don't know
what the status was of their online
sales but like here in Austin only two
stores even got inventory on the launch
day so I mean it kind of calls into
question like that
inventory it sounds like they did not
anticipate the demand but I mean yeah
what I called this this t-mobile place
in Frisco and said hey do you guys have
any in stock and they actually said yes
I said well can you hold one for me i'll
be there in 15 minutes and I said well
or selling out pretty quick so you need
to get here immediately yeah it's
somebody's gonna buy it in 15 minutes
before I can get there look this is
ridiculous so one of the users in the
comments just said they heard i fix it
was wrong and the amplifier was actually
there under the heatsink OLG actually
came out and said that it's missing the
filter and the amplifier so I'm not sure
if that's accurate it's no it is
definitely not there it's not hidden
under they take it all they didn't put
it in because it's expensive and you
know you got to lose some things like an
expensive amplifier if you want to sell
at three hundred dollar device and you
know the in the whole reason that it
does have this limited support is
because it's virtually the same bored
it's in the optimus G they always so if
you're going to stamp out boards you're
not going to make it you're trying to
save money you're not going to give a
whole new schematics only design you're
going to use one that but the least
amount of changes as possible to save
money that's that's most likely what
happened or you can go there conspiracy
theory and say in a year from now you'll
be able to use it on tmobile you know I
would be honest put on your tinfoil hats
right now you know the waiting game
begins again um HTC droid DNA or the
dicks dicks DLX um Josh we refer to it
as the HTC dicks for the longest time
the Dei acts the DLX you know I said we
have so many acronyms for that's crazy
um let it was unlocked prior to its
release the unlocker was pulled at the
device launched and now it is community
unlocked now so basically the unlock
that's out there for it you know you
through some Android hackery it you can
fake it to be a different device
basically
you doin aight you do you do anything
you do a some android hacker ethos may t
be command a TB restore and you can then
trick the device into being able to be
unlocked through it doesn't actually say
on the HTC dev com it doesn't say you
know droid DNA it says uh when other
unsupported devices right it can now be
unlocked through the other end okay okay
so it's similar to what they did with
the AT&amp;amp;T one x where they spoofed it
into being a rogers 1x and then unlock
it that way right i think that's still
possible like HTC hasn't shut that down
uh I like shutting down SS yet you
thought it back door bitch slap at the
carriers that could be true yeah so we
actually have a comment talk about the
samsung galaxy s4 eight-core processor
that's coming out because oh so odd we
have that actually slated but uh coming
up right now quince identity obsidian
what Dan being our resident hardware
guru what do you think about that rumor
yeah i mean it's it's people say eight
core cpu and you think oh my god a
course that's fantastic the part that
you don't notice what that is that's
eight cores in a big little formation so
it's two clusters of four cores they're
not simultaneously active it's one
relatively lower power and less by which
i made more power efficient but less
actually powerful quad-core ARM
processor that handles menial tasks and
then when you need actual like of it
hands up to a quad-core cortex a15
processor this has a samsung is planning
to announce the chip in the fall by
which they're saying we're gonna have
like the spec together and be ready to
you know kind of talk about how awesome
is going to be not ready to like show it
off in a you know test device review
talk about how awesome it's gonna be
down the road so people wondering about
this being in the s4 not even a remote
chance in hell if i don't know real
thing
I would think I'm tablet before phone
yet the only cortex a15 that they can
build it all right now is in the nexus
10 had the new Chromebook and it's in
those devices and not phones because
they can't get the powerful print loan
out to put it in phones and that's not
going to change anytime soon adding two
more cores and then for more on top of
that isn't going to fix that problem for
them and make that more phone friendly
though they'll target these these big
little a core processors for tablets and
for servers probably couldn't the
diffuse like last year's course and
potato them together yeah I guess they
weren't as efficient as the ones are now
oh yeah just yeah so the smaller set of
course would not even be comparable to
like a 9 the sort of previous generation
it's a small one i think it's a 5
actually which is a smaller in terms of
power and output processor but it's a
good you know sort of well refined
specification that's very efficient and
used in a lot of other things it's just
didn't be a pretty similar thing to what
in videos doing with the Tegra 3 right
now it is similar in concept yes so the
big.little architecture kind of stay
after stud I mean that the quorum stills
aren't inherently efficient but it's a
race to idle configuration which that
you get the task done you drop down to
the low power footprint quicker and then
switch to the lower power processor to
Eidolon so those of you that didn't get
a nexus 10 um it's actually available in
play store right now the 16 gig and 32
gig became available the other day I
thought you said Nexus 4 and I was about
to go there no but uh they speak indexes
for the winner was announced earlier in
the week for the the Tyler Idol members
name and write it down Tyler something
so congrats Tyler something on winning
the nexus 4 is it Tyler realizing him
from fight club yeah but so said yeah so
he won the device and speaking of
giveaways and so forth we're gonna get
to that nexus 10 giveaway details here
in a little bit but first let's talk
about some carrier information dan
so t-mobile as you mentioned is
spreading their hspa+ on the iPhone
friendly pcs fans that's the 1900
megahertz I until recently t-mobile has
just had edge on this and so I phone
users who are skirting away from AT&amp;amp;T
and going to tmobile have been pretty
much just stuck on that that particular
band what parole the edge Dan I mean
nothing from you all up your end of that
sort of thing it's but they have been
working to roll out hspa+ and this is
the same dual channel 42 mega bed that
they have on their AWS spectrum so
they've been working to spread that
which means that iphones on their
network will be capable of much much
faster data speeds than iphones without
LTE on agencies network um so they're
adding another ten metro areas mostly in
California Arizona and Florida and
they're also planning a lot more to come
soon including I think Los Angeles and
Chicago and New York where basically
what they're doing is letting out the
hspa+ and then doing a lot of testing
and then making sure they're ready to
actually say it's official and then
making a press release about it so
people right now in New York and LA and
Chicago and a lot of other places are
probably already getting these pastors
beings so great for them I mean it's
still not LTE but it's gonna put tmobile
in much stronger position when they go
to aldi and then everything everywhere
the t-mobile UK and I think it's orange
a sort of joint venture the one and only
LTE carrier in the UK right now they
finally gone live with their LTE and we
finally got some actual speed test back
out of it let's be comparable to about
where verizon's wasn't watch where
you're getting peaks in the mid 20s and
higher ah so it's it's definitely about
double the speed of the hspa+ carriers
in the UK right now so I can you Jonas
is not as fast as wet everything
everywhere is saying it's going to be
and it's still pretty patchy so where
you get coverage from it it's pretty
good but there's still a lot of places
where you just don't get
there's still a lot of places in the UK
where they're only getting edge yeah I
mean that's true too people are probably
surprised with how well it's doing
indoors because it is on a higher
frequency so it should theoretically it
should not penetrate walls as easily as
a lower frequency like we're safer
eisner 18 tease ltd ends but they've
been getting really really great test
results indoors so good for the UK and
so yeah in addition to the ingress good
ways we're also giving away a code for
nexus 10 Scott's going to talk about
that giveaway hopefully I don't butcher
this time oh we made it a code that you
could not mess up this time just ok just
let you guys know the code is not back
door um and we use a doc to look over
the notes for the show and the code is
in size 64 font oh did you did you make
it bigger sake you wouldn't mess it up
alright so was it so uh ok so we're
giving away a Galaxy Nexus 10 Nexus 10
we're not giving away in that galaxies
oh my god i butchered every single time
calm down calm down okay nexus 10 give
it away internationally so everybody can
join in on the fun it is a gigabyte
nexus 10 wondering yes it's a system
where we're gonna revoke your contest I
agree privileges your content privileges

rafflecopter and you can get points I
doing certain things 14 points in total
doing things like tweeting about the
contest subscribing to the YouTube page
following them on google+ plus one in
the page
you can actually get two chances to win
from using the code that we're going to
give away here tonight and then another
two chances to win from the code will go
away next week and is it going to be a
completely different code so don't enter
it twice it won't count okay so holding
it lots and lots of chances to wet ok so
the code for this week is going to be
ingress i ng r e SS ok good job Scott
alright so the code is ingress for the
16 gig Nexus 10 giveaway on let's
continue on here for for routing and
ramen this week I said we had some sneak
peek information from the CM team over
the past few days and they've been
posting on google+ and I teasing you
know what what they have done so far so
the theme engine for 10.1 which is
Android 4.2 has been updated and it's up
and running and we have seen screenshots
for the galaxy tab to the galaxy s the i
9000 the galaxy w the Sprint Galaxy
Nexus so sprint galaxy nexus users you
haven't been forgotten about the
transformer prime the epic 4g it's still
kickin the galaxy tab 10.1 and we also
saw a screenshot for the galaxy s2
running cm 10.1 so those devices
obviously there's going to be plenty
plenty more running cm 10.1 but right
now we've seen leaks for those so as
well you know keep us interested is it
just me or does CM seem to have
something of a samsung bias since I
wonder what is one of their developers
went to work for sams haha yeah I think
bootloaders help to a tail yeah I
definitely but you don't see the the
nexus 4 you don't see so yeah but well
obviously the next ever gonna work you
know obviously the galaxy
Nexus is going to work you know they're
posting devices that don't normally get
a lot of love right away that's at least
what I think we keep our way o SP for
nexus for yet right father they're
merging is it totally in well just have
the prop files which you can rip off the
device you can just rip them off the
device yeah I mean you can do it wrong
without you know without the binaries
people were already doing it stop stop
doing that stop ruining the device right
and so uh that's really it for reading
and ramen this week I mean I you know
apps have been updated to Ted unlock the
bootloader if you're a point-and-click
type person and you know you need to
point and click to unlock your
bootloader on the Nexus 10 or the Nexus
4 and you need to put a custom recovery
on it you don't know how apps have been
updated this past week fully working
with custom recovery and all that good
stuff but really yeah not nothing major
this week in my opinion so what sort of
sicken it these cribs if anybody wants
to Tevin a lot i'm on to google drive
for you Oh in it and it d arnot dot T
both okay alright so let's talk about
some uh some carrier news dan also known
as Dan's whiny time you ain't Pat Morris
yeah um so more details about the HTC
Apple licensing agreement have come out
for one thing HT n seek very much
vehemently denied the idea that they're
paying six to eight dollars per device
and suggested that that was outrageous
and ridiculous so they're definitely
paying something less than that we still
don't know what that amount kids there
was also recently an article on foss
patents that said that as part of that
agreement both parties were giving up
all their claims against each other with
prejudice and that is not true HTC is
giving up all their claims with
prejudice which means basically HTC is
backing out of all of their claims
against Apple without leave to file them
again later in contrast apple is
releasing their claims without prejudice
so if Apple chooses to they can decide
to sue
HTC again for all the same stuff again
later so you know that's probably
something that HTC decided to just eat
because they're getting it you know a
licensing agreement that pretty much
prevents them from getting sued in that
fashion and they're getting it for less
than six to eight dollars to device Soho
considering Apple is asking 30 to 40 for
these patents sounds like HTC is getting
away with a steal on this um more on
that same agreement though Samsung is
going to get to see an unredacted copy
complete with all of the dollar amounts
and the specific patents that are
included they've seen a redacted version
previously that was cut down by Apple to
a whopping 33 words the entire agreement
33 words were not blacked out ah but
Apple has been claiming that not only do
they need the 1 billion dollars that the
jury awarded that they need the judge to
triple those damages and they need the
judge to ban all of Samsung's devices
they've been saying that they need all
of these things because just the money
monetary damages aren't enough to make
us whole because we would we have would
never ever ever dream of licensing these
patents they're too important to us and
the day after they filed that the news
broke that they'd signed this licensing
agreement with HTC so pretty clearly
they are willing to license those things
and that really really undermines their
entire argument for banning import of
Samsung's devices after the big you know
their big loss so that's that's not
shaping up good for Apple um and then in
sampling an apples other case in
California both parties are trying to
add a bunch of more devices into it we
saw recently Apple was able to add the
the jelly gain running Galaxy Nexus
they're now trying to add the jelly bean
running galaxy s3 along with the new to
the sgs3 mini and the tab too I mean
while Samsung forget to add the ipad
mini and the new new ipad so basically
every mobile device that Apple makes is
is added on their side and just about
every mobile device that samsung cells
in the u.s. is on their list is that the
official title the new new iPad the iPad
Mini right
didn't have no they are smaller just the
new I've had again the smaller I Paul
laundry name like five yeah yeah
starting to sound like an Android device
now you don't know what though I heard
somebody say when I was out and about
the other day they asked what phone that
i had and i said i had the nexus 4 and
they said oh why I'm gonna get the
iphone 5 because it's the it's the five
it's you know better than a 40 I was
like well I mean tech really i'm
thinking i was like well I mean
technically if you're going by number
I'm not as high earnings by some call it
the 47 million beat that I mean
technically they're right that five is
larger than I don't know if that makes
it any that's right that's how I was
like I mean um kinda like the ones do so
good because it was the iphone fourth
i'm gonna have 4g yeah yeah that a year
ago everybody thought they had 4g on
their iphone yeah apple's entire
business model works on that whole idea
people even bigger the bigger model
number is better yeah that's how this
mozilla all is this multi they get away
with that though Jeff when they start
when they came out with you know the new
iPad the new new way you know you'll the
fall room didn't yeah nobody nobody knew
what to call it is it the ipad 3 it's
not the ipad 3 it's a new ipad whatever
well now you can walk into the apple
store and always say is that the new
ipad they say yes and you just buy it
great because it's always in your life
always the new ipad brilliant please
you've got six ipad fours they're all
the same and each one is better than the
next i started selling ipad 2 is it full
cost of the new new ipad yeah what yeah
and then they shrink it down and call it
the mini right I'm charged almost as
much I'm saying in stores right that'd
be fun yeah fill in more apple patent
litigation um so google / Motorola and
Apple are apparently considering binding
arbitration to resolve all of their
friend patent issues
but apple's terms for this art have been
pretty ridiculous they're basically
saying we want to have binding
arbitration that's going to bind your
patents but only on the condition that
we can keep seeing you for everything
else and none of our things are actually
gonna be part of the discussion to which
Google more or less respond but hey
we're happy to talk about arbitration
but we actually want to you know
arbitrate the whole problem not just you
know this little piece of it that's
going to make it easier for you to come
after us in other directions later cuz
that's pretty much what happen was
trying to do with elemental the fran
issues so they can continue to go after
google and all the other android makers
on design and utility patents i think
apple is i don't know they live in their
own reality they very much do live in
their own reality and continuing that
that theme um in more apple vs motorola
issues google suppose be able to review
some of apple's source code more or less
decide whether or not they believe
certain things are infringing on certain
patents and there's a pending deadline
for file and coming up in december so
not just a few weeks now and goo our
apple apparently has been withholding
that code from that which for for
legally minded people that's basically
the same thing as withholding evidence
right they are legally obligated to
provide this discovery material to
opposing counsel and they're refusing to
do so that's the sort of thing that can
get lawyers held in contempt of court
right like this is not smart legal
strategy by Apple this is more of the
same crap that they pulled in the UK
that got judges very very angry at them
very very quickly so I don't know who at
Apple is running their legal department
that somebody should remind them the
pissing off judges is not a good way to
win cases it's well it's been working
for them so far right so they're so just
like oh that just say okay uh whatever
you say by all means continue yes when
you had your creditor or early I can't
remember the name of the other one who
say no really even if we let this go
forward there's not actually any remedy
other than you sitting around whining
like a little girl so get out of my
courtroom
like I said alternate reality Apple
right yes somebody make that a meme go
we can make a game out of that too so we
were like is it s'alright so I want to
see somebody make a lost mashup with
Apple go what season not quite patent
news apparently the german federal
Environment agent and save just I guess
they're kind of vpa is calling for a ban
on sealed batteries and cell phones it's
basically non removable batteries for
environmental reasons basically the big
issue is they're very difficult to
recycle people you know replace their
phone every two years and if it doesn't
have a removable battery the phone just
goes in the trash lithium-ion batteries
really ought not go into the trash
that's that's not good so that's the
like the razr maxx the lot for the
iphones yeah yeah yeah and when they say
BAM we aren't really talking about the
same kind of ban as you know injunction
sales bands we're more talking like this
is going to affect regulations on how
those sorts of phones after you've built
this but it's going to probably have to
become easier for the backs to come off
and for those non removable batteries to
be removed I don't see how that's any
different than having a removable
battery right if you're going to make a
non removable back still difficult to
remove but less difficult right we
should just make it more easily
removable I'm curious I mean so the onus
is on the person who owns the device to
recycle it right there's recycling bins
at best buy and Verizon and t-mobile do
you do that I just throw them in the
garbage I've never actually thrown away
cellphone know what Jeff I care about my
environment so I bought a package get
the risin okay all right if you are you
ever recycled motor oil yeah I do i I'd
see it's not feasible well I don't
change my own oil uh in situations where
people dude you got to haul a big glob
of all the way up town to resign right
don't live in the country like you and I
that's true but ya know even when you
live in suburbia if you're changing your
own oil you still gotta drive across
town to somewhere you can recycle
yeah yo just have a longer version
dotting partner because you're in spurts
come on you little bit yes yes like
we're gonna be if you only had a car you
gonna stick it in your trunk and just
towed it up that no right cuz it's gonna
spell one that's not up to it all
disappears from the ng on the word goes
you know oh so back to this battery
thing on the you know I think we got off
on a tangent but I mean do you think
that this is the potential to you know
actually start affecting the way the
manufacturers are designing their phones
to the point that we reverse the trend I
mean I'd removable batteries I think it
depends on sort of where Germany goes
with it if they affect it as more or
less a hard man where you can't sell
their product here unless has a
removable battery it's definitely an
effect changes because nobody's gonna
make a German device and then a rest of
the world device sure oh they're just
not gonna make a German device all right
that's a fair point it's not a big
enough market to swing that right so the
only I mean the only reason the only way
that that would have any impact as if
Jeremy persuade the entire EU to adopt
the same policies yeah if if Germany
doing it forces the entire economic
community that is new to do the same
thing that will definitely force a
change sure what are the benefits that
we've seen from having on removable
batteries a lot of people say that you
know it gives us like thinner phones and
stuff like that you can get a thinner
phone or you can get a larger battery
without sacrificing having a thicker
phone okay okay well I wouldn't mind a
little bit of thicker phone if I could
swap some bad Rancic yeah and not some
things that you can make batteries in
very irregular shapes right being able
to come out of the device the other one
seemed a big build quality and that's
really a decision based on what the
manufacturers do because they put flimsy
plastic doors instead of something
that's a little bit more starting I've
seen high quality backs that arm yeah
sure I just not them not really the
status quo unfortunately but well
looking at like the HTC DNA the droid
DNA is that the one that's got the
battery right behind the display like
that so that they've changed the order
of the parts oh yeah likin that gave
Adam is pretty challenging because their
site in the back in the battery right so
then that kind of you know I can see how
it opens up
this entire can of worms but I'm curious
to see because it's difficult Nexus 4 2
because when we pull them back off it's
got a whole mess of antennas attached to
it right speaking of the nexus 4 battery
man this battery rocks i just had to
toss that out there oh my goodness it's
leaps and bounds better than the garret
houses how does your battery lasts on
edge what I'll tell you what I have a
segment of the show reserved for me for
a five minute anytime as Dan calls it so
I'll talk about it in a minute but let's
get to the part everybody's waiting for
and let's let's move on and get to the
ingress giveaway number to Jeff and then
I'll get to my whiny time how about that
okay so this time I'm going to ask a
question it's actually a pretty easy
question you're gonna have to go to the
android authority google+ page and your
ghosts refer little in the original post
yep the first person to correctly answer
the question i will send you the code in
a private post alright so let's give
everybody a second if you're watching on
YouTube to find it so it's google com /
+ android authority all in word so if
you're watching on YouTube that's where
you go to view it if you're viewing on
my stream Scott's or somebody else's
that happen to share this make sure you
go to the android authority post that
had the original post so that way you
are participating in the same comments
that we're watching we're not watching
any other comments so do do do everybody
should be on your way there yadda yadda
yadda okay so you should be there when
out right and that's fast enough okay
all right Jeff without further ado what
is your what is your question for the
ingress code the question is what was
the first commercially available android
device who's going to be a father that
was that was a harrowing silence after
you finish the question everybody waited
with bated breath seal in case people
having streaming issues Dean hear it
again the question is what was the first
commercially available and star Aaron
star congratulations the g1 also known
as the HTC dream
that's right way to go Aaron star you're
gonna get an ingress you invite all
right so Jeff is going to private
message you on google+ and give you your
code let us know if it if it is if it
works for you please and or if it
doesn't work as well alright so while
you're getting your code let's go to
Derek's whiny time cuz I've had a bunch
of questions about it so uh trying to
spend too much time in this live first I
want to talk about my Nexus 7 sadly my
nexus 7 died um it died thanksgiving day
i had plugged it in the night before
because it was it was dead actually i
used it now that afternoon until it died
and I I plugged it in when I got home
let it charge all night my left did
thanksgiving pre-thanksgiving stuff came
home next morning woke up unplugged it
went to turn it on and wouldn't turn on
huh that's weird I was like well this
happened to me recently before I let it
charge overnight and actually did in
charge so I plugged it back in hit the
power button and it turned on but it did
wasn't a normal you know Google logo
that I saw I wasn't the Nexus boot
animation I saw a black screen with a
bunch of snow on it like seeing a
sparkling flashing and after after a few
minutes yeah after a few minutes the the
device actually booted and as soon as I
saw the unlock screen it shut back down
and rinse and repeat it went all snowy
for a few minutes oh I'm sorry whenever
it shut down every single color of the
rainbow was visible across my screen in
a mad dash of flashing frenzy and it
hissed and made a pop did you ran it
hissed and made a pop it happen is it
possess I'll tell you what I actually do
have a video it's not the greatest
because I was so so I'll get down a
minute so I mess with a little bit more
thought well you know what something's
really bad but I have the factory images
downloaded so let me go ahead and try to
flash them I tried to get into the
bootloader by pressing the power and
volume buttons and that didn't work so I
unplugged it plugged it back in try to
press the power buttons and nothing
you know the bootloader the Google
screen never actually appears so I can't
actually get into the bootloader it just
immediately starts booting up you know I
see the nexus logo so after a few times
with it doing that and me trying
everything under the Sun to get into
fastboot mode I realized it it was
probably a hardware issue and I called
google play and they picked up right
away I talked a very nice guy there by
the name a lance he's very helpful
they're sending me a new Nexus 7 and
probably here um I'm I'm betting I'm
Monday or Tuesday depending on shipping
I got a shipping notification the next
year free oh yeah yeah it's so it's
advanced RMA so that means I give them a
credit card they charge me well they put
two hundred dollars on hold they hold
two hundred bucks and then I they send
me a new one I get an RMA number which i
already printed out and a free shipping
tag and I put that on the box and ship
it to them they're shipping center looks
at it and says yep he didn't smash this
down the steps or yep it's you know
looks like he physically damaged it but
obviously I didn't so they're going to
credit me the two hundred bucks once
they get it and realized it you know it
wasn't my fault that the device bro they
even actually have to analyze advice
they just keep the hold until they
receive it well that's what that's what
he told him he told me they're gonna
look at it make sure there's no physical
damage the device and if it looks like
it was the devices fault and not my own
then I'll get my 200 bucks back though
they'll release the hold and the funds
yeah yeah yeah so they actually in
charge money it's just you know there's
a hold on 200 bucks which which is it is
fair because I'm sure somebody could
drop their device and break it and send
it to him say oh I didn't break it it
broken incentive me don't you you know
every RMA I've dealt with for the past
10 years in the IT industry does this
Yul's not doing anything out of the
ordinary hand all the big guys do it
every month workman is if you they send
you a new one before you send your
broken one back yeah but but that's
because they tacked only charged me two
hundred all for it so yeah yeah but but
either way are they have to wait three
weeks yeah yeah so only I'm gonna get it
monday or tuesday uh I'll check my
shipping information but yeah so here it
is it unfortunately does not does not
work but anyway so I did make a video a
test yeah not i can use if her drop test
no I I did do a video of Phil I was
filming it as I was actually on the
phone with the representative and he he
put me on hold for a minute while he
entered some information and I was doing
a quick video and I didn't finish the
video because he came back to tell me
they're going to replace it so uh it's
like a minute not even a minute long
i'll post it later so you can look at
it's not very professional so anyways so
that's my nexus 7 story now i have an x
4 story but i'll try to cut it short
here cuz we're running out of time um so
yeah I had a nexus 7 for a little over a
week now and for not I'm sorry Nexus 4
for a little over a week now and the big
thing for me was I was not going to get
it because I have horrible horrible
horrible gsm coverage here it's a
verizon dominated area the gsm here is
basically like an island with verizon
surrounding it is the sea in that's just
how it is um but I thought unfortunately
you know I have this shirt that says
android on this hat has android on all
this android stuff back behind me and
all that stuff overpowered me the my
fanboy ism to buy the device and test it
out anyways um I found out my voice
coverage is pretty much the same as
verizon when I have one bar I can't make
a phone call when I have one bar and
Verizon I can make a phone call it's
great on my galaxy nexus I don't need
full signal um data yeah edge is slow
four bars of it hey but you know what I
could play ingress on four bars of edge
and I can post on Google+ and interact
on google+ it's a little slower but for
full bars of edge is doable it's like
one bar of 3g so it's not bad um I think
edge goes up to 170 k doesn't I did it
because I than that but not a lot yeah
it's not yeah it's not the greatest um I
I don't know I I did speed tests at work
where I have hspa+ i'm on a tease
network with straight talk and and i
have HSPA at work and i did a speedtest
and I was getting between three and six
meg down coming over um that was with
for four bars you know it written you
know sometimes I get
you know but then don't average was
between three and six you know and
that's really slow compared to what I'm
used to then the next day I was in
another town that had hspa+ and I did it
all i'm sorry i did a speedtest on my
galaxy nexus on verizon's LTE and i got
nine down so it was those you know three
times as fast or depending on we know
the results so it was a lot faster but
that was okay no 36 is fast enough from
the majority of stuff I want to do I was
able to stream a video and you know
whatever that's fine and then the next
day I was in a different town that has
hspa+ and I got 17 down with verizon LTE
and I got one down with hspa+ and a
little part part of me died and then
today when I went to to drive to meet
Dan on the way down i noticed i had
because i was being safe in my car and
doing a speed test i noticed i had a you
know i had four bars of LTE is like oh
let's do a speedtest got got 18 Meg down
picked up my nexus 4 to do a comparable
test oops no service you know that was
that was sad um um well I was on gee
maybe no just cheap I'm still not sure
what I'm gonna do i mean i have my
variety might technically my verizon
contract runs out in the month so i have
a month to figure out what i want to do
I don't know what I'm gonna do yet if
I'm going to stay with the phone and
other phones amazing I mean it's the
build quality is great i absolutely love
it it feels great my hand it's it's so
much lighter than one used to mean it
don't know III love holding it it's a
great phone it's an amazing phone it's
probably best friend of our own dumb I
said I i love this thing and it's it's
great it's really going to be really
hard to give up something i love but if
i can't use it to its fullest i don't
know i'm trying to find more Wi-Fi you
know i'm using Wi-Fi more than i used to
use so we'll see what happens um you
know in another week maybe i'll come
back and say yeah I decided I can't do
it especially you know when verizon's
look into complete der LTE network in
about seven months my area right now is
3g i'll probably have LTE in in the next
you know three to six months so no need
Verizon's coverage like because are the
only place that covers you yeah yeah
where I live Verizon's da middle of
nowhere right is
so I got the joy what about the Droid
DNA aligner and slap some cm on it
whenever it's known it and that's what
and that's what I'm really thinking
about but if I get the droid DNA then I
have to renew my verizon contract or
spend 650 bucks so I i don't i don't
know i don't know it's a big decision
and i'm going to go back and forth on at
least six more times before I figure out
what I'm doing because that's that's
what I do so uh you do we could had a
couple questions I want to hit on real
quick on YouTube um so acer chromebook
yeah i mean that's not entirely android
related but scuba relating we're all
Google fans um yeah it's fifty dollars
cheaper than the Samsung counterpart and
has a massive hard drive in it but I
would go for the the the Sami in math
exam song for sure hate Samsung's I'd
still recommend the samsung we actually
had me at two different same guy asked
two questions about that and then
another guy on YouTube asked about would
you say the samsung galaxy note 2 for
sprint would be good I mean the note
tuza the hell of a phone on any carrier
ah yeah he seems like it's a very solid
device is he asking if it's objectively
good or if it's good compared to why you
didn't heard what is it objectively good
matter yeah it's a good phone yeah very
powerful big the one thing you've gotta
take into consideration is how big your
hand is yeah if you want to be a lot of
here you're a hunter found girls yeah
yeah you need to have huge hands but
it's just me a little bit difficult with
smaller hands but I mean if you want the
bigger sign screen it's an awesome phone
for that yeah I'll bake it up with it in
in my last week so I'll it wants to know
something with it yeah yeah don't be one
of those creepy guys going around with
the Bluetooth headset him dang it
talking on cell phones yeah do it or not
on with what and last comment here we
have another youtuber saying that
they're they're basically upset with
this being a biased channel you know
when we talk about android vs apple
we're biased well it's not called smart
phone authority no and I guarantee you
that the people running running 9to5 mac
or anything like that or not objectively
talking about Android you know I mean
it's just a little biased yeah well I
think you're biased when you say things
like Apple stole their notification
system well I just wanted you reckless
litigious course that's outrageous and
unprecedented these are biased
statements these are objective
statements yeah I'm sorry animal fat and
your think you're being slighted by that
but those are objectively favor
statements to make we can what maybe
we'll start next week with a disclaimer
like hey you know disclaimer we like
yeah we like Android so we're gonna say
things that we like about it the end
with the android authority we're going
to bash them for 45 minutes I'd be
curious to uh once the dust settles with
all this news lately happening um get
some iOS people on here and we battle it
out talking about it I think I'd be
interesting sure I've got oh there's
some great people I've got in mind whoo
yes let's do that that's what it sounds
like an interesting conversation haha
