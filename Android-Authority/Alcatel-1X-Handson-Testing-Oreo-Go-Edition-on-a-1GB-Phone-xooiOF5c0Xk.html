everybody and we're here with the
Alcatel 1x now at the version that I'm
using right here is actually the Android
Go edition and it has a lot of
applications inside of this android oreo
edition that are the go additions where
you're able to cater the amount of data
you're actually using and they're also
incredibly light additions of those same
apps but before we get there we're just
taking a look at the phone and we have
this small 5.3 inch display that is an
18 by 9 aspect ratio the full view
display however it does have 960 by 480
resolution so it's definitely a budget
oriented phone kind of speaking to that
more budget mindset you do have a micro
USB port on the bottom but there is a
headphone jack still so obviously a lot
of the basics are going to be covered
here the specification shows 16
gigabytes of on-board storage and only
one gigabyte of ram but but since this
is a go version of Android I do have to
give it some props for still feeling
pretty smooth but of course that is
because of the optimizations made for
just one gigabyte of RAM it's running
the media tech 6739 processor here but
it does have android oreo like I said
after all this is the latest version of
Android go at Android 8.1 there is no
fingerprint sensor on here however the
Alcatel 1x does use face key which is
something that you've seen in all of the
other devices make sure you check out
those videos as well here on the channel
and finally what the camera is depending
on the version that you get of the One X
you could have an 8 megapixel or 13
megapixel camera and on the front facing
camera it's a 5 megapixel shooter there
aren't too many things that are really
special about the camera but it is nice
that it has that kind of power but it
also comes with it the social mode that
allows for photo booth like photos and
also collages we don't really have a
whole lot of connectivity on this phone
but it's easy to see already inside of
the app drawer that there are a bunch of
go versions of apps maps go Google go
and even YouTube go all of which are
going to tell you how much data they are
using and you're able to cater what that
usage is like and it's also a very
lightweight version of these so even
with one gigabyte of RAM you'll still be
able to enjoy YouTube content you're
just going to have to cater it to the
kind of performance that this phone
provides obviously the Alcatel 1x is
more budget minded so anybody out there
is looking to really save some money on
the phone or just need something very
bare-bones in order to do basic things
on Android we'll want to look to the 1x
with all of these go apps so they can
still enjoy the Android ecosystem
without having to spend an arm and a leg
and that was the Alcatel 1x this
Android Go Edition that I was using in
this video let us know what you think
about Android go and what it looks like
on this particular device and let us
know how you feel about this and all of
the different Alcatel phones that we
looked at while we were here in
Barcelona at MWC keep it tuned to
Android Authority and don't forget to
head on over to Andrew authority comm
for all of the best coverage from
Barcelona Spain because we are your
