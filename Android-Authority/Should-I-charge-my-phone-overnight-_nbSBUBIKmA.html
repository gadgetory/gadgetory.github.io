12,000 shares because when it comes to
the age-old question should I leave my
phone plugged in overnight people care
it's a good question should you leave
your phone charged overnight and the
short answer is yes now here's why first
we have to understand the difference
between lithium and nickel based
batteries you're probably aware that the
majority of today's tech runs on lithium
ion batteries years ago batteries were
primarily made of nickel like the
Duracell and energizer batteries you buy
in your dollar stores nickel based
batters exhibit a tendency to have
cyclic memory that means that if they
weren't given full charges between
cycles they might forget their full
capacity and remember the point to which
they were last charged as being their
maximum charge capacity many of us have
never had nickel based batteries on our
mobile devices since the transition to
lithium ion batteries occurred in the
early 2000s fortunately lithium based
batteries didn't suffer from the memory
phenomenon often exhibited in nickel
based batteries lithium batteries played
a major part in the mobile revolution
for one thing they're able to hold a lot
more power while remaining fairly
compact which allowed mobile phones to
become increasingly small and thin also
lithium ion batteries
having much better lifespan and recharge
fairly quickly the one caveat however is
temperature sensitivity now we get to
the most significant threat to your
lithium ion or lithium polymer battery
which is heat granted batteries dislike
the cold just about as much as they
dislike the heat but the latter is much
more relevant when it comes to leaving
your device plugged in overnight the
charging temperature for lithium based
batteries that means the temperature at
which a battery is capable of receiving
a charge is 32 to 113 Fahrenheit
meanwhile lithium based batteries can
discharge a temperature as low as -4
Fahrenheit fast charging technologies
work best at warmer temperatures between
41 and 113 Fahrenheit with no charge
capable of occurring when the
temperature is lower than 32 Fahrenheit
there's a couple important things to
understand
here first a lithium based battery can
discharge at temperatures far below
freezing so keeping them in your freezer
won't prevent them from self charging
though I don't recommend it second a
lithium ion battery warms as it charges
as it gets warmer it charges faster but
since batteries can't hold more than its
capacity after reaching a full charge
the battery expands the excessive power
by giving off its heat overnight
charging becomes a problem when a
battery has no way to reroute the
incoming current after reaching its full
capacity sounds kind of bad for your
phone no well there is a solution to
this problem our mobile devices have
gotten a lot smarter over the years they
can actually stop charging when the
battery has reached its full capacity
and begin using the connected charger as
its primary power source allowing you to
wake up to a fully charged battery while
your phone remains powered through the
night pretty sweet deal however it's not
all pink clouds and fuzzy rabbits the
charging habits you have can and will
have an effect on the longevity of your
battery if your goal is to really extend
the life of your phone or your battery
the best bet is to keep your charge
between 10% and 90% not letting your
phone fully drain to 0% or fully charged
to 100% will extend the life of your
battery it's not a danger but it would
extend the life of your battery you guys
remember from like 15 years ago when
people were making money hand over fist
in the dot-com bubble remember we didn't
call it a dotnet bubble or dot-org
bubble we didn't call them dot biz
billionaires we called them dot-com
billionaires because that's the power of
a.com now why is that because no domain
name extension tells your story with the
same degree of trust as a dot-com or
dotnet domain name.com and dotnet domain
name extensions inject credibility into
your online presence save 15% on domain
names and web hosting when you use our
