handy the Android authority app guy by
now Android has fixed most of the
problems when it comes to music quality
however a lot of people still use
equalizers to get a little extra kick
out of their sound today we'll be taking
a look at some of the best equalizer
apps for Android first on our list is
the aptly named music equalizer by
Rodrigo Kolb yes there needs to be a
distinction there because there is a
second app on this list with exactly the
same name this variant is a simple app
that shows up in a floating window and
looks a little plain but it gets the job
done it has all the bells and whistles
you'd expect from an equalizer there is
a bass boost visualization although
there are no visualization options a
five band EQ and presets this is one of
the few on the list that doesn't max out
the bass on every setting and that's
actually a good thing next on our list
is an app called equalizer FX free this
little equalizer app features a six band
EQ along with all the usual goodies
including presets bass boost
visualization settings and the ability
to save custom profiles
it's an equalizer and it does equalizer
things we actually couldn't understand
why people didn't rate this one higher
it won't bow anyone but it doesn't
harass you with ads and the equalizer
settings do actually work the only
problem we found was that half the
presets had the bass maxed out which
makes everything sound like it's coming
out of Beats Audio which isn't always a
good thing
viii on our list is called and I hope
I'm getting this right and EQ equalizer
this nifty little five band equalizer
has both a paid and a free version the
difference being nothing more than ads
we recommend checking out the free
version first though to make sure that
the app works properly on your device we
did have some trouble with it as you can
see we got forced closes when trying to
load the presets that may have been just
us but again check out the free version
first problems aside is a simple five
band equalizer app with some presets
that can be nice if you need a quick
tweak OBO eq is number 7 on our list and
like an EQ this is a very simple
equalizer it's actually designed for the
obvio brand headsets but it still works
for everything it comes with some music
controls in a small settings menu should
you need to use them the main interface
is where the EQ is and like we stated
it's pretty simple you move the six
bands wherever you need them to go or
you can select from a few presets there
are also bass boost and reverb available
should you need them is it nice sure it
is is it anything special no not really
is just an equaliser next up is the
second unimaginative Lee named music
equalizer as the name implies this is an
equalizer for music also the sky is blue
Twilight is overrated and Steve Ballmer
is crazy obvious facts aside this is
actually a really nice app with a slick
interface like the first one it opens up
to a floating window which is already
really awesome and then proceeds to do
exactly what it's supposed to do
unfortunately like some others on this
list its pitfalls that it thinks
everyone wants maxed out base on every
single preset other than that this is
the superior of the two music equalizers
at number five is Android equalizer
player we tried not to include a lot of
media players because usually the
equalizer is secondary to actually
playing the media for this app that is
not the case at all as the equalizer is
a front and center feature that's always
visible beware though as the ads can get
annoying so here's how it works you open
the app find a song and play it when you
do you find that the equalizer is baked
right into the main music player it has
a number of presets in the separate
phase control but if you're one of those
people who like to change the equalizer
between every song this is definitely
one for you to check out
like we said a second ago we try to stay
away from music players because
equalizers are more of a peripheral
feature there however like Android
equalizer player this app has the
equalizer at the forefront of the music
player and as its main feature that said
the equalizer music player is almost an
exact replica of the Android equalizer
player down to the small room the big
room the plate settings down to the
presets and everything however this one
has millions of downloads while the
other one has only a couple hundred
thousand downloads and the ads aren't as
bad admittedly this one also kind of
looks better the first in our top three
is called bass booster this app used to
be a much bigger deal back in the days
before this kind of stuff was really
common especially in earlier versions of
Android for eq's weren't baked into the
OS it's not that big of a deal anymore
but it still functions pretty well the
bass boost part is kind of a toss-up it
may work with your device and it may not
it's recommended to try the free version
first to see if that's what you're
looking for what it comes with though is
a pretty nice expand equalizer with a
number of presets and a simple interface
and you can't ask for much more than
that number two on our list is a nifty
little app called equalizer this is one
of the easiest apps on the list to use
and it doesn't come with any catches
like advertising there is a paid version
that unlocks some of the better features
but the free version is still perfectly
usable on the first page you can see the
equalizer presets on the second page you
can set the equalizer yourself and even
use a track to play while you do it page
three lets you control the bass boost
and the reverb perhaps our favorite
feature was the auto equalizer which
changes your EQ based on the genre of
the song you're listening to beware
though you need to have proper ID three
tags set on your music for this feature
to work
this is it the last on our list and the
number one rated equalizer app bite you
guys it's called music volume EQ and it
has a really nice looking interface like
a few others it shows up in a floating
window and as do the rest of the list it
acts as an equalizer and volume manager
it has all the bells and whistles you'd
expect equalizers bass boost presets
visualization and volume controls it
looks nice and it works well of course
nearly every EQ preset has the bass
maxed all the way out like many of the
others so you may need to turn that down
in order to enjoy it however this is the
one that people like the most here is
the leader board so you can see them all
together as always we do not rate these
ourselves this is how you the people
have rated them there is no bias here
ladies and gentlemen to get these apps
the links are in the video description
all of these apps essentially work the
same way you open them you mess with
either five or six band equalizers and
your music hopefully sounds a little
better so there may be very little
variance as to how all of these work
most of the time the difference is how
they look of course equalizers are out
there by the dozens and are often mixed
in with themes and plugins for other
apps so if we missed a really good
equaliser and you want to talk about it
let us know your thoughts in the
comments once again I'm Joe Hendy the
