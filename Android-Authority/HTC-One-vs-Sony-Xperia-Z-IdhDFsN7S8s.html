what's going on everybody and today in
this edition of vs. we're taking a look
at what are probably two of the most
sought-after devices in the market today
yes we're talking about the HTC One
versus the Sony Xperia C we'll start
with the Sony Xperia Z it did bring back
that rectangular angular corner look
that we don't see much of these days and
the black slate look is really nice the
button layout half way down the right
side makes handling easier so it does
deserve that credit the HTC One on the
other hand might be a 4.7 inch device
but it is just about as big as the
Xperia Z all around however with an
aluminum casing it also has a really
nice feel and it is actually thinner the
thinness and the rounded back thus
helped with the handling in their own
way
making reaching the top power button and
the volume rockers still pretty easy
either choice leads to a great-looking
phone and with decent enough handling
either way we have a tie here I've said
before that instead of five inch screens
we should be seeing 4.7 inch 1080p
displays right when I get used to five
inch devices the HTC One then comes
around to fulfill my wish and it does a
great job it definitely has better
viewing ankles than the Xperia Z is 5
inch performer and is even sharper with
469 PPI over the Z's 441 yes the Xperia
Z is still a great 5 inch screen but
when you compare its viewing angles to
better ones out there like the HTC One
you kind of wish that they the Xperia Z
was capable of that too the Sony Xperia
Z has the capable 1.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon s4 pro processor that has
powered some of the best phones on the
market but it is getting on a bit
enter the 1.7 gigahertz powerhouse of
the Snapdragon 600 found in the HTC One
which is going to be the next evolution
scores don't lie either the HTC One
routinely scores above the Xperia Z and
thus it gets the point in this round the
Xperia Z is water resistant which is a
great feature to have even if it's not
something you'd use all the time but it
also has a microSD expansion slot that
is useful from getting more memory out
of the 16 gigabyte capacity but here's
where the experience he kind of loses it
the speaker found in the corner is very
tiny tinny and is a low performer enter
boomsound HTC is replacement for the
one-third inch space saved by using a
4.7 inch screen on the one they sound
incredible and are leaps and bounds
better than the one on the Xperia Z the
base model of the HTC One also comes in
32 gigabytes but a 64 gigabyte edition
is also available so with some great
specific advantages on either device
both get a point for their capabilities
the two batteries are basically the same
here with the 23 30 milliamp hour unit
in the Xperia Z and a 2300 unit in the
HTC One with such close competitors I
personally found that the battery life
was about the same with either device
getting through a full days of work and
now the cameras the Sony Xperia Z's
Exmor RS optics have 13 megapixels at
their disposal and they do perform quite
decently a slightly darker tone is found
on each picture and the superior auto
does a pretty good job of picking one of
the many scene modes for just what you
need in your shot now you would think
that the four megapixel count on the HTC
One would put it at a loss but we're
talking about ultra pixels here that are
supposed to go above and beyond for your
pictures and to be honest they actually
do low light performance is the big
development here as the ultra pixels
really do well to capture enough light
for a decent photo unless you really
want larger sized pictures the HTC One
pretty much has the same capabilities of
the Xperia Z along with HTC Zoe which
can put your pictures and videos in some
nice-looking montages
so it's low-light performance then puts
it on top software is where things get
interesting the Sony Xperia Z does have
the Xperia UI that puts together Ice
Cream Sandwich elements with jellybean
features like Google now and the Sony
additions like small apps and the
Walkman player it's a nice melting pot
of design elements and functionality
that works quite well HTC Sense is
obviously what you get on the one so
everything has that space outlook but
it's been given a new coat of polish so
it's easy on the eyes the biggest
improvement here aside from font and
general design is blinkfeed
it's a Flipboard esque interface found
on the very left of the home screens and
gives you access to social networks and
news outlets in an attractive way I
personally really like it with a
slightly fresher take on Android rather
than just a rehashing melting pot the
HTC one gets the software point and
finally we have the price when
uncontacted of these devices should come
in at around the same price for a
two-year contract but the HTC one can
come in at around 549 US dollars
unlocked which is cheaper than they
usually over $700 price unlocked of the
Sony Xperia Z and so there you have it I
did give the HTC one a couple more
points in this versus so it does walk
away with the win here but the best way
to take a look at these two devices are
they are great examples of their
respective screen size categories the
HTC one just might be the best 4.7 inch
screen device out there while the Xperia
Z is still a great example of how much
fun you can have in a 5-inch screen
really though once you figure out what
you really need from both of these
devices you really should be the winner
of this vs because you'll walk away with
a phone in which you'll have a lot of
fun we have great content going up all
the time on the Android authority
YouTube channel so don't forget to

then once you're done with all that head
