handy the Android authority app guy and
in this quick video we're gonna take a
look at the best Android wear apps first
up is an application called Find My
Phone this nifty little Android wear
application can help you find your
device if you've lost it it'll also make
the watch freak out if the phone loses
Bluetooth connection so you can know
when it's disconnected Google keep is
probably the best notetaking application
currently available for Android wear the
interface is simple and easy to use and
taking notes doesn't require all that
much effort it works well and it's
totally free
if by IFTTT is an awesome application
that allows you to create actions that
happen when certain triggers are applied
it has Android wear support and it can
help make your Android wear watch that
much more functional instaweather for
Android wear is a dual wear application
it not only includes a weather
application complete with radar support
but there are a few wear watch faces
that show you the weather it's a solid
experience and a good weather app look
behind as an Android wear application
that shows you on the watch what your
camera phone sees this is great for
mechanics plumbers or pretty much anyone
who needs to see in dark crowded areas
and there is even LED flash controls
runtastic running in Fitness is one of
the premier fitness applications on
Android and guess what
it has Android wear support to include a
step counter and you can also check for
your calories burned total distance and
much more info sleep as Android is an
alarm application on steroids and it's
also Android wear compatible with it you
can monitor your sleep to see how much
or little you're getting and there's a
lot more features as well swipe apply is
an Android wear launcher application
that puts a floating icon on your watch
so you can open the app drawer whenever
you need it it's a bit in the way
sometimes but it's effective and it's
functional twitter is by far the best
social media platform for Android wear
thanks to its hundred sixty character
limit and talent for Twitter is the best
Twitter option for wear owners the app
is solid and it works very well and it's
even cheap taco is a command center
application for Android wear that lets
you do some fun stuff with your phone
including turning Wi-Fi on and off and
sending SMS messages there is also
Tasker support if you use Tasker where
app manager is an application that lets
you view and deal with all of the
Android wear apps installed on your
phone this is a great way to see what
apps you have that have wire support and
keep track of them web browser for
Android wear is one of the precious few
web browsing options that are available
on Android wear it costs a couple of
bucks but it works well
enough and gets updated rather
frequently so it's worth a shot where
messenger is a full-fledged SMS
application that you send and receive
texts on your where device
it even has third-party keyboard support
and we recommend you use menuhim thanks
to its small size where music controller
is a sort of universal remote for music
apps with it you can skip tracks change
volume play and pause your music this is
great for music apps that don't yet have
wear support where Tasker is last on our
list and it's an application that's
designed to work with Tasker as many
well know Tasker is a glorious
application they can make your device do
practically anything the where
application has some bugs but it works
well overall and that about does it for
this video folks the video won't be
updated but the article most certainly
will so check back from time to time to
see what's new also we have a wholly
separate wear watch faces article and
we'll have both of those linked in the
video description below as usual all
recommendations are welcome if you
