brought to you by citrix gotoassist
the number one global market leader in
remote support hello again ladies and
gentleman I'm Joe handy the Android
authority app guy and in this quick
video we're going to take a look at the
best Android VPNs first up is f-secure
freedom VPN it features an easy-to-use
interface which is good for those who
don't know much about VPNs there's also
a built-in virus scanner and comes with
a free trial fast secure VPN is another
simple VPN unfortunately it makes up for
its simplicity with a rather complicated
pricing structure still you can use it
for free to see what it's like before
you spend any money Finch VPN is a solid
VPN option with a slightly more simple
pricing structure the free version has
no data restrictions but you won't get
the best bandwidth there are also Pro
and premier options to choose from
flash VPN is likely the most simple VPN
on this list it includes only the basic
features and requires no configuration
which is great for those who are all new
to this the only downside is the lack of
features hiding VPN is one of the more
popular options on Android it has a
sleek interface and plenty of options
for VPN use it has a variety
subscription options and one-time
payment options which is also nice hi
ninja VPN is another popular and
well-known VPN service with a simple pay
strategy and good functionality the
interface is hollow which is nice and
it's a solid overall experience hotspot
Shield VPN is one of the more complete
VPN options out there it's more
expensive but the payment structure is
simple to understand there is plenty of
features and unlimited web usage for pro
users Open VPN Connect is one of the few
truly free VPNs on the market
unfortunately it also comes with a
wicked learning curve so those who don't
know about VPNs should probably look
elsewhere open VPN for Android is a fork
off of Open VPN so they have a lot of
the same features learning curves and
even the same price tag which is totally
free if you're using Open VPN connect
and want another option this is a good
one speed VPN is another rare free
option each connection is limited to 60
minutes but you can start a new session
as soon as one has ended it should be
noted that using this for torrents will
get you banned from the service surf
easy VPN is one of the few apps that
comes with a bit of flair when it comes
to the interface free accounts get you
500 megabytes per month and you can pay
to get more it's simple enough to use
and a good option
Tyger VPN is a one-click VPN where you
can press one button and you're
connected to the service free accounts
get 500 megabytes
month and you can purchase more if need
be the payment structure is a bit
complicated though tunnel Bayer VPN
turns the act of using a VPN into a bear
that tunnels around the world it's a
great visual representation of the
process and comes with 500 megabytes
free every month that you can also pay
to upgrade VPN by private Internet
access has a couple of unique features
it does things like compress incoming
data to help those with slower web
connections the free version is very
basic with the pro version having more
of the features VPN master is an
application that boasts speed consistent
uptime and loose restrictions on free
users it's based on Open VPN but you
don't have to create your own server
this time to use it
it also looks pretty nice VPN via ton
carries with it one of the sleekest
interfaces of any VPN on this list
there's a free trial with 200 megabytes
but otherwise there is no free version
of this application which may chase some
people away last up for now is zpn
connect they utilize a mobile carrier
style pricing structure that makes it
somewhat easier to understand free
accounts still get three gigabytes per
month which is better than most free
accounts thanks for watching everyone
but let's get down to some serious
business citrix gotoassist remote
support can provide live or unattended
support to any computer or mobile device
this is great for IT professionals who
need to help employees or customers
diagnose and fix problems faster with
more efficiency Anytime Anywhere
they have also recently introduced the
seeit feature where people can stream
their smartphones camera to go to assist
so you can personally see what's going
on with the hardware and let's face it
most problems are easier to fix when you
can see what's going wrong if you're
interested in trying it out head on over
to go to assist comm and click on the
try it free button to get a free 30-day
trial with no credit card required again
that is go to assist comm and if you
decide to take the plunge and buy an
annual subscription before March 31st
you will get a free at Samsung Galaxy
Tab for tablets
we'd like to thank Citrix for their
support of Android authorities and that
about does it for this video folks that
video likely won't be updated with the
written version it definitely will be so
check back every now and again to see
what's new there also I'm always down
for hearing suggestions so if I missed a
good application on this list let me
know about it in the comments if you
haven't done so already don't forget to

day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
