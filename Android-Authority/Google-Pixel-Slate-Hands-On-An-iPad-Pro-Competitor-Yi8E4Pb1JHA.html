Authority and I'm coming to you live
from the Google pixel event here in New
York City and I'm taking a look at the
brand new pixel slate this is their new
tablet slash laptop hybrid and this
thing starts at $5.99 for the base model
and goes all the way up to $1,600 the
base model will get you an Intel Celeron
processor and the higher-end models will
get you a Core i5 or a core i7 the
detachable keyboard is $1.99 and then
the pixel book pen is an additional $100
so the pricing can add up pretty quickly
but as far as the tablet itself it's
really nice it's made of metal so really
high quality it's also extremely thin as
well very impressively thin and if you
take a look around the tablet you'll
notice that it has two USB type-c ports
one on either side it also has a power
button on the top that also doubles as a
fingerprint sensor one thing that you
will not find though on this tablet is
that it does not have a headphone jack
so it is what it is now on the front
there are dual front-facing stereo
speakers and I didn't really have a
chance to test them in this loud
environment but I'm sure they probably
sound really great the bezels on the
front are pretty thin pretty thin for a
tablet anyways you still get enough
space to rest your fingers and you also
have cameras on the front and back both
cameras are 8 megapixel and the front
camera is a wide-angle lens which is
going to be really great for taking
selfies and group photos and it also
incorporates a lot of the same machine
learning algorithms as the pixel phones
so you're going to be able to do the
same portrait mode
the screen on here is a twelve point
three inch display Google calls it a
molecular display which is basically
sort of a fancy term for a screen that
looks really good so it's really sharp
really vibrant it's three thousand by
two thousand resolutions so it is a
three by two aspect ratio screen and it
also is an LCD panel as well
now the pixel slate is running Chrome OS
but Google says it's sort of a
reimagined version of Chrome OS which
basically just means it's optimized for
both a tablet and desktop experience so
you get a really tablet friendly
experience but you also have the power
of a Chromebook so if you open up Chrome
for example you get the full version of
Chrome and it's not the mobile version
of Chrome so one of the cool things
about Chrome OS on the pixel slate is
when you open up the app drawer you'll
get some recommended shortcuts
underneath the Google search bar and
these recommended shortcuts will
basically change on how you use the
device and based on what you're doing so
for example if you're browsing a web
page on your pixel phone you can
continue to browse the web page on your
pixel slate and a little shortcut will
actually pop up right underneath the
Google search bar to make it easy to
continue doing that now if you want the
full on desktop experience you of course
need to have the keyboard and the tablet
snaps into the keyboard really easily it
snaps in with magnets so it just kind of
pops right into place and from the short
time that I spent with the keyboard it's
actually a really really nice keyboard
of course you can use the keyboard to
prop the tablet up if you want to
consume media and things like that or
just interact with the touchscreen but
the keyboard is very comfortable to type
on the circle shape keys might throw you
off at first but it's actually very easy
to get used to and their keys have a
really nice amount of travel to them
they're very spacious the trackpad is
also a very nice size as well it's also
very clicky and responsive so I really
like this keyboard a lot I think it's
one of the best parts of the pixel slate
and I feel like if you want to get the
full power of the pixel slate you
definitely have to get the keyboard with
it and of course there's also the pen as
well which you can use to
take notes you can even use it as a
laser pointer if you want so a ton of
functionality with the pixel slate of
course the price does begin to add up as
you begin to move up in storage and
processing power and once you add all
the additional accessories as well but
that's pretty much all there is to the
pixel slate let me know what you guys
think down in the comment section below
hopefully you guys enjoy this video and
if you did give it a thumbs up and we
have a lot more to come from Google's
pixel event here in New York</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
