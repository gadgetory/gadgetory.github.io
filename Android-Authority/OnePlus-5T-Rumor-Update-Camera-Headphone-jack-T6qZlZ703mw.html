the 1 plus 5t you see the co-founder of
one plus Karl PI has been tweeting up a
storm
showing off the supposed photos of the 5
T by tweeting things like what phone is
he taking that photo is well it's likely
the 1 + 5 t and according to rumors it
will have a similar camera setup to its
predecessor but instead it will get a
speck bump 2 to 20 megapixel dual
cameras this isn't the only photo shared
by pi though he recently took to Twitter
to share another great picture which
featured a low-light disco ball he
captured the picture cool photo must
have come from a great camera CEO and
co-founder Pete Lau was also getting on
the action with his own picture which
you can see here he says impressive
photo must be a great camera another
piece of sweet news is that the 1 + 5 T
is said to keep the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack in a Twitter posting
earlier the company asked fans what all
of their previous phones had in common
it would seem like a pretty cruel joke
to remove the headphone jack on the 1 +
5 t after a post like this now clearly 1
+ 5 t is trying to compete with this
puppy the Google pixel - and this is the
smaller version that I've recently
acquired and the phone camera is
fantastic in portrait mode it is it is
amazing I mean it produces portrait
quality photos that are as good or
better than my $2,000 professional DSLR
yeah sadly the rest of the phone is
underwhelming at best let me know what
you think about the 1 + 5 t are you
excited about it are you gonna get it
let me know what you think in the
comments below or as usual on
Twitterverse well as someone who runs an
online business I can tell you that I
