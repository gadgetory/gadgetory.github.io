releasing multiple versions of their
phones when I say multiple I mean a
metric ton forget about those pesky
carrier variants the Galaxy S line in
particular has so many different phones
that most people don't even know they
exist the galaxy s5 in particular has
six different variations for customers
to choose from and that doesn't even
include carrier specific models it's
been a long time since I five hit the
shelves though and it seems like
Samsung's finally starting to narrow
down their offerings bit the last two
versions of the galaxy s have focused on
small and large versions for different
types of users but it's the new design
language of the galaxy s 8 beg for a
single phone I'm David and Mel Thurmond
authority and this is what I don't like
about the Samsung Galaxy s8 plus the
Galaxy S II is all about bigger screens
and smaller bezels this is literally the
core marketing feature of Samsung's
unboxed your phone campaign don't get me
wrong this is a great change because it
moves us towards that single sheet of
glass phone that we've all been dreaming
up for years
smaller bezels in a larger screen are
great for media consumption but when
does that much screen become too much
sure the screen to body ratio in the
galaxy Si and si plus is a lot more
optimized than it was in previous
generations but the whole point of this
optimization was to give more room for
content while still being able to hold
the phone in one hand yeah ok someone
could argue that the Galaxy S a plus is
just slightly bigger than something like
the pixel XL but does that curved glass
body make it way too easy to slip out of
my hand and it's the height of the
screen just a little too hard to reach
from the top yes it is without using two
hands this phone really isn't optimized
for the average user okay I know what
you're thinking
just get a case but listen again to
Samsung's slogan for the Galaxy s8 unbox
your phone yes I know this is intended
to highlight these small bezels and big
screen on the thing but a phone like
this
a screaming to be left uncovered Hey
Simpsons official yet horrifyingly ugly
cases are designed to protect the thing
from bumps and scuffs while still
maintaining as much of the original
design language as possible well I can
understand where they were going out
with these cases never mind those things
are terrifying this feeds into my other
primary gripe with this phone the
fingerprint sensor yes the sensors on
the galaxy Si and si plus are exactly
the same the effort required to actually
activate them is far from it
a fingerprint sensor on your phone
should be as effortless to use as
possible and both the galaxy Si and si
plus are guilty of bad placement and
just bad design on the regular si at
least my finger lands somewhere near the
right spot but the plus model forces
need to stretch my hand to its full
length in order to cover it just right
now to be clear I really do like the
design of these devices well I am
partial to LG slightly chunkier design
that is easier to hold the galaxy sa
really is a work of art same some
obviously took what was so beautiful
about the galaxy note 7
and worked it into these devices from a
functionality standpoint the essay
reigns supreme over the essay plus in my
opinion for a price differential of
about 120 bucks which essentially gets
you a slightly bigger battery and
slightly larger screen it's a no-brainer
for me to nab the standard version of
this thing what's your opinion on the
galaxy si plus do you value this extra
point four inches of screen real estate
over the bigger body do you like
learning devices like this and are still
looking for something to replace your
late note 7 let us know in the comments
below and make sure to subscribe and hit
that little bill at the top make sure
that you stay tuned for future videos
until next time I'm David Emmel with
Android authority and I'll see you in
