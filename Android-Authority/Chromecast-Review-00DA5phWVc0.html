until now viewing YouTube has been
easiest on say a laptop or on a phone or
tablet and you've probably asked
yourself this question at least one time
before how do I get this content onto
here well Google has come up with a way
to do so and not only is it affordable
it's easy and yes it is a lot of fun hey
it's Josh of Agartha mandroid authority
what's going on everybody
and this is the chromecast
okay so this is the chromecast it's just
a little module or dongle as is the
technical term not a whole lot to say
here you have the chrome icon at the
front nothing on the back here obviously
it connects to your HDMI port in your TV
so there it is an opposite that is a
microUSB port made for routing power to
it the only thing other than that as you
can kind of see here is a little button
that you can hold if you want to reset
the chromecast to its factory settings
that's useful if you need to connect it
to a different Wi-Fi network or if it
just sort of messes up on you you need
it to reset so we're gonna go through a
set up and get this thing connected to
my TV here at my desk like I said before
the chromecast does require power so you
have either the USB available if you
happen have a USB port on your TV or you
can use the included AC adapter if you
don't have a USB port on your TV
luckily mine does the one that's here at
my desk alright and then into the USB
alright and it will direct you to
downloading a program onto your computer
which I already have so let's just open
that up and from here it'll
automatically start searching for your
chromecast dongle that should be powered
on in your TV and there it is you just
say that's my code and then you enter in
your Wi-Fi credentials and there you go
it's all set up
alright so I've come over to my bigger
TV over in my living room in order to
show off just a couple extra things but
first I'm gonna show you just how easy
it is to do the setup for the chromecast
from the Android phone if you don't
happen to have a laptop nearby when
you're setting up your chromecast using
your phone or tablet running Android
it's pretty much the same procedure and
is just about as easy there you go it
shows up right there and I'm going to
set it up the code shows up on the TV
and it should show up here for me to
verify that would be the one
and there you go
very easy I have the YouTube app already
open to some just kidding news so we're
just gonna select one okay so we're
starting with some just kidding news
I'll just click on this it should be
able to detect the different kinds of
chromecast that you have on your network
in my case I just have the one right
here since I only have one chromecast so
we'll just select that it will head over
to the chromecast tell it to connect
with YouTube and begin playing my video
the cool thing about the YouTube app is
that you can go through your YouTube
subscriptions or any other channels any
other videos and just keep adding them
to a queue that is found on the bottom
right here if I look at the queue I only
have one item so let's add a few to
those just take that you'll see add to
TV queue right there so we add that add
that to the queue and at any point when
you're looking at the queue you could
just select one of the videos and it
will begin to play that video instead
at any point that you want to stop
chrome casting just select that cast
button at the top again and select your
phone it'll just bring the video back to
your phone and there you go let's change
it up a little bit they start watching
some Netflix episodes of TV all right
here's a Netflix right here all right so
we have some CSI Miami playing right
here and of course you have the full
screen here if you're watching on your
phone but the cast button is right next
to it click on that they do this device
or my chromecast click on that and this
becomes a remote control for the actual
video that we'll be playing on the TV
and of course you can send music to your
TV as well if you have Google play music
or you use Pandora a cast button will be
available on there as well and you can
send music straight to your chromecast
connected to your television and use
that as a nice music player however
there is one more feature available to
the chromecast and that is the ability
to broadcast a tab from your Chrome
browser that's possible by installing a
plug-in now anything inside of this tab
that you choose to broadcast will be put
onto your television so kind of think
outside the box a little bit and realize
what kind of things you might be able to
broadcast using this feature we're going
to get a little bit more in-depth on
this in a tips and tricks video that I'm
going to be releasing very soon and so
there you have it the chromecast is its
revolutionary well in reality not really
that's because a lot of people are going
to argue that this technology has been
around for a little while if you own a
Smart TV or a Google TV for that matter
then you already been enjoying these
features for a while now on your
televisions but you have to be very
aware of what kind of setup you have at
home before you purchase the chromecast
see in my case this DLP TV is almost a
decade old so it does take one HDMI
input but there's no way of getting the
audio from there over to my 5.1 speakers
so when I'm using the chromecast
I'm hearing it through the
built-in speakers on this actual TV and
that's kind of a bummer there is a way
of making it happen using an extra piece
of equipment that I have to buy but then
that just means that $35 for the
chromecast will now be my total cost so
you kind of have to make sure of what
kind of setup you have in that that one
HDMI port will still be okay to get to
your full sound system but for a $35
piece of technology you can turn your
television into a smart TV and that's
honestly really cool enjoying Netflix
and YouTube on your television in such
an easy way with stuff that you probably
already own like your Android phones or
tablets really makes this the easiest
way of getting your content from the
internet onto a TV so as always stay
