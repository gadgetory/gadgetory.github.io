being geared towards the playful side of
people it's trust regard from Android
Authority what's going on everybody and
we're taking a look here at Alcatel new
one-touch go play series the ghost play
might be pretty decidedly mid-range but
it is available for people young and old
to have a more playful side to them and
that should be pretty obvious due to the
variety of colors that are available but
this body is ip67 certified so the
rubberization on the back should be a
pretty dead giveaway that the go play
you should be able to take anything that
the playful side of you will be able to
throw at it that being said however
we'll take a look at the specs it's a 5
inch HD display that's 720p resolution
that's powered by a Snapdragon 410 and 1
gigabyte of RAM the storage underneath
is really not too much to really get
excited about you get 8 gigabytes in the
onboard storage with a micro SD card
slot which is pretty nice but as of
right now it only goes up to 32
gigabytes though that should be enhanced
pretty soon right around the time of the
launch the cameras are of a 8 megapixel
rear facing camera construction with the
front facing camera bringing 5
megapixels which is actually pretty nice
for the various selfies that people
might be taking here now obviously
Alcatel is thinking that this phone
might be a little bit more gear to the
younger crowd especially those parents
who want to give their kids a phone that
will be able to give them a pretty good
Android experience without really having
any fears of it breaking too easily and
even then it is still pretty fun to use
you can also record stuff playing on the
mobile screen with the actual camera
recording you doing so so you can have a
reaction video to anything that's going
on on the phone itself think about doing
some games and then you might be able to
react to it and then you can actually
share that on social media or with your
friends so you can show your reactions
and have some fun with that and with the
2500 milliamp hour battery underneath
you probably will have a pretty good
time with this phone as it will go for a
pretty long time considering the lower
specifications keeping the battery from
really draining out too quickly so that
was just a quick look at the affordable
yet decidedly mid-range yet fun go play
by Alcatel OneTouch as far as budget
devices go this might be one that shows
a little bit more creativity than many
that are available now so keep it tuned
to Android authority for even more about
the Alcatel OneTouch go play and stay
tuned for another video or head on over
to our channel to see its companion the
go watch and you can see there what we
think of their brand-new wearable the
update to the original OneTouch watch
keep it tuned to you for even more from
Aoife in Berlin as we're here with
Alcatel seeing their new products for
this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
