net neutrality and what our tech
companies doing about it unless you've
been living under a rock over the past
several months you knew that this vote
on net neutrality was coming it played
out as many people expected and the FCC
voted to reclassify Internet service
providers like Comcast spectrum and
Verizon the vote removed restrictions on
the companies that many felt were vital
to have an open and fair internet now
Google responded by pledging to continue
to follow the policies of net neutrality
quote we remain committed to net
neutrality policies that enjoy
overwhelming public support we've been
approved by the courts and we are
working well for every part of the
internet economy we will work with other
net neutrality supporters large and
small to promote strong enforceable
protections now what does Google mean by
strong and enforceable protections
because there are less protections or
there will be once this passes partly we
have to trust in companies like Google
to protect our interests not just theirs
Facebook is another company that voice
support for strong net neutrality
regulations and that quote from Sheryl
Sandberg today's decision from the
Federal Communications Commission to end
net neutrality is disappointing and
harmful an open Internet is critical for
new ideas and economic opportunity and
internet providers shouldn't be able to
decide what people can see online or
charge more for certain web sites we're
ready to work with members of Congress
and others to help make the internet
free and open for everyone I love what
Sandberg said because it was a lot less
lawyer speak than Google and she also
pointed out how it's going to affect
people like you and me more on that in a
moment let's move on to Netflix
we're disappointed in the decision to
gut net neutrality protections that
ushered in an unprecedented era of
innovation creativity and civic
engagement this is the beginning of a
longer legal battle Netflix stands with
innovators large and small to oppose
this misguided FCC order damn Netflix
tell us how you really feel they also
remind us that this is just the
beginning of a long legal battle and it
will be some time before these new
regulations take a
also with its repeal Amazon's chief
technology officer took to Twitter to
share his statement and a quote I am
extremely disappointed in the FCC's
decision to remove net neutrality
protections we will continue to work
with our peers partners and customers to
find ways to ensure an open and fair
internet that can continue to drive
massive innovation now let's just sit
back for a moment and talk about why
this matters so much to people like you
and me and it's not just about companies
charging you a little more to get to
your content it's much deeper than that
it speaks to the very root of a
democratic open free society so let's
just sit back for a moment and imagine
that the Internet is a whole series of
highways roads bridges and buses and
trains okay and different companies own
different aspects of the transportation
system and they say hey you know Jace
you can go to this mall over here and
drive there on our fast train for free
and once you go there you can shop on
all those stores that we have
partnerships with or we own a piece of
but if you want to go over here to this
other mall where you're gonna charge us
1099 each time you go on that bus or
train or Road yeah now those malls are
not competing with each other on equal
footing anymore are they no it's not
really fair and it's stifling innovation
because this mall over here could create
a wonderful experience but they can't
compete with free fast transportation to
the free mall right that's not fair
that's not a free and open
transportation system we want a free and
open Internet what happens when you take
that and it becomes the Internet that's
our highway for information and
knowledge and cultural exchange
well now you can decide what people see
and what information they get and if
you're really good at it you can
manipulate what people begin to believe
right I mean we saw a lot of this in the
last election in the US and 2016 where
countries or companies you know were
manipulating information we called it
fake news and of course each side had
their own a set of fake news it's really
dangerous stuff and although these
companies have a case to want to make
more money and and scale up their
business it is a very slippery slope
when you are able to manage
information in a way that suits your own
business and is not in the best interest
of public and society at a heart you
should care about this and you should
care about it a lot
let me know what you think in the
comments below and on Twitter like me do
you like ultra-thin bone cases if so you
just need protection against everyday
wear and tear and our sponsor has
super-thin cases price just right for
all major phones you can go to minimal
case calm use our coupon code AAA 20 and
get 20% off an already sweet deal
