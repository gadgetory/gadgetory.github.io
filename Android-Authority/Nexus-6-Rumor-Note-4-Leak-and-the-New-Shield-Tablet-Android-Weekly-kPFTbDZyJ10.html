is Jason this past week could have been
called deke week with all the geektastic
leaks we got from the Moto X plus 1 and
the new shield tablet and for all you
phablet fanatics out there you'll love
the news regarding the Samsung Galaxy
Note 4 which others fear could just look
like a large bandaid that just begs to
be ripped off okay ready on three ready
okay 10 now before we get too deep into
the note for you should know that I had
this whole thing written and ready to
shoot and then just a couple hours ago
we received notice or rumors that
Motorola might be building shamu no I'm
not referring to a cellular killer whale
I'm referring to a device codenamed
Shamu otherwise referred to as the nexus
6 this rumor is credit to android police
who have reportedly obtained what they
call proof in the form of a bug report
that shows a build number codenamed
Shamu of an unspecified 5.9 inch display
and the inclusion of a fingerprint
scanner now of course it's hard to take
these unsubstantiated rumors seriously
but it's reported the design of the
device will be smooth black and white
waterproof and prefer the taste of fresh
fish now all you phablet fanatics out
there should know that the Korean eTnews
claims that Samsung is putting a lot of
stock and hope in the release of the
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and will be out as
early as this temper apparently Samsung
is planning to include a 16 megapixel
OAS camera module metal casing and
supposedly will offer flexible and non
flexible display options there is also
the superfast Exynos 5430
system-on-a-chip now all you speed
demons out there will want to know that
according to these benchmarks the Exynos
5433 is said to be faster then the
Snapdragon 805 now for those of you who
love the Moto X but wanted something
just a little bit bigger this is friggin
these photos hit the inbox of the folks
over at Android police allegedly showing
the successor to the Moto X sporting a
metal possibly aluminum frame and
wooden backplate even if the images are
real we may be looking at a
pre-production model or a prototype as a
rather unpolished m logo on the back
seems to suggest the specs rumored in
past for the Moto X plus 1 are a
Snapdragon 800 processor 5.2 inch
display 32 gigabytes of storage and a 12
megapixel rear facing camera and a 2900
milliamp hour battery now you should
also know that according to EV links
motorola will be providing additional
backplate options for the Moto X plus 1
not just bamboo and wood but leather
backplate options now for all of you who
love mobile gaming on a tablet NVIDIA
has taken this to a whole other level
today nvidia made official the new
shield tablet an 8 inch device powered
by the Tegra k1 processor targeting
primarily coolers the shield features an
8 inch full HD IPS LCD display and comes
with a built-in stylus that works within
videos new direct stylus to technology
which includes a new capability where
pigment and paint mix and duty
physically in real time and the palette
is naturally illuminated in 3d as the
user adjusts the light source the Tegra
k1 system-on-a-chip features a hundred
and ninety-two Kepler based GPU cores
that support some desktop-class graphic
features such as tessellation and at
quad-core cortex a15 processor spinning
at 2.2 gigahertz as well as 2 gigabytes
of RAM the device comes in two versions
one with Wi-Fi only and 16 gigabytes of
an built-in storage and one with LTE and
32 gigabytes of storage now the good
news is that both models have an
expansion slot for 120 gigabytes of
internal storage and are priced at 299
and 399 respectively thanks for watching
