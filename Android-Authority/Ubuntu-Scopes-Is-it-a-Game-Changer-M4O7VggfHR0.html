to you by HipChat so you guys remember
this Ubuntu it's an alternative mobile
operating system that launched over two
years ago with lots of promise and
fanfare but they didn't just launched a
new phone this week it's what's on that
phone that could begin a systemic shift
and how you and I interact with our
phones now first let's just start with
the phone now the first you bun to phone
will be a repurposed Aquarius efore
point 5 the low budget BQ handset which
usually runs Android the Aquarius a 4.5
Ubuntu edition has a 4.5 inch display
with a 540 x 960 resolution a one point
three gigahertz quad-core mediatek a7
processor one gigabyte of ram and a
Mallee 400 GPU the phone also has 8
gigabytes of internal storage a 2150
milliamp hour battery an 8-megapixel
rear-facing camera and a 5-megapixel
front-facing camera and right now there
is no LTE support no although the phone
is selling for the somewhat attractive
price of 195 dollars u.s. it will only
be sold in Europe but canonical has
assured us that they will have quote a
u.s. device strategy but that's not the
most important thing now for the past
week we've talked about how difficult
it's going to be for any alternative
mobile operating system to compete with
Android or iOS because they just don't
have the juice to build an app ecosystem
to compete I mean who would possibly
have that so ubuntu is going to change
the rules of the game and they've
started with a new UI paradigm and they
call it scopes scopes which is a new UI
paradigm designed to deliver content and
services directly to your home screen
giving users a rich unfragmented
experience scopes will give you
categorized home screens that will pull
content from multiple sources this means
you will get content from youtube vimeo
and your own recorded media all on the
same page as well as music news and
other multiple page types set
directly to each home screen the phone
supports mainstream html5 beautifully
and as canonical claims will not be just
another Android or iOS clone now I know
it's some of you may be thinking sounds
interesting but it also sounds like a
cluttered experience and that may be so
it's too early to tell whether scopes
would work but it does sound interesting
but here's the important part scopes and
the idea behind scopes opens up the
possibility of beginning non native apps
what are non native apps you see native
apps or apps that you have to get
through a play store or the iOS App
Store now the exception is sideload apps
but we talked about for you shouldn't be
doing that for security purposes but
Google and Apple are the middlemen they
control the app distribution so we call
those apps native apps a non native app
is an app that you can go to through the
web browser on your phone and use it
directly now that's not very popular
right now because web browsers kind of
suck and non native apps are just in
their absolute infancy but it could
potentially have big changes just look
at history remember 15 years ago we
didn't download our apps you had to buy
them on a cd-rom and manually install
them until web apps came out and they
quickly dominated desktop apps we expect
a similar thing to happen in the mobile
device industry but there are some
stumbling box here is why it is so
important for you and me let's use
YouTube as an example YouTube is the
middleman between you and me I'm the
content producer or publisher you're the
consumer YouTube controls that
relationship they don't let us email you
directly text you send you snail mail
that's what every business needs to have
a direct relationship with their
consumer or customer now you may be
saying Jason I don't want you to email
me or text me or anything like that and
that's fine this would be for people who
opt into it but consider how many
businesses that you cherish that you
have opted in for have your phone number
your address or your email or something
like that you want to connect with them
because they provide value and so
they're able to maintain that
relationship right now YouTube the
Google Play Store iOS all these platform
are the middle men and they take a
massive chunk for controlling the
relationship a non native app removes
the middleman it allows you and me to
connect directly and we control the
relationship not a middlemen this means
that we are able to make more money from
our content therefore providing more
premium content higher better quality
people better gear better preparation
all that kind of stuff I don't have to
do this out of my living room kind of
thing and you get to consume more
premium content and have choices and
probably get a lot of content that's
cheaper because we're not given off
thirty to fifty percent of our ad
revenue see what I mean massive massive
game changer let me know what you think
in the comments below have you guys ever
tried to collaborate with a large group
of people online to get a job or project
done it's pretty difficult that's why
you want the right tools to do the job

Google+ now guys I wanted to clear a
problem up because yesterday I did the
Nexus 6 how to fix its common problems
and I think some of you got the
impression that the phone has all these
problems or most people have these
problems with the Nexus 6 and that's
just not true we're just trying to solve
some of the technical problems that some
people have
with their Nexus 6 but lots of people
love the phone it's a very premium foam
great for you if you love really large
fabulous I just wanted to clear that up
