would a smartphone have to be like for
you to fork out 1,400 bones well this is
what the rumored cost is of the Samsung
Galaxy F what you're seeing here is
concept creator concept creator is a
youtuber who just posted a conceptual
render of the upcoming foldable Samsung
Galaxy F now this render is not real
repeat it is not real but it is based on
industry speculation as well as the
prototype shown off by Samsung earlier
this month but for $1,800 that thing
better walk my dog vacuum my floor and
massage my wife's feet $1,800 I mean I
can see a future where if a foldable
device is super thin but yet really
durable can act both as a phablet and a
tablet all in one device I can see a
premium price for that I I may actually
go for that but $1,800 you do the math I
mean you can buy a premium tablet and a
premium phone for less than that or at
least a mid to your phone I just I don't
buy it and the hype there's a lot of
hype but I don't think it's quite $1,800
with a hype what do you think let me
know in the comments below and then
further Samsung News we may end up
seeing next year a new variant of the
samsung galaxy s 10 leaker Ben Gaskin
has dropped some hints about a rumored
galaxy s 10 variant the leaker detailed
the potential specs and price of the
budget galaxy s 10 model what may be
called the galaxy s 10 light in a tweet
earlier this week via phone arena Gaskin
suggests that the phone will have a dual
camera a side mounted fingerprint sensor
and a flat Infinity o display as opposed
to the curved version Samsung is
currently favoring on its flagship
devices now Samsung has been working on
the in display fingerprint sensor for
some time now but it is unlikely that
they would include that technology in a
lesser expensive Galaxy S series device
but a side mounted fingerprint sensor
that may not be a huge surprise and to
go further down the Samsung rabbit hole
let's take a look at what Evan Blass had
to say the tipster suggested that the
Galaxy S 10 would come with three rear
cameras with standard wide-angle and
telephoto lenses
as well as an ultrasonic in-display
fingerprint sensor Samsung has long been
rumored to be working on an in display
fingerprint sensor technology so there's
a strong chance that we'll launch with
the 2019 Galaxy S series Samsung has
previously dipped its toes in the triple
rear camera arena with the mid-range
Galaxy a7 2018 which has standard wide
angle and depth lenses Samsung is yet to
introduce as many sensors on a flagship
phone though it's premium handsets
usually deliver in the photography
department for sure glass is also
speculated that the device will have an
infinity ODIs play and you know what
that means that there will be a floating
cutout housing the front-facing camera
you know what software starts to do
things it's not supposed to do who
solves those problems
