with Android Authority and this ZTE
zaxxon 7 with the Exxon 7zt has
implemented dual independent hi-fi audio
chips for both listening and recording
as well as dual front-facing stereo
speakers with Dolby Atmos surround sound
technology let's take a closer look at
this setup and explore how to take your
audio experience to the next level with
the axon Santa let's first discuss the
AKM ak4 96:1 DSP codec which could be
considered the primary chipset for Wi-Fi
or do playback and recording AKM states
that they a que 496 one offers
industry-leading level performance of
THD + n- 99 DB and 110 DB dynamic range
with the newly developed 32-bit advanced
audio deck in capitalist class G
headphone amplifier the ZTE axon 7 also
includes the AKM aka 4 4 9 0 en DAC or
digital to audio converter which is an
independent hi-fi audio amplifier this
is essentially a downsized variant of
the ak4 4 9 0 eq adapted for smartphones
and other portable devices with a 1.8
volt digital interface but not to worry
as the ak4 4 9 0 en offers the same
high-quality audio playback as its
bigger brother and with 5 32-bit filters
and a symmetrical left/right lay out the
aka 4 4 9 0 certainly delivers a premium
audio experience both ships include a
km's velvet sound technology which aims
to offer sound that is both high-quality
and true to life with a good pair of
headphones the difference can be very
noticeable although some other
smartphone manufacturers have recently
adopted similar technology in their
flagship offerings this is likely the
highest quality audio chipset
configuration that you can acquire for
the exon 7 very affordable $400 price
tag and that's even before considering
the axon 7 dual front-facing stereo
speakers with Dolby Atmos surround sound
technology a big step forward from last
year's single speaker to say the least
and it's not just about adding another
speaker as
dee has emphasized this speaker setup
here is a careful endeavor and it's
clear that a lot of work went into
making the axon sevens external audio
sound fantastic it's very difficult to
find speakers of this caliber on other
smartphones in the galaxy s7 single side
firing speakers pales in comparison the
xn7 is able to offer a realistic clean
full and loud audio output which makes
the listening experience extremely
immersive the speakers also make sharing
content much easier in order to maximize
the utility from the exon sevens hi-fi
audio you may need to adjust how you
listen to music although some will argue
that you need lossless audio content
often available in the form of flack
files
many will be unable to notice the
difference in comparison to high bitrate
lossy formats lossless files are
admittedly difficult to legally download
but you could just buy and rip CDs into
flat files yourself if that sounds like
a lot of work you'll probably want to
look into higher quality streaming
options if you're insistent on streaming
flat files directly you want to check
out titles option for $20 per month
otherwise pretty much every popular
music streaming service offers high
quality streaming often
indistinguishable from lossless content
for example configuring Spotify to
stream at a higher quality is quite easy
as you simply open the app go to the
settings and select extreme quality for
streaming this process is very similar
across apps - and if you have any
trouble Google can be your best friend
do keep in mind however that higher
quality streaming is often only
available for paid subscribers if you're
not paying already it may not be worth
the money for what may be only a subtle
improvement in perceived quality
especially if you aren't using an
expensive pair of headphones with that
said you'll definitely love how audio
sounds with the accent 7 regardless if
you find audio quality to be of
particular importance the ZTE axon 7 is
certainly worthy of your consideration
CTE has undoubtedly invested a lot of
time in the axon sevens audio experience
and it's truly remarkable when factoring
the X and 7s price for just $400 you're
not only getting class-leading audio
but also a very compelling device that
ticks pretty much every checkbox thank

the exon 7 audio experience please be
