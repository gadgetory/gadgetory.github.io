everybody and we're right on the floor
in Barcelona Spain hanging out with
Alcatel at MWC 2018 what we have here
are a few different phones all part of
the same lineup I will tell you what the
differences are between all of them but
you can see already that the design on
all three can be a little bit different
the Alcatel 3 which is the base level
one has just one camera on the back with
a fingerprint sensor and then the other
two have either different size screens
or different cameras let's start off
with the Alcatel 3 this is a 5.5 inch HD
plus panel up front with an 18 by 9
display as all of the phones happen to
have this 18 by 9 aspect ratio
it also has 2.5 D glass and on the back
is a matted finish now like we said the
display is 5.5 inches but it's HD Plus
that's 1440 by 720 resolution underneath
the surface you have 16 gigabytes of
on-board storage with 2 gigabytes of RAM
which means that it is definitely a
little bit more in the mid-range to
almost budget category but there is a
micro SD card slot aside from that you
have a media tech 6739 quad-core
processor but it does come with Android
audio which means that you have the
latest edition of the Android operating
system with all the features lying
underneath the fingerprint reader is
there for security measures but you are
also able to do something called face
key now the face key is basically face
unlock and it tracks a hundred different
points of your face after it does its
initial setup after which you just have
to wake the phone by hitting the power
button look at the device and it should
be able to unlock immediately now the
camera of the Alcatel 3 in particular is
not too special compared to the other
two you have a 13 megapixel rear camera
at F 2.0 aperture with a 5 megapixel
front-facing camera but let's go ahead
and bump things up by moving over to the
Alcatel 3x it's a little bit larger it's
more of the middle child when it comes
to all three of these phones and it
comes with the same 18 by 9 aspect ratio
screen but this time it is at a size of
5.7 inches it is still HD plus 1440 by
720 but all of the specs get a slight
bump up there is a version with 32
gigabytes of on-board storage and 3
gigabytes of RAM now the claim to fame
for the 3x is a dual camera system where
one of them is at 13 megapixel camera
but the other camera is a 5 megapixel
wide-angle lens
using the white angle obviously will
allow for better shots that fit
everything in like group shots or having
landscapes obviously this is a slightly
larger device so handling is going to be
a bit different there but it also has a
matted finish on the back but you can
see that it has that dual camera setup
with the fingerprint reader underneath
but it also retains all of the same
features from the Alcatel 3 including
the fingerprint sensor on top of having
the face key and inside of the camera
app as all of these phones have is that
social mode that allows you to do things
like photo booth and also live collages
and finally we have the Alcatel 3v
arguably the most premium of the bunch
depending on what features you really
need out of the camera now as the 3x has
a wide-angle camera the 3v has a depth
sensing extra lens that allows for a
better detail capture but also allows
for a portrait mode the cameras come at
a 12 megapixel power along with the
depth sensor which is a 2 megapixel
shooter this is also the largest of the
bunch which is a 6 inch 2k panel at 2160
by 1080 definitely making it the most
premium of the bunch and it also has a
glossy finish on the back making it
really shine compared to the other two
the specifications underneath include 32
gigabytes of on-board storage and 2
gigabytes of RAM but this time you have
the media tech 87 35a as the processor
we continue to have all of the same
general specifications here across the
board only you have some bumps up
depending on the screen and also the
camera so this was a look at all of the
different Alcatel 3 phones there are
three of them here the 3 the 3x and the
3 v depending on what your needs are all
of these phones are gonna come in at a
pretty low price point especially out
here in Europe where it is going to be
released and you can see which one kind
of fits your needs the best because
you're still going to get the same
Android experience underneath all of
these phones also come with 3000
milliamp hour battery so you can get
about the same battery life across the
board except for the 3v which does
support that 2k display keep it tuned to
Andrew authorial for all of the best
from MWC 2018 as we bring you everything
that we see here on the show floor and
also just around the city like today
when we were hanging out with Alcatel
keep it tuned to android authority and
