hate Siri because is Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody
and Google assistant is now on iOS now
given apples propensity to log down as
OS it comes as no surprise that
assistant is not quite as easy to launch
as Siri after all with Siri you can use
the hot word hey Siri and you will be
able to get straight into its
functionality and do a lot of different
things however when it comes to Google
assistant you have to say ok Google only
after opening up the app so once you're
all set up with the Google assist and
how does it compare to Siri well in a
lot of ways the system actually proves
to be a bit better than Siri however
third-party limitations kind of put them
on even footing you might be wondering
if you can make a call or text using
assistant and you definitely can the
experience is about the same when saying
something like call Joshua Vergara
assistant brings up the number in places
the call with the option to cancel the
call and then when you say text Joshua
Vergara assistant asks you for the
message then asked you to confirm before
booting over to messages were then you
have to press send Syria is able to
finish these steps without you having to
do extra input but google also natively
does this on Android we loaded up music
and Siri opens up Apple music by default
and plays music automatically while
assistant requires you to choose between
something like YouTube and playing via
Apple music searching for specific songs
will make you choose between the two and
then it will default to that for future
ones unless you specify exactly which
application you want to use this is
really an example of how these two
different ecosystems iOS and Android are
really trying to coexist here but
they're always going to be a few
pitfalls in the translation from one to
the other which is not really surprising
to us but if you use Google's own apps
instead of apples then you'll probably
love assistant the way that many Android
fans do to send an email you tell
assistant who descended to and it will
go straight into Gmail otherwise you can
also do navigation and it will use
Google Maps instead of Apple Maps which
is a good thing if you have it installed
assistant also now has the updated
explorer page that some Android users
have been enjoying already in which you
can find useful suggestions as well as a
separate tab called your stuff where it
can show everything that you have done
via the assistant application so overall
iOS does when the Google assistant just
a little bit but that is the disconnect
between these two ecosystems as we
mentioned earlier there are some
features that Google
doesn't Android that aren't available in
iOS but we're sure that that can come in
different updates later on whether it's
on the app side or even on the iOS side
and that kind of development is
something that we're looking forward to
after all this is the developer
conference Google IO 2017 where we have
brought you a lot of great coverage over
at Android or decom so make sure you go
check that out and then watch all of our
