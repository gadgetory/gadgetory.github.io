announcement of their modular g5 we take
a look at the mid-range offerings at LG
brought to MWC 2016 it's Joshua car from
Android authority what's going on
everybody and here we are with the LG X
cam and the X screen we'll start off
with the phone that actually has some
similarities to the LG g5 the X cam
which features dual cameras on the rear
and it says it will deliver the most
advanced camera experience in a mast
earphone or mid-range phone in this case
and the X Kampfer STUV all comes with a
5.2 inch full HD display a 1.1 4
gigahertz octa-core processor a
front-facing 8 megapixel camera which is
nice and 2 gigabytes of RAM with 16
gigabytes of internal memory and a
microSD card slot the battery is 25 20
milliamp hours which is nice for a phone
of this size and it should pretty much
go for about a decent about day or a day
and a half but we'll take a look at the
back and you see the two cameras there
which is similar to the LG g5
construction and it looks like LG is
really pushing this forward you have a
13 megapixel regular shooting camera and
then you per wide-angle five megapixel
camera on it as well when heading into
the camera app however we don't see any
manual controls and a number of the
modes that come in the LG g5 don't make
it onto the X cam the main crux of the
camera app is the fact that you have the
ability to zoom in and out and be able
to use the wide-angle lens and it does
change pretty seamlessly between the two
just like it does in the g5 which is
nice but now we can move over to the X
screen which takes a number of its
features from the LG v10 and puts it in
a mid-range and more affordable offering
now what we have in the specs is a 4.9 3
inch HD main display with a 1.7 6 inch
LCD secondary screen up top there's a
1.2 gigahertz quad-core processor
underneath and the pictures come from a
13 megapixel camera on the rear and 8
megapixels on the front there's 16
gigabytes of internal storage with 2
gigabytes of RAM and a 2300 million
power battery that screen up top does
help with glancing at certain
notifications and also with providing
shortcuts to applications that are of
course user-defined
and it could be activated when the phone
is in standby n it can also stay on when
the screen is on allowing you pretty
easy access to a number of areas but
also even just a small area for personal
customization so these are two of the
other devices that were announced at MWC
2016 alongside the LG g5 you can have
the dual camera setup of the X cam or
you can get the LG v10 second screen
available on the X screen with fairly
affordable price points you can pretty
much take your pic and enjoy some of the
best features that LG has been able to
put into their flagships over the last
couple of years for more about LG's line
of smartphones make sure you keep it
