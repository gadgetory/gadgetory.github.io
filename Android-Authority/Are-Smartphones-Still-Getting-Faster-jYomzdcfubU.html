interpreted as meaning that technology
is going to double in terms of
performance and power each year as we'll
see that's not exactly what Moore said
but it's still the yardstick that many
people use for a while it did seem that
way every new handset came with a
massive hike in power and speed but our
phones still getting faster does Moore's
law still apply to our modern mobile
devices let's find out the problem here
is that it can be quite tricky to
compare two devices or CPUs seeing as
they often aren't directly comparable
there's only so much we can glean from
the numbers so let's start off by
looking at how clock speeds and
benchmark scores have improved before
taking a deeper look at some of the
other factors that might be affecting
the differences we see I'm a Samsung guy
I've got a few Samsung devices lying
around so let's take a look at how the
flagships have changed over the years so
looking at this table you can see that
there's not really that much change
between the SI in the s7 both are
packing octa-core processors and there's
only a small difference in terms of the
gigahertz the Geekbench scores are
pretty different though and that's our
first clue that there is something else
going on here but it's certainly not
double the power we have to go all the
way back to the s5 before we see a
quad-core with any t gigabytes of RAM
and a benchmark score that's under half
of what we see on the s8 those of you
who like to have the most powerful and
fastest devices possible might be a
little bit disappointed by that
but it is a little more complex than
that as well so as gary has explained in
a few of his previous videos gigahertz
does not tell you the full story in
terms of the performance of a CPU so
gigahertz tells you the clock speed and
that's how quickly a CPU can carry out a
sequence of instructions these are
stacked up in order in what is known as
the pipeline so back in the day doubling
the clock speed would mean roughly
double the power because it meant that
the CPU could carry out those actions
twice as quickly but modern advancements
in efficiency have gotten around this in
some clever ways so for example an
execution engine can now carry out more
than one instruction at the same time
through something called instruction
level parallelism this is sometimes
referred to as the pipeline getting
wider
likewise CPUs can now begin fetching the
next instruction before the current one
is complete by splitting those
instructions down into smaller blocks
this is sometimes described as making
the pipeline longer so basically what
methods like this mean is that although
the clock speed might be the same
the number of revolutions times around
might be the same the CPU is now
carrying out more instructions on each
go-around therefore it's more efficient
and faster
despite the gigahertz being the exact
same then you have things like the
advantages and slight disadvantages of
having multiple cause you have the RAM
you have the GPU you have the size of
the cache all these factors can
influence those benchmark scores as well
as the performance you see every day
even when the gigahertz doesn't actually
change but what Moore was talking about
more specifically was the number of
transistors that we'd see on a chip he
said that year-on-year the size and
efficiency of transistors should improve
such that we'd see double the amount on
the same sized chip that would mean in
theory that the number of transistors in
your CPU should be doubling year-on-year
so when you see a CPU described as 10 M
that actually means 10 nanometers that
means that half the length of a
transistor cell is 10 nanometers on that
chip 10 nanometers is currently the
smallest we've got and the smaller the
size of the individual cells the more
you can fit onto the chip currently
samsung and tsmc are racing to bring us
the first seven nanometer chip and tsmc
are also looking at building factories
to create three and five nanometer chips
so this is something that's increasing
rapidly currently but the precise number
of transistors is of course related to
the size of those transistors as well as
the size of the chip so of course the
density is only part of the story we've
got a very dense chip but it's tiny
could still have fewer transistors than
a less dense chip that is massive so how
many transistors are there in the modern
flagship well the Samsung Galaxy s8 has
got the Snapdragon 835 and that has a
whopping three billion transistors just
to put that in perspective the human
brain has only got 100 billion neurons
and there's only just over seven point
four billion people on the planet
so there's a lot of transistors how does
this compare to previous generations
well unfortunately OMS are a little less
candid when it comes to transistor
counts versus gigahertz and I can't get
that information for the s6 and the s7
however Apple are a bit more forthright
we know that the iPhone 6 has
and a8 chip in it and that has two
billion transistors and we can compare
this to the iPhone 5s which had the a7
chip and that had one billion so that is
quite a big hike year-on-year even if
it's not doubling we also know that the
iPhone 8 and 10 will sport the a11 chip
with an incredible 4.3 billion
transistors and if that wasn't enough
the ki-rin 970 is gonna have 5.5 billion
transistors so these are massive jumps
in terms of speed and performance it's
over nine I'm sensing a table coming on
so in this regard were definitely seeing
some pretty big jumps each year and it
almost seems to be speeding up but then
if we look at the difference and the
Geekbench scores between the iPhone 5s
and the iPhone 6 we can see that they're
not actually all that different and this
might seem quite strange because the a8
has got double the number of transistors
and they're otherwise pretty comparable
in terms of their specs so you might
have guessed there and transistor counts
also can't tell us the whole story in
terms of performance that used to be the
case when things are a bit simpler but
today once again things are more
complicated so another law worth
learning is Dennard scaling Dennard
scaling tells us that as transistors get
smaller their power density should
remain the same and this tells us that
the power usage of a chip should be more
to do with the size of the chip and not
to do with a number of transistors and
this is pretty important because
otherwise as we doubled the transistor
count we'd end up with hardware that
required huge amounts of power to run
and got extremely hot so really Moore's
law doesn't work without Dennard scaling
and actually Dennard scaling stopped
holding up around 2000 so today there's
no guarantee that as density increases
stators efficiency and that's one reason
why doubling the number of transistors
doesn't necessarily mean double the
performance and it sort of down to OEM
to decide how they want to utilize all
those transistors not all of them will
necessarily be used for pure computing
power some might be used for power
efficiency options etc so if we're being
really strict and down our scaling is
kind of broken and Moore's law doesn't
apply it's somewhat redundant these days
and Moore himself even revised his
theory in 1995 to say that it would
double every two years and even then he
said it was approximate so no your phone
isn't doubling in power year-on-year but
you shouldn't be too disappointed about
that it's kind of moot to think about
that way anyways your phone is becoming
more efficient and smarter and cleverer
at the way it uses the power it's got it
is getting faster and it's also
improving in terms of build quality the
screen resolution the camera the water
resistance the software optimization if
you can pair a phone today to a couple
of years ago it's still pretty
remarkable how far it's come even in
that short amount of time and as we go
forwards virtual reality augmented
reality artificial intelligence and 4k
screens they're all going to push the
need for faster and even more efficient
performance even further there are some
beastly phones on the horizon thanks ton
