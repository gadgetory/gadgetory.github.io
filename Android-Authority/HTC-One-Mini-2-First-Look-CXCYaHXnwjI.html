size perhaps for some users out there
hey it's Josh reguar from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
here is your first look at the HTC One
mini two of course we're going to start
off with the design and what we have
here is a phone quite literally the same
as the HTC One m8 just shrunken down for
a better and more accessible size and as
essentially what the mini device is
supposed to be and that's what you get
here it's really the same design the
language that was found in the original
with this hairline brush metal on the
back and of course the Busan speakers
found on the top and bottom of the front
of the device that screen by the way is
a four point five inch screen coming in
at 720p resolution you have a five
megapixel front facing shooter up top as
well but another design aesthetic that
comes back from the original HTC One
mini is this plastic ring that goes
around the device on the silver versions
of the original and also of the second
one you'll see that that lip is white
it's white plastic all around which was
a design choice that we actually thought
was a pretty nice change going to let's
say the HTC One mini of last year and
also the HTC One Maxx but it does return
here as well though I am using the
gunmetal gray version of this device in
which they that plastic lip is black and
it blends in a lot better with this
device so it's not necessarily something
that you would really notice as compared
to the silver version as you go around
the device the you'll find that at least
on the top the power button is so much
easier to to reach as compared to the
original Big Brother flagship and if you
thought that that phone was really large
you just have to grip this phone and
then be able to turn on the screen a lot
easier because that power button is
easily reachable with your index finger
the power or rather the volume buttons
on the left side are silver on the
version that I'm using but now we have
been told that in the final production
units these will be great to better
blend in with the rest of the aesthetic
but once you get over to the back it
does there's a telltale sign here as
well that this is a different phone
compared to its flagship Big Brother and
that is of course the exclusion of the
dual camera here up top
you're not getting the same optics
package either when it comes to the HTC
One mini two as this
is not an ultra pixel camera normally
for ultra pixels are what you get for
the shooters and flagship HTC devices
but much like the htc desire 816 that
was very recently released you get a 13
megapixel more standardized camera here
on the HTC One mini 2 after that it's
like I said before the same general
aesthetic but what is great about this
device and what is probably going to
strike a lot of you most is how easy it
is to handle the smaller devices are
definitely a breath of fresh air
compared to a lot of the flagship
devices that we're dealing with now at
around 5 or even more inches and they
are also a little bit harder to maneuver
in one hand but that's not the case with
the HTC One mini 2 as I've already
mentioned the display is a 720p
resolution display coming at 4.5 inches
for this device and while you might be a
screen nut or someone who really craves
higher resolutions you really won't be
seeing much of a difference on this
particular display especially because it
is smaller 720p is perfect for a display
of this size and with the darker motif
of Sense 6 it shows that the contrast is
pretty good and after that the color
reproduction also looks quite good as
well so doing anything from watching
media to playing games on here should be
fine after getting underneath the
surface you'll find the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 400 it is the lower tier
processing package compared to let's say
the 6 or the 800 obviously but it is a
quad core processor clocked in at 1.2
gigahertz back to by 1 gigabyte of RAM
now that should still provide you
everything you need to perform your
general tasks those of you who require
more advanced processing packages for
more advanced tasks will obviously look
to the HTC One m8 but at least on here
you still should be able to get
everything you need done in a very quick
manner because Sense 6 is one of the
more minimalistic operating systems out
there and it should still provide you a
snappy experience those sensors that
will would trigger when you bring the
phone up to your face on the HTC One m8
are not found here so you will not be
turning on the screen and a number of
different unique ways but at least like
I said already you will be able to reach
that power buck up top very easily as
far as on-board storage goes you get 16
gigabytes on the HTC One mini 2 but also
you have a micro SD card slot which is a
great addition to here and it is
expandable of with cards of up to 1
and 28 gigabytes of capacity the battery
is a 2100 milliamp hour units that is
pretty sizable for a device of this size
and should provide quite a bit of
longevity and finally just talking about
the camera while the camera is a 13
megapixel shooter in this sense it's a
more standardized optics package it does
still provide pretty much the same
experience that you would expect from an
HTC camera you aren't able to still put
together zoe's but the Zoe camera is not
included in the modes and after that you
also don't have the Pan 360 it's more of
a standardized experience with the
regular camera the selfie camera and
then after that you have of course the
ability to create zoe's in the gallery
that will then be shared into the Zoe
app which is included in the device and
finally in software we have sent six the
latest version of sens from HTC that
what's called Sixth Sense for a little
out there but nonetheless it comes
without what you would see in the HTC
One m8 it's obviously just brought down
to size and that includes blinkfeed
which is one of the in my opinion best
news aggregation ii screams that is
available that are available out there
and it is an enhanced version that now
uses tiles in a very flat manner instead
of the paginated layouts to bring you
all of your news feeds in a very
attractive way after that you can always
hunker down into specific sources if you
wish which is a feature I always loved
about it but once you put blink feet
aside it's a pretty standardized Android
experience what with the home screens
the notification drop-down with the
quick settings shade the app drawer and
of course the canvas for all of your
widgets icons and folders so you're
getting a very simplistic layout on here
that is a really easy way of getting
into Android one of the easier operating
systems to use out there and that was a
feather in the cap of the HTC One m8 but
now it is of course a feather in the cap
of the HTC One mini two and so there you
have it for the HTC One mini two in this
quick look as you can already see there
I'm holding it very easily in my hand
and it's just small enough room to be
able to grip it like this and that is
really the charm of the HTC One mini two
and that's what it was for the original
mini as well the fact that are greatly
put together flagship device has been
brought down to size and it brings some
of the best that the original had to
offer and puts it in a size that plenty
of users out there will
enjoy better than the larger five plus
inch devices out there that make
one-handed usage a little bit more
difficult so keep it tuned to Andrew

One mini - keep it tuned here for all of
