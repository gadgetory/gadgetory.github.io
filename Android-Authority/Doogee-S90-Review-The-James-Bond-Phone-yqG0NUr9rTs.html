someone who really enjoyed technology
and that's one of the coolest things
about working for Android Authority I
get to play with all sorts of really
cool technology unfortunately a lot of
the time that technology is kind of
boring it's lots of squares with screens
on them and there's not tons to get
excited about however when I was sent to
the do GS 92 review I knew that I was
looking at something a little bit
different the first thing that clued me
into that fact was the box which was
gigantic and had a drawer and just
assembling all the different parts that
it came with all the modules I felt a
bit like James Bond or some kind of
super spy looking at all the stuff that
Q had given me for my latest mission so
this is a much more exciting phone than
most like a lot of more out there
technology the new GS 90 began life on
Kickstarter that's where it got funded
it's massively exceeded its goal already
by a huge margin and it's still rank so
if you want to get involved you still
can and that's how to get hold of one of
these as cheaply as possible but should
you get involved would you want to get
hold of one of these well that's what
I'm gonna be looking at here so other
than the fact that this device comes
with lots of modules lots of add-ons
things to lose if you're me the other
notable aspect of this device is its
heft this is a rugged device it's
supposed to be adaptable for
adventuresome type so if you go on lots
of hikes if you go rock climbing if you
go skiing then this is the phone you'll
want to bring with you that's the sales
pitch to that end it's incredibly
durable and can withstand all sorts of
attacks it's waterproof dust resistant
all that stuff that you'd expect it's
got bumpers around the edge it's
military spec it can withstand being
submerged in water 1.5 meters for two
weeks apparently which is quite
impressive it's got these old-school
flaps and it's thick and heavy
unfortunately is any Gorilla Glass 4
which is already slightly out of date so
that's a bit disappointing but other
than that this is a phone that should
have a hard time destroying so if you
were to drop it in a puddle or you to
run over it with your push bike then it
should be fine in theory I did actually
test it
there's some slightly drop testing
dropped into some muddy puddles and one
of the buttons which we'll come to in a
moment stop working and I don't know if
that's because of me or if it's because
of a quality control issue or what but
yeah something to keep in mind despite
being so thick and bulky I do you think
it has its own kind of rugged charm and
actually hate the look of it they've got
some nice touches around it's got this
kind of hexagonal pattern which kind of
makes it look a bit futuristic the
screws that are visible look like
they're meant to be there and to be fair
if you're so many needs a really rugged
phone chances are you're gonna add a
really thick case to it in theory this
doesn't need a thick case you might just
want a screen protector and so actually
the difference in size might not be that
noticeable if you're that audience and
this is a phone that really knows its
audience and it's not for everyone and
that's fine one other thing I'll say
that I didn't really like about the
design so much is the reflective screen
which obviously makes legibility in
direct sunlight a bit difficult which
doesn't make a lot of sense for a device
that you're supposed to be using
outdoors there's also no headphone jack
which kind of sucks but you can
understand why they admitted it and
opening up these flaps gets pretty old
pretty fast
other than the shininess the LCD screen
is nice and big and this fhd plus is
fine for media playback and the sounds
perfectly adequate as well what's really
cool is the number of buttons on this
thing and only do you have your usual
volume rocker and power button you also
have a custom button which you can set
to all sorts of different things you can
program single clicks double clicks
along clicks like I say mine stopped
working but in theory that's really good
and you get a camera button so what's
really good about that is that normally
when you get a custom button the first
thing a lot of people are going to do is
set it to launch the camera app but
because you've already got a camera
button here you can do all sorts of
things with that and that's going to be
really useful if you are at the top of a
mountain with thick gloves on or if it's
freezing cold and you don't want to use
the screen I would say though that this
button is a little bit easy to hit by
accident and that can be a bit annoying
but I'm sure you'll get used to it over
time in general this is a phone that
does require some learning you need to
develop the muscle memory for it in
terms of specs it's fairly middling as
you might expect you get a Helio P 60
chipset you get six gigabytes of RAM 128
gigabytes of storage which is quite nice
and performance is fine for swiping
through the UI
reading webpages etc
and you can even do some light gaming
something like pub G ran just fine on
medium settings the one module I didn't
get to try actually is a gamepad module
I guess it wasn't ready at the time they
sent this out for the review and it
looks quite cool it attaches on and lets
you play with physical keys however
given the chipset it doesn't really make
tons of sense seeing as this isn't
exactly a gaming phone and at the same
time it's a bit off brands as far as I'm
concerned I mean you're not gonna be up
mountain playing pub G probably so bit
random but I guess why not other than
durability something else that's quite
important for someone who's going on a
hike on adventure is the camera
unfortunately the performance of this
camera is really fairly middling you get
a dual lens camera at the back you can't
do bakka effects or anything like that
with it it's got an F 2.0 aperture which
isn't particularly impressive and
performance is just really average and
even poor in some cases I mean it takes
photos of stuff and endure some photos
come out okay there's not much
post-processing they're a bit bland to
put they'll do the job however when you
take it outside it really seems to
struggle with exposure even with the HDR
mode on which is off by default so you
get these white skies and these really
bland looking scenes Detailers a bit
lacking it seems to be over sharpened in
some cases like I say it's fine if you
want to just take photos of your dog to
upload to social media but if you're an
adventurer and you've just reached the
summit of an amazing climb and you want
to take out a camera and take a photo to
capture that amazing moment you're not
gonna want to do it on this one which is
a shame because that would have been an
obvious match that's for the
front-facing camera it's an 8 megapixel
camera doesn't do anything fancy would
have been so cool to have like a
wide-angle lens here so you could get
yourself and your friends at the top of
a mountain in general there's lots of
missed opportunities and strange design
decisions like the gorilla glass like
the reflective screen like the lack of
great front-facing camera but it's not
highly expensive device and considering
everything you get you can see why some
corners had to be cut the software
experience is built on Android 8.1 but
actually there is a fair amount of
customization here some of which is a
hit and some of which is a miss so you
get gesture controls which is really
cool so you can wake your phone by
wiggling it and you can launch apps by
wiggling it and that's really useful
again if you've got thick gloves on and
you also get a bunch of custom apps
which is really cool you get something
called the tool
which basically gives you access to all
sorts of things that take advantage of
some of the unique senses in here like
the barometer so you can measure
altitude and you can measure gradients
and you can even use it for hanging a
picture which i think is quite cool
there's a compass in here and that's all
pretty neat unfortunately there are also
some customizations I wasn't so keen on
for instance like Samsung you get a
bunch of duplicate apps in here it makes
more sense from Samsung Bing as Samsung
as a massive company I don't know why I
do G feels the need to give us their own
browser but it's there and you can't
delete it bit annoying not the end of
the world my slightly more obtrusive
perhaps is some of the aesthetic
decisions that design decisions around
the UI you get this kind of black gray
and gold color scheme or bronze which
looks nice enough but it's not so nice
on those big skeuomorphic icons which
unfortunately are also present in the
settings menu so you can't get rid of
them completely probably what you really
want to hear about is those modules so
how are they are they worth it do they
add much extra functionality well if you
go for the full caboodle then in the box
to get a wireless charger which isn't a
module but is a nice touch you also get
a puzzle which is weird
but other than that you get four modules
three of which I've been able to test
walk and talk hello
night-vision camera extra battery oh
it's an extra battery and there's a
gamepad that haven't been out the test
as well and if you back this product on
Kickstarter you'll either be able to get
the full kit with everything included or
you can buy just the phone and then
optionally buy additional modules just
picking and choosing the ones that you
need the modules clip on and off really
quickly using a magnet there's no need
to reboot the phone and in theory it's a
really cool concept extra battery you
already have in here a five thousand
milliamp hour battery there's actually
5050 or
that's a lot of juice and then when you
add this you get an extra five thousand
and so with that clipped on then in
theory you go for a long camping trip
you could for a long hike and really not
worry about having to plug in and charge
anywhere which is obviously really
useful if you're the sort of person who
does that kind of thing a lot then you
get the walkie-talkie the idea being of
course if you're somewhere that doesn't
get signal or if you want to spare your
data then you can speak to someone else
who's got another walkie-talkie it
doesn't have to be a do G just as long
as they're able to pick up the same
frequency which I don't know much about
walkie-talkies but that sounds good I
guess and the last module was the one I
was most excited about
and unfortunately the mo
disappointed with theory this is an
awesome idea I'd love a night-vision
camera myself however its performance is
really middling the low-light
performance of the main camera is
abysmal you won't really be able to take
any photos if it's even slightly dark
add this on and you get a significant
upgrade to the clarity unfortunately you
can only take photos in 1080p and
there's a big fish eye effect and so you
think well that's pretty cool until you
compare it to something like the note 9
and you realize that the note 9 is able
to take better low-light photos with no
gimmick with no reduction in quality
with no fisheye lens than this can with
that attachment rendering it almost
completely useless which is a big shame
I mean that's a bit of fun and if you
want it then sure it will upgrade the
camera you haven't here generally but
don't buy this thing because you want a
night-vision camera just don't but on
the whole what do I make of the digi s
90 well it's a really difficult one for
me to review fairly because I had a ton
of fun with it normally when I'm
reviewing a phone I use two litmus tests
and decide if I like them or not one is
how much am I looking forward to getting
back to using my daily driver than no.9
and the other is how sad am I to have to
give it back and the weird thing about
this one is that I was really sad to
give it back but also I couldn't wait to
stop using it which is a bit strange and
that's probably because it's a really
nice frame that might appeal to a very
specific group of people it's exciting
but it also has a lot of shortcomings
and setbacks so that makes it even more
niche someone who works in construction
who isn't hugely into technology might
enjoy having a really thick rugged phone
with a massive battery life that they
can throw around that can get dusty and
in theory other than this button it
should be able to stand up to that
punishment I'm pretty sure that's just
my model I wouldn't you know assume that
every phone is going to break like that
it's not coming back
likewise if you are someone who hikes
and explores and adventures and you want
a phone like this then this could be
really useful and some of the modules
could be handy maybe the walkie talkie
certainly the battery pack in that
scenario likewise it's useful as a
backup phone if you want something
that's tough and it's going to last a
long time if you haven't be going on a
camping trip even if you're not like an
adventurer type of an explorer
but most people I'm going to want to
frame this
big the shortcomings are a nuisance it
can be a pain to use so I really
wouldn't recommend this to the majority
of people and like I say certainly
knowing with a small pocket or small
hands but like I say I loved reviewing
it it was tons of fun and I think doogee
deserves some credit to trying something
different and being inventive so that's
they do GS 90 something really different
and really interesting and whilst it
might not be the best phone in the world
it did make me feel a bit like James
Bond for a little bit so I like it don't
necessarily buy it I hope you found this
video useful and interesting if you did
then please share around please leave a

you think of this thing maybe what other
