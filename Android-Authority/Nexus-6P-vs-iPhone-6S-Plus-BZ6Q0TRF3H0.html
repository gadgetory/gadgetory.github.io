different ecosystems finally go
head-to-head it's Josh of agar from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Nexus 6p
versus the iPhone 6s plus does I might
actually be kind of an easy choice here
because the iPhone 6s plus actually has
a lot of the same design cues and tropes
from the previous generation even the
button layout and pretty much everything
is in the same place and even with the
3d touch which we'll touch upon a little
bit later everything looks and feels
largely the same the rounded sides and
corners with this metal unibody actually
make for kind of a slippery design but
ultimately the handling is what you
would expect from a larger form factor
here and that is essentially the same
that you would get in the Nexus 6p but
the design is very new for the Nexus
line this time around well you have is
Huawei at the helm and they have put
flat sides around this 5.7 inch screen
that help with the handling because you
can get a pretty good grip on there but
it's still not ideal neither of these
devices are for one-handed usage that
black bar on the top covers up the
camera and its accessories and below it
is the fingerprint reader and of course
the Nexus logo in landscape now that
fingerprint reader is a big focus and
this time around and we'll also get to
that a little bit later in the hardware
section but ultimately both of these
devices really use metal as their main
q4 premium and in the Nexus 6p P stands
for premium and that's something that
you've already expected from Apple
iPhones up until now so really you can
take your pick but you're going to get a
very high quality device either way the
display is more of a spec battle here
because you get two very different
resolutions and even constructions in
these displays the IPS display of the
iPhone 6s plus comes in at Full HD
resolution and has a 5.5 inch size so
really is good for media and games and
even text viewing for the most part even
though it's text may not be quite as
sharp as the quad HD display here on the
Nexus 6p which has 2560 by 1440
resolution in this 5.7 inch display now
this is also of an AMOLED construction
which means that the deeper blacks
provide better contrast and actually the
colors are punched out a little bit more
so really in our opinion the Nexus 6p
does have a slightly better viewing
experience especially because of those
colors but even then you can
even get more out of this display
because the higher pixel density makes
text incredibly sharp we do think that
you'll have a good time in either of
these displays as quad HD and 1080p
aren't too far off the mark for daily
usage but if you are spec hungry the
Nexus 6p is obviously going to be your
choice performance is a little bit more
neck-and-neck however because you're
looking at two different ecosystems that
provide and demand different things from
their processors the Nexus 6p uses the
Snapdragon 810 with audrina graphics and
three gigabytes of RAM all of which are
the de-facto processing package for
Android and it does a great job of
letting the optimized and stock Android
marshmallow really fly we are able to
get through all applications and
elements of marshmallow and even gaming
has been really a treat but the same can
be said for the iPhone as well which
uses what might seem like an
underpowered when compared to Android
Apple a9 which is a dual core processor
backed by power VR graphics and 2
gigabytes of RAM now while that might be
an upgrade from before it still sounds a
little poultry when compared to very
powerful Android handsets but because of
iOS and its own optimizations it's still
able to really go by swimmingly no
matter what we were able to do on the
iPhone 6s plus we had a good time on it
even when it came to gaming as well
hardware is actually kind of a even
playing field because with the iPhone 6s
plus you had to contend already many
Apple users did with the lack of extra
features like the removable batteries
and expandable storage but that's also
the case with the Nexus devices but the
main trope here is the fingerprint
reader which everyone is talking about
especially with Nexus imprint and
Android marshmallow you basically just
have to have your finger on this back
area here and you'll be able to unlock
and wake the device at the same time but
on the iPhone 6s plus they have been
able to update the finger parameter
embedded in the home button so you don't
really have to leave your thumb lying on
the button you just have to press it and
because it's pretty much always firing
you'll be able to get in just fine when
it comes to the more conventional
offerings however you do have the
front-facing speakers dual stereo
speakers on the Nexus 6p which provide
great sound and a lot of body in that
dual setup but we will say that there is
some richness to the bottom mounted
speaker of the iPhone 6s plus still but
it definitely doesn't get quite as loud
now what the iPhone 6s plus is
definitely able to boast is a new
lair of centers underneath the screen
that allow for 3d touch it's able to
really tell just how hard you're
pressing on the screen and if you press
hard enough on icons or certain areas of
the OS you will be able to trigger even
more things to happen like shortcuts
into applications that otherwise you
would have to open it and then swipe and
press around in order to get to it's a
nice new layer to the inputs of iOS
which has otherwise been a pretty
formulaic experience for the last few
years and finally in battery the main
story here for us at least is that the
iPhone 6s plus does not have fast
charging now the battery of the iPhone
6s plus is able to go for a pretty good
time at least a full day but it's
standby time is something that we will
definitely highlight but standby time is
a focus of Android marshmallow as doze
is now added in doze allows for the
phone to really have a good standby time
as long as its sensors are not being
triggered you have to leave it face down
or face up and you pretty much just have
to not touch it but the standby time can
be pretty great but the 3450 milliamp
hour battery in the Nexus 6p goes for
quite a long time even with somewhat
moderate usage we've been able to go for
about a couple of days without really
needing to charge the phone but with
fast charging using the USB type-c
standard now we have been able to get
some great battery life on here by just
plugging it in for a little while in the
middle of the day
zero to 100 can be charged in about
ninety minutes which is awesome and
makes fast charging one of those
indispensable tools for Android when it
comes to the cameras we are actually
looking at two similarly SPECT camera
packages here with the 12 megapixel
iPhone 6s plus camera coming with
optical image stabilization which should
help it in lower light situations Google
tried to battle this however with a
larger sensor in the Nexus 6p that comes
with 13 megapixels and thus the larger
sensor should be able to bring in some
better light but when it comes to the
applications we really didn't see too
many differences here as both are pretty
much automatic point-and-shoot
applications you do get some extra modes
and both of them including panorama
photosphere and lens blur for the Nexus
and then the iPhone has time-lapse
hyperlapse and a couple of other modes
but ultimately aside from changing HDR
to auto or off or anything like that you
kind of have a point-and-shoot
experience for both of these cameras
when it came to camera quality however
usually it's a bit of a toss up but with
the next
slide we have a massive improvement in
what used to be a lackluster experience
the iPhones have always been known to
have some pretty good camera optics and
in this case the quality is still a
little bit better in the low-light
situations due to the OIS but the larger
sensor of the Nexus 6p is not all that
shabby either
but in brighter situations the Nexus
actually punches out the colors just a
little bit more so if that's more
enjoyable for you then you're probably
going to be picking the Android phone
but when it comes to detail and clarity
both of these cameras do very well it
just matters which of the color profiles
look a little bit better to you as far
as social media and maybe even some
production go you can use either of
these cameras for a daily companion when
it comes to shooting your memories and
finally in software we have Android
versus iOS the age-old comparison that
actually is a little bit easier to make
now iOS has been pretty formulaic and
you can pretty much expect the same
experience here you do have the home
screens with all the icons and some
extra information and controls if you
swipe from the bottom or the top or even
to the side depending on what it is that
you need like the control center coming
up from the bottom but iOS has added in
the 3d touch which is a big layer that
is added on top of what has been a
pretty familiar experience in iOS it
adds a layer of input that users can
take advantage of and we're excited to
see where it does go in the future
but ultimately iOS is eye candy for the
Apple users and everyone is pretty happy
with it generally when they get their
iPhones but now Android has really come
a long way and marshmallow brings some
refinements to its own formula it still
has the same tropes as well with Google
now over on the side in the Google now
launcher and the home screens can be
riddled with widgets because you have
all of your applications inside of the
app drawer which is now a vertical
scroll but from there you still get the
notification drop-down with the quick
settings and the additions that
Marshmallow puts in aren't necessarily
flashy but they're ultimately very
useful like app permissions AB
permissions do allow the user to have a
better insight into what applications
are trying to access in the phone and
after that now on tap provides an easy
way of searching what is already on the
screen and when it works it works pretty
well ultimately the experiences for both
of these phones is pretty similar now
because the app gap is not necessarily
that big anymore you can pretty much get
the same experience no matter which one
you pick so it just matters what you
want to have wrap
to run your overall app experience and
that will probably be the one that you
want to pick between these two this time
around you're going to be paying $749
total to t-mobile in monthly payments in
order to get the 16 gigabyte version but
if you want to bump up to 64 you have to
put down another hundred dollars on the
other hand the Nexus 6p is generally
considered just an unlocked device and
is not available for monthly payments on
carriers and for the Nexus 6p it starts
off at the 32 gigabyte model for 499
dollars fifty extra dollars will get you
the 64 gigabyte model and we do think
that you should get that one just to
have a little bit more space in your
phone and so there you have it for the
Nexus 6p and the iPhone 6s plus the two
purest and biggest actually experiences
you can get for both of these respective
ecosystems in the case of the iPhone 6s
plus it is a refining of a formula that
we are already pretty familiar with by
now but the addition of 3d touch does
allow it to provide a feature that we're
kind of excited to see where it goes in
the future but really it's the Nexus 6p
that has closed the gap between its
Android brethren and the iPhones mostly
because now that we have a Google
centric phone with stock Android on here
that is able to provide power and camera
quality that is on par with the iPhones
we do think that it deserves a lot of
credit in order to get the purest
example of what Android should be the
nexus is definitely where you should go
and the more premium of the two is one
of the best phones we've seen this year
if you want a large phone for large
experiences then of course you're going
to pick one of these two but if you are
already a purist for either of these
ecosystems then you know which one
you're going to pick but at least we
know that no matter which side of the
fence you pick the grass is definitely
going to be very green keep it tuned to
