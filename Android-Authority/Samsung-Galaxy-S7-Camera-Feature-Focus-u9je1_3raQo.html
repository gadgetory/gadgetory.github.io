Authority what's going on everybody and
every photo and video that you're seeing
in this camera shootout was taken on the
galaxy s7 a trip to the broad Museum in
LA is the backdrop for this camera
future focus but first we did want to
take a look at the front-facing camera
and it does provide some good quality it
is nice to use and is just wide enough
but you can still use the wide selfie if
you want to add more people in one thing
about the front facing cameras flash
however is basically just a very bright
screen but it still provides a somewhat
harsh light to the subject that said
however back to the brode we do have a
lot of pictures from here and I'm going
to do 100 crops from time to time just
to show you that the 12 megapixel
pictures of the rear-facing camera of
the galaxy s7 does lose just a little
bit of the sharpness when compared to
its 16 megapixel counterparts from the
galaxy s6 now again that is not to say
that the pictures are terrible by any
means they are still quite sharp it's
just that they aren't quite as crisp as
they used to be now another thing about
this batch of photos is that we're in a
less lit situation the lighting in this
part of the broad museum was not
necessarily ideal so what you're going
to find is that the white balance on the
camera is more towards the warm side and
that's something that in auto mode the
camera of the galaxy s7 does tend to do
quite a lot and like I mentioned before
and in the review the front-facing
camera of the galaxy s7 can record in
quad HD resolution which is incredibly
handy especially for anybody that's
looking to vlog or in the case of this
shot right here I just wanted to put the
camera down and be sure that I framed it
properly and I could use the
front-facing camera and of course the
viewfinder in order to make sure I got
the shot right 4k video recording is
available in the rear-facing camera
however if you turn on the 4k recording
you do lose some of the functions
including the software enhanced video
stabilization but oh is does tend to do
a pretty good job with stabilizing the
videos what I do like in video however
is taking advantage of the auto focus
now auto focus before you take your
picture is already pretty great but in
videos it does make for a pretty crisp
and clean
way of focusing on a subject we move
into a video installation and this was a
place that I can actually show why you
would use the pro mode over just the
auto mode all the time in this
particular photo in the auto mode it is
trying to expose for the entire picture
however I would like to make sure that
my brother is more backlit have more of
a silhouette and by going into the pro
mode and turning up the shutter speed
I'm able to achieve that particular
effect now moving into the top floor of
the broad museum the lighting was much
much better and you're going to see that
the pictures already have a better white
balance to them but this was also a
situation that I could have used for the
panorama mode now in this panorama mode
one thing to know is that on the left
the gentleman in the Hat was actually
walking while I was doing this motion
with the panorama and was able to stitch
him without having to have that blur
a quick note about sensor sizes and the
aspect ratios now the reason why all of
the photos are like this is because I
wanted to take advantage of the entire
12 megapixel sensor which is of a 4 by 3
size and ratio when you want to do 16 by
9 photos it will actually crop down the
sensor to a 9 megapixel photo and the
same goes for videos as well one thing
that I did notice is that by taking a
photo in the 4 by 3 ratio and then
hitting record for videos
it had a zoomed in effect the main
reason being that it had to zoom in and
crop the sensor so it seemed like
everything was a little bit more zoomed
in than it should be
now with HDR HDR is not something that
you can really have on all the time and
expect to have this kind of effect on
all the time you can have it on auto and
the phone will figure out in high
contrast situations to turn on HDR but
these are just examples of illustrating
what kind of situations HDR will
actually give you that more blown up
effect with the shadows that are raised
up and the highlights that might be
brought down for example in the sky
alright next leg of the day heading over
to Grand Central Market where we could
probably wait for about 4 hours for an
egg the hyperlapse mode is basically a
very speed up video but the galaxy s7
does do some of the work in terms of
stabilizing the footage now Grand
Central Market was another indoor maybe
less lit situation which provided more
examples of how the auto mode in the
galaxy s7 tends to go to the warmer side
of the temperature color temperature
that is when in lower light situations
but overall the results might be a
little bit mixed in terms of the auto
white balance but overall the detail and
the colors still look pretty nice and
you are always able to modify the
pictures in post and of course I have to
do the foodie shots in this particular
photo though it's another illustration
of how the sharpness when zooming into a
photo is a little bit less this time
around the very lines of the meat inside
of this burrito are not very crisp and
there's a noise reduction trying to
compensate for which makes the entire
area just look that little bit more
smudged out as we move into the final
portions of this camera feature focus I
did want to show a couple more photos of
HDR now the saturation in HDR photos
does get bumped up a little bit but as
you can see in these pictures and
these high contrast situations it's more
about bringing up the shadows for the
most part in order to even out to the
entire image and finally a set of lower
lower light situations now this was in
an indoor area where there really wasn't
a whole lot of lighting so what we're
going to do is zoom into these photos
and you can see that the details are
getting less and less which is to be
expected and the color temperature is
even more to the warmer side but what's
important to note here is that in these
situations it was really easy to get
these photos and they are really
workable the 1.4 micron sized pixels of
the s7 really do a good job of flooding
in the lights and that was the point of
bringing the camera from 16 to 12
megapixels so in these lower light
situations you will get very nice photos
even if one zoomed in you're going to
see the differences in terms of detail
now especially when you're outdoors and
there are like street lamps or any signs
in front of storefronts you'll have
blown out areas where those lights are
that's something you're just going to
have to contend with and you can expose
for them but then you're going to get a
high contrast shot it's in these
situations that HDR might help out a
little bit but overall the main thing to
take away here is that the low-light
performance of the s7 is definitely so
much better than it ever has been before
and so that should do it for this camera
feature focus on the galaxy s7 overall
it's a great package and a great shooter
to have especially as a companion on the
daily and even if the details might be a
little bit less that's something you're
really only going to see if your pixel
peeping the bottom line however is that
low-light performance has been bumped up
and the overall general performance in
more wild lead situations it's still
pretty much as good as ever with just a
couple of caveats from there however you
