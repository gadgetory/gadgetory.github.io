name is Kevin the tech ninja and this is
the basics of Android part 2 in this
edition I'm going to talk about how to
set up your Android phone how to use the
home screens and how to pretty much get
around on your Android device so we're
ready to learn let's begin so during our
last session we spoke about what is
Android and getting started with it we
also touched on a UI just a little bit
so now we're going to dig into the UI
just a bit more let's do a recap from
last video and this notification bar you
can access some quick toggles these
toggles depends on the version of
Android and skin you are using some
toggles may be visible by the phones may
require you to press a more button you
can simply press icons to launch
different settings to move between your
homescreen just swipe your finger to the
left and to the right when you reach the
end of the screen it would no longer go
to the next screen also there are
corresponding dots to show you which
screen you are currently located on
press the home button to return back to
the main screen to launch an application
simply press on the application with
your finger this will open the
application up and you are now in this
program to get out of it go ahead and
press on the home button or to go back
to the previous screen press on the back
button all right so let's expand upon
this you'll quickly learn that Android
is navigated via swipes pinches long
press and even taps out-of-the-box
depending on the skin of Android you
have will determine the launcher
regardless all launcher is pretty much
act the same
what makes Android really unique is that
it allows for widgets and application
icons right on your home screen many new
Android users will ask what is a widget
well a widget is a graphical element on
your home screen that offers data at a
glance for example you can add a sports
core widget so you can see all the
scores without going into the
application an app icon is what you
expect on the home screen you can press
the icons to open the application unlike
the other major phone operating systems
all the applications do not need to be
on your home screen because no matter
what stock launcher you use you have an
application drawer the application juror
holds all of your applications you have
inter
grid-view some grits go vertically and
some scroll horizontally depending on
the launcher you can access the widgets
from here as well put more on this later
finally shortcuts are actions within the
application some applications support
this feature but sometimes this is
forgotten about quite frankly I forgot
about it too actually I'm just adding
this into the writing right now because
it's something that's not used hardly at
all
but it's still a part of Android and I
still have to mention it although it
looks like google forgot about it too
because it's not in the newest launcher
hmm on the home screen you can press and
hold on a blank spot and you can access
the application shortcuts and widgets
from here as well the widget picker
shows the size of the widget prior to
plopping it down to your home screen
press and hold your choice to drop it on
the home screen you can even resize it
by pressing and holding on the widget
the grid size of the newest launcher
which is called the Google experienced
launcher is four by four on the most
popular Android devices which is
obviously Samsung it uses the touchwiz
launcher well touch woods uses four by
four grid as well and if for some reason
you don't like your current launcher you
can always download third-party
launchers from the Play Store I'm
actually a big fan of the third-party
launchers because you can really
customize the way you want your phone to
look you can change your grid size you
can change your icons you can have
control of your homescreen as I said a
few moments ago all of your applications
installed on your device will reside in
your application drawer by default this
is represented as an icon on your dock
and once you press the drawer then a
grid of all your icons show up and you
slide and flick your way between all of
your applications the application drawer
does a few more things besides launching
applications it allows you to move apps
to your home screen by holding down the
icon and dropping it on the screen also
you can press and hold the icon and it
gives you an option to uninstall the
application or just be able to access
the application info another way to
organize your applications is by making
application folders to make a folder
simply drag an icon into another one and
this makes a folder you can put this
folder into your dock by dragging it
into there as well once you open the
folder you can move icons around in
different orders and you can
so name the folder the top Barbie
Android device can't show several icons
like Bluetooth Wi-Fi signal NFC and
various system settings these dependant
they are turned on or active the time
signal and data you are receiving will
always be displayed on the left-hand
side of the bar is where you find your
notifications notifications are broken
down into two categories persistent in
standard persistent notifications stay
within the bar the whole time even if
you press clear or swipe them away it
remains one-way its use is to keep an
application open so the Android
operating system does not shut it down
the active notifications can be removed
usually by a Clear button or even a
swipe away these notifications come from
other applications or events just to let
you know what is going on any new emails
text messages Google Hangouts
notifications Miley Cyrus torque updates
will be shown here in notification bar
some notifications can be expanded if
they have more data than it shows you
can pinch the notification or press and
hold and slide your finger down to move
an icon to the dot first press and hold
to make it movable then drag it to your
dock the dock on most launchers can only
help five icons including the launcher
so make sure you have enough room for
first as I said before as long as you're
on the home screen these docked icons
will stay with you you can go to the
left or go to the right and these icons
always remain but once you open an
application or go into a different
screen the Doc's are no longer visible
