of innovation smartphones are becoming
more sophisticated but isn't a I first
approach right for a modern-day
smartphone let's find out it's near a
400 thority and this is the huawei mate
10 and mate 10 Pro the mate 10 follows
the trend of other 2017 flagships and
comes with a full view displayed that
essentially means it has smaller bezels
than previous years the mate 10 has a
5.9 inch qHD IPS display with 16 by 9
aspect ratio while the mate 10 Pro comes
with a 6 inch full HD Plus AMOLED
display with 18 by 9 aspect ratio both
screens also support HDR 10 so you'll be
able to watch HDR content natively
through apps like YouTube and Netflix
the switch to smaller bezels have
resulted in other changes to the design
both devices come with curved R is to
improve the in hand experience as well
as a signature horizontal stripe across
the camera most noticeable change
however is the fingerprint sensor while
the May 10 Pro keeps the fingerprint
sensor on the rail like previous years
the mate 10 has squeezed it below the
screen on the front the biggest star of
the show is the kieran 917 which is the
first smartphone chipset to come with a
dedicated neural processing unit for AI
while way says the MP u allows you may
tend to see what's around you and react
accordingly and this is most noticeable
in the camera when pointing at a subject
the NPU recognizes the type of subject
such as plant food or flower and adjust
the image accordingly both while taking
the picture and in post-processing
talking of the camera both devices come
with the next generation of lekha dual
cameras the main sensor is a 12
megapixel RGB sensor with OAS and the
secondary camera is a 20 megapixel
monochrome sensor the mate 10 is also
the first smartphone to offer F 1.6
aperture on both lenses which tops the
LGV 30 which offers it in its main
sensor only under the hood both devices
come with a flagship specs list but the
differences are quite pronounced the May
10 comes with four gigabytes of RAM and
64 gigabytes of expandable storage while
the May 10 pro has 6 gigabytes of RAM
and 128 gigabytes of storage that can't
be expanded the May 10 comes with a 3.5
millimeter audio jack while the May 10
pro relies on USB C digital audio only
the May 10 supports LT cat 16 which
offers data speeds of up to 1 gigabit
the second automate impro offer speeds
of up to one point to bigger bits per
second the make tempo also comes with
ip67 dust of water resistance which is
the missing on previous Huawei flood
ships both devices are powered by a four
thousand milliamp hour battery and
support Huawei super charge which
charges to 50% in just 30 minutes
the emui interface is often the most
polarizing feature on huawei smartphones
and last year's emui 5.1 was a welcome
step in the right direction this year
while he has jumped to emui 8.0 as both
devices are running Android Oreo out of
the box the company has also designed
parts of the interface with AI in mind
and these are most seen during day to
day use so we'll need to wait for the
full review to truly test these out that
said the MPO is said to offer contextual
suggestions such as enabling the reading
mode to dim the blue light when reading
a book and offering to save details when
taking a picture of a business card
alongside this one is also introduced a
new floating navigation table it can be
moved anywhere on the screen and offers
easy navigation options such as one tap
to go back a long press to go home and
swiping left or right to activate the
recent apps menu it's a little confusing
but you can enable the on-screen keys if
you'd rather have a more traditional
experience Huawei is also trying to
appeal to business users with the
addition of a single cable projection
mode that lets you make 10 connect to a
secondary screen the dock
less-experienced can either mirror or
extend your smartphone screen and you
can navigate the interface either by
pairing a Bluetooth keyboard a mouse or
by navigating using the mate 10 screen
itself when projecting your screen
causing other sensitive content won't
display on the big screen to ensure that
your privacy is respected the make 10
will be available in black champagne
gold pink gold and my personal favorite
maka Brown while the make 10 pro will
come in mocha brown titanium grey pink
gold and midnight blue the make tenon
mate temp Pro offer an interesting
insight into our ways overall smartphone
portfolio an AI first approach suggests
the company believes AI can allow its
smartphones to stand out from the
competition but the actual benefits of
this won't be clear until we've spent
enough time with each device we'll find
out in our upcoming review of both
devices but for now what do you think of
the make 10 and do you plan to buy it
