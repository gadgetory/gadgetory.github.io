the game of everyday fitness bands with
an offering that tries to bridge the gap
between SmartWatch and exercise tracker
did they get it right on the first time
well it's Josh regard for manager
Authority of what's going on everybody
and this is our full review of the
Samsung gear fit if you thought the gear
line of smartwatches was a little less
than accessible you will find a
refreshingly easy design in the gear fit
a module comprised of a 1.8 4 inch
curved display a single button a
charging connector and a heart rate
monitor on the back fits into a rubber
band that can be replaced with different
colors if you have ever used a fitness
FuelBand like the Fitbit or the Nike
FuelBand the gear fit takes on that
particular motif but adds in much more
functionality due to its unique display
experience and as far as the band goes
it is refreshingly easy to put on
compared to the gear smartwatches which
were a little confusing at first a
double pin fastener fits right into the
holes on the other part of the band
allowing you to easily dawn and remove
the gear fit without any fuss the
overall size of the entire set up is not
too bulky but it does dwarf the other
fitness bands out there that have a more
minimalistic design but again that is
because of the screen however overall it
doesn't weigh down your wrist at all and
after some time you're not even going to
notice that the gear fit calls your arm
it's home easily the most eye-catching
part of the gear fit is its vibrant
display you will undoubtedly be asked
what that is on your wrist when it goes
off for notifications or when you're
checking the time the touch screen
capabilities are easy to use and allow
for quick access to the different
functions touch sensitivity might be a
little spotty at times though as I was
sometimes forced to press a button
multiple times until I finally got in I
found the landscape orientation a little
odd at first prompting me to suggest
that you wear the gear fit backwards on
your wrist for better reading comfort
but that has been helped by the added
ability to make the display go into
portrait mode which is semi-permanent on
my unit now when you view your
notifications you are able to set it to
go landscape whenever you open one but
reading a whole notification in
landscape can lead to some uncomfortable
stretching of the arm and wrist
there's very little to take away from
the wonderful screen that is found on
this wearable and it makes us think that
if Samsung is able to put a nice curved
display on a wearable as easy to put on
as this then we're kind of excited to
see where this form factor will go given
how much or in contrast how little the
gear fit is supposed to do its
performance was never really in question
swiping between functions was smooth and
there were never any issues getting to
what I needed as far as battery goes it
is capable of going a couple days before
needing a charge but a couple days is a
little bit dwarfed by the other fitness
bands out there that because they are
more minimalistic can go for many more
days on end also be careful with the
charging module that snaps onto the back
of the unit it's really small and just
looks like a hunk of plastic meaning
that if you're not careful you might
lose it pretty easily ultimately it
always comes down to usage and in this
case we do have some SmartWatch
capabilities on top of fitness
capabilities but unfortunately the gear
fit falls under the usual Samsung Trobe
it tries too hard to be multiple things
at once without ever being very great at
any one of those things let's start off
with the main component fitness
functions for a fitness band like this
include tracking steps sleep and
distance based activities you won't be
getting much more use than that so those
of you who let's say exclusively lift
won't probably get much use out of the
gear fit the pedometer as a required
feature of any fitness band is
unfortunately pretty inaccurate with the
gear fit I was walking around the LA
Arboretum for a camera shootout one day
and it yielded me over 3,000 steps in
just one hour which seemed to be way too
inaccurate the other issue with the
pedometer and also the sleep tracker is
that you have to actively turn them on
and off before you actually do or
complete your activities tracking
Fitness on the other hand with the fit
allows for the recording of your
distance traveled how long the workout
was and also the general amount of
calories you may have burned and all of
this data goes into the s health
application which is pretty robust on
its own but anyone looking for more in
their workout data might not be
satisfied with this particular suite and
finally the heart rate monitor which
takes on the same motif as the one found
on the galaxy s5 itself when you use the
straight heart rate map it will only
give you single readings now I typically
use a polar
rate monitor that constantly tracks my
heart rate and when used up against it I
did find that the gear fit was more or
less accurate depending on how the gear
fit is snugly fit on your wrist it might
have a little bit of trouble getting an
accurate reading as long as you have it
maybe just a little bit tight so that
it's not really moving around too much
then you should be able to get an
accurate reading you also have to make
sure that sweat is not getting in the
way of the heart rate monitor looking
through your skin in order to find what
that is now you are able to have the
heart rate monitor on throughout a
workout which is great for the gear fit
and this is achieved by turning on a
coaching mode which will monitor your
heart rate and tell you if you should
take it easy due to a high bpm for the
most part though you should have a
little bit of information to know how
fast you should be going what your heart
rate should be it will mostly ballpark
exactly what your heart rate needs to be
so I would say consult a little bit of
extra information to make sure that
don't take the gear fit as the gospel
truth but ultimately the holes in
operation are what make the gear fit a
less than favorable companion for anyone
out there really into fitness it
requires a lot of personal input to make
its functions work the data that it
tracks for workouts and for let's say
sleep are ultimately basic and
ultimately minimal and while the always
firing heart rate monitor during
workouts does garner at some points the
gear fit doesn't necessarily bring a
whole lot else to the fitness band game
than just a pretty screen and finally
we'll end by looking at the other side
of the coin as a gear device SmartWatch
capabilities are also available you can
of course tell the time and get a quick
look at the weather with the home screen
the background of which can be cater to
a specific image using the gear fit
manager found in your galaxy phone find
my device is available if either of your
devices go too far from one another and
of course the media controller is also
there for you to skip songs or change
the volume on the fly which was used
most often in my experience
notifications are the marquee function
provided by having a nice screen but
like I alluded to before it's far from a
great implementation when using the gear
fits in portrait mode notifications that
come up are often scrunched up due to
the formatting issue of having the small
screen and like I said before you can
read your current notifications in
landscape but it does require a lot of
scrolling and it is also hard to read
without pretty much straining your arm
in order to line it up correctly and of
course the notifications are on a view
only basis you're able to set up quick
templates for responses but basically
you're going to be reaching for your
phone more often than not and so there
you have it the Samsung gear fit I can't
help but think that this is only the
beginning yes it falls short of being a
great fitness tracker it also falls
short of being a decent SmartWatch but
this screen on this wearable does show
that we have quite a bit to go when it
comes to wearable tech and this is not a
bad start and shows the potential for
our wearable tech this is the first
wearable capable of SmartWatch
capabilities that is as easy as it is to
put on and wear all day and having it on
will definitely help your geek cred but
the moment you realize you forgot to
personally turn on the pedometer is when
you realize this is more geek than
Fitness chic the first order of business
is fixing the current holes and then we
can only hope that Samsung will unlock
the potential of what was an exciting
development in the world of wearable
tech so as always thank you guys very
much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this review of the Samsung gear fit
unfortunately it is not everything that
we were hoping it to be but it does show
the potential of wearable tech
especially once in this interesting form
factor size so keep it tuned to Android
or thority for all of the best coverage
including our coverage of all the
flagship smartphones everything from the
Samsung Galaxy s5 to the Sony Xperia z2
we have a lot more coming for you in the
coming weeks especially with more phones
coming out the woodwork so hit that like
button hit that subscribe button and
then hit up Android authority comm
