year and you know what that means we saw
several great flight shifts announced in
the first half of the year but HTC opted
to hold off until now to invade layers
they did announce a para foam shortly
after CES
the HTC new ultra and play but neither
were regarded as flying ships from the
company now that they've seen what the
competition has done they're finally the
last of the bunch to take the wraps off
its latest hero device this is the HTC u
xi xi so-called truth black ships in
HCC's history expectations are riding
high with this one so it'll be
interesting to see how the HTC u 11 will
remain woven given what we've seen and
is out there right now say goodbye to
metal and hello to that familiar liquid
design language result in the HTC u
ultra and play it leverages the same old
metal glass construction and unibody
aluminum band with the same mirror esque
finish it's only adds a layer of luster
to the phone but just like before it's a
magnet for fingerprints despite that it
looks attractive but more importantly
its manageable to hold with one hand
love it or hate it
there's no headphone jack with this one
so you'll have to rely on the USB type-c
port thankfully there including a
brand-new pair of HTC u sonic headphones
which now features active noise
cancellation courtesy of the HTC u
Elevens audio processing
they've also tweaked the construction a
little bit here because it features an
ip67 rating the HTC you altered didn't
have that so it's nice to have it here
this liquid glass design language is a
step up over what we see in the LG G 6
but it's really tough say if it's better
looking than a galaxy s 8 while there
are a few iterative improvements with
the design they CC you 11 certainly has
the good looks in attracting our
attention part of the reason why it's
more manageable to hold it's because of
its screen it's a 5.5 inch quad HD Super
LCD 5 display with Gorilla Glass 5
obviously we can't complain about the
resolution and size it's more than ample
for VR purposes and you know what Super
LCD technology has always been superior
without door visibility under direct
sunlight so it's reassuring that the
same
down here with the HTC u11 this
definitely in flagship territory because
it's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon
835 now the u.s. parent will only reveal
with four gigabytes of RAM and 64
gigabytes of internal storage whereas
with the international model it will
have that and another one with 6
gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of
storage luckily we didn't see any
hiccups with the four gigabyte model in
our short time checking it out plus
there's expansion courtesy of its
microSD card slot the software
experience with Sansa is very similar to
the HTC u ultra they added this thing
called HTC edge sense like squeezing the
sides of the phone it offers quick
access to certain functions it's able to
recognize short and long squeezes so you
can program it to do things like turning
on the flash launching the camera taking
a selfie and much more essentially it's
a new form of shortcutting now is this
novel in a way maybe but there's still
some practical applications for it like
taking a photo underwater or maybe
turning on the flash in the frigid
winter without taking off your gloves
moving onto the cameras there's a 12
megapixel ultra pixel camera and the
Briere which features oh is a dual LED
flash and an F 1.7 aperture lens
complementing that is a beefy 16
megapixel front-facing camera with a
backside illuminated sensor now we can't
pass judgment just yet about it but HTC
assures that's going to be near or at
the top of many benchmark tests so
knowing what HTC has brought to the
table is it enough to compete against
the current lineup of flagships HTC
definitely had ample time to organize
and develop its flagship phone to make
it for mobile at the current moment
though it's honestly going to hinge on
one key factor and that's pricing so at
launch it looks like Sprint will be the
only US carrier to sell the HTC u 11
which is the price of roughly $700
attached to it that's right there with
the rest of the pack but HTC sweeten the
deal by giving away to amazon.com Sprint
unlock versions of the phones will be
made available through HTC and Amazon's
websites the price is more justified
than the HTC u ultra but it still has
some stiff competition if it proves to
be superior in key
like battery life performance and camera
it can absolutely bring back HTC to the
spotlight and that is our quick look at
the new HTC you 11 you guys one learn
