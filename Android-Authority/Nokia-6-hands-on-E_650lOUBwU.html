end rotor 40 this is the Nokia six we've
got our first preview of it back at MWC
but this is the final retail versions
available right now here in the US it is
the Amazon exclusive this is the one
we're checking out here it sells for
$180 which is a discount over the
standard price which is 230 bucks the
difference between the two is this one
of course will have those Amazon ads on
the lock screen it's going to try to
sell you some stuff of course that's the
only caveat about the handset but
besides that it's a stunning looking
phone that's big in design it is a
gorgeous phone that's because it's
constructed out of metal specifically
it's from a solid block of 6000 series
aluminum anodized and polish giving it a
substantial feel in the hand and for the
price point it's really impressive with
its design moving on to display it
measures in at 5.5 inches there's a
little bit of bezel on the left and
right sides it's pretty skinny for the
most part and it's more than detailed at
the price point again 1080p is expected
and that's what we get here it looks
nice colors are vibrant and so far it
has a pretty good brightness output so
when you get 480 bucks well we know here
6 here features a Qualcomm Snapdragon
430 CPU you have three gigabytes of RAM
32 gigabytes of internal storage you can
expand that because it has a micro SD
card slot feature is capacitive buttons
you have the fingerprint sensor which is
nice especially for its price point the
only thing here is going to be the micro
USB port on the bottom nowadays would
expect USB type-c but they opted to go
with a micro USB instead side of the box
it's running pretty smoothly with that
Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 chip for the
most part it's opening up apps
relatively quickly who knows how it's
going to run after those ads start
piling up I wouldn't really recommend
this handset if you're into gaming just
because this processor this chipset is
not really meant to handle more
processor intensive stuff and to round
out things it has a 16 megapixel rear
camera on the back
and you have an 8 megapixel camera on
the front but when I saw really quick
it's more than ample for quick shots the
convenience factor is there but who
knows what the quality is like so just
wrap up the nokia 6 here there are two
versions that are available right now
you can pick up the ramazan the standard
editions and unlock one you don't have
all the Amazon stuff or the ads in your
face that's price at $230 and if you're
willing to live with those ads you get a
$50 discount so $180 to pick up the
Nokia 6 the nice looking design premium
for the price point of course and
besides that if you're looking for an
entry-level phone without feeling too
cheap this handset seems pretty nice so
if you guys one learn more about the
endnote es6 you could check out our
