their devices on the rise we often find
ourselves having the need or simply the
desire to pick up cases and accessories
on a more regular basis whether it be to
protect or sometimes just to complement
those devices and with the market for
mobile phone cases being as large and
competitive as it is it isn't always
easy finding brands that truly take
pride in offering a quality product well
zeizel Wireless is one of those brands
this family-owned case manufacturer has
been diligently protecting our delicate
and indispensable mobile tech since 2006
and today we're taking a look at some of
their newest offerings from one of this
year's highest end flag ships with its
sleek and impressive curved glass on
glass design we thought the Galaxy Note
8 would be the perfect device to help us
out while we spend some time breaking
down to the design functionality and
real-world performance of a few aziz O's
lineup leading cases CISOs take on a
metal clad case they dubbed the atom
series is as well-constructed as it is
good-looking this super attractive
design consists of a high-grade airframe
aluminum bumper in combination with a
durable tempered glass backplate for
added protection now there are a few
things that set the case apart from
similar offerings to start wear metallic
bumper cases often utilize tiny screws
they get access which makes for a
lengthier installation process the Adam
takes a new approach with its unique
locking mechanism along the top to allow
for quick and easy installation along
the interior of the case we've got a
soft rubber liner that helps ensure it's
snug fit we'll also keeping the sides of
you know d.p from any scratches that
could occur from coming in contact with
the aluminum the tempered glass back
panel measures and it just under a
millimeter thick and is also trimmed in
this high-grade metal and other than a
little diesel branding towards the
bottom the hardened glass is crystal
clear allowing you to still enjoy the
beautifully designed facade of your note
while offering an additional layer
protection that isn't often seen with
metallic cases popping your phone in is
simple enough ensure the bumper and
backplate are properly aligned and is as
quick as snapping the lock closed the
precise fit overs a nice sturdy feel and
rattle free experience as if it was
crafted from a single piece of aluminum
the Adams framework has a beautiful
metallic flake finish that looks great
in contrast with our midnight black no
date taking a look around in addition to
the locking mechanism up top we also
have some small cutouts to keep the
metal from degrading the phone signal
strength on the sides we see buttons
made of
aluminum that sits pretty close to flush
if not ever so slightly raised off the
frame
despite that they still manage to have a
nice tactile and clicky response when
pressed along the bottom we have the
usual cutouts for the charging port
headphone jack speaker and s-pen and
with the amount of recess and obviously
zero given the aluminum
Ziza was made sure to leave just enough
lateral space in the cutout so you can
easily snag the s-pen with a fingernail
the cases angular design gives way to
soft fronted corners that sit
comfortably in the hand making a
pleasant to hold as far as protecting
your device the addams military-grade
jaw protection proves to hold up even I
was a little nervous with this one but
it survived multiple four-foot drop
tests meaning it should have no problem
handling a tumbler to something I
noticed is that zeizel loves to throw in
small accessories with their cases which
is great with the atom they decide to
include to a tempered glass screen
protector and this guide an optional
finger grip and ring standard adheres to
the back of the case and serves double
duty as a way to both prop up your note
for easier viewing as well as offering a
way to more securely grip your device
overall the atom series is truly a great
looking case that complements the Galaxy
Note 8 s already impressive design it
does a nice job of overcoming many of
the pitfalls that plagued metal frame
cases and it's available in five color
options including the blue you see here
as well as red silver gold and rose gold
the next case we're checking out is the
stylish static series this case looks to
bay there no date in color while letting
you express your personal style with its
trendy ultra-modern design this slim
dual air case is made up of a shock
absorbing TPU inner liner along with a
tough polycarbonate outer shell the
pliable TPU uses an impact dissipating
pattern to help with shock absorption
while the rigid outer shell is built to
take the brunt of any potential hit with
a moderately sized top and bottom lip
the static offers a solid face ton
design which will also help in the event
of a fall a quick tour around the case
and we see fully covered buttons as well
as ample sized cutouts for the headphone
jack charger and s-pen getting to that
as pen is made simple by way of the
larger opening that wraps around the
bottom of the case around back we find
the notates dual camera module
well-protected thanks for the raised
polycarbonate that frames its cutout I
really liked how the contour of the TPU
dipped down below the camera
it's a natural spot for your index
finger delay which is why well place
fingerprint scanners are put there so
with the underlying TPU being exposed it
makes for a really comfortable resting
spot for your finger while you're
holding the phone the static features a
built-in kickstand that can be used to
prop up your device for portrait or
landscape viewing the landscape
orientation sits around sixty degrees
perfect for watching video while the
portrait is closer to 45 it's a really
nice arrangement as the lower portrait
angle is more conducive for interaction
with the touchscreen and it's the
optimal position for getting some
essentially hands-free tasks done
without having to hold the phone when
closed the kickstands low profile makes
it barely noticeable when handling the
device the slim design makes it a
perfect fit in the hand while not
sacrificing on drop protection we were
more than happy with having a crack and
scratch free note after our testing now
the outer shell of the static comes in a
variety of colors we have black blue and
red options that feature the same matte
soft touch texture that we have here
while silver gold and rose gold colors
have more of a glossy finish then
finally there's the orange and black
colorway the only one of the bunch to
feature a colored TPU layer the Z's
ostatic series case combines a unique
and protective design with vibrant color
options geared towards balancing form
with functions
letting you stand out in a crowd show
off your new no date as well as
protected
with ultimate drop protection in mind
these next two cases are built to take a
beating
first up disease oh I on is an ultra
protective option that aims to provide
the highest level of protection in a
relatively slim and lightweight form
factor Ziza puts a big emphasis on edge
protection here with three fortifying
layers making up the framework we've got
two polycarbonate elements along with a
clear silicone shell that combined
reinforce one another to create a super
strong and rigid bumper now I say the
case is relatively slim because it does
add a fair amount of bulk to your note
but more importantly it provides a
substantial border around the entire
display for maximum job protection much
more than the previous cases we've
looked at but even with the added
thickness the ion case fits comfortably
in your hand thanks to its tapered sides
a soft touch coating and raised stiffled
pattern present on the lower trim the
portion of the case that actually rests
in your palm provides plenty of grip
along with a pleasant feel we have
molded silicone buttons that offer a
nice cushiony response as well as
protective flaps for the charging port
and headphone jack in order to keep dust
and other small particles from getting
into these important areas the silicone
also provides protection for the back of
the note and to protect the silicone
itself the surrounding frame keeps it
elevated making it less likely to be
scuffed up during usage now the one
drawback is clearly apparent but also
purely aesthetic because of this soft
and pliable nature of the material it
tends to dip slightly in areas and touch
the back of the device creating the
bubbly appearance you see here but it
has no effect whatsoever on the cases
performance the ion remains a largely
well designed case that provides an
impressive level of protection for those
who need it you'll sacrifice a bit with
the added bulk as you will with the
majority of heavy-duty cases but overall
the case achieves its goal of extreme
protection and does it with a little
style what more can you really ask for
the last case on today's list is a
popular one disease Oh both is well
known for its intricate hard to miss
design as well as the excellent drop
reduction it provides taking a quick
look around the perforated hard outer
shell is home to the unmistakable
slanting striations of the bulb add in a
soft touch matte finish and you've got a
case with a great feel in hand and
excellent grip on the interior there's a
pliable shock absorbing TPU layer that
provides a 360-degree cushion for your
phone to rest in the case teachers very
responsive covered buttons and large
shallow cutouts along the bottom making
it easier to access your headphone jack
charging port speaker and s-pen flipping
the case around the noted school camera
module is nicely protected thanks to the
raised polycarbonate rim surrounding it
now one of the nicest features of the
bolt has to be its outer lock and
kickstand when closed it sits completely
flush with the case and when locked in
the open position it's easily one of the
most stable kickstands we've seen narrow
wouldn't be in typical Z's of fashion
without some extras so the bolt also
comes equipped with a 360 degree
rotating belt clip holster a
quick-release lanyard and yet you
guessed it a tempered glass screen
protector to round out the package as
far as protection Diseases got you
covered here the super rugged dual layer
design has a very solid reassuring feel
that's only bolstered by its 12-foot
maximum drop rating though we stuck to
our various two and four-foot tests
needless to say the bolt easily managed
to keep our no-date looking new not only
did it keep our device safe during
testing but the case itself finished
without a scratch on it
overall the zeizel bolt is a super
durable and protective option for your
no-date its unique styling remains one
of its best features but there's plenty
else to like about the bolt well there
you have it guys a look at a few
standout cases in Z Zoe's 2017 lineup I
hope you all enjoyed the video and if
