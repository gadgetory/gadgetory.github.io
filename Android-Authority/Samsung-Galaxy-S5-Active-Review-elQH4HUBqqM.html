Android authority and the Samsung Galaxy
s5 maybe water and dust resistant but if
you live a very rugged lifestyle or just
happen to be a klutz and drop your phone
a lot that just might not be enough but
Samsung has got you covered with a phone
that's meant to take a lot of punishment
let's take a look at the Samsung Galaxy
s5 active so when looking at the galaxy
s5 active right away you're going to
notice the design is a complete
departure from the regular galaxy s5 but
it's not just different for the sake of
being different it's still rated ip67
making it dust and water resistant but
the added heft and bulk gives this phone
military grade specs meaning you'll be
protected against shock from drops up to
four feet on flat surfaces vibrations
extreme temperatures humidity and high
altitudes it's still entirely made of
plastic but this phone feels like a tank
and if you're curious the back is still
removable giving you access to the
battery sim and microSD card slot all
the buttons and ports are still in your
typical Samsung locations with the power
button on the right volume rockers on
the left 3.5 millimeter headset jack up
top and the microUSB port located on the
bottom covered by a flap the speaker is
still located on the back in the bottom
left corner and it sounds fine for what
it is but honestly it's nothing to
really write home about the buttons
below the display however are very
different instead of your typical
Samsung home button flanked by
capacitive keys all the keys are
entirely physical sort of adding to the
ruggedness of the phone the buttons are
very nice and clicky but since you don't
have the standard Samsung home button
there's no fingerprint scanner built-in
and depending on how you look at it that
may or may not be a compromise if you're
a fan of the heartrate monitor on the
standard galaxy s5 it's still there if
you want to use it and it works exactly
the same so that's all I'm really going
to say about that now you might have
noticed an extra button sitting right
above the volume rockers a button you
don't get on the normal s5 this is what
Samsung calls
the active key pressing it takes you
into the activity zone app which gives
you access to a barometer providing
atmospheric pressure and elevation a
compass flashlight and stopwatch so
Samsung is really expecting you to take
this phone along on some very extreme
activities on top of opening up activity
zone a long press of the active key will
open the camera and once inside the
camera the active key serves as a
shutter button allowing you to take
photos with the s5 active underwater
another feature you can't do what the
standard s5 if you remember the S 4
active from last year there was quite a
bit of compromise especially when it
came to the display but that's not the
case this year with the s5 active you
still get the same 5.1 inch Super AMOLED
display with 1080p resolution that you
get on the standard s5 that's very
bright and beautiful with punchy colors
great viewing angles and outdoor
visibility making it still easily one of
the best displays that you can currently
get on a mobile device so whether you're
taking care of business watching videos
or playing games this display should
provide for a very enjoyable experience
no matter what you're doing the s5
active is still packing the same
Snapdragon 801 processor Adreno 330 and
2 gigs of ram as the s5 so there's been
no changes here either and performance
is exactly what you might expect from
high-end flagship specs it's very fast
in day to date usage and everything
performed just fine in my experience
whether it was swiping through home
screens or navigating through various
parts of the UI opening and closing apps
multitasking playing games for hours at
a time I didn't run into any real
problems at all there may be the
occasional TouchWiz lag here and there
but for the most part it's a very fluid
and responsive experience that many
people should have no problems with the
16 megapixel sensor on the galaxy s5
also carries over to the s5 active
including the camera interface and there
certainly aren't any shortages when it
comes to manual controls and features
and Samsung's camera app many of the
features that you know and love like
Beauty face dual camera eraser drama
shot and selective focus mode are all
here and while
Amazon's camera interface certainly
isn't the most simplistic and could be a
little too cluttered for some it does
offer a lot of control as far as picture
quality goes it's exactly what you might
expect from a 16 megapixel shooter
photos are very sharp and crisp and what
16 megapixels you've got plenty of room
to play around with when it comes to
zooming and cropping color reproduction
is really nice with very vibrant colors
and I notice this camera always does a
great job with figuring out the
appropriate exposure leading to a lot of
very well balanced shots even outdoors
on a sunny day dynamic range is already
pretty good as is but HDR still gets the
job done in bringing out more detail
without the over aggressiveness that
some other smartphone cameras tend to
have low light photography does leave a
lot to be desired with the shutter
speeds slowing down drastically
especially with picture stabilization
turned on and photos lose a lot of
detail and pretty much turn into a noisy
mess
despite the lackluster low-light
performance this is still a fantastic
camera and is definitely one of the best
smartphone cameras currently available
as far as the battery life is concerned
the 2800 milliamp hour battery while not
the largest should be enough to get most
people through the day with average use
I pretty much had no problems making it
through the day whether I was checking
social networks watching YouTube
browsing the web taking photos or
playing the occasional game and I
managed to consistently get between four
and a half to five hours of screen on
time so battery life is pretty solid
and obviously if you need to get even
more out of your battery Samsung does
include their power saving and ultra
power saving modes to help you get the
most out of your s5 active on the
software side of things the s5 active
comes with Android 4.4.2 out of the box
with the latest iteration of Samsung's
TouchWiz which has already been covered
at length so I'm not going to go too in
depth with it but TouchWiz is still
TouchWiz with a lot of very bright
colorful icons and UI elements my
magazine still lives one swipe to the
left of your main home screen and the
settings menu is still just as difficult
to navigate as ever
all of your usual features that you've
come to expect are all still here as
well like multi window smart stay smart
pause and air gestures while TouchWiz
certainly isn't my favorite when it
comes to manufacturers skins it's
definitely an improvement over previous
iterations but it still has a long way
to go the Samsung Galaxy s5 active is
available now in three different colors
titanium gray camel green and ruby red
it's an 80 exclusive and you can
purchase it on a two-year contract for
one $99.99 or obviously buy outright for
the price of six hundred and sixty
dollars which is pretty much the same
price as the regular s5 and rightfully
so because at the end of the day this is
a high-end flagship in a more ruggedized
body again this phone isn't going to be
for everyone and I'll admit it certainly
isn't for me but it's a great option for
someone who lives a very rough lifestyle
or if you're just the type of person
that isn't very good at taking care of
your phone and you need a phone that can
take a lot of punishment then the s5
active is certainly more than capable
but that is it for this review hopefully
