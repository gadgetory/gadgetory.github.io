two Falls could definitely be great gift
ideas because they are probably the best
ones you can get for such a low cost
hello everybody I'm crystal and this is
the oneplus X versus the Nexus 5x first
let's talk about the price of these
phones because that's what makes them so
special the Nexus 5x are set 379 for the
16 gig variant and 429 for the 32 gig
version and that's a great price but the
oneplus X beats the Nexus 5x by a huge
margin at its 249 price point although
you're stuck to the 16 gig version and
yet that's pretty low but it's even more
shocking once we jump into the specs the
Nexus 5x does cost 52 percent more but
you do get some nice extra additions so
keep these prices in mind during this
review with design we're talking plastic
versus glass now you would think that
cheaper oneplus X would be built from
plastic while the $130 more Nexus 5x
would be built from the premium feeling
glass but no this is not the case and
this is why we're all shocked at the
oneplus X s price point this phone does
not feel cheap at all it's build feels
fantastic and very premium with his
glass backing and metal frame and that
metal frame has some micro cuts that
help give it a nice grippy texture and
it isn't too bad to look at either when
looking at the front it appears that
there are no side bezels at all which
makes this phones design even more
beautiful however it's a bit of an
illusion as you'll see when the screen
turns on still though this film looks
and feels very premium much more than
the more expensive Nexus 5x the Nexus 5x
still manages to look very sleek with
his Nexus logo running along its back
and yet when picking up the phone
due to its plastic build it may feel
cheap compared to the oneplus X but
there shouldn't be any build quality
where ease LG the designers of the Nexus
5x did a great job making the phone feel
very high quality given its plastic
build however the oneplus X still has
some more nice design elements over the
Nexus 5x like ass thinness it's a full
millimeter thinner although with the
plastic found on the 5x the oneplus X is
a little heavier just by hair at an
extra 2 grams of
course this is unnoticeable but these
are two of the latest phones on the
market right now you'll find a headphone
jack on the bottom of the 5x while on
the oneplus X is at the top but this
comes down to personal preference volume
and power buttons are found on the right
and there's no question once again that
the oneplus X is buttons are superior
due to their metal build with is even
smaller micro cuts to give both the
power and volume buttons a nice texture
on the Nexus 5x they're more of plastic
rectangles that don't feel the greatest
and also don't support any textured
patterns so it can be a little hard to
differentiate between the buttons
charging ports are found on the bottom
although while oneplus decided to revert
back to the market USB the Nexus 5x
features a new USB type-c port which we
really prefer and we'll get to more that
later overall both phones feel great and
impress us in their own ways but make no
mistake the oneplus X is a much more
enjoyable phone to feel in the hand both
phones offer decently sized screens at 5
inches on the oneplus X and the larger
5.2 inch screen on the Nexus 5x and
although this makes this phone a little
bigger all around they both are the
perfect size for one-handed use in terms
of quality the oneplus X is display will
most likely be the one you prefer
they're both full HD
but while the Nexus 5x is your standard
LCD the oneplus X force an AMOLED panel
so immediately you'll notice very deep
and true blacks where the pixels don't
even light up under the black portions
of the image that the phone is
displaying and by default the oneplus X
is set to system wide dark mode so menus
like settings and even the App jar are
true black making the wars and apps pop
which creates a more immersive
experience like I said before although
oneplus does quite tricky with this no
side bezel illusion with a system-wide
dark mode and a black homescreen it
really does look like a bezel this phone
the 5x still has a nice screen although
that backlight is definitely noticeable
when trying to display black images and
there's more of a ghosting type effect
noticeable on the Nexus 5x as well when
triggering fasting animations when
comparing the two colors seem much more
natural and well colorful on the oneplus
X white seem more realistic as well with
the 5x Wiese appearing a little greenish
really when setting these two phones
side-by-side the whole display of the 5x
appears as if it's sitting underneath
the haze there is one thing that the 5x
has going for it though and
that's is brightness if you're somebody
who's outside a lot the 5x will
definitely give you less frustration but
indoors the oneplus X offers a more
immersive viewing experience
and although the 5x offers a larger
display most of the time you're going to
have your navigation buttons on the
bottom sure that's like almost every
Android phone but with the oneplus X you
can choose to have no on-screen
navigation buttons and instead use these
capacitive buttons found on the bottom
these buttons help actually make the
phone's display feel bigger than the 5x
so that's definitely something to
consider too so far the Nexus 5x seems
to be having a hard time catching up to
the oneplus X but this all starts to
change when it comes to hardware inside
we have a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 808
processor on the Nexus 5x that could
also be found in a lot of flash chips
this year while the oneplus X 6 to the
801 now the oneplus X does have an extra
gig of ram over the two gigs down on the
5x and although it only comes in 16 gigs
of storage you do have access to a
microSD card slot around the Nexus 5x if
you want more storage you'll have to pay
extra for the 32 gig and you'll be stuck
at that but of course the Nexus 5x has
one huge trick up its sleeve and that's
its fingerprint scanner it's located
right on the back below the camera and
really is a great placement this scanner
is very fast too and very reliable it's
a great feature to have and
unfortunately oneplus did not include
their fingerprint scanner on their X
model now one hardware feature that is
missing on the oneplus X but found on
the Nexus 5x is a front facing speaker
is located on the bottom front while the
oneplus X is is located on the bottom
left next to the charging port now
usually we'd say that front facing
speaker is better than any speaker
located on the bottom or the back but in
this case I actually prefer the oneplus
X a speaker even when facing away from
you towards the ground you can put the
volume up on the oneplus X a speaker
about 75% before starts clipping and
about 95% on the 5x and still the
oneplus X s speaker is louder even
without it facing the viewer the 5x
seems a little more muffled as well
compared to the oneplus X is more
emphasized trouble both speakers are not
the greatest and both will do the job if
you're not listening to music both
phones do include LED notification
lights to help sing if you're all caught
up at a glance also the low priority
mode slider makes a return on the
oneplus
Exce allowing an instant and easy way to
silent your phone is a really great
button to have and it saves a bit of
time battery life on both devices are
pretty good but with the five X's extra
bump in thickness LG was able to cram a
2700 milliamp hour battery into it while
oneplus chose to have a smaller 2525
million barrel battery to keep its nice
thin design and the difference is
exactly what you would expect with an
average of three hours of screen on time
with the oneplus X for me that's very
good I have all my accounts on sync and
really take a lot of snapshots and
pictures all day long so I was very
happy with it but you do manage to get a
little more juice out of the Nexus 5x
averaging about three and a half hours
of screen on time there is one thing
though when it comes to the oneplus X
and that's mostly for users in the
United States the phone doesn't have
some mobile data bands and that could
affect users on AT&amp;amp;T as well as t-mobile
where you won't be able to get an LTE
signal and instead will be stuck with 3G
the best thing about owning a nexus
phone is that you're going to be the
first to get updates when Google
releases them which is why the Nexus 5x
is running Android marshmallow 6.0 right
out of the box while the oneplus X is
running Android lollipop 5.1.1 another
great advantage is that on a nexus phone
like the 5x you'll always be running
stock Android with the software being
bloatware free simple and controlled
directly by Google stock Android creates
a simple and worryfree experience and
with oneplus is oxygen OS UI running on
the oneplus X updates will roll out much
slower but other than that you can
expect a very similar stock Android
experience not much has changed menus
and notification panels have not been
touch aesthetically and overall oxygen
OS runs much like stock Android but with
a lot of very useful features like I
said earlier you can turn on a
system-wide dark mode which turns things
like settings the app drawer and the
notification pull down a darker shade on
the 5x you'll be set to your standard
white menus gestures are available to
like double tap to wake and draw certain
letters to open up apps and more this
can all be very useful and unfortunately
are not found on the 5x but with this
being non stock Android companies like
oneplus can partner up with app
developers to pre install apps on the
phone and yeah there's a lot here on the
oneplus X it comes with a very outdated
looking Google
on the home screen along with the
battery saver turned on to fill your
notification jar and some other speed
boosters and spam cleaners which is
quite unfortunate however you can
disable them of course with the battle
between 808 and 801 Qualcomm Snapdragon
processors and two gigs of ram versus
three gigs I came to a very simple
conclusion the oneplus X is consistently
okay nor Hubble crashes ever but it
definitely doesn't fly while the Nexus
5x is consistently great with rare
instances of apps crashing or the phone
freezing on the oneplus X animations
will consistently be a little choppy not
too much but they are definitely
noticeable like when you're flying too
recent app screens on more graphic
intensive games the frame rates really
suffer and this makes for a very poor
gaming experience loading times will be
a lot slower though when compared to the
Nexus 5x which performs exceptionally
well gaming on the 5x is really good
maybe a frame will drop here and there
but for the most part games run buttery
smooth you should have no problems with
it like I said the Nexus 5x is
consistently smooth all around you don't
notice any choppiness and animations
that you would find on the oneplus X but
you will run into big performance issues
sometimes it's very rare mostly having
to do with the camera app it'll just
crash sometimes and other apps may pause
for a while until they finally launch
yeah the majority of time you won't run
into these problems but most likely you
run into one of these bugs sometime down
the road we're in a few weeks of testing
the oneplus X we've had no big problems
like this there is some silver lining
with the 5x issues though and that of
course has to do with it being a nexus
when Google has a fix to these problems
you'll have them fixed immediately
usually when it comes to phones it's
cheap you're not going to get much when
it comes to the cameras but the shooters
on these phones are actually very good
however we have a very clear winner now
although the 13 megapixel sensor on the
oneplus is larger than the 5x is 12
point three megapixel the actual pixel
size that the 5x sensor creates is much
larger similar to a pixel size that you
find in some real point-and-shoot
cameras so in the end you can expect
much more detail with the 5x the 5x has
laser autofocus where the oneplus does
not and unfortunately neither of these
phones have optical image stabilization
so let's hop right into these pictures
just taken out of the pocket and
immediately
snapping a picture the oneplus X tends
to have a softer image while the Nexus
5x seems to be a little sharper which in
some scenarios could be good or bad it's
up to your preference but in some
outdoor shots I do like the oneplus a
shot a little more mostly due to the
coloring there's a lot more saturated on
the oneplus and although maybe not as
color accurate as a 5x I do think it
tends to have the preferable picture now
both phones do have a habit of
overexposing but that's what HDR is for
right well you would think so but the
HDR and the oneplus almost does nothing
take a look at the sky with HDR off and
HDR on it's still really blown out but
on the 5x we have something called HDR
plus so yeah it acts as normal HDR
taking two different exposures and
merging them into one photo but it also
gives a lot of image processing
depending on the photo we can definitely
see the sky after we turn on hdr+
and really you're never going to have
any under or over exposing with HDR plus
on and even though the colors are nice
on the oneplus X I'm sure most would
prefer a better exposed photo over a
more saturated overexposed photo in
low-light HDR on the oneplus suddenly
wakes up and really gets a lot more
light into the picture we're on to 5x
you don't need hdr+ to get a bright
picture but it definitely doesn't hurt
to turn it on to get a bit more color
and make it even brighter really they
shower plus found on the 5x really helps
a ton and in low-light really pulls
ahead of the oneplus X when it comes to
video both phones create some pretty
shaky video without any sort of optical
image stabilization but things are much
clearer and sharper on the 5x whereas on
the oneplus we have more of a smooth
rendering of objects which isn't very
flattering some more features of 5x has
going for it it's his ability to shoot
in 4k and slow-mo at 120 frames per
second two features that cannot be found
on the oneplus X when it comes to the
front-facing cameras once again the
oneplus offers a higher megapixel count
at 8 megapixels over the 5 megapixel
found on the 5x although just like the
rear-facing camera you're going to have
a much better time using the selfie cam
on the 5x even without his ACR plus mode
the 5x is a lot more detail than the
oneplus pictures are a lot clearer
colors are better and expose a little
bit better play you crank on the HDR
plus and the 5x is a clear winner there
is a beauty mode on
one plus a selfie cam but most people
won't even bother to use this and the
quality without it is still very soft
which gets rid of the details like
blemishes already overall you're going
to have a much better time snapping away
and showing your friends your photos
taking on the 5x rather than on the
oneplus X now really both phones are
fantastic phones and really shocked all
of us when it comes to price for the
quality although when first picking up
these phones is tempting to say the
oneplus X has a better value it's a
hundred and thirty dollars cheaper yet
feels 130 dollars more expensive with
this beautiful glass back that sits
between this metal gold frame along with
this very nice AMOLED panel with great
colors but once you start doing work on
the phone you start to see that it's a
$249 value for a lot of people a better
camera better battery better gaming and
better software experience is much more
important than a premium design but not
everybody of course for me I love an
amazing camera fast updates and a bigger
battery so I would spend extra bucks on
the Nexus 5x but if you appreciate a
more luxurious looking device and your
big movie watcher who does in game or
you can get by with a decent camera
you're going to love the oneplus X and
of course you can't regret what you get
for that price if you actually get sent
an invite of course well that's about it
