Android Authority and we were expecting
to see two Galaxy s6 is here at MWC 2015
and that is exactly what we got so let's
go ahead and take a closer look at the
Samsung Galaxy s6 edge the big news with
samsung's latest flagship offering is
the galaxy s6 and the s6 edge is the
move away from the plastic build
material to a more premium look and feel
with an aluminum frame and glass back
these devices now offer the high-end
quality that many have been wanting for
a long time from Samsung it's still a
Samsung device though so you do have the
tactile home button up front integrated
with a fingerprint scanner and flanked
by capacitive back and recent app keys
the overall aesthetics will remind you
of previous generations only in a more
refined body of course like its namesake
the Note edge the Galaxy s6 edge earns
its name from a curved display edge but
unlike its larger sibling there isn't
just one but rather both sides of the
display featuring curved extensions in
terms of handling the edge will
definitely take some getting used to
especially with it now being on both
sides but the comparatively smaller size
of the s6 edge will make it easier to
hold on to the phone Samsung finally
made the much-needed change in terms of
build quality but unfortunately this
move wasn't without its compromises for
starters the battery is now not
replaceable and secondly microSD
expansion isn't available anymore
both features that a lot of fans truly
appreciated and finally because of how
thin the device is the camera module at
the back does tend to stick out a little
bit which could be a problem when
placing the device on a flat surface
it'll be interesting to see how fans
react to these changes to accommodate
the premium build quality but as far as
the look and feel in the hand goes
there's no denying that it's a big
improvement save for the edges things
are mostly identical between the s6 and
the s6 edge when it comes to the display
the edge also features a 5.1 inch Super
AMOLED display with a quad
HD resolution resulting in an impressive
pixel density of 577 PPI as is always
the case with Samsung displays you get
deep blacks bright and vivid colors
great contrast brightness and viewing
angles again like the s6 the edge
iteration also packs an Exynos 7420
processor backed by three gigabytes of
RAM Samsung flagships are always on the
cutting edge when it comes to power and
things are no different this time around
along with an improved experience on the
software side of things performance
should be of no issue for this
smartphone and other hardware you get
either 32 64 or 128 gigabytes of
on-board storage but as mentioned it is
not expandable any further a full suite
of connectivity options are available
and making its way from the galaxy s5 is
the fingerprint scanner up front
integrated into the physical home button
as well as the heart rate monitor which
can be found next to the camera module
when it comes to the battery the s6 edge
packs a rather small 2600 milliamp hour
battery but it's still bigger than the
normal s6 while the battery capacity
might result in some concerns especially
with it now powering a quad HD display
the new Exynos processor is said to be
quite frugal in its power consumption so
things might not actually be too bad
when it comes to the battery life while
the battery is not removable it does
come with fast charging capabilities
with Samsung claiming that you can get
up to two hours of video playback time
back after charging the device for just
10 minutes the s6 edge now also supports
wireless charging and the great news is
that with both the WPC and PMA standards
supported you don't have to worry about
what charging pad you use the galaxy s6
edge comes with a 16 megapixel rear
facing camera with smart optical image
stabilization and a 5 megapixel front
facing camera with a 90 degree wide
angle lens which is great for all you
selfie lovers out there some nice
features available include a double tap
on the home button to launch the camera
app which is claimed to happen in only
0.7 seconds the rear camera has a new
feature called try
I can autofocus which tracks moving
objects in the frame such as moving cars
or kids the app comes with all the
features we've come to expect with a
revamped HDR mode as well the new auto
HDR mode now automatically turns itself
on when the camera thinks it needs it on
the software front the galaxy s6 edge is
running Android 5.0 lollipop out of the
box with TouchWiz on top TouchWiz looks
just about the same from previous
generations with only a few lollipop
related changes the good news is that
the number of pre-installed apps have
been cut down drastically with users
given the choice to install more if they
want to the curve display sides of the
s6 edge offer similar functionality to
what you get on the note edge with a
couple of useful additions firstly you
now have the ability to assign different
colors to up to five contacts and you
can now know who is calling from the
glowing edges even when the phone is
placed facedown the edges can also show
you notifications like calls texts
whether social media feeds and more and
there you have it for our hands-on of
the galaxy s6 edge there's definitely a
lot more to come so make sure you stay
tuned for the rest of our Mobile World
