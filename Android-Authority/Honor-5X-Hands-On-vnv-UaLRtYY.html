Authority and as we reported a few weeks
ago
honor has finally launched in the US
with the honor 5x at its press
conference here today at CES 2016 the
first honor smartphone for the US market
brings an all-metal build a OneTouch
fingerprint sensor and dual SIM at an
affordable price this is our quick
hands-on in first look of the honor 5x
so jumping right into the display on the
front d5x has a 5.5 inch full HD IPS LCD
display which offers sixteen point seven
million colors and a pixel density of
401 PPI unlike the Huawei p8 the honor
5x has small bezels on either side of
the display and large bezels above and
below the screen the honor 5x is being
powered by an octa-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 615 processor with 2
gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
internal storage and the micro SD card
slot can expand these storage by a
hundred and twenty eight gigabytes or be
used as a secondary SIM card slot like
other Snapdragon 615 devices the
performance is reasonable but we've
noticed some minor hiccups in the user
interface the honor 5x measures an 8.1
millimeters thick and weighs in at 158
grams which isn't the lightest phone in
the world but it's definitely acceptable
for an affordable smart phone the extra
thickness does have a benefit with
Huawei claiming the 3000 milliamp hour
battery can last for over 1 day for
heavy users at the bottom of the honor
5x comes with a mono speaker placed
inside machine drilled holes and Huawei
has chosen not to include USB type-c and
instead has opted for the more
traditional microUSB port the honor 5x
runs on android 5.1 lollipop with
Huawei's emotion UI 3.1 on top and
there's a planned upgrade for
marshmallow in the works on the back the
5x has a brushed aluminum finish and has
a 13 megapixel camera with the OneTouch
fingerprint sensor underneath the camera
has a 28 millimeter wide angle lens with
five elements eff 2.0 aperture a blue
glass infrared filter and a single LED
flash the front camera is a 22
millimeter wide angle 5 megapixel camera
with F 2.4 aperture 4 elements blue
glass infrared filter and 720p HD video
capture like most on ur smartphones the
5x has an array of connectivity options
including gsm and cdma support the honor
5x supports all US networks and is
available now for just $199 like
previous honor smartphones the honor 5x
offers impressive specs at an affordable
price tag and honors first American
smartphone could prove to be an
excellent launch pad for the company
