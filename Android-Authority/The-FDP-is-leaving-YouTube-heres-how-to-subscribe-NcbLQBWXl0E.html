Hindy and today I have some bad news we
will no longer be publishing the fdp
podcast on YouTube now some of you are
probably wondering just what in the hell
I'm talking about the ftp is the android
authority podcast where we talk about
tech stuff it is an audio only podcast
but it is a lot of fun in you should
check it out you just can't do it on
YouTube anymore because we're not gonna
do it there since it is an audio only
podcast the idea to put it on YouTube
but probably not our best decision in
many of you didn't like it anyway but
don't worry you can still listen to it
every week or whenever josh decides to
release them you have three really good
options the first method is with your
standard podcasting application we are
on the itunes so you iOS users can
simply find us there for the rest of you
any podcast application that scrapes
itunes will do the trick including free
ones like dog catcher or much better
paid ones like pocket casts if you want
more podcast options we have an article
that outlines the best podcast apps and
you can find that in the video
description below if you don't want to
do the traditional podcast app
experience you can also find us on
stitcher radio simply download the
application or hit up the website and
search for android authority and we
should pop right up and for those who
have been pining for us to get a
SoundCloud account good news is we now
have one hit us up at soundcloud.com /
android authority to find all the latest
ftp episodes yes you can also use the
application and we'll have that link in
the video description below and that's
it folks those are your three ways to
subscribe to the fdp and we'll have a
bunch of links in the video description
below in case you've forgotten any of
them also don't forget to check out
android authority calm / podcasts with
an S at the end and our social media
posts you can also discuss at any time
with us by using the hashtag fdp on
Twitter or Google+ I promise we'll find
it and that's it for this one folks
we'll see you next time on the fdp</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
