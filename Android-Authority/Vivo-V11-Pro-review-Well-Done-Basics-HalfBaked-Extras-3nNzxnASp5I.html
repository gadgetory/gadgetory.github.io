high-end features like an under glass
fingerprint scanner and near bezel free
screen to the mid range despite
generally being a solid phone all round
the V 11 feels a bit like it's bitten
off a few more flagship features than it
can chew
right now the mid range seems to be
going in one of two directions
it's either cramming flay chip specs
into a mid-range price point or is
keeping the specks mid-range but trying
to offer a watered-down flagship
experience
well the poco phone f1 is a good example
of the former with beefy specs and no
frills the vivo V 11 is a good example
of the latter putting flagship features
in a mid-range phone and in a lot of
ways it succeeds it has a great display
excellent battery life solid performance
good looks high-end tech like an in
display fingerprint scanner and tiny
water drop not around an ear bezel free
screen this is awesome stuff for a phone
in this price bracket but it feels a bit
like vivo should have focused on those
basics and called it a day Before we
jump in be sure to hit that subscribe
button down below and ring the bell to
be notified of future uploads and the
Questor bring that flagship feeling to
the v11 vivo has decided to a I all the
things most notably in the camera now I
have to admit that a few updates were
pushed out while I was doing this review
so if things may not stay this way
forever but as it stands right now the V
11 camera experience is a bit of a mess
in ideal conditions the V 11 camera is
pretty good daylight shots and selfies
and good conditions are excellent with
great color and detail even low-light
shots are okay if you're leaning the
phone on something because there's no
OAS or EAS here I ended up giving up
entirely on the twenty five megapixel
front-facing camera because well I've
got some great shots some of the time it
ended up grainy and soft far too often
and I found it easier just to rely on
the 12 megapixel primary camera instead
while the V 11 doesn't handle dynamic
range all that well it does have a great
HDR mode I ended up leaving it on auto
all the time because of how well it
balances shadows and highlights without
going overboard at night the V 11 loses
points though as it blows out highlights
can't handle moving subjects and
generally looks grainy and undetailed
again given ideal circumstances you can
get workable shots the conditions need
to be very specific to get them and the
V 11 just isn't reliable enough for me
the price doesn't get the V 11 a pass
because significantly cheaper phone
cameras like the Xiaomi me a to perform
better once you get past the basics the
V 11 camera experience only kind of gets
worse day I scene detection is a bit
slow and doesn't really change that much
in the shot the AI portrait framing sort
of works but all it really does is get
you to Center your subject the AO a face
beauty options can be handy if you're
into that kind of thing but they tend to
be a bit aggressive the panorama
stitching is poor the portrait mode edge
detection isn't all that great and so on
but this many failed attempts at
improving the extras on the camera I
can't help but feel the vivo should have
prioritized basic camera performance and
left the rest to the flagships if your
photography needs a pretty
straightforward then the V 11 will do
you just fine
but if you're expecting a lot from all
of the added extras then think again and
this is basically the V L Evans problem
it's a very good mid-range phone but it
tries too hard to take on extras that it
can't really back up because vivo has
put so much into making the V 11 look
like an affordable flagship it's hard
not to point out several things that are
missing while still being present on
other phones in this price range there's
no IP rating no NFC no wireless charging
no 4k video or image stabilization no
USB type-c and an obvious missed
opportunity to have stereo speakers so
the bottom firing speaker is the only
one used for music and media on the plus
side that single speaker is actually
pretty decent with crisp eyes
loud volume and decent sound even at
full blast without sounding tinny the
presence of the 3.5 ml headphone jack is
a welcome bonus - meaning you don't need
a dongle or to switch to bluetooth
headphones blue g5 is also included so
you can enjoy higher bandwidth as well
the choice of micro USB is kind of hard
to stomach on a phone as futuristic
looking as the V 11 but it does have
fast charging it's 3400 milliamp hour
battery is really efficient and I
regularly go through half of my second
day before I needed to think about
recharging you might want to disable the
off-screen fingerprint scanner to save
on battery though the most fun touch OS
on Android 8.1 won't appeal to everyone
but on my global unit changing the
custom launcher is a simple enough task
fun touch does have a bunch of good
options like a nap and File Vault app
cloning for multiple instances of a
messaging or social media app display
calibration motorbike mode always-on
display
gesture navigation and Google assistant
and goo
lenz baked right in FIFA's jovi virtual
assistant is still onboard but it's
basically relegated to handling in-game
interruptions in game mode and some of
the AI camera tweets already mentioned
the V 11 feels very pocketable because
of its relatively small size and
lightweight and it won't break the bank
either for the equivalent of 360 to 440
u.s. dollars depending on your market it
will definitely make an impression when
you pull it out of your pocket but the
vivo V 11 has some very stiff
competition from the likes of Jimmy and
the poco phone as well as honor and even
Oppo to be honest I think vive has
missed a trick here by trying to do a
little bit too much because it's the
extras that let this phone down even as
the essentials are almost universally
well done it looks great and generally
performs great and that would have been
enough for me so it all boils down to
what you expect from a mid-range phone
these days if all you want is the best
possible specs you can get you better
look elsewhere if you want an affordable
phone that brings flagship features to a
mid-range price point and well I think
there's other phones that have succeeded
better on that front too but if you want
a mix of good specs and performance with
a real flagship look well the V 11 might
just be for you only you know which
compromises you're willing to put up
with but the best part is if the V 11
isn't quite your cup of tea there are
plenty of other great options out there
there might be as always thanks for
