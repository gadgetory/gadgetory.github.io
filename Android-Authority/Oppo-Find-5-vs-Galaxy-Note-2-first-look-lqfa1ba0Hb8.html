a first look at the Galaxy Note 2 vs
apple fine fine now the ala scene 02 is
the device I'm currently rocking but I
actually think that I might switch it up
I have a craving for high-resolution
something on the galaxy note 2 despite
having a beautiful AMOLED HD display
simply doesn't match although it does
feature 5.5 inch display with a
resolution of 1280 by 720 and not of the
pen tile matrix variety it simply
doesn't hold a candle to the resolution
of 1920 x 1080 on a 5-inch form factor
this results in a pixel density for the
Aqua fine 5a 441 and although i love 5.5
inches for looking at websites and
browsing media I simply am not able to
use the Galaxy Note 2 in one hand which
sometimes makes a little frustrating
when I'm on the move and for all you
AMOLED lovers out there just check out
the brilliance and clarity and color
richness of the Aqua fine 5s 1080p
display in the benchmark department the
amplifying 5 also beats the Galaxy Note
2 even with the 1080p display and the
for software optimization it's that good
ol s4 pro quad-core 1.5 gigahertz while
the Oppo find 5 a slightly thicker it
only has a 25 hundred million battery
verse of the galaxy knows 30 100 ml amp
now the Aqua 55 is slightly thicker than
the no 2 but do the fact that it has
slightly maybe about 14 to fifty percent
less width in the galaxy note 2 again it
does have that one hand usability which
makes it really nice for people that are
constantly busy one on the move and need
to use the device one-handed really the
thickness is not a deal-breaker guys
we're talking about maybe 0.05 of a
millimeter it's hardly noticeable now
the styling of obviously is a little bit
of a curve rear a matte plastic backing
nice for fingerprints and if your greasy
fingers like me it's not going to absorb
them the Galaxy Note 2 on the other hand
is a figure of print magnet and I find
myself costly my being down on my sleeve
other than that the fact that the Aqua
55 has a 13-megapixel camera is really
nice i like the camera on the galaxy
note 2 it takes great pictures but 13
megapixels is just that much more I'm
sure it is slightly thicker the Aqua 55
that is but check out this picture
though the thickness more than makes up
for the brilliance and richness and
clarity of this display is stunning and
even though i love AMOLED displays I was
really taken aback by the clarity of the
awful fine 55 inch 1080p display and due
to the fact that it has a less wide
profile I found that one-handed
operation was a lot easier to attain
additionally the hardware acceleration
of HDR 120 frames to slow motion and the
13 megapixel count make it really really
attractive candidate for would be
photographers on the move now the Galaxy
Note 2 is a phablet make no mistake 5.5
inches is a lot of phone I found that
helpful find 5 very similar in style
into the experience series from Sony
with its Matt back blacking making a
really fingerprint resistant and you
know the displays actually are really
similar in terms of height the width is
what's different I'm sure that watching
1080p videos on this is going to be a
real joy although really use some high
quality materials for the plastic it
really feels nice in the hand it really
reminds me with Sony's upset now phablet
verse smartphone is 5-inch really a
phablet or going to be characterized as
a smartphone I think that what
characterizes devices of a Blee is the
fact that it most likely cannot be used
by one handed operation unless you are a
giant
and with the Alpo 55 I found that I was
able to actually use it primarily
one-handed something I've been missing
with the Galaxy Note 2 other than that
both devices fly I mean we're talking
about some of the latest generation
technology in both so really you're not
going to notice the difference in as we
saw in the benchmarks before they're
very comparable so this about sums up
our initial comparison of the galaxy
note 2 versus the output fine five if
you're looking for a large device with a
beautiful screen great optics and
excellent battery life and performance
the Galaxy Note 2 is the way to go but
if you crave speed and you create high
resolution like a lot of people do then
the Aqua 55 introduces a whole new price
point for a display of this caliber and
a device of this caliber the benchmarks
at 1080p are better than no to the
display rocks and has rich robust colors
and clarity and it is actually usable
with one hand so for this particular
round do the fact that i missed one hand
i'll hand it to a PO don't forget to
check out our other videos subscribe and
let us know what you think of the Oppo
find 5 verses the galaxy note 2 thanks
