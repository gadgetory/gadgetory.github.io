for Samsung not just in design choices
but also when it came to the s-pen
however as a line the note range also
includes tablets and its biggest
iteration has come along for the ride as
well hey it's Josh regard from Android I
thought he what's going on everybody and
this is the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1
2014 edition
for the most part the much bigger
sibling of the galaxy note 3 adopts many
of its design philosophies and that is a
very good thing what you get here is a
design with generally flat sides and
corners that while rounded are
definitely more decisive in their angles
and is a far cry from the pebble design
that we may have grown accustomed to
from earlier Samsung devices the 10.1
inch screen beckons and is above the
same classic button layout the home
button flanked by back and menu the
power button and volume rockers are
found up top and to the left and are
pretty thin but still press down with a
nice tactile feel over the corner we
have the headphone jack above one of the
two speakers comprising the stereo setup
thrown over to the opposite side the
other speaker is there underneath where
the s-pen calls its home further below
that is a micro SD card slot if you're
wondering where the micro USB port is it
is found down on the bottom and is not
the USB 3.0 port like on the note 3 this
is to me a peculiar spot to have the
charging port because if you are
standing the tablet up pretty much any
which way plugging the power in becomes
more difficult than I think it should be
the back while not removable is made up
of the new textured plastic that has
been given a very welcome change for
Samsung devices and etching around the
edges gives off the general feel of
leather in the hand the textured plastic
definitely helps it feel very nice and
helps provide a nice grip for usage
while one-handed usage is very difficult
with such a large device you can
actually still grip it easily by resting
your thumb over the just rightly sized
bezels around the screen it's
unsurprising that a 10-inch tablet
should be rather heavy and though this
version of the Note 10.1 is lighter than
its predecessor it is still hefty at 540
grams handling the Note 10.1 is about as
good as it can get and it is definitely
as stylish as its little sibling which
is probably the best part a great
display should come with a great tablet
and that is definitely the case here as
Samsung has outfitted the Galaxy Note
10.1 with a LCD screen capable of 2560
by 1600 resolution at a more than
adequate 299 PPI all content looks great
on this screen as colors are nice and
vibrant making especially the TouchWiz
UI pop this might not be the bigger
version of the stell
Super AMOLED display found on the note 3
but it is really close I really enjoyed
watching YouTube videos and playing
extensive sessions of dead trigger 2 on
here text is given a nice sharpness that
even when you bring it close up doesn't
show any real sides of pixelation rest
assured your viewing experience on this
Note 10.1 will be an enjoyable one
another area where Samsung definitely
doesn't skimp out on is the performance
aspect while there are different
versions of the Note 10.1 that will get
different processing packages this Wi-Fi
only version did come with the fabled
Exynos 50 420 the octa-core beast that
is supposed to bring even more speed
than the Snapdragon 800 that is found in
other notes consider for a second how
high the resolution of the screen is and
thus how much processing power is
required to make the Note 10.1 blaze
then consider that the antutu benchmark
scores are comparable to the smaller
galaxy note 3 that sports the Snapdragon
800 now that's very impressive and for
those same reasons I am okay knowing
that here there isn't the buttery
smoothness that you would find on the
note 3 but that also doesn't mean that
getting worked and played done on here
will be hindered even in the slightest 3
gigabytes of RAM helped the Note 10.1
perform all of its multitasking and
extra s-pen functions handily and the
mall et 628 graphics helped make even
the most intensive games run well at
high quality the newly released dead
trigger 2 did experience some noticeable
but generally negligible stutter on the
other hand or as some other devices
might lag on the low quality setting the
note provides a smooth and enjoyable
experience killing them zombies in the
hardware department it's definitely
focused around the s-pen but that
doesn't mean this big tablet doesn't
come with some extra good features I
will say that without the many sensors
found in the Galaxy s4 or the note 3 you
won't be able to use your hand for air
gestures or air view those smart stop
and scrolls are available here they
included 32 or 64 gigabytes of storage
is bolstered by the microSD card slots
and while not removable you do get a
massive 80 to 20 milliamp hour battery
unit inside that Samsung claims will be
able to go for nine hours of usage in my
testing I once play dead trigger for
about 45 straight minutes after taking
the time to download it beforehand
after that one and a half hours of total
usage 80% battery life
still available which i think is pretty
impressive considering everything I was
doing in that short amount of time one
of the new features is definitely the
dual speaker stereo setup the sound is
crisp and quite rich music sounds good
even if using headphones might generally
be more preferred
and when shooting zombies you can still
easily hear another one coming up from
behind
and finally of course is the s-pen which
has been given a more symmetrical design
that allows for it to be inserted more
than just one way as for its usage on
the larger screen it is as good an
experience as the note 3 and having a
larger canvas to work with will
definitely help anyone looking for just
that it's pretty rare that a tablet
camera exceeds our typically low
expectations for them and on paper one
could understandably come into the Note
10.1 with them compared to the standard
13 megapixels of other top-tier devices
this tablet comes with an 8 megapixel
shooter the app is very much like we've
seen in other Samsung iterations but
doesn't come with nearly as many extra
features though drama and eraser modes
are baked in it is in the picture
quality though that we find our
expectations surpassed as this tablet
camera actually performs pretty well
colors have a good punch to them in
pictures and sharpness is at a nice high
level even if the 8 megapixels do put
this camera more in galaxy s3 territory
its quality actually puts it closer to
the Galaxy s4 with picture quality like
this we can almost forgive public
shooting with a big tablet like this
almost before I get into the main parts
of the software I do have to say one
thing while TouchWiz is undoubtedly in
need of a refresh I find that it works
very well on larger screens well we
would otherwise call bloated in there
earlier or let's say smaller devices
fits almost perfectly on a big
high-resolution display if I needed to
use TouchWiz I would take it on a note
device any day to be fair the TouchWiz
on these newer note devices look and
generally feel the way you remember it
and while it does make some different
choices in the tablet version a couple
could use another look like the
notification drop-down that shades the
entire screen rather than shows in
sections like in stock tablet Android
despite this general familiarity
TouchWiz on the new Notes comes with the
new S Pen functionality and an improved
multi window multi window has been given
the ability to run two of the same app
at once easily drag data from one to the
other and even provide some multitasking
within the segmented windows multi
window fans will love using the new
version on this larger screen and it
might become a routine the S Pen on the
other hand got the new air commands menu
which replaces a few of the functions
from previous note devices
inside it are five easy to access
functions like the contextual action
memo and the powerful s finder search
these and the s note or sketchbook apps
give you a great level of control
whether that's creative or not as this
experience is pretty much exactly like
the note 3 you can see my future focus
video on the S Pen for the smartphone
for a more in-depth look at all of these
functions has a pretty complete package
paying for a very powerful tablet with
its little stylus friend will set you
back five hundred and ninety-nine
dollars this makes sense considering all
that the Note 10.1 offers but is
understandably a little steep which begs
the question while the note 3 can be
used without the S Pen and still provide
a great smartphone experience does that
translate to the tablet if Samsung put
out a pretty average tablet experience
and then tacked on the much-loved s-pen
functions on top that would be a pretty
easy no but in the Note 10.1 you get the
updated great S Pen nestled inside one
of the best executed tablets currently
available speed a wonderful screen the
XE knows 5420 an accessible overall
design and form factor and a
surprisingly above-average camera making
this a pretty complete package it's a
home or office assistant the media
viewer the book the portal gamer and
even a second camera we're still on the
fence about that last one though and so
there you have it thank you very much
for watching as always and I hope you
enjoyed this review of the Galaxy Note
10.1 2014 edition like I said before if
you want a closer look at the s-pen and
everything that it can do you can see my
feature focus video on it and even
though it is on the Galaxy Note 3 the
experience is very much largely the same
