largest phones head-to-head seeing if
their latest device is enough to triumph
last year's no.5 hello everybody its
Krista Laura and this is a galaxy s7
edge versus the galaxy note 5 both the
s7 edge and note 5 are large phones but
with the height of the top and bottom
bezels of course a 5.7 inch screen on
the note 5 makes for an overall bigger
phone than a 5.5 inch s7 edge the note 5
is almost three millimeters taller than
the s7 and also five millimeters wider
so you'll need to stretch a little
further on the note 5 when trying to use
it one-handed both phones have Gorilla
Glass 4 on the back creating a very
elegant design although this year the s7
edge seems to have taking a page out of
the note 5s book with this glass
covering on the sides samsung says he's
back curbs helped with grip and even
comfort when holding and it really is
the case especially on the s7 edge where
there's a lot less frame to hold on to
both of our phones here are the dark
models black sapphire on the note 5 and
black onyx on the s7 edge however while
the note 5 is a little more blue the s7
edge is a more true black which I think
helps that make it look a little more
sleek another design change that I love
is that the shiny silver accents that
can be found on the note 5 have not been
carried onto the s7 edge instead we have
black borders in a darker less
reflective frame and of course thanks to
the s7 edges 1 millimeter thicker body
the camera pichu's just a little less
all of these little changes definitely
make the S of an edge have a bit more of
an advantage when it comes to a visually
pleasing phone but of course we haven't
even talked about the main difference
here and that is a curved display of the
s7 edge the side bezels on the note 5
are pretty slim to begin with but on the
s7 edge they are almost non-existent the
left and right sides of the display
curve a little to meet the frame
creating a display that appears to be
embossed even with the screen off the
extra reflections of curved glass
creates makes for a very beautiful
futuristic looking phone and when
putting the phone side-by-side there is
no competition in terms of beauty the s7
edge makes the Note 5 looks like it came
out years
while we're on the topic of displays
let's dive into the specs of both phone
screens Samsung is using the same type
of display technology here but their
Super AMOLED panels as well as the same
resolution of quad HD and of course with
the note 5 having a larger display this
creates 4 less pixels per inch actually
making the s7 edges display slightly
sharper but these differences pretty
much go unnoticed these displays are the
best on the market right now although
there's a pretty big difference in terms
of color reproduction here the s7 edges
display appears to be a little warmer
than the note fives and whether that's a
good or bad thing it's mostly up to
preference the note 5 does get a little
brighter than the s7 edge as well so
when outdoors the note 5 is going to be
a lot easier to see another difference
comes with most phones once they surpass
that 5.5 inch screen mark and that's the
PI with the note 5 having a larger
screen Samsung gave the phone a dpi of
560 allowing for smaller text and icons
which allows for more information on the
screen the s7 edges display is just a
tad smaller yet the DPI is set at 640
which cuts off a lot of information that
you will be able to see on the note 5
the curve size of the s7 edge though
really make this display feel like
something from the future and when using
the note 5 after using the guest of an
edge for a while you feel as though
there's a quite distance between the
glossy touch and the actual screen below
it but overall I really do enjoy the
cooler tint of the note 5 and the
brighter screen and along with the lower
dpi the note 5 may still be better
technically speaking with all Samsung
phones we have capacitive navigation
buttons instead of on-screen ones
including a physical home button this
physical home button does double as a
fingerprint scanner and it's a very good
one these scanners are not the fastest
ones found on phones but they are very
fast and very reliable thanks to the s7
edges extra processing power you'll be
able to scan and unlock the phone ever
so slightly faster than the no.5 both
phones have the same speaker placed on
the bottom of the phone which is
unfortunate because it's very easy to
cover up and is pointed away from you
the speaker itself isn't too bad it's
not great it can be a little tinny but
it can get pretty loud however on the s7
edge
speaker is a bit quieter and a little
more weaker and sound overall but that's
because behind the speaker is a
protective coating because the s7 edge
is ip68 certified water-resistant the s7
edge can survive up to 30 minutes and
1.5 meters of water so surviving rainy
days or accidental drops into the sink
is no problem whereas if you do this on
the note 5 you're going to end up having
to buy a new one now perhaps the biggest
disappointment with the note 5 was the
removal of the SD card slot but with the
S of an edge
Sampson listened to us and found a way
to keep this beautiful glass device and
add an SD card slot so now you can add
photos songs and movies up to 200 gigs
for very cheap instead of purchasing a
different model the phone for an
expensive price tag the note 5 does have
one feature though that the s7 edge does
not and that is the S Pen pulling this
pin out from the bottom of the phone can
open up a whole world of features making
getting work done a lot faster and
easier you can easily drop down notes
crop areas of images circle things and
draw diagrams if you need to and sure
not everybody needs an S Pen but
depending on your line of work the S Pen
feature alone may be worth getting the
no.5 over the s7 edge the s7 edge sports
the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 while
the note 5 has the Exynos 7420 Adreno
530 versus Mali t760 GPU with both
phones having 4 gigs of RAM since these
processors and GPUs come from different
manufacturers
I ran both phones through some
benchmarking apps to see where they rank
to one another Geekbench scored the s7
edge slightly high while in - to put the
s7 edge way ahead the majority of the
time the s7 edge will open apps a second
faster than the note 5 while having a
bit better RAM management as well apps
tend to read load less and although
still are perfect it's a lot better but
oddly enough the note 5 loath power
hunger games a few second faster but
once the game starts you'll notice less
frame drops on the s7 edge the
difference is very miniscule though and
you'll have a great time playing games
on either phone but with the s7 edge
Samsung has introduced a new gaming mode
that disables incoming notifications and
even locks up the capacitive buttons
so nothing will interrupt your game
which is awesome if you're a gamer even
though the s7 edge is only about one
point three percent thicker than the
no.5 Sampson was able to cram a 20%
larger battery inside which is very
impressive the note 5 has great battery
life already lasting us all day with
about 4 and a half hours of screen on
time but yeah the s7 edge does last a
little longer
and with light to moderate usage I could
easily make the phone last into my
second day with this being a new year in
a new era for Samsung phones the s7 edge
is running the newest version of Android
Android marshmallow 6.0 while the note 5
is still stuck at Android lollipop 5.1.1
at the moment and this new version of
Android brings along a new version of
TouchWiz on the s7 edge that looks and
performs a lot better the recent apps
screen allows for more the apps to be
seen and the Notification pulldown has a
more toned down in neutral color scheme
this shouldn't matter too much though
because you can't take advantage of the
theme store found on both phones where
you can change these colors TouchWiz is
just as customizable on the note 5 as it
is on the new s7 edge allowing for even
the icon grid to be resized each big
selling point for these phones come with
some nice software features like the S
Pen has its own little menu for getting
things done and the curved size allow
for swipe in menus and widgets the s7
edge allows for pretty much creating
your own little home screen sliding in
where you can add contacts apps app
actions widgets and even news samsung
made a big change this year to their
already great performing cameras instead
of the 16 megapixel sensor found on the
note 5 we have a 12 megapixel sensor on
the s7 edge yes
that's a downgrade in sensor size but
the pixel sizes themselves are actually
larger this time around allowing for
more light to come through creating
brighter photos also we have a lower
aperture of 1.7 instead of the note 5s
1.9 optical image stabilization can be
found in both along with the 5 megapixel
wide-angle selfie cam first off the main
difference you'll notice is that the
note 5 shoots in a 16 to 9 aspect ratio
at its full sensor size while the s7
edge is stuck to 4 to 3 in terms of
quality though the s7 edge
to be a little bit sharper with a tad
more contrast creating the ever so
slightly better image here oftentimes
the note 5 will over expose a little
more than the s7 edge which ends up
losing a lot of detail in the highlights
and makes a photo worse the s7 edge does
a much better job at creating a
perfectly exposed photo over all colors
on the note 5 appeared to be a little
warmer than the s7 edges not necessarily
making for a better or worse photo but
it's all up to preference of course
these differences are very minor but
when we get into low-light that all
changes with the s7 edge outperforming
the note 5 by a large margin while the
note 5 starts to shift colors to a less
saturated look with greenish highlights
and purple in the shadows the s7 edge
creates a much more sharper image with
more vibrant colors for an extreme test
I took both phones into areas where I
could barely see with the naked eye the
no fives representation is pretty close
to what I could see in real life pretty
much nothing unable to make out any
detail however the s7 edge is larger
pixel size allow it almost see in the
dark
suddenly the picture is just better in
every area better colors brighter image
and much sharper the no 5 creates a very
dark purple and smudgy photo in dark
areas while the s7 edge brightens up the
shot even brighter than the real scene
itself while creating a clearer image at
the same time the front facing five
megapixel wide-angle selfie camera
differences are very minor but they're
still there with the galaxy s7 edge
being a tad sharper and brighter in dark
areas in normal lighting conditions
though there is not much of a difference
the same differences can be found when
it comes to video there's a lot more
grain with the no 5 shot and when moving
into darker areas you start to lose
colors sharpness and you get that nasty
purple hue in the shadows on the s7 edge
your video remains clearer and more
vibrant the no 5s camera seems to hunt
around a lot more and even when it does
focus properly it takes a lot longer
than the s7 edge the s7 edge focuses
instantly onto objects so you can be
confident you'll never miss part of the
action overall the s7 edges camera is a
huge upgrade over the note 5s if you are
someone who takes a lot of indoor and
low-light shots both phones were
very similar in price when they were
both released but with the no.5 being
older you can pick it up for a lot
cheaper these days but still is that
we're spending a bit more on the new s7
edge over the note 5 with the main
differences being better battery life
water resistance micro SD card slot
better processing power and hugely
improved camera I would say the s7 edge
is definitely worth picking up over the
note 5 but of course these features may
not be needed by some users but still
the s7 edge seems to be an upgrade in
every department evenness design and
that is the end of the video thank you
