the ground here at CSS booth we're
having the privilege of taking a closer
look at what I'm actually starting to
really love it's the huawei ascend mate
here it's a device with the 6.1 inch
displays the 720p display and we're
comparing to what we thought was the
logical comparison which is the nexus 7
because we have a 6.1 inch display vs a
7-inch display but just look out how the
footprint is substantially different we
can almost fit the ascend mate within
the display of the nexus 7 another key
feature is that we're looking at is the
weight difference now this particular
device features a 4050 milliamp battery
and it only weighs in at 198 grams
whereas the next seven ways 340 grams
making this device almost half is light
obviously a lot more portable and usable
but it's not in the Nexus reference
device may be some good rommerz will be
able to throw an AOSP rom on there to
make it a little more functional other
than that we wanted to compare how what
it's like to read text on them now this
is a really really bright display the
nexus 7 display obviously they had to
cut a few corners you know this is only
199 dollar device at a 16 gigabytes so I
just wanted to bring up some books here
for you so you can just so what it's
like to actually read text have some
pride and prejudice here with mr. Darcy
let's just bring it up here the
performance on this device is pretty
good even though it is only 720p display
the pixel per inch count is going to be
a little bit low because this 6.1 inches
now in terms of the specs while this is
loading here we're looking at both are
featuring ARM Cortex a9 1.5 gigahertz
processors this one has a 1 gigabytes of
RAM and this one does too this is a
taker 3 chipset here so let's just see
okay what it's like to read text I'm not
that blind so let's just zoom out here
will be grabbing some macro shots to to
show what it's like for you guys just
bring that down now this displays
probably fifty percent brighter the
viewing angles on it are absolutely
fantastic so you can almost go totally
vertical and the Nexus 7 not bad but no
not quite as good we actually had to
turn down the brightness till here a
little bit or else we won't be able to
get a good video for you guys so it's
just nice to have a portable device for
such a massive display 6.1 inches is
pushing the envelope a little bit but if
you take a bus or you take trains or you
fly a lot this is really really nice
device for watching movies and web
browsing one gigabytes of RAM features
an 8-megapixel camera on the rear there
is obviously going to be no word yet on
LTE but we're looking at hspa+ ferent
that's going to hit the markets pretty
soon here probably early q2 maybe late
q1 no word on pricing and this is
obviously a tablet but the bezels
massive is obviously not you can really
hold it with one hand but it's 340 grams
and this one's under 200 Rams only
hundred ninety-eight 4050 milliamp
battery and this one has just a little
bit bigger around 40 300 milliamps so
other than that guys this is just a
closer hands-on look versus comparison
of the ascend mate from Huawei looking
at the nexus 7 made by asus my name is
Darcy like ube we're here at CES 2013
