is it to you to have a full screen
display I'm talking about like a panel
from the top to the bottom of your phone
no bezel to be found well last year
opera and VEVO kind of tried to do this
they hit the selfie camera in this
little moving parts module in the top of
the phones which kind of enabled a
bigger screen than we've previously seen
in a lot of devices and now it's 2019
and a lot of manufacturers are trying to
do a similar thing they're drilling
holes in the display to make room for
the selfie camera but vivo doesn't want
to do this and they kind of want to
still go with this whole full screen
display idea with like nothing
intersecting it so now what they come up
with is a phone with two screens this is
the vivo next dual display edition all
right so this one is really interesting
I don't really want to talk about specs
that much here because a lot of the
specs are pretty much the same as other
flagships oh let's give a quick rundown
it's got a qualcomm snapdragon 845 it's
got 128 gigabytes of storage and it has
10 gigabytes of RAM and 10 gigabytes of
RAM is a lot of RAM there's a few phones
on the market right now that have 10
gigs of RAM and currently that's pretty
pointless but I think it's nice that
they're actually putting that in here
because that kind of adds a sense of
longevity to your purchase and maybe
down the road Android will actually be
able to take advantage of 10 gigabytes
of RAM I don't see that happening any
time soon but it's nice to just have
that if you need it and the performance
on these specs is as you would assume
really really good I didn't see any
frame dropping or stuttering pretty much
throughout my entire time with the phone
and it actually performed really well in
our benchmark test too if you want to
check those out you can check them out
in the article below
so yes it's pretty much like every other
flagship and 2018 as far as performance
goes but what makes this phone really
interesting is the two screens so on the
front you've got this huge AMOLED
display it looks really really nice it
looks pretty much the same as the vivo
next from last year but then you turn
the phone around and on the back you've
got a second display which is still
fully capable and you have to wonder
what is that there for
so the main focus of the secondary
display is gonna be the camera vivo kind
of thought well the rear cameras on
smartphones are already better than the
selfie cameras on most smartphones
anyways so why don't we just repurpose
the rear cameras to be able to shoot
your selfies and that makes a lot of
sense the only thing that was holding
people back from doing that was being
able to see themselves when they were
taking their photo and I think this is a
really interesting implementation but it
would kind of suck if that was the only
reason this thing had a secondary
display right so people probably thought
that through - and they introduced a few
new things that you can actually do with
the second display so it isn't just
about taking selfies the first one is to
be able to take pictures of people and
let them see the photo that you're
taking of them before you actually take
the shot and this is really nice because
if someone wanted to pose or just like
put a photo up on their Instagram you
can hand your phone to someone and then
you can actually see the photo before
they take it which is a really nice
feature the other main use for the
second display is for gaming so if you
were in a first-person shooter like pub
G they specifically partnered with 10
cent on pub G you to actually use this
back display as kind of like a trigger
so if you're using your thumbs to run
around and aim you can actually tap on
the back of the phone to shoot and that
just gives you a little more leverage
makes it a little easier to play the
game I'm sure there's a bunch of other
things that you could probably use the
second display for when I first got the
phone I thought oh no like what if I
drop it and break the second screen but
if you think about it most phones are
glass now anyway and just having a
second display lets you use the other
display if you do break one of the
screens so you still will have a usable
phone even if you crack one of your
displays which is actually pretty useful
so this thing has a 3500 million power
battery and you're probably thinking oh
no battery life is gonna be so bad two
screens half the battery life and that's
not really the case because if you think
about it you only use one screen at a
time and most of the time I'm using the
main display there is a very very few
times when I'm actually using both
displays only really in like mirror mode
in the camera but the battery life was
actually pretty good for some reason fun
touch os does not report screen on time
which is really frustrating for me but I
ended the day with about 25 to 30
percent battery life left which is a lot
better than some of the other phones
have been using recently so just keep
that in mind and if there's only one
of cameras on this phone you'd hope that
they would be good right and I'm kind of
mixed on it I really like the color
profile I think it's very similar to the
Xiaomi me it's a little more D saturated
and more natural than a lot of other
flagship phones like a Samsung camera
but the clarity and sharpness just isn't
there I was really impressed with the me
a its camera and if this was just a
little bit sharper I think it would be
really similar to that camera one kind
of cool thing about this camera though
is the built-in ring light so say you
were taking a selfie and you just wanted
to light up your face a little bit more
there's two bright white LEDs on either
side of this camera that give your face
a really nice even exposure and just
give that sensor a lot more light
overall and when you're charging your
phone or you get notifications there's
actually RGB LEDs that can light around
the camera sensor that just give it this
really nice effect so obviously it
doesn't actually change the performance
of the phone but I just thought it was a
little tool thing that kind of adds a
little value to the device the vivo next
dual display edition is running on
funtage OS 4.5 which is based on Android
9.0 Pi and in my opinion it's bad it's
definitely not made for Western
audiences it's trying to look a lot like
iOS which is pretty popular with Chinese
roms and I just really don't dig it it
doesn't allow you to have an app drawer
which is really frustrating for me and
it forces you to put all your apps and
folders on the home screen which is just
so annoying but the nice thing is that
it does have some good navigation
gestures they are really similar to iOS
s but I'm not really a fan of the
default PI navigation gestures anyway
and I think these are a little bit
better overall I think if you like how
iOS looks and works then you might like
this but I would really suggest just
throwing a launcher like Nova on it Nova
actually works really well I did test it
on this phone and you can also use it on
both displays so it doesn't actually
mess up any of the system navigation so
you might be thinking without a selfie
camera how am I gonna do things like
face unlock or other types of
authentication they aren't just putting
a pin in and VEVO has put another in
screen fingerprint reader in this phone
just like the original next and it's
definitely better than the original x2
it's faster it's more effective and I
really didn't have trouble getting into
my phone if you want to turn on the rear
display though there is a time of flight
sensor next to the regular camera which
basically projects dots onto your face
and creates a matte
of your face so that you can get into
your phone it's really similar to like
face ID or some of the other technology
that we've seen from people like Jamie
so you can actually buy this phone right
now in China it is 4998 RMB which
translates to about seven hundred thirty
dollars or like six hundred and thirty
euros and honestly I think that's a
pretty good price for what you're
getting you're getting really good specs
but really honestly you're just getting
a phone that is very very unique you've
got two displays you've got a headphone
jack but you don't get in a lot of
phones right now and it's just gonna
look completely different from all the
other phones in all your friends pockets
couple weird little things to note here
I use Google Phi and t-mobile for my
data pretty much on all my review
devices and this is the international
version of the phone so it should work
with that I kind of check the bands and
made sure that it should work with those
services but for some reason I can get
no more than two G edge data on this
phone so I reached out to vivo I asked
them what's up and they said they would
get me a response as soon as I can so
make sure you check the article in the
next few days I'll definitely be
updating that to let you know what kind
of networks this is actually going to
work on but overall I think this is a
really interesting and innovative device
we haven't really seen a smart phone
besides the Nubia X that has a screen on
both sides of the phone and I really
like that vivo just kind of goes out on
the limb and tries wild ideas and
actually makes them products doesn't
just make them tech demos so you can
actually go buy this right now which i
think is really cool anyways I hope you
guys enjoyed the review if you have any
questions make sure you drop them in the
comment section below you can go check
out the full review on our website where
I've detailed a lot of things we have
image samples we have benchmarks so all
that stuff is right there so until next
time I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
