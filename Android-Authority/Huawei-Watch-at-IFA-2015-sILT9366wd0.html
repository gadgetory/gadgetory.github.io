earlier this year the huawei watch has
returned with a somewhat different
design more refined and in a bunch of
new finishes and colors this josh of a
gar from android authority what's going
on everybody and here is another look at
the sleek and sexy while we watch the
watch that we all in some ways fell in
love with earlier at mwc this year comes
back with a lot of new friends many
different new finishes colors and even
strap designs are available for the
huawei watch the one you're seeing right
now is probably the one that i would
even pick up personally if i must say
the black on black version metal with a
deployment clasp underneath you can
already see just how sleek this is but
you'll also notice a few very subtle
changes in the design nothing too
drastic really nothing that you could
even mention because this watch tends to
have that let's say gymnastic wat when
it comes to what it makes in terms of a
watch design into a SmartWatch this is
probably the only watch available right
now that really does take on the look
and visage of a real luxury watch and
you're going to be paying about that
much in order to have it but before we
get to the prices will get into the
specs as a refresher this android wear
powered watch has a 1.4 inch 400 by 400
resolution display that has one of the
highest pixel densities in a wearable
right now and is powered by a 1.2
gigahertz qualcomm snapdragon processor
with half a gig of ram and 4 gigabytes
of storage on top of all of that it's
also going to be one of the first
Android wear devices to offer some basic
support for iOS bridging the gap between
Android and iOS for the wearable game
donning the watch onto my wrist really
does feel like this is the kind of
SmartWatch we have been waiting for in
terms of really wanting a luxury watch
you just have some digital capabilities
that are available with our smartphones
now the Huawei watch does not come with
any real big bells and whistles aside
from what you're probably used to an
Android wear already but it's really
just in the casing and the design that
many people have become enamored with
this particular device and it's going to
be available on September 17th in the US
with Germany Canada France Spain and
Italy all up in Europe getting the watch
later this month
now when it comes to this release there
are some myriad prices for this
particular watch 349 dollars is the
starting price point for a leather band
with a silver and a silver body rather
and a metal band with a silver body is
going to be three hundred ninety nine
dollars along with different types of
other metal pants this black on black on
black version that you're looking at
right here is four hundred and forty
nine dollars and then higher even higher
luxury versions of the Huawei watch will
be available for seven hundred and
ninety nine dollars and those range from
having leather straps to metal straps
but have an even better finish with a
rose gold available as well subscribe to
