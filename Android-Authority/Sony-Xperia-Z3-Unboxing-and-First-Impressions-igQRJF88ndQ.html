doorstep it's pretty much safe to say
that the flagship smartphone season has
officially begun
well let's go ahead and get started it's
Josh freghar from Android authority
what's going on everybody and it's time
to unbox and give my first impressions
on the Sony Xperia z3 alright and here
we are with the unboxing of the Sony
Xperia z3 the box is not quite as large
as I remember it being in the previous
models but that's alright we're just
going to go ahead and get right into the
unboxing itself and there it is the
phone itself just all in plastic ready
to be peeled off and ready for us to go
ahead and start using it so that would
be just the plastic there but we're
going to put that aside just for a
second so we can take a look at what
else is available inside of the box open
up the flap over here and the microUSB
charging cable is right here along with
the plug adaptor in this case it's for
European plugs so we're gonna go ahead
and take those out open the flap even
more and now we have some headphones
right here now these look like pretty
much the standard headphones that would
be available for a smart phone not
necessarily the highest of quality but
at least they do come with some and some
goodies here in the form of manuals and
probably some vouchers that will allow
you to get some extra goodies for buying
this particular phone VIP in the Xperia
lounge some documentation and of course
the legal information so that pretty
much does it for the contents of the box
but of course what we're here for is
this actual phone itself taking off the
plastic off the front very nice and then
of course the plastic on the back which
is also made of glass so the plastic
adhesive on the back keeps it looking
really nice as you can see right there
as far as first impressions go we do see
a good design as sony has always been
able to put on the Xperia line except
this time around from the Xperia z2 you
see that the sides right here are more
rounded out you don't quite have the
rigidity certainly of the Xperia z1 or
the Xperia z2 which did improve on
a little bit more but now we have what
seems like the design that the Xperia
line should have had in the first place
but you do get the same tropes either
way on the side right here you have the
big silver power button along with the
volume rocker underneath it and the
dedicated camera button on the bottom
which is always a welcome addition the
glass panels on both sides and the 20.7
megapixel G lens over on the top corner
and of course NFC found and designated
very plainly here on the top third over
on to the other side we do have the
ports now that their covers are pretty
flush with the actual sides themselves
that are now rounded out so you have a
smooth feeling all throughout and of
course on the front you also have those
front-facing speakers that are on the
top and bottom and are a little bit more
designated as they were before to when
they were before because in the Xperia
z2 they were just slits on the top and
bottom but now they look like proper
speakers English under the United States
there you go I will be putting my sim
card in here once this unboxing is done
and I'll be using this phone as my daily
driver over the next few days to bring
you my full review once that is all over
so we're just going through all of the
setup right now go ahead and skip
everything right now just so we can get
to the homescreen but nonetheless there
we are in the Xperia UI now the sony
xperia z3 is the enhancement on the
Xperia z2 that came out just half a year
ago but that is Sony's milieu when it
comes to these particular flagship
smartphones every half you're going to
get an update on it and get the best
that they have to offer at the time
faster than anybody else whether or not
that's going to be a big draw for a lot
of users out there is something we're
going to explore in the full review
which you can stay tuned for very soon
the Xperia U I still looks like a pretty
simplistic Android iteration that keeps
things pretty simple but there's also
the reason why they keep it fast
so overall the Xperia z3 is and it has
been on the design and also some
enhancements on the inside hopefully in
the camera especially but of course this
entire phone is water resistant and dust
resistant making able to brave the
elements and it also makes it one of the
sturdiest phones that we've ever been
able to use at least if the Xperia z2
was any indication we should see the
same in the Xperia z3 so keep it into
Android 34 all of the best coverage
including our future review of the
sony xperia z3 we are also going to get
our hands on the Xperia z3 compact and
the z3 tablet compact so you can stay
tuned for those as well we're certainly
excited to not only go through all of
these but personally I do want to see
the Xperia z3 compact and the tablet but
this e3 is where the flagship does get
its leader and here we are with the
unboxing and first impressions that I
hope you enjoyed so stay tuned for the
full review and watch more videos from
my colleagues in Android because we are
your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
