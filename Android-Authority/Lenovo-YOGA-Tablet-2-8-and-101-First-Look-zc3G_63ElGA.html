and ultimately useful form factor in the
tablet game with this Lenovo yoga tablet
- that's right the yoga tablet returns
now and as you can see here we're
already playing with the kickstand that
is pretty much what defined the form
factor but now there's actually a
different sort of feature of it and it's
a little hole on there that when you
bring the kickstand down to become flat
you're actually able to hang this tablet
from any particular apparatus so that
you can use it in even different way
than before other than that though the
kickstand still performs about that the
same way that you remember it being able
to put it into a typing position when
laying down or a standing position for
viewing purposes
underneath that kickstand is a small
cover for the micro SD card slot so you
will be able to bolster the 16 gigabytes
of storage that's found within as far as
construction goes we do have a metal
construction here that provides a very
sturdy feel but it is also quite sleek
and thin especially in the part opposite
where the kickstand is we're taking a
look at the screen right now which is an
8 inch full HD that's 1920 by 1200 IPS
display and underneath the surface there
is the Intel Atom processor the Z 3745
that clocks in at 1.8 6 gigahertz and
then after that we have 2 gigabytes of
onboard memory what's nice is that there
is also a 10 inch tablet available as
well that has pretty much all of the
same features as the 8 inch model all
the way down to the resolution in the
screen at 1920 by 1200 the Intel Atom
processor and even the kickstand that
will allow you to hang the device for
hands-free operation a 2 megapixel
camera is found on the rear one that you
may or may not be using on this tablet
experience but nonetheless it is a nice
addition to have but ultimately what
we're looking at here are two tablets
and two different sizes made for you
that have a very great form factor to it
this particular kickstand is really one
of the most useful ones that we've seen
thus far and the fact that it is
integrated into the tablet itself is
just a nice feature that we liked before
and we continue to like in this yoga
tablet 2 there are going to be some
accessories that are available for both
of these versions but the 10-inch tablet
in particular is going to have an AK you
type Bluetooth keyboard cover that will
not only as the cover for the actual
tablet but also as of course the
keyboard so you'll have an integrated
keyboard basically for that larger
tablet and with a claimed battery life
of up to 18 hours on a single charge
we're pretty certain that this
particular tablet is going to help you
go the distance whether it's your work
or play though it is entirely up to you
whether or not the hanging part of the
usage in these tablets will ultimately
be useful we do like what we see with
the yoga tablet 2 in both the versions 8
and 10 inches the fact that they bring
back a form factor we really enjoyed and
brought some extra power along with it
especially in that screen so keep it
into Android thority for our future
coverage of voted these tablets and
remember that we are your source for all
things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
