from Android Authority comm your number
one source for all things Android and
today what I would like to do is review
an app called the dash clock application
now this app is actually a lockscreen
widget so you're not gonna be able to
display it on your normal home screen
and you're gonna need Android 4.2 to run
it because no other version of Android
has lock screen widgets enabled anyways
guys if you don't have a Nexus device
running the latest version of Android
you're gonna need a device such as the
Samsung Galaxy s3 or any device really
that has custom roms available for
Android 4.2 I'm personally running the
vanilla root box ROM and I'm gonna show
you guys how to set this app up on my
phone give you the full rundown and by
the time this video is over you're gonna
be pros it's not that hard so stay tuned
guys okay everyone so if you're running
Android 4.2 head over to the Play Store
and download the - clock app so all
you'll need to do at this point next
you'll go to your lockscreen here and
you're going to want to go to one of
your customizable windows here or your
customizable lockscreen panes and you're
going to click the plus like you
normally want to add a lockscreen widget
and you're simply going to click the -
clock application now once we actually
open up the - clock application you can
see all of our different options we have
to display on the lockscreen we can
display our weather Gmail unread count
calendar appointments missed calls text
messages and alarms you can see we can't
add any other extensions but we can
remove them and also change their order
and how they are displayed on the actual
widget so you can see we do have two
settings both for our weather and our
Gmail on red count clicking these will
review our different inbox and our
different particular email addresses
that we can check for and on the weather
we have our location settings and our
temperature settings then we can also
choose the appearance of our lockscreen
widget as you can see we can swipe for
different styles of time and date both
very cool I will just choose this
configuration for now and we can click
done now in our lockscreen you can see
we do have our brand new widget
and we can simply drag down for all of
our updates
I have no new SMS or gmail emails at
this point so they're not showing up but
they would in this little level right
here as you can see we do have our next
alarm present and we have our settings
slider to access the settings easily
very cool stuff so one more time guys
we'll go ahead and go to our lock screen
you can see our beautiful dash clock
widget right here looks awesome and then
at the click of our finger we can expand
our notifications and actually unlock
our device so there you have it guys
awesome app from a Google developer for
your Android 4.2 device so if you have a
device running Android 4.2 you can get
this and press all your friends have a
hot new app that not too many people do
because the Android 4.0 operating system
is still in its early days as far as
device implementation but that's another
discussion for another day today we want
you to try this app out if you've got
any 4.2 and tell us what you think go
ahead and leave a comment if you like
you guys or if you have any other
opinion whatsoever let us know this is
Clayton Youngberg with Android authority
comm and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
