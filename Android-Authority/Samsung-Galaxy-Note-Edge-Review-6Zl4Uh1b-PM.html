line brings a new look and feature but
is it a compelling enough addition to
alter the note curve it's Josh of agar
from Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the Samsung Galaxy
Note edge this is basically a samsung
galaxy note 4 in design except it also
isn't the curve on the right portion of
the screen obviously changes a lot but
in all other respects this is definitely
a note device it's as if someone took a
blowtorch to the right side of the
screen and melted it down that curve is
where the new handling experience will
be found inside and out because it is no
longer a flat side a thicker lip under
the glass has been added to aid in the
handling you can definitely pinch that
lip to get a grip on the phone but
brushing the edge can still sometimes
happen and though I haven't had anything
happen to yet I do worry that the curves
closer proximity to the ground or to the
table that it's sitting on can make it
very susceptible to scratches the edge
also changes the button layout as the
power button has been moved up top which
honestly felt pretty different for a
samsung phone waking the phone is still
easy with the tactile home button but
having to reach up top to put it into
standby still feels a little odd even
today everywhere else we have the same
frame that holds together the removable
backing made of textured plastic with
the front
these are the main tropes of the note 4
that continue to make for a very
attractive device I've already made a
couple of allusions to the handling of
the note edge I'll get into more details
as they come up but ultimately there are
times when you don't notice the curve
and then times when you absolutely hate
using it I have to admit I do enjoy
getting the attention that this
attractive Note 4 with a weird curve on
the side tends to get this is a very
alerting device no doubt about it and my
curiosity continues to be piqued it's
almost as if I reach for the note edge
not just because it is unique to pretty
much any other phone but because I'm
curious how this edge is going to
perform with my general tasks for that
day as we will explore throughout this
review the edges curve can mean a lot of
different things and it will be up to
you how positively or negatively you
take this version of different obviously
the main story what this phone deals
with the display as we get a somewhat
increase to 5 point 6 inches because of
this added real estate what was once a
quad HD display gets a little more resin
solution but it's not like you'll be
using it for media or games because the
right side comprises just a number of
panels or controls but for the rest of
the screen everything brings the same
signature Samsung saturation and high
fidelity text continues to look sharp
and I still enjoyed median games despite
the extra screen real estate yes the
curve can prove to be a little
distracting at times and I really wasn't
too happy any time I accidentally
triggered it and thus covered a sliver
of my Netflix or YouTube video up top
touch sensitivity on the curve though is
as good as it should be though
interactions with the curve are
comprised of mostly just swipes and
touches on the various icons or elements
on that part the Super AMOLED
construction allows for this curve to
turn on independently from the rest of
the display and this is one of its
marquee features quite literally as the
angle of the curve can be viewed easily
from a nightstand or when sitting on a
table turn on the night mode to make the
note edge kind of a clock or swipe up a
few times on it to check the time so yes
there are now more pixels on this screen
but ultimately they matter little to the
overall display handling experience they
add a little bit to it but they still
rely on your needs to be fully
compelling once again the influence of
the edges original sibling returns here
with the Snapdragon 805 the Adreno 420
and three gigabytes of ram the package
that returns once again in the edge as
such the performance is largely the same
reliable even despite all of the
multitasking abilities and TouchWiz is
pretty saturated operating system the
new addition of the panels and the curve
don't detract from the general
experience as everything still runs
smoothly I do notice that some new
animations have been added in to draw
attention to the side as all of the apps
seem to slide in from the edge but these
are just aesthetic changes and overall
these animations while different don't
do anything to hinder the performance we
just might be looking at the most
full-featured phone available right now
because this is basically a galaxy note
4 which was already packed with features
and now we have a new curved display
that even adds to the list as such the
usual Samsung tropes include the
removable back cover that underneath
gives access to the removable battery
and a micro SD card slot call quality is
standardly decent and the rear-facing
speaker despite getting pretty loud is
still stifled because of its placement
the recent Samsung editions include the
heart rate monitor and the multiple
microphone setup helps
recording specific parts of a sound
spectrum which can be useful for
interviews of course the main draw of a
note device is the s-pen the stylus that
provides precision usage and note-taking
capabilities removing the s-pen opens up
the air command menu that allows for
capabilities like easily clipping parts
of the screen for later usage access to
the S note and the action memo the S Pen
itself has also been enhanced to allow
for even better finer writing
experiences but the S note application
has been given the photo note arguably
the biggest addition here which can
capture the lines and designs of any
scene and make them editable by the S
Pen this is good for taking signs
blackboards or any presentations open to
your creativity and yes you can
definitely use the S Pen on the edge but
it just feels weird the battery life of
the Note edge falls in line with the
large form factor 3000 milliamp hours
might sound a little bit poultry for
this unit but it still lasted for around
four hours screen on time but the
standby time and the screen off power
consumption were the story here as it
allowed me to reach the day and a half
mark easily on multiple occasions while
my usage might have been a little bit
higher than most I was still pretty set
with the Note edge and with a Samsung
fast charger you can juice it back up
pretty quickly alright let's move on to
the camera the 16 megapixel shooter in
the Note edge that brings the expected
Samsung quality and various modes though
I have one really big problem with the
way it handles if you haven't noticed
already a lot of the controls for
various Samsung applications are moved
over to the curve which is a nice idea
half the time and then a terrible idea
the other half the camera is a prime
example of when it is not well
implemented you'll still get access to
some on-screen buttons to set settings
but the controls and quick settings are
all in the curve whose organ AMA not
made for smartphone camera shooting I
was never able to take photos with one
hand because trying to reach that
shutter button on the curve is simply
awkward and consistently made me feel
like I might drop the phone support from
my other hand was required pretty much
all the time I wouldn't go as far to say
that the controls on the edge destroy
the shooting experience but it is
certainly an example of how an
innovation like this needs much more
thought put into it still thankfully
photos take on the Samsung quality you
probably expect including the high
saturation levels that might make the
picture a little less accurate to the
original scene but even overly vivid
photos are often received well by the
general user and that's how I feel about
this particular camera various modes are
available including HDR which doesn't
enhance too many photos unless you find
the right situation and the selective
focus which is a real hit or miss
feature that can mess up the focus line
around your subject low-light
performance is somewhat helped by the
optical image stabilization as photos
still lose detail and get grainy the
darker the situation becomes but I will
admit that the note edge and
subsequently the note 4 still perform
better in low-light than most other
competitors but in good lighting the
pictures that come out of this performer
are reliably good and should please most
people who use this phone and finally we
have TouchWiz the operating system of
the Note edge that now has to
accommodate a new area to present a
number of elements before we get to the
curve let's go through what we have
already covered in the galaxy note 4
mainly the multitasking the ease of
multitasking was this versions focus and
it's plainly seen in the recent apps
screen which has added a button to
quickly trigger the multi window hit
that button and just pick an app to open
up on the bottom when prompted
but even when in the dual app setup you
can still switch to a floating app setup
and even make the floating app a small
icon for safekeeping drag down from
either of the top corners and most
applications will be shrunken down to a
floating window and then you can freely
switch among all of these different
modes multitasking is a very big part of
the note experience and it is at its
most capable on the note edge especially
when you factor in the curve a panel
full of icons or folders that you
customize make shortcuts to your
favorite apps available at all times
this feature is by far my favorite
aspect of the new curve adding in even
more ease of use another panel will show
of notifications in real time turning
into a ticker when they come in and a
variety of other panels ad functions
like data tracking further news ticking
with Yahoo as the source and a set of
quick tools that include even a ruler
for quickly measuring everything in the
real world and finally I took full
advantage of the personalization panels
in which I could put a small phrase for
example and some drawings in order to
further make the Note edge my own in the
end I enjoy how the software tries to
use the curve to a good extent but not
every situation will yield a good
experience if anything it's a great
place to get perpetual shortcuts and a
great way of checking the time easily
either manually or
the nightstand clock but are those
features really enough to justify the
edge but that's a question you have to
answer on your own because the Note edge
tends to cost more than the note 4
instead in cases you're paying almost an
extra 150 dollars just to have that
extra curve to the screen on the case
that the curve of the screen provides
enough to justify that price I'm
honestly not that sure the Galaxy Note 4
is already a wonderful device and its
price makes sense for such a premium
phone so it comes down to whether or not
you want to spend the extra money for
something that is let's say simply
different different that's the word that
best describes the experience of using
the note edge even if we're not all that
convinced that the curve is enough to
make us shell out the full price for
this phone I do have to admit that the
unabashed alert is undeniable
Samsung has moved forward with a new
form factor and tried to make it as
compelling as possible with mixed
results I have said before that I would
consider buying the Note edge solely
because I don't think many people would
and I stand by that statement I don't
think what the edge offers over the note
4 is enough to justify its sky high cost
and unless you're like me and crave a
feeling of exclusivity the note 4 is
already such a good package that you
would probably be happy with it already
there are some times that I really hate
using the Note edge but there are 4 more
times that I actually really enjoy using
it and I think half the reason why is
because honestly it feels pretty damn
cool to have something this different
and this unique in my hand as always
thank you guys very much for watching
and I hope you enjoyed this review of
the Samsung Galaxy Note edge it is a
unique device no doubt about it and
honestly that's half of its alert but
the curve proves impractical just as
many times as it proves useful in the
end I'm actually really excited to see
what a second iteration of this will
look like but until then you can keep it
