handy the Android authority app guy and
in this video we're going to take a look
at the hound application by SoundCloud
and we're going to compare it to Google
now now unlike most of my videos where I
have everything neatly scripted out and
you know doing a bunch of stuff to make
it look all nice in this one I'm just
gonna do a flat comparison I just have
the microphone behind the camera and I'm
gonna cut out the boring parts where I'm
not talking or anything like that but
we're just you know we're gonna do this
on the fly without a script so let's get
right into it okay folks here's how this
is going to work I'm gonna have six
rounds of testing the first round is
going to be one question that I know
both services can answer the next test
is going to be one question that I know
neither of them can answer the third
test will be multiple questions so I'm
going to ask it like two questions in
one go the fourth test is going to be
outside of the search functionality so
I'm going to ask it to like leave a note
or find some music stuff like that and
then the final test is going to be
whimsy because why not these things
should be a little bit whimsical alright
um let's get right into the first test
okay folks test number one one question
that I know both can answer okay hound
what is the population of Los Angeles
California the population of Los Angeles
is three million seven hundred
ninety-two thousand six hundred
twenty-one very good all right let's go
over to Google now okay Google what is
the population of Los Angeles California
the population at Los Angeles was three
point eight eight four million and
twenty
all right well the numbers are a little
bit different but Google now did say it
was sourcing it from 2013 both answer
the question relatively quickly no
problems yet let's go to the second test
okay folks the second test is one
question that neither of these search
engines should be able to get on the
first try okay hound what is the thirty
second law of Ferengi acquisition
showing search results for what is the
thirty second law of gravy acquisition
okay so we didn't understand the word
for Rangi and I kind of anticipated that
I knew that was gonna happen but at
least you know that first well actually
no wait no I'm wrong all right so uh
yeah none of these are right hound it
did not do very well uh what is III sir
Oh rain be acquisition of course all
right so I didn't do that well so let's
try out Google now and see how that
works okay Google what is the thirty
second law of Ferengi acquisition and
here you see the power of Google now you
know a slightly better voice recognition
I said the exact same thing to both of
them and there you go Google now wins
round two okay folks for test number
three I'm going to ask multiple
questions at once look we all know that
Google now is going to fail this one but
it's a lot of fun to watch hound you
know pound out all of these answers so
let's give this a shot
okay hound what is the population of
Quebec what is the capital of Norway and
what is the day that is five days after
the day after tomorrow
showing search results for what is the
population of Quebec what is the capital
of Norway and what is the day that is
five days after the day after tomorrow
okay so there is a limit to how many
questions you can ask hound and which
combination of questions you can ask
hound because this totally worked for me
like five minutes ago
okay hound what is the capital of Norway
and what is the population of France
the capital of Norway is Oslo the
population of France is 64 million seven
hundred sixty-eight thousand three
hundred eighty nine all right let's do
the Google now one okay Google what is
the capital of Norway and what is the
population of France all right so it
doesn't quite give you everything that
you need to know I'm gonna try this
hound one one more time just because I
think I figured out what I did wrong
okay hound what is the capital of Norway
and what is the population of France and
what is the day that is five days after
tomorrow okay I guess we can't do it
that way
another case umm hound wins the round
it's just that there's a limit to what
you can do with this application okay so
for test number four I'm gonna do two
things I'm going to ask it to take a
note and see what it does with the notes
and then I'm going to ask it to identify
a song I'm listening to and I picked a
very obscure song not a lot of people
know this one so we're gonna see how it
works
okay Google take a note to remind me to
do something and really imagine it's
bright when are where do you want to be
alerted
five o'clock today okay do you want to
save this yep
saving reminder all right so it added a
reminder even though I asked to take a
note but we know that the note-taking
functionality actually works in Google
now I probably just did it wrong okay
hound remind me to do something here is
your reminder yeah hey there you go it's
it's right freaking there all right well
done
let's get to the music part of it okay
Google what song am i listening to
all right Google now got it right on the
money it was in fact hundred million by
treble charger and that is the right
album so good job at Google now all
right we're gonna go into hound and try
this again okay hound what song am i
listening to
and there it is they both got it right
now Google now wins this round because
it does have a lot of stuff that I
didn't test here you know you can find
directions on Google Maps take notes in
Google key and it has integration with a
lot of other stuff that Hound doesn't
have now hound can do some simple stuff
like taking notes you know like you just
saw me do and finding music sorry about
that frog in my throat but at the end of
the day Google now just has more
functionality it has a much wider range
of things that it can do and that's why
Google now wins this round okay folks so
the last test is whimsy if we're gonna
be integrating our lives with these
things to some extent and so they could
be a little bit of fun to be around you
know you should be able to have a little
bit of fun with it so let's see if you
could have any fun with these
okay Google let's play a game showing
pictures matching your request that's
not what I wanted at all creepy clown
face from saw nope
okay Google tell me a joke and no jokes
although it did link me to a bunch of
stuff or I could find jokes for myself
there so it's not terrible but you know
it's not really personal you know you
don't have a lot of personality they're
just kind of showing you stuff okay
hound tell me a joke I haven't slept for
ten days because that would be way too
long
okay hound tell me another joke please
because that one sucked I went to my
doctor and told him that I broke my arm
in two places he told me to stop going
to those places har har har arts oh
they're cheesy but at least it actually
does tell you jokes okay hound let's
play a game
choose a game from the list below or say
quit
no cool hangman I didn't understand what
you said choose a game from the list
below or say quit the love of God hang
man I didn't understand what you said
choose a game oh my goodness I want to
play hangman hangman guess your first
letter for example you can say gauge for
ages in house okay okay hound the letter
s there are two S's
the letter R oh sorry okay hound the
letter R there is one R okay hound the
letter e there are no E's try again
okay hound the letter A there is one a
okay hound is it brass that's the word
you win yay I win so yeah you can play
games with hound too and something I
found a little funny I want or I read
the review on the verge and they said
that hound didn't have any personality
but here I am playing games with it it
tells me jokes it seems like it has a
little bit more of a personality than
they give it credit for or maybe it's
just because you know it's not Siri but
I'm not going to speculate any further
on that okay folks here's the thing at
the end of the day Google now is just
the more powerful personal assistant
between all of the things that they can
connect to and all the other things that
it does in the background there's just
no real question here you know if you
want the thing that gives you the most
information they can do the most things
then Google now is still the winner
however with hound you know it's not as
bad as people make it out to be it is
actually a lot of fun to use and while
it doesn't have the width and breadth of
things that Google now can do it's still
pretty decent and I do think it's
disingenuous that people do compare the
two as a parallel because hound isn't a
closed beta and Google now has been out
for a couple of years now so Google has
the extra data they have the extra
development time that hound doesn't have
yet so you know here in a few years
it'll be interesting to see just how
much better hound can get um that about
does it for this video ladies and
gentleman I'm Joe handy the Android
authority app guide don't forget to
subscribe to the Android Authority
YouTube channel thank you again for
watching have a wonderful day
okay Google what is the population of
Ontario and what is 30 all right let me
try it again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
