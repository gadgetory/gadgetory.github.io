Transportation National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration you drive you text
you pay now normally when you hear
people like me talk about Android versus
iOS you hear something about flexibility
versus simplicity we're gonna do a lot
more than that today now before we get
into comparing software features we
first got to define the term geek versus
civilian you see this this is a lion
steel s r1 with d2 steel and a mono
frame handle now if you are a knife geek
you gush over this knife and will fall
in love with it just like I do
I carry this knife with me everyday
everywhere if not this knife one other
knife very similar to it why you saying
why do you care a big-ass knife in your
pocket Jase well like you I need to cut
things everyday
packages cardboard string paper
envelopes you name it you use some
cheap-ass dollar store scissors I have a
cool knife with a story about the fit
and finish in the design and the
intentions behind all this cool subtle
features and the craftsmanship that went
into it I'm a knife geek you are a knife
civilian no right or wrong just a
totally different perspective on what we
use to cut stuff you see I will submit
to you that iOS is most enjoyed by
civilians people who just want to get
that cheap pair of scissors to get the
job done iOS does the job and it does it
in a stylus fashion Android on the other
hand are enjoyed by Android geeks people
who want to get into the nitty-gritty
because it's fun and now to dive deep we
first have to talk about androids double
edged open-source sword the ability to
take the base version of Android and
expand upon it has resulted in wonderful
and diverse device experiences sadly
however this has also meant some
seriously strange and problematic
situations and at the core is what is
called the AOSP or Android open source
project built and maintained primarily
by
mother google open-source essentially
means that anyone can download android
and install it on their devices even
manufacturers for free now if they want
to have access to certain essential
Google services like Gmail and Google
Maps then they have to adhere to certain
standards and pay certain licensing fees
but it is still free to basically
download and use and this has allowed
for an amazingly vibrant and diverse
developer community that's created
widgets and totally different versions
of Android forked versions of Android
like CyanogenMod it's been amazing but
the other side of the sword is it can be
a bit chaotic
while many us believe that a lot of
options is a good thing there are those
that feel that there are just too many
options under the Android banner with
something north of 5,000 unique Android
devices available for purchase it's no
wonder that there's some confusion
around consumers when you buy an Android
device exactly what are you going to get
whereas with Android you never quite
know what kind of user experience you're
going to get with the device with iOS
it's like McDonald's wherever you go in
the world you're going to get the exact
same experience or very close to it now
with Apple's iOS on the other hand there
are only three current generations of
smartphones and three sizes of tablets
apple's latest and greatest offerings
are easy to choose from for many there's
no need for more options and variables
they just want a simple device that gets
the job done and they know exactly what
they're going to get when they buy an
Apple device now let's talk about
features that I will argue we both use
more than any other feature on either
smartphone platform and that's
notifications on both platforms you can
swipe down from the top of the screen to
access your notifications on Android
they call it the notification shade this
is a drop down menu that houses current
notifications from the apps and services
on your device Android includes a quick
settings menu at the top when you do a
second downward swipe and iOS put there
quick Settings panel at the bottom
Google has implemented rich
notifications enjoy quick replies to
messages music playback controls and
more all without having to actually open
the apps in question now iOS also does
this but they split up the functionality
while swiping down gives you your
notifications swiping up from the bottom
gives you access to quick settings we
can't deny that we like the iOS quick
settings bar but we do wish we could
slide from any part of the display and
not just the dead center with a small
indicator arrow now it's important to
note here that when it comes to
notifications and widgets Android takes
the cake because it minimizes the steps
you need to engage with your content
with iOS when you want to get to a
widget you have to swipe down to get to
the widget whereas with Android the
widget is just right there it's one
click away to get what you need done and
for geeks that's important now a major
advantage with Android our launchers a
launcher is a full desktop environment
for your device you may have heard the
term skin as well which is appropriately
descriptive of how a launcher works
providing different and extra tools for
controlling apps icons folders numbers
of screens on your home screen layout
and more launchers open up a whole new
world to the Android experience now
let's talk App Store's and ecosystems
first let's start off with Apple's App
Store it is possible to own and operate
an iPhone or iPad without a PC but
you'll never be able to get full
functionality of services without the
old program called iTunes it's not just
for buying music iTunes is the program
on your PC that will allow for full
device backup and recovery syncing of
apps and songs and so much more without
it all you have is the Apple App Store
on your device and the ability to do
some basic backups and syncing through
iCloud the Apple App Store contains that
last recorded measure 1.5 million apps
many apps are free but more will run you
at least $0.99 now the Google Play Store
at last measure contains over 1.6
million apps in addition to installing
these apps directly from your device you
can also install them from the web
there's no need for the average user to
ever connect their Android device to a
PC if they don't want to all app
installs backups and recoveries can be
handled from your phone or tablet in
hand now let's talk about what most of
you are here for performance as you can
see here for basic day-to-day tasks our
sample iOS and Android devices perform
admirably you need to get down and dirty
by loading heavy games and other large
apps before you can really feel the
performance
reference Apple's latest does outperform
a one-year-old curing device and a brand
new Intel power device but that margin
is reduced greatly when flagship Android
devices are considered alright let's
talk price and the fact is with Android
you have far more options you can get a
$700 phone right down to a $50 Android
phone not that I would recommend that
Apple on the other hand focuses on the
more high-end market even their cheapest
phone is still a few hundred dollars so
that's something to think about alright
I did want to talk about some practical
options when weighing the pros and cons
of Android versus iOS and let's talk
about expandable memory many Android
manufacturers provide expandable memory
internal memory right I can take my Sony
Xperia c3 and extend it to 128 gigabytes
that significantly extends the life of
my phone really increasing the value of
that purchase Apple doesn't do that at
all you can also have dual SIM card
support that's fantastic you can really
expand the options of your phone you can
have two different numbers for one phone
that's great
you also have waterproofing options
Apple doesn't do that kind of thing at
all now let's talk about pros with Apple
at least for me one thing that Android
just doesn't do and can't do with their
ecosystem is sync my content so when I
am downloading podcasts on one device
and I go to another iOS device it is
automatically synced that is that's
massive for someone like me who listens
to podcasts and you know whole bunch of
stuff books on a constant basis that's
really practical that's one of the
reasons that I love my iPad so much
consider that what do you guys think let
me know in the comments below I want to
hear it alright let's admit it we all
know it we've all texted while driving
what you may not know is that thousands
of people a year die from distracted
related crashes like texting while
driving and law enforcement right across
the US have really upped their game and
they've initiated an intensive campaign
whereby they're searching for those of
us texting while driving and if they
find you they will write a ticket so be
smart be safe don't text while driving
remember you
five you text you pay for more
information visit distraction.gov
