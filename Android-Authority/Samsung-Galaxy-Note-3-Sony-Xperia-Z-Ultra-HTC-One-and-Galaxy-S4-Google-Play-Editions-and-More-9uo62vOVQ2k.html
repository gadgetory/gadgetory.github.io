Authority for a free trial the galaxy
note 3 the xperia z ultra and some
delicious key lime pie hey it's joshua
Vegard from android 30 what's going on
everybody and it sounds like it's time
for another dose of the week's top
android news it's android authority
weekly we start off with a lot of rumors
regarding the samsung galaxy note 3
korean news sites reported that the
component orders for the note 3 should
be starting by the end of august now
this came is not much of a surprise
because Aoife at berlin happens at the
beginning of September however there was
a little bit of confusion when it came
to the screen see evleaks tweeted that
the note 3 would have a 5.7 inch screen
which is a little bit of a minimal
increase from the 5.5 inch note to it
then followed that samsung will be
producing the galaxy note 3 with Super
AMOLED and LCD variants well this made
some sense considering production costs
it then followed just one day later that
instead Samsung would be outfitting the
note 3 with a super amoled flexible
display why the jump to flexible
displays well perhaps Samsung wants to
show that it can still truly innovate or
maybe LG's own flexible displays are
really just on the horizon one thing is
for certain though regarding the Galaxy
Note 3 we don't really know a whole lot
for certain Sony did bring some real
releases in their big event this week as
was expected the Xperia Z got a big
update in the Xperia Z ultra this
behemoth of a phone has a six point four
inch full HD LCD that has a lot of tech
inside to further enhance your viewing
experience it even got a big update in
performance with the Snapdragon 800 that
is clocked in at 2.2 gigahertz perhaps
the most interesting feature is its
ability to take any pen or pencil and
treat it like a stylist this water and
dust-resistant monster will be out in
quarter three of this year no pricing
has been given if you've been waiting
for some SmartWatch development sony
also had your back this week with the
announcement of the SmartWatch to this
aluminum clad watch features a 1.6 inch
touchscreen and doesn't need to be
paired to any Android device in order to
remain useful everything from answering
calls to tracking fitness will be
possible with a large library of apps it
is slated to be released in September
but no pricing has been given just for
reference though the current SmartWatch
by Sony is still priced at around one
hundred dollars and finally from Sonia
we have rumors of the own ami phone sony
later this week still has a press event
in paris and this might be its focus the
enemy or the xperia i1 is slated to have
a 5-inch screen the snapdragon 800
processor and a 20 megapixel camera that
press event invite that we showed you
last time then was actually not the
xperia z you so we're just going to have
to wait until july four to see what else
sony has for us in the future you ask
and google delivered the samsung galaxy
s4 and HTC One Google Play editions
officially landed this week to the
excitement of many now you can get two
of the top smartphones on the market
with the pier Nexus experience of course
that also means that you're not going to
get the special software that Samsung
and HTC put in like s health or
blinkfeed if you order now the devices
will ship on july 9th and come in at
five hundred ninety nine dollars for the
HTC one and six hundred and forty nine
dollars for the samsung galaxy s4 but
wait hold up it seems you can't really
please everybody and those prices were
the start of some new troubles our very
own nate swanner examines why there
wasn't a mass migration to these new
versions of the HTC One and Samsung
Galaxy s4 in a nutshell the Nexus 4 was
already a great device at a great price
so it seems a little ridiculous
for everyone to have to pay full price
for these new google play edition phones
well what do you guys think let us know
in the comments we got some interesting
news from the wall street journal this
week regarding Google's next moves
apparently google is hoping this fall to
be releasing their own SmartWatch their
own gaming console similar to the Ouya
and an update to the Nexus Q now the
SmartWatch in the gaming console do make
some sense but it's a little odd to see
that Google's going back to the drawing
board on the pretty much failed Nexus Q
we won't know until more details come
out one interesting tidbit though was
that google is planning on allowing
android to power more than just
smartphones and tablets pretty soon
speaking of android the wsj also hinted
at the upcoming release of the next
version key lime pie apparently dubbed
kate edition internally this version
five point no of android is supposedly
slated to be released this fall even
more interesting is the idea that key
lime pie could be supported by older
hardware which is a move that would
definitely help android fragmentation
problem now these are all obviously
unconfirmed bits of information but what
is exciting about it is that we can keep
our fingers crossed to see if the rest
of 2013 will be as awesome as all these
rumors suggest and finally we may not be
getting key lime pie for a little while
but android 4.3 looks to be on the
horizon a flashable test firmware that
is compatible with the samsung galaxy s4
leaked online this week apparently there
aren't too many changes in this version
of Android but if you are feeling
adventurous you can take your rooted
device over to android authority calm
and learn how to get it the main change
in android 4.3 however can easily be
yours found in the HTC One and Samsung
Galaxy s4 Google Play edition devices
damn that's a mouthful is the inclusion
of an updated camera there aren't that
many changes to the camera itself but
the app has been given a new touch
interface that uses arches rather than
full circles the good news is that the
camera was extracted from these two
devices and was put into a standalone
apk which makes it an easy download and
install again head over to android
authority com if you want to learn more
and so there you have it for this
edition of android authority weekly a
written companion for this video can be
found in the description below don't
