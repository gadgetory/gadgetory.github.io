just the trend we've been seeing and
there's no stopping that from the looks
of it through the course of this year
alone we've seen some fantastic phones
already but the honor eight might set
the benchmark in terms of design and
specs at this new price point especially
when it comes to close to matching the
huawei p9 spec sheet Wow this bone looks
utterly amazing it's mind-boggling to
see that it looks to some degree like
the Samsung Galaxy s7 it has this 2.5 D
curved glass covering it which just like
the s7 shimmers in these cool patterns
thanks to how light bounces off the
surfaces it's almost hard to wrap our
head around how the honor
ainÂ´t looks so good especially in
comparison to the honor 5x from earlier
in the year everyone else needs to step
up their game
the 5.2 inch 1080p display looks like
amlet at first but in reality it is
actually an IPS LCD screen it has those
deep and vibrant colors just like AMOLED
there's really not a whole lot to
complain about the screen here since its
resolution quality seemed favorable at
the moment of course still dropped many
comparisons to the Huawei p9 most of the
specs are identical but one the main
differences they'll relate to the
processor the p9 gets the top tiered
Kiran 955 well the honor 8 is slapped
with a slightly less powerful keren 950
now this is acceptable considering that
the phone is being targeted to
Millennials it has enough power to
handle all the basic stuff and given the
emui 4.1 software that's on board and
running on top of android marshmallow
this combination makes perfect sense
although who knows how it will handle
gaming there's also a fingerprint sensor
here on the back which again shows that
they're no longer isolated to high-end
phones it acts as another form of
unlocking the phone but we're impressed
that it's super speedy and it actually
doubles as a button as well where you
can program it to launch the camera app
which is a single press or launch Google
search with a long press and even double
tapping it to take a screenshot as for
the cameras it appears to be almost
like the ones on the huawei p9 there's 8
megapixel front-facing camera and you
have the dual told my pixel camera setup
on the back the notable change here is
that it four goes to like a branding or
attachment now despite that this dual
camera setup allows the phone to
readjust the focus level or bokeh level
post shot the same shooting modes are
pretty much the same here but it'll be
interesting to see if it's quality for a
budget price phone can be flagship level
phones have always gotten cheaper even
for new phones that are just coming to
market we've been seeing this trend for
the last couple of years now with no end
in sight
usually the performance of these
aggressively priced phones reflect their
price so that means subpar qualities
like slow processors lack of expanded
storage and ugly designs you can say
that the honor eight is beating many of
its rivals announced this year already
with a spec sheet worthy of a flagship
device combined with a beautifully
crafted design the honor eight is making
quite the convincing statement so if you
guys want to learn more about the honor
eight you could check out our website
