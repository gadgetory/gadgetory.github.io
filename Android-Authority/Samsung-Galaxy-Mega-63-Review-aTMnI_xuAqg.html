how much phone is too much phone is that
even possible
find out in our review hey everybody I'm
Chris look if you're like me and I know
I am you might think it's a little weird
that phones keep getting bigger and
bigger when not too long ago the goal
was to make them smaller now we have
this the Galaxy mega 6.3 sure it's got a
big screen but is that enough to make it
worthwhile well let's get started by
taking a look at the specs the Galaxy
mega 6.3 has you guessed it a 6.3 inch
720p display it runs a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 400 chipset with a 1.7
gigahertz dual-core Krait processor and
Adreno 305 GPU 1.5 gigs of ram and
either eight or 16 gigs of internal
storage expandable via microSD we're
looking at an 8 megapixel rear-facing
camera with 1080p video capture and a
1.9 megapixel front-facing camera
finally powering everything we have a
3200 milliamp hour battery there's no
way around it
the galaxy mega 6.3 is big now depending
on your point of view and how you use
your phone that's either a good thing or
a bad thing
but other than its general size this is
still very much a galaxy device we're
looking at here the power button volume
rocker headphone jack and USB port are
all exactly where you would expect to
find them the general feel of the device
is solid yet light like a much larger
version of the Galaxy s4 and it's
actually thinner than the note 2 its
size is probably a minus if you drop it
though because it might be easier to
break so try to hang on to it with a
resolution of 1280 by 720 on a 6.3 inch
screen we're only looking at a pixel
density of around 230 pixels per inch
here which had me concerned before I
really got into using the mega but it's
surprisingly not that much of a problem
text and icons rendered fairly sharply
and so did video the display is a tea
tl CD which is a little strange as
Samsung normally uses Super AMOLED
displays but I actually preferred this
as the colors aren't quite so
exaggerated the displays brightness is
better than average and black levels are
fairly deep to test performance we turn
to our usual first tool of choice and to
to benchmark we ran the benchmark not
once but 10 times and took the average
of the scores which ran from around
12,500 to around 13,600 our final
average score was 13,000 309 next we
turn to Epic Citadel running in
benchmark mode first we use the
ultra-high quality setting and ended up
with an average frame rate of around 33
frames per second running in just high
quality mode up the frame rate to around
57 frames per second while high
performance only bumped it up to 58
frames per second in real world use the
Megane never felt slow or laggy whether
it was launching apps or scrolling
through various screens and menus I
tried to quick race in Real Racing 3 and
though I may not be great at the game it
performed just fine the Galaxy mega 6.3
runs Android 4.2.2 jelly bean right out
of the box and it's overlaid with the
same version of TouchWiz as the galaxy
s4 so it feels very similar just - a few
features due to the large size of this
device it's nice to see a landscape mode
included on the homescreen for when you
want to use it more like a tablet now
you don't have to use this but it's nice
to know it's there this review unit
didn't come from a carrier so it was
free of bloatware
unless you're counting the Samsung Apps
like S Memo s planner and s translator
which plenty of people happen to like
it's also nice to see features like
watch on included
sadly I was a little disappointed by the
camera eight megapixels didn't sound bad
and even though this is no s4 I was
expecting something pretty nice but the
photos I took aren't very sharp no
matter what the lighting conditions were
and even using the LED flash didn't help
here
Samsung included a whole lot of camera
functions like HDR and drama shot but
they're not much use of the pictures
aren't that great the 1080p video looks
much better though the caller's tend to
be a little flat motion is nice and
smooth and the image is generally very
sharp the Galaxy mega 6.3 is powered by
a 3200 milliamp hour battery which is a
bit of a surprise given that the note 2
has a 3100 milliamp hour battery but
when you match it with the Snapdragon
400 chipset battery life is pretty good
on the first day of testing I
benchmarked and tested for a few hours
before I set the mega down to work on
something else I came back and grabbed
it late the next day and it was down to
around 15% basically as long as you're
not constantly watching movies and using
the screen all the time the battery
should easily last you a full day and
since the battery is removable you can
always carry a spanner in the end it's
easy to see that this is a big phone
built for people who like big phones we
would have preferred a 1080p screen but
still we're pretty happy with the mega
6.3 in general if you'd like to know
