and wait for the recent apps screen to
come up or you can take multitasking to
a whole new level and all the new
Samsung Note devices there are a couple
pretty cool ways of doing so H Strasburg
Arfa manager I thought he what's going
on everybody and this is a galaxy note 3
multitasking feature focus also shown on
the note 10.1 while anyone that is used
to Samsung smartphone or tablet may be
familiar with the multi window function
it has been pretty greatly enhanced in
these new iterations a somewhat expanded
list of applications is available for
you to split the screen with and as you
saw in my galaxy note 3 review its
function is pretty undeniable as you can
do a plethora of things at once however
because the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet is
able to do everything the Galaxy Note 3
can I decided to show you these features
on it simply because it provides a much
larger canvas so when it comes to multi
window you have the basic split down in
the middle of two apps that can be
dragged from the left side selector this
selector bar can be activated by holding
the back button and can be hidden with a
small tab sticking out for easy access
pick your two apps and it will split the
screen but the actual split can be
altered by dragging the little dot in
the middle thus far this is everything
that we probably already knew multi
window could do tap that little blue dot
in the middle however and you get four
new functions that really open up your
possibilities the first one allows you
to switch the app that is showing on one
of the particular sides yes you can
further multitask within the two windows
that you created for the multi window to
add more apps open up the selector on
the left and you can drag any of the
listed apps into one of the two portions
you've created on the screen what was
replaced then will be stored for this
switch application button so for example
you can keep one part of the screen
static while continue to use another
portion of the screen for all your
multitasking in my case multi window is
away from me to satisfy my YouTube
viewing obsession while checking emails
and browsing the web on the other side
the next option here is the ability to
drag and drop content from one of the
windows to the next off the bat I should
tell you that this does not work with
everything that you would probably think
the rule of thumb that you can use and
incidentally for a number of other
Samsung proprietary features is to
generally only utilize Samsung
Chrome for one example is tough to use
when dragging information from one place
to another taking this information from
an email however did work just fine in
the Samsung internet app while this is a
nice feature to have it doesn't have too
many functions outside of taking info
from one window to search for in the
other or perhaps you could copy your
information from one chat window into
the other so you don't have to type it
again but after that that's pretty much
it and after that of course is the
ability to switch the two windows which
is a simple but pretty obvious option
that you have to include and finally
with one of the two portions selected
you can close just that application by
selecting the last option close window
this one proved a little more useful
than initially thought because hitting
the home button or even the back button
at the right moment it could close both
the applications that you've opened up
in multi window so that's multi window
which is a clearly a powerful way of
getting to and in some ways even more
things done at once however with the
enhanced s-pen you got the air commands
menu that includes the pen window
function you can draw a rectangle of
some sort on the screen and it will fill
that area with one of a number of apps
admittedly in pen window this is a small
amount of available apps compared to the
ones found in multi window the window
you create however can be used on top of
a multi window setup though three might
not be a very optimal number for this
particular kind of function especially
on the smaller screen of the Galaxy Note
3 the same goes for when you create
multiple pen windows while two is
possible given the size of the screen it
is just downright tough to get anything
done when things start to overlap and so
there you have it
multitasking on the Galaxy Note 3 and
10.1 tablet when using the recent apps
screen just isn't enough one thing is
definitely for certain after taking
these devices to their perceived
multitasking limits 3 gigabytes of RAM
is more than just an upgrade and far
from a gimmick if you are a
super-powered user who really needs to
multitask of this crazily then the new
note devices can definitely be your best
