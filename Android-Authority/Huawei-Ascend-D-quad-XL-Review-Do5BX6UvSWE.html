April and you're watching the android
authority channel on youtube today I'll
be talking about Huawei's latest
contribution to the high-end Android
smartphones market Huawei has been a bit
prudent and modest in the high-end
Android smartphones market for quite
some time but with the introduction of
its latest high-end phone the huawei
ascend d quad XL u 9 5 10 e it seems
that Huawei has also started to sharpen
its teeth and produce a rower let's see
if this phone has teeth sharp enough to
compete fiercely in spite of its very
long name the huawei ascend quad XL is a
very portable device its size is
comfortable enough for easy holding
though the phone is rather thick and a
bit heavy these are justified though as
I shall explain in a little bit the
front panel looks classy here's the 1.3
megapixel front camera beside it are the
lead notification light and sensors and
here's the red accent provided by the
speaker grill when I first took this
phone out of its box it instantly
reminded me of the HTC sensation XE
which has a similar looking red accent
except for the capacitive buttons here
these white buttons are visible even
when the screen is off there's a very
discreet hole down here for the
microphone the power button is here on
the top side along with the headphone
jack the bottom side is empty but
there's a notch at the corner for
removing the backplate the volume rocker
is here on the right side the control
buttons are easy to reach to besides
curb sharply towards the back which
makes the phone easy to grip let's check
the back the back plate is hard plastic
with small diamond patterns is texture
here's the 8 megapixel back camera and
do a LED flash still with red accent
this label make sure you know that the
camera has autofocus and can capture
1080p full HD images here's the video
microphone hole here above the Huawei
logo and down here is an indicator that
the phone has Dolby Digital Plus
technology this one's the loud speaker
grill again with red accent I must give
huawei a few brownie points for making
this backplate removable just snap it
off like this the high-capacity battery
is here additional brownie points to
hallway for this 20
600 mah battery capable of about 10
hours of power under very heavy use and
up to a day's worth under moderate use
this battery is one of the main reasons
for the phone's thickness and weight I'd
give more brownie points at this batter
you were removable and replaceable SIM
card slot is here it's for a regular
size zip thankfully micro SD card slot
is here these two are the only reasons
for this removable back plate and I find
it a bit sad Huawei could have done
better by either employing a unibody
chasis with the sim and microSD slots at
the side or make the battery user
replaceable also this backplate creaks
in several areas it doesn't snap on
snugly but it's probably just an
isolated case for this test unit Huawei
is sending with a display and processing
power this phone uses a homegrown quad
core chipset known as the hallway k3v2
with a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core ARM
Cortex a9 cpu and a 16 core GPU together
with one gigabyte of ram 8 gigabytes of
internal storage and up to 32 gigabytes
more of micro SD storage this huawei
phone does pack a punch you'll notice
the powerful hardware at work while
using the phone here's the lock screen
it can switch between 2d and 3d lock
screens here's a default home screen the
display on this phone is high-definition
at 1280 by 720 pixels on a 4.5 inch IPS
+ LCD screen protected by Gorilla Glass
2 it's super sharp and crisp with a
display density of 326ppi the colors too
are not saturated and appear realistic
hallway seems very confident about the
powerful Hardware on its new baby you
can switch between 2d mode and 3d mode
notice how even the widgets are rendered
in 3d one and 3d mode the 3d mode does
cost a display to lag instead are a bit
compared to 2d navigation and 2d mode
though is genuinely smooth and fluid
with little lag here and there as for
the camera the phone spat camera is very
snappy with nearly no shutter lag
autofocus though is a different story
focusing
about one to two seconds outdoor photos
come out really great but photos and
dark environments tend to be noisy the
low light feature doesn't help much
either as for media playback music
lovers will be happy with dolby digital
plus for surround sound even with the
film's loudspeakers the default music
player app shows your songs album art in
a 3d carousel against an equalizer
visualization in the background which
kind of looks nice if your song supports
it you can even sing along with lyrics
videos play fluidly and with hardly any
dropped frame and the stock video player
the phones ready smooth and awesome
under android 4.0 point for ice cream
sandwich i'm not sure exactly when
jellybean is coming to this phone but
i'm sure it will bring a lot of speed
and performance improvements overall the
huawei ascend d quad XL u 9 5 10 e does
have some big things to offer high end
users it has a simple but classy red
extented exterior the phone is solid and
easy to grasp the size is accessible
enough for the fingers it may be a bit
heavy on account of its battery but come
on it's 2600 mAh the high-definition
display is very sharp and crisp with
vibrant and realistic colors multimedia
playback is very pleasurable on the
phone most of all you get very powerful
processing hardware so make sure you
don't overlook this hallway phone when
you make your holiday wish list what do
you think of the hallway ascend the quad
XL u 9 5 10 e share your thoughts in the
