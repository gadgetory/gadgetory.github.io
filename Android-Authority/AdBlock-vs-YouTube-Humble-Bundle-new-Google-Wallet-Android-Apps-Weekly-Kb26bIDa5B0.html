show is brought to you by daily
calculator free the Logan ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe penny the Android of
30 app guy and welcome back to Android
apps weekly let's jump right into those
headlines Google announced earlier this
week that the minimum price for an
application in India has gone down
originally the price was set to 50
rupees and that has now dropped to 10
rupees this will allow app developers to
souther application for less money and
hopefully encourage people to buy more
apps in an unusually stupid move Pandora
will be offering a one-day pass of ad
free listening for $0.99 that adds up to
about $30 per month and at that point
you might as well just use Spotify or
Google Play Music or you know anything
else
we don't foresee this being too big of a
deal although you never know with how
people spend money these days earlier
this week ironhide game studio
developers of the famed kingdom rush
franchise announced on Twitter that
their first Kingdom rush game is now
free with in-app purchases and will
remain that way forever even if it's a
little bit old it's still a solid tower
defense game and definitely worth
checking out a new Humble Bundle is out
now and includes such games as one more
line toward offense the Double Dragon
trilogy and odd world strangers wrath
you can get all of these games for the
average price of just over 4 dollars
which is far less than you'd pay
normally and this is also a great way to
give to charity last up this week it was
announced that YouTube has found a way
around adblock and a hilarious twist
users of adblock and similar
applications go from not seeing ads at
all to not being able to skip them
unless they disable adblock users are
understandably pissed off and I'm sure
the comments section will reflect that
for even more Android apps and games
headlines updates and new releases don't
forget to check out this week's
newsletter which is linked in the video
description below there you'll find the
complete list of stuff that happened
this week including the stuff we didn't
have time for here if you're so inclined
you can head to the written companion
which is also linked in the video
description below and sign up for the
newsletter using your email address and
we'll send it to your inbox every single
Friday while you're at it don't forget
to subscribe to our twitch channel there
we play games goof around and have a fun
time we should be playing some games on
Monday at 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
we do more but we're preparing for some
YouTube gaming so keep an eye out for
that as well ok folks is take a look at
the apps and games that made a big
splash this week as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the video just
option below you sunk for Android wear
is as you'd imagine a game for Android
wear in this simple game your test was
sinking all of the enemy battleships
using a variety of weapons the game can
be played on either a phone or an
Android wear device but it seems to be a
little bit more fun on the watch
there are also power-ups different time
settings and even nukes if you want them
it's free to download but do be aware of
those release date bugs virustotal
uplink is a newer antivirus application
and virus scanner that scans your files
and applications on command or you can
have it run in the background it's well
designed and comes with a very small
footprint at 1.4 megabytes
I know not a lot of people use
anti-virus applications and that's ok
but this seems to be something worth
trying out for those of you who do it is
totally free with no in-app purchases
kill me again infectors is a match-three
puzzle game with some fighting game
elements mixed in unlike most puzzle
games that use these mechanics this one
actually kind of has a storyline it is a
zombie game where you must survive in a
world run by zombies but the cinematic
graphics are pretty decent the mechanics
are solid and it's actually a pretty fun
little time waster it's also free to
download if you're interested but again
watch out for those early bugs in an
amusing twist of irony the adblock
browser was released earlier this week
in terms of pure browsing power the
adblock browser isn't all that special
it does the basic browser stuff without
a lot of bells and whistles obviously
the main focus of this application is to
block advertising and that is something
that it does rather well it's worth
trying if ad blocking is something
that's important to you as with most
applications there are a few bugs out of
the gate in anticipation for the
upcoming Google pay rollout Google has
taken the Google Wallet functionality
and put it in its own application with
this app you'll be able to view your
balance manager Google Wallet card if
you have one of those send and receive
money and a whole lot more it's
essentially what the current Google
Wallet application is except for it
doesn't have any of the time to pay
functionality if you use any of these
features you'll want this application
because we imagine that it'll be leaving
the current Google Wallet app once it
turns into Android pay thanks again for
watching the video everybody but let's
get down to some serious business this
week's Android apps weekly is sponsored
by daily calculator free this
application was designed to look good
and be easy to use full of which it does
extremely well some of the features
include multiple color themes the
ability to copy the calculation by
long-pressing and even some
customization options you can even
enable and disable memory buttons change
the keypad layout and change the display
format it's easy to use
it's totally free with no in-app
purchases or you can pick up the ad free
version for $0.99 give it a shot and
show your support for the Android apps
