name is kevin AKA vet tech ninja and
today i'm doing a quick look at the
official and newly released Nexus 7
folio case the Nexus 7 was manufactured
by soos and was released in July of 2013
since then there has been an onslaught
of accessories coming from third-party
manufacturers during this time Google
has been laxed when it comes to pushing
on official accessories Google's
official folio case was released in
October of 2013 and how does it hold up
well here's a quick look there are four
options for Google's folio case the
option that I have is gray in blue at
first appearance this case is stunning
the two-tone option makes the case
appearance pop the material is and it
looks like Jean fabric the stitching has
a subtle design element and gives it a
somewhat premium feel the inner portion
of the case feels like a mixture between
suede and rubber I'm not really sure
what it is but it works the edges on the
case have just enough lip to cover the
edge on the tablet and the holes are cut
with precision the threads in the
stitching are thick and well placed when
the device is in the case it feels well
secure all the buttons and ports are
fully exposed and provides a layer of
protection the flap on the case has a
ridge for it to fold under so you can
prop up the tablet and this allows for a
fixed viewing angle but you are able to
flip the case over and view it in a more
traditional 45-degree angle although the
latter does not have the same amount of
stability and at first glance this case
is a true winner but there are a few
things that are missing that could be a
true game killer the first thing this
case does not have a magnet to turn the
screen on and off the second issue this
case does not last on anything so if the
case drops the flap may come open and
thus leaving no protection for my device
thirdly not having true adjustable
angles and this makes it not as
universal as the cheaper cases for the
tablet coming up soon on Android
authority we will compare the top Nexus
cases in a battle and we will let you
