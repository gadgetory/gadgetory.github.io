cars and even smart watches but Samsung
is trying to debut a smart skincare
product personally I was hoping for the
smart hair product Samson will be
showing off a number of experimental
electronic devices next week at the 2017
Consumer Electronics Show CES baby in
Las Vegas and one of them is called
Lumina a skincare scanner device that
links with a smartphone app lumen II is
part of Samsung's cielab division which
was formed in 2012 with the goal of
fostering more innovative technology
aside from lumen II the company will
also show two more see lab projects at
CES 2017 one of the other see lab
projects is yet another skin care
product called s skin one part of the
product is a micro needle patch designed
to enter the skin to deliver effective
ingredients and enhanced absorption what
dude I don't really know this is just
the information Sammy's given us but the
other part is a portable device created
to measure the hydration redness and
melanin of the skin while using LED
lights to take care of a person's skin
and just when you thought that 2016
couldn't get more bizarre oh we find a
new smartphone app slash device that
will help those in long-distance
relationships to kiss via their
smartphone my god I'm actually reporting
on this I swear to God I did not make
this up I found this via the verge and
it's called the Kissinger and the
Kissinger pairs with a messaging app
that lets users send a kiss so when one
is sent the Kissinger measures pressure
on different parts of the sender's lips
to replicate that kiss on the recipients
Kissinger the lip part of the device is
made of silicon and I doubt it feels
like a regular kiss but who knows maybe
a cold to silicon device pushing against
your lips will make you feel good if you
it came from a loving place now a
current prototype only works on iOS but
with androids dominance you can expect
that such an app is probably coming to
the Android operating system
