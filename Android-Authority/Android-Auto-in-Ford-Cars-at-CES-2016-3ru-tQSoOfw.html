authority what's going on everybody and
we are inside of a way 2017 Ford Escape
Florida escape 2017 edition that's very
very exciting and we have some very
exciting news when it comes to Fort at
the very least especially for you
Android fans out there Android auto has
officially come to Ford alright and we
have Mike Lambert here who's going to
give us a demo of it and you can see we
have an extra shot over here of the
actual interface so Mike what is Android
auto rather let me do it the other way
what is Ford bringing to Android auto
now so what we're looking at here is our
sync 3 system so this is available on
select 2016 mowers and all 2017 model
year vehicles starting with this floor
escape in 2017 so the exciting news for
the sync three in this 2017 Escape is
that we are integrating Android auto so
when you connect Android device which is
going to be 5.0 or higher you're going
to get the launched up here's the
Android auto interface so what that
brings to you is you get the exciting
Google Maps you get all of your phone
information brought in you get media
apps as well as a third-party media apps
that Google's brought in but what we're
doing as sync which is really exciting
is that when you look at this screen
here where we previously had some sync
features that are now kind of redundant
to the Android features we've replaced
those with Android we've given Android
features preference so that way the
customer can has chosen to use Android
auto as well like Google Maps and all of
those features but we're still giving
them ability to use their you know
native audio systems FM satellite radio
their climate features and an easy way
to jump right back into things like
Google Maps so right from the sink
system we've done this kind of
harmonious integration between Android
auto and sync 3 to really make the two
systems intuitive and easy to use
for the customer we want to give the
customer the experience that they want
right so we're giving these projected
technologies like Android auto and the
customer's chosen to plug in their
device and use that so we really want to
make that this experience the best we
can for them using the Android device
and using the Android features like
mapping and and media so that's great
and of course if to our to our viewers
right now that if you're familiar with
any Android auto iterations already that
is essentially what you're seeing here
but it is integrated a little bit better
here on the four iterations what cars
from Ford will have Android auto already
built in yeah so 2017 model year
Ford's and Lincoln's will with sync
three we'll all get Android auto so
they're austell board across the board
that's so we don't have great
differentiation or anything like that
okay in the future actually towards the
end of 2016
those customers that have bought 2016
model your vehicles I have sync three
we're gonna update their vehicles as
well so they're not left out of that all
right that's awesome
so one sort of slightly offbeat question
are there any other connectivity options
that are available with the cars
especially the 2017 editions like smart
phone apps for example or anything like
that yes so we offer four connected
experiences we offer Android auto what
you're seeing here we also offer apple
carplay and we offer app link which is
kind of the Ford's version of bringing
in the connected apps so we love it
because it we feel gives it a customer
the ability to choose you know they get
to choose the experience that they like
whether it be app link which they've
been using on previous Ford vehicles or
these new features like Android auto or
apple carplay sounds great all right
well that was a quick look at Android
auto in Ford cars once again we're in
the Ford Fusion the future so I had a
problem really I keep thinking of the
fusion in the Fiesta those are the two
that come to mind because I actually was
going to get a Fiesta one time yeah the
16s K 16 Fiesta has sync three exactly
well you guys can look forward to if you
happen to have
new Ford cars I can get upgrades Android
auto obviously but in this case we're in
a 2017 Ford Escape and we want to thank
you for letting us sit in here and you
know kind of get away from all of the
ruckus for at least a few minutes but we
really appreciate it here Mike thank you
so much
all right well Android auto the future
of computing inside of the Ford cars you
know so we really like what we see and
we really look forward to seeing them in
even more so thank you yeah wonderful
all right stay tuned for even more about
perhaps Android auto but of course all
about Android here at CES 2016 as we our
Android Authority coming to you live
