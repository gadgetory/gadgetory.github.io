Android authority and love it or hate it
Plus phones are starting to become the
new trend in the smartphone world
typically bringing better specs and more
features to an OEMs main flagship and to
the surprise and maybe even the dismay
of many HTC has done exactly that with
the one m9 and has added a few key
enhancements that some may feel probably
should have been there from the get-go
is this HTC's true flagship let's find
out what the HTC One m9 plus from a
design perspective the m9 plus is
essentially a blown-up version of the m9
with just a few minor tweaks it's larger
than the m9 in both height and width due
to the bump and display size there's a
fingerprint sensor located on the bottom
chin now and the rear camera has been
slightly redesigned to a circular shape
versus the rounded off square on the m9
otherwise this is still the same
all-metal design and build quality that
we've come to expect from HTC the
corners are rounded off in the back is
tapered to allow the phone to sit nicely
in the hand and the metal Ridge or
stair-step effect that goes around the
entire perimeter of the phone provides
for a much better grip it still isn't
the easiest phone to hold on to but by
no means did I ever feel like it was
going to slip out of my hands even
though the m9 plus is slightly larger
than the m9 it's not a drastic
difference and for most people this will
still be considered a pretty normal
sized smartphone so if one handy
usability is what you're concerned about
it's not really that big of an issue the
power button is located on the right
side just below the volume buttons which
is a stark improvement over previous one
devices but just like the regular m9
it's just a hair too low making it
slightly difficult to reach to be
perfectly honest it really should be
swapped with the volume down button but
thankfully HTC's double tap to wake
returns here to help you avoid using the
power button all together and what the
m9 plus you also have the added benefit
of unlocking straight into the device
with the fingerprint sensor the rest of
the buttons and ports are in their usual
places with the large black strip up top
for the IR blaster microUSB and 3.5 mm
headset jack on the bottom and the SIM
card tray located on the left side
course the m9 plus wouldn't be complete
without HTC's tried-and-true boom sound
speakers on the front and for better or
worse the infamous black HTC bar still
resides below the display speaking of
the display the m9 plus features a
larger 5.2 inch screen over the m9 and
with a resolution of 2560 by 1440 or
quad HD it's also much sharper although
depending on who you are you may not
even be able to tell the difference
regardless HTC delivers another
fantastic looking display with the m9
plus and puts their 1 flagship on par
with the competition the blacks aren't
as deep in comparison to say in AMOLED
display but that's to be expected from
an LCD the overall screen however is
bright vivid with great viewing angles
and it's pretty easy to see outdoors it
does bias more towards a warm color tone
giving off a slightly yellowish hue
which is very different from the m9
which has a much cooler display but
otherwise the screen on the m9 Plus is a
pleasure to use in normal day-to-day
operations and for media consumption
another major change with the m9 plus is
the processor the m9 plus still features
3 gigs of RAM but HTC opted to go with a
mediatek chip this time around versus
the Snapdragon found in the m9 in
general everyday use like navigating
through the interface and opening up
applications the m9 plus maintains a
very fluid and responsive experience
it's when multitasking that things start
to become a mixed bag sometimes
switching back and forth between
applications can be smooth and
responsive and other times there's a lot
of stuttering in the animations and huge
delays and load times between apps
gaming however is where you start to
notice the biggest dip in performance
and HTC's decision to go with mediatek
becomes a little bit of a head-scratcher
intensive games like modern combat 5 can
run smoothly at times but when there's
too much action on the screen at one
time the framerate starts to dip
resulting in some choppy gameplay games
like Mortal Kombat 10 are a little too
much for the m9 plus to handle and even
simple games like clash of clans while
still completely playable fail to run at
a consistent frame rate it's possible
some of this could be due to a lack of
optimization for the immediate Exorcist
ampere on anyone who enjoys gaming on
their phone one part of the gaming
experience or
Media consuming experience in general
where HTC still reigns King is the
front-facing boomsound speakers there's
still the loudest and most Kris sounding
speakers on any smartphone that still
yet to be rivaled by anyone and with
Dolby audio enhancements you can easily
talk between a theater mode for a
surround sound effect and a music mode
for a more flatter sound the bottom
speaker has undergone a slight makeover
with a separation in the grille to make
way for the m9 pluses fingerprint
scanner the process of setting up the
fingerprint scanner is very similar to
both Apple and Samsung implementation
requiring a series of repeated presses
to accurately record your fingerprint
and up to five fingerprints can be
stored at one time once setup the
fingerprint scanner works surprisingly
well unlocking the phone almost
instantaneously the majority of the time
and HTC's implementation feels like it
can easily rival that of both Samsung
and Apple the fingerprint sensor is also
very well thought out allowing to treat
it like a dedicated home button but
because it's not a real button it
functions more like a capacitive key
than a physical button for storage the
m9 plus comes in a 32 gigabyte
configuration only but if you need more
the microsd card slot will allow for up
to an additional 128 gigs of storage
this is actually a downgrade over the m9
s 200 gigabyte limit but for most users
a hundred and twenty eight gigs should
still be sufficient with the camera the
m9 plus brings back the duo camera setup
that we originally saw on the m8 this
allows the camera to refocus shots after
the fact but considering mini smartphone
cameras can achieve the same effect with
only one sensor reintroducing the duo
camera becomes a rather questionable
move otherwise the main camera is still
the same 20 megapixel sensor as the m9
and the four ultra pixel camera has been
brought to the front for some
high-quality selfies HTC's camera
interface is a simple one you can easily
switch between the front camera main
camera and panorama just by swiping on
the viewfinder or tapping the button on
the bottom right and a couple others
like photobooth and split capture can be
added to the mix if you'd like the rest
of the camera settings are buried in the
overflow menu which keeps the interface
from appearing cluttered but getting to
modes like HDR and manual require a few
more steps than is necessary
the most notable difference with the
chem UI is the addition of the duo
camera toggle to quickly switch between
duo capture and standard high resolution
shots the duo camera works just like it
should but for best results you need to
make sure you have a clear subject of
focus and a clear background or the
refocusing may not look very convincing
the biggest caveat to using the duo
camera is photos are capped at 4
megapixels so there's not a whole lot of
room to work with if you're planning to
crop when shooting a normal full
resolution there is plenty of detail to
be had especially when you're working
with 20 megapixels but being that this
is the same camera sensor in software
the m9 plus has a lot of the same issues
that plagued the m9 good looking shots
are possible given the right lighting
conditions but the cameras main problem
is its lack of dynamic range and how it
handles exposure the exposure can be
adjusted by tapping anywhere on the
viewfinder which sounds really easy but
even the most my new change in where you
tap will cause some major exposure
swings and you can wind up with two
completely different looking photos as a
result HDR can help improve the
situation but with several seconds of
processing time between each shot it's
not exactly practical to use at all
times the situation doesn't get much
better in low light and without OAS it
becomes extremely difficult to get a
clear shot especially when the shutter
has to stay open longer to try to
capture more detail at higher ISOs
pictures quickly become filled with
noise which is to be expected but this
typically results in soft images with
very little color and HTC's
post-processing isn't quite able to save
it this just goes to show that more
megapixels doesn't always equate to
better image quality and it's very
evident that HTC's camera is still
suffering from the same problems as
before on the bright side battery life
on the m9 plus has been quite good the
embedded 28 40 milliamp hour battery can
easily last anywhere between 14 to 16
hours with normal usage which should be
enough to get most people through a full
day on a heavier day filled with lots of
gaming and picture taking that number
can dip down considerably and in my case
those around 10 to 11 hours while I
can't provide exact screen on time
numbers mainly because HTC has made that
number incredibly difficult to determine
for whatever reason what I can say is
that I never
had a problem getting through a full day
with the m9 plus unless I really
hammered on the device and in that case
I would have to recharge midway through
the day now since it's being powered by
the mediatek processor you do lose out
on the fast charging which would have
been really nice to have but considering
the m9 plus has more than adequate
battery life it isn't exactly a
deal-breaker for the software the m9
plus is running on Android lollipop with
the latest Sense 7 that brings
everything that many have come to know
and love about cents from previous
versions and adds a few key features
that we first saw on the m9 since
they're retains a very fast and fluid
interface and of course you have the now
very familiar UI elements like the
vertical scrolling app drawer and
blinkfeed for aggravating all of your
social media and news stories into one
panel blinkfeed can also show you
restaurant recommendations now during
mealtimes and these can even show up on
your lock screen if you'd like all the
motion launch gestures that make
accessing certain functions of phone a
lot faster are also still available you
can double tap to wake the display swipe
up to unlock the device from a sleep
State directly access blinkfeed and
quickly get into the camera just by
picking the phone up in landscape and
hitting the volume down button just to
name a few
the newest feature is introduced into
sense 7 is the addition of the home
widget and the themes engine the home
budget aggregates a selection of
applications that are most pertinent to
you based on your location whether
you're at home work or out and about and
these applications can change over time
as the widget learns from your usage
habits a folder of recently downloaded
applications will also appear here along
with some recommended apps that it
thinks you might like the home widget
can definitely be useful but if you feel
otherwise it can easily be removed since
it's just a widget the new themes engine
on the other hand is one of the coolest
features of Sense 7 and even though
sense is already a great-looking UI it's
always nice to have a change of scenery
the themes engine is still relatively
new but there's already a plethora of
themes to choose from allowing to change
virtually everything at the click of a
button from the wallpaper icons sounds
fonts and even the general system UI
elements you can even create your own
theme by selecting a wallpaper or photo
of your choice and the theme engine will
automatically build one for you or you
can get more granular with it
get exactly the way that you want the m9
plus is already available in markets
like China and India and recently just
became available on Amazon for purchase
here in the states for around seven
hundred and forty dollars give or take a
few bucks in either direction as pricing
does tend to fluctuate on Amazon you
have the choice of gunmetal and silver /
gold for the color options but keep in
mind this is GSM only so it will only be
compatible with AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile here
in the States
with such a high price tag the m9 plus
will be going up against some very stiff
competition like the g4 s6 and even the
m9 itself and without a carrier subsidy
it's not going to be feasible for
everyone if you're debating between the
m9 plus or the m9 you'll basically have
to ask yourself if a larger quad HD
screen a built-in fingerprint scanner
and the reintroduction of the dual
camera is worth the price the addition
of the quad HD screen is great and the
fingerprint scanner is very well
executed but for current m9 owners you
shouldn't feel cheated because not
everything about the m9 plus is an
improvement the performance takes a step
backwards and the camera largely remains
the same but if those aren't total deal
breakers then maybe this is the one
you've been waiting for
