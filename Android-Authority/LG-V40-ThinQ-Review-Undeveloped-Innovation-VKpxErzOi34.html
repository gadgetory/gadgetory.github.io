that phone really changed things up for
the company it introduced a whole new
design which is pretty rounded off and
very similar to how the UI works but it
also included things like the quad dak
dual cameras with a wide-angle camera
and even a wide-angle camera on the
front
this year LG's taken the best parts of
the LGV 30 the new and upgraded features
in the LGG seventh in queue and created
what they like to call the LG v 40 thin
queue now if you used the LG b 30 before
you're gonna feel right at home with the
v40 thank you the design is extremely
similar but it's pretty much been
upgraded to fit in in 2018 it's got a
much bigger 6.4 inch display which is
still the OLED from last year and this
year Zola doesn't really seem to have
the quality problems that the V 30 had
the panel's 1440p and it looks okay it's
got a pretty high pixel density but for
some reason it just didn't seem quite as
sharp as something like the samsung
galaxy note 9 now that being said the
panel does support HDR so you can watch
HDR content on this thing and you can
also upscale other content to make it
hgr compatible once you look at the rest
of the body you can see how LG is pretty
much keeping everything in here well
bring you up to date with that 2018
field we've still got the headphone jack
with that quad DAC that's gonna make
your audio sounder really great and LG
did tell me they are planning on keeping
that headphone jack until it's pretty
obvious that the consumers don't
actually want it anymore if you'd rather
play music straight out of your phone
they have ported the boombox speakers
from the LG G 7 into this phone so it
gets really loud it doesn't feel quite
as loud as the ones in the LG G 7 but
we'll have an audio review coming later
down the line also inherited from the g7
is the Google assistant button and I
know people like Samsung got a lot of
flack for having another button
dedicated to their virtual assistant but
personally I really love Google
assistant and I always use the squeeze
feature on the pixel to excel so I'm
really glad to see that
is bringing that to this phone the
software on this phone is really a mixed
bag it is very stock and pretty simple
in most of the menus and if you're just
scrolling around the home screen you're
gonna be fine but as soon as you go to
the settings menu
it gets really clunky there's just so
many different types of settings that
are just not organized very well and if
you scroll down from the top without
trying to get into the settings menu it
brings you to this overlay thing which
is supposed to show you about your day
but really just uses a ton of different
UI elements that just feel extremely
clunky now that being said LG hasn't
included a ton of their own proprietary
apps in here and they are using Google
for most things you can even have access
to Google feed if you scroll to the left
from your home screen
LG's UI is really love it or hate it but
if you do hate it you can always just
throw in another launcher like Nova to
get the best experience so the LGV 40
thin queue is a flagship so it is
running flash expects it still got the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 it's got 6 gigs
of ram but the one spec that seemed a
little underwhelming here was the 64
gigabytes of storage now this phone does
have expandable storage available so you
can always throw in one of those 400
gigabyte microSD cards like the one that
went on sale last week for like a
hundred bucks on Amazon I would just
like to see a few more storage options
available
overall I didn't really notice any
pickups in general performance but the
battery life on this thing was pretty
bad it's got a 3300 milliamp hour
battery which is pretty average for a
lot of phones but now that it's up
scaled the screen to 6.4 inches
it just doesn't last that long I got
like between 4 and 5 hours of screen on
time in any given day and that's just
not that great especially when you
compare it to the 6 to 7 hours that I
got on the samsung galaxy note 9 now the
note 9 does have a four thousand
milliamp hour battery so that makes a
lot of sense and I really would have
preferred that LG kind of bumped the
battery capacity here okay so you're
probably gonna notice that I'm comparing
the LG before you thinkyou to the Galaxy
Note 9 a lot and that's because they're
really similar they both have OLED 6.4
inch displays they both have headphone
jacks people forgot wireless charging
and ip68 water resistance so what
exactly sets them apart
well the note 9 is rocking the s10 LG g4
teeth in queue has 5 cameras and I know
that sounds a little crazy but as you
already saw the LG before you think you
has 3 cameras on the back and 2 on the
front the 3 cameras on the back are a
wide-angle a standard angle and a 2x
telephoto zoom this lets you do a lot of
different things like triple shot where
you can pretty much just choose the
angle you want to shoot before you shoot
it or you can just shoot all three in a
sequence and then choose after you take
the photos which one you like the best
this is a pretty cool feature but for
some reason it doesn't really focus the
same when it takes all three photos so I
notice that some of them kind of came
out blurry I generally just prefer to
use the overview mode that shows you all
the different cameras before you
actually take the shot and then choose
which lens you want to use before you
shoot it as for the quality the lenses
the standard and the wide seem pretty
good the white has really good color
reproduction but for some reason the 2x
telephoto just seemed a little bit
disappointing it's supposed to be an
optical zoom so it should be a lot
better than like a digital crop but for
some reason it just seemed pretty muddy
and the sharpness was not very good
I know LG has a lot more experience
using those wide-angle lenses but I
really would have liked to see the 2 X
optical zoom up to par if they were
going to stick three cameras on the back
of this phone and like I said before
there's five cameras on this phone so
that means that there are two selfie
cameras there's a regular sensor and
there's also a wide sensor and I'm
really glad that LG made this decision
they were able to fit two of those
cameras right inside the pretty small
notch on the front of this phone and the
wide-angle camera makes it really easy
to get selfies with a group of people
there's also allowed for things like
portrait mode which unless you're google
you need two cameras for anyway
and it actually works pretty well on
this phone okay so on paper the LG v40
think you pretty much has everything if
you're really into audio or you want
those wide cameras then those are some
killer features the biggest issue for me
is that this phone ranges between like
900 to a thousand bucks depending on the
carrier than you get it on you just
can't review phones in a vacuum and the
LG g 7 honestly has like 95% of the
features that the v40 think you
the only features you're really missing
on the lg g7 are the bigger oled screen
and like a couple of the cameras but the
thing is the g7 is a lot cheaper than
this phone right now it retails for
about 750 dollars and it frequently goes
on sale for 650 or less for me if you're
gonna spend a thousand dollars on a
phone it really has to be best-in-class
and pretty much everything that it does
and the thing is the v40 think you just
doesn't really do that if this phone was
like 700 to 800 dollars it would
probably be worth looking at but I think
there are just a lot of better options
on the market right now anyways let me
know what you guys thought of this
review I really wanted to like this
phone and I did like it
I just don't think it's worth a thousand
dollars make sure you drop your thoughts
in the comments section below I'll go
down there and answer all your questions
and I'll see you next time because of
