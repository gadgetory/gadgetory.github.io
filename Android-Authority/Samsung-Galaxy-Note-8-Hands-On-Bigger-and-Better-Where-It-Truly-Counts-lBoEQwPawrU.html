everybody and this is the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 now Samsung has had a bit of a
resurgence since the galaxy s 8 trying
to make up for the problems of the past
but how does one of the most feature
packed phone lines redeem the pass well
that's what we hope to find out it's
easy to think that the Galaxy Note 8
will basically be a galaxy s 8 plus with
an S Pen and while that's not too far
from the truth it's also just a tad bit
too simplistic to start the phone
currently comes in four colors black
grey golden blue or the US market there
will only be the gray in black editions
that's why I went straight for the blue
one because I don't feel like I'll be
able to use it any more after this so
let's get the obvious part out of the
way the phone looks and feels a little
bit big much like with the galaxy s 8
plus it has a screen that comes in at
six point three inches think about that
for a second the note line used to be
known for its 5.7 inch displays and now
they're finding ways of extending it by
three-quarters of an inch
thankfully we have the curved infinity
display that helps with handling but
this is still not the most ideal phone
to use in one hand the display continues
the trend of steeper aspect ratios and
it continues the other trend of taller
and more narrow displays the difference
here is that the curves have been dialed
back a tad mainly because the phone
itself is a little bit bigger a little
bit taller and a little bit thicker all
around but it's hard to knock the size
too much because that large screen size
remains one of the most enjoyable parts
of the note in order to make room for
this the noh8 also catches up to the new
design aspects like removing the tactile
home button and capacitive keys and a
button basically underneath the screen
that will vibrate when you press down
hard enough
speaking of buttons the rest are all
where you would expect to though the
Bigsby button now finds its way into the
note line the next enjoyable part of the
note when compared to the Galaxy S line
is the more premium experience the note
generally tried to have better specs and
that philosophy returns in the note 8
there's one obvious spot of discretion
however the battery is 3300 milliamp
hours while we always would prefer a
bigger battery for better longevity we
also kind of understand what the
motivations were here
the Snapdragon 835 keeps the phone as
updated as it should be but six
gigabytes of RAM is the real big story
here this is the first time that Samsung
is going past the four gigabyte mark for
all of the devices across its release
and that six figure bytes of RAM should
be able to help with a lot of features
like the edge UX it gets one useful
update for the multitaskers out there
users have told Samsung that due to the
large screen multi window has been
utilized a bunch for those users the
note a adds in dual app shortcuts called
app pair they can be created in the home
screens or nestled in the edge panels
for easy access and the open up to
user-defined applications at once in
multi window automatically there are a
lot of different combinations that would
help with multitaskers out there like
the calendar and the email app or in my
case pretty much YouTube and anything
else which brings us to the S Pen the
main extra for any note device over the
years the S Pen has been given many new
features that it's kind of hard to list
them all open up the pen command menu
and you'll see all of the different
features smart selection no creation
screen capture and there's even an
option for using the pen and all of its
brushes to do some coloring maybe you
would like to share some of your doodles
in the pen up artsy social media network
or just use the s-pen pretty much like a
mouse to do things like click drag and
drop translate has been updated so it
can translate more than just single
words at a time and for the real note
taker the screen off memo that activates
from standby can now record a hundred
pages of editable notes without the need
to unlock the device first now the main
new feature here is actually a fun one
but it's still kind of practical the
live message which records the users
path to writing a short message into an
animated gif added effects like sparkle
is a neon lighting give it a little bit
more Flair helping to make pleasing
gifts that you can sense a friend
significant others or pretty much anyone
that deserves that little bit extra all
of this is on top of the Samsung UI that
continues to look about a streamlined as
ever the software on the note 8 looks
very similar to the one from the s8 with
very few changes in the look the updates
are happening mainly in bigsby where we
were told that more voice commands will
be made available and we can expect more
updates to the rest of the capabilities
Bixby has like vision will continue to
test Bigsby and see how every aspect
gets better on the Galaxy Note 8 so with
all of that out of the way we can talk
about
the main addition to the Galaxy Note 8
the camera as expected the dual camera
has made it to the Samsung ecosystem
adding that second lens on the back in
an obvious black area a black color to
this whole area is a little bit jarring
when you see it on every device no
matter what color it is and it kind of
adds a high level of contrast when
you're using a non black device how it
looks is kind of up to you but these
cameras really pack a punch 12 megapixel
dual pixel sensors with OAS in both
lenses and one lens is a 2 X optical
zoom at f/2 point 4 aperture 10 X
digital zoom is possible but overall
having oh is in both sensors is kind of
a big deal it will really help for when
you go tighter into a shot and all of
those jitters are actually being
compensated for the interface where the
camera has changed a little bit to
reflect this new hardware change live
focus is not only still available it is
now kind of front and center much like
the portrait modes from the iPhone and
the oneplus 5 the note 8 will use a
combination of the zoom lens and
software enabled depth of field to make
subjects stand out from the background
but one really cool feature about this
is that you get both photos you get the
picture from the zoom lens that has the
depth of field and you also get a
picture from the regular lens so you
have both to choose from we of course
applaud the move to a dual camera setup
and so far it seems that Samsung is
putting some real thought into their
iteration it already benefits from fast
focusing dual pixels the dual o is and
pretty much every other mode that you
would expect in a Samsung camera and all
of this is alongside the front-facing 8
megapixel camera that has autofocus and
2k video recording will be putting all
of these lenses to the tests when we get
our hands on our review unit and so
there you have it the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 consider for a fact that
everything that I told you in this video
is basically what is new and there's
still so many other features that you
may or may not already be familiar with
inside of the Galaxy Note 8 so far the
Galaxy Note 8 manages to be just
slightly larger than its predecessor but
much bigger and badder in every other
area that truly counts the screen
continues to be a sight to behold adding
a zoom lens gives people more shooting
possibilities and the s-pen remains one
of the most useful tools for anyone that
bothers to use it especially for
productivity we're excited to get our
hands on the note 8 as always and we
will be bringing you our full review
soon pre-orders start on August 28th
the phone going out on September 15th
