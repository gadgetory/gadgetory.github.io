know what that means
it is MWC time and we've got
manufacturers dropping smartphones like
they're hot left and right but right now
today we are going to focus on Nokia who
just dropped a new phone which we've
seen leaked for months and months now
but it is finally here this is the Nokia
9 so on the insides the Nokia 9 seems
like a 2018 flagship basically it's got
a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 it's got 6
gigabytes of RAM and it's got 128
gigabytes of storage and honestly that
is pretty much the equivalent of what
you were going to get out of the
top-of-the-line 2018 smartphone but what
makes the Nokia 9 really really special
is that five camera array on the back of
this phone last year we saw people like
LG and Huawei drop three cameras in the
back of their phone but no Nokia is
going next level with this thing they've
actually partnered up with a company
called light and if you remember them
they created this crazy camera called
the light L 16 which had 16 different
cameras on the back of it that basically
used AI to stitch all these images
together and just create one super
sampled photo so the back of the Nokia 9
you have not three not four but five
different camera sensors and three of
these are monochrome sensors so if
you're wondering what monochrome does
these are really for light capturing in
detail we saw this in the Huawei P 20
Pro which had a monochrome sensor which
just made that camera extremely sharp it
was actually a little bit better than
the me 20 Pro in our camera testing so
that shows how efficient these things
could be no Nokia saying that these
monochrome sensors can capture three
times as much light detail as a regular
sensor and it uses that information to
stack it on top and just create a really
really super sampled image now because
you've got five different cameras on the
back of this phone you're getting a
little bit different perspectives a way
that a lot of portrait modes on smart
phones work is it uses both the cameras
to kind of create a separation between
the subject and the background basically
you're focusing on two separate areas so
you're able to say hey this is
subject this is the background here's
what needs to be blurred out and the
Nokia nine is doing a pretty similar
thing here but it's got five cameras to
actually take that depth data and while
most smartphone cameras have like three
or four different focus areas that they
can detect for depth
the Nokia 9 apparently has 1200
different depth areas so you're really
getting a smooth gradient between your
subject and the how-to focus area now
that's been a huge problem for
smartphones in the past it's pretty
obvious when someone's using portrait
mode just because there's not that
smooth linear gradient between the
subject and the background so this
should smooth out a lot of those issues
now interestingly these Snapdragon 8045
can only actually handle three cameras
on the back of the phone so they're
working specifically with light to pass
it through it's Lux capacitor which
basically handles all the cameras on the
back of this phone it's the same one
that they used in the light L 16 the
other cool thing is that you can
actually take photos through the stock
nokia camera app in RAW so you can let
it them in Lightroom and really have a
lot more dynamic range and other
information to work with just like if
you were using a regular SLR camera just
a quick note that our MWC coverage is
brought to you by digit daily your daily
dose of tech straight to your inbox
check out the description below to learn
more
no no he is actually making these in
limited capacity they didn't say exactly
how many they're making but they said
that it was specifically tailored for
people who love taking photos with their
phone and just want to get as much
detail and information out of their
phone as they can and probably most
surprisingly Nokia's suggesting a retail
price of only 599 euros which honestly
isn't that bad of course you're getting
the snapdragon 845 from last year but
qualcomm says that no one's actually
taken advantage of the snapdragon 845
like they have in this phone so I think
it's a really interesting device if
you're just a photography nerd or really
want to get advantage of those cameras
and even if you're not a smartphone
photography nerd you're still getting
other 2018 flagship features like a in
display fingerprint reader or Alysha
charging ip67 water resistance and a
pretty big battery it's three thousand
three hundred and twenty million powers
this phones also in the android one
program which means it uses a very clean
stock issue of android that is very
basic there's not a lot whole extra
going on here but if you like something
pretty minimal this could be for you
our guys well that's about it on the
Nokia
we only had about an hour with the
device at our briefing we're definitely
going to get this in for review when we
can I'm actually really excited to use
it but until then you can see all the
specs all the gritty info over Android
or 30.com make sure you head over to the
site and check that out and wait for our
view to come out in the coming weeks so
I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
