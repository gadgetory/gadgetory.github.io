Hindy the android authority app guy
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 175 so let's roll the
intro and get right into those headlines
Nintendo confirmed that Super Mario run
will be out on Android sometime in March
it should roughly coincide with the
nintendo switch released it will have
been a long time since the iOS released
so we're not quite sure how the hype is
going to be hilariously a nintendo plans
on releasing Fire Emblem heroes on
Android in February that means Super
Mario run won't be the first true
Nintendo game on android in 2017 keeper
security released a report this week
that talks about the most popular
passwords from 2016 it was not a great
year the most popular password was
123456 with various amalgamations of
that taking up most of the top 10 some
of the other passwords in the top 10
where password 11 11 11 11 3 123 that is
not great news those who use passwords
like that should seriously consider
changing it like right now google
announced a 20 finalists for the
european indie games contests among
those are San morose 3 pin outs crap I'm
broke out of pocket rusty like roots and
of course many others some of these are
very good games that we've talked about
before here on the show a few of the
games aren't out yet but we imagine that
they will be in due course we'll let you
know who wins when they announce the
winner but officially transformed into
vine camera this week the first
iteration of the app is actually pretty
bad it still records the six-second
videos as usual however since most
platforms don't loop the videos don't
have the charm they once had we think
there could be something here someday
however we wouldn't blame you if you
didn't want to dive into this new app
just yet the google play store and apple
app store had a really good 2016 a new
report shows that the respective app
stores had more downloads made more
money and people have been spending more
time in app stand in 2015 perhaps the
most interesting factoid is that ninety
percent of the money earned on Google
Play was done through mobile gaming that
kind of explains why there's so many
freemium games that simply where the
money is buu KU jira is a fun little
platformer it features soft colorful
graphics a gigantic whale and lots of
destruction the premise is that evil
alien robots are invading earth and
human technology isn't doing anything to
help and so you must play as a whale
that destroy
things the premise is epic but the game
is actually pretty simple it features
one touch controls a couple of different
play modes and some quirky themes it's a
freemium game but one of the less
aggressive freemium games out there
stringify is a new competitor to ifttt
it allows you to create automatic
actions for your phone to perform and
that means you can do things like
automatically posting your Fitbit goals
on Facebook it also has Internet of
Things support so you can have it
control things like Philips you light
bulbs smart locks smart garage doors and
other smart items it's a free download
but it's also in beta that means there
are some plugs so do be prepared for
those the little fox is a runner with
some unique ideas it boasts that it's
the first runner to use a hexagonal
field of play that gives you a few extra
directions to play around with it also
features stylish graphics a cute little
clocks obstacles to avoid and various
areas to run through the soundtrack is
also pretty decent if you're into that
kind of stuff it's free to download and
check out people seem to be complaining
about the advertising and there are a
few bucks here and there other than that
it runs pretty well tuned tastic 3d is
an animation application that lets you
draw cartoons it features a collection
of pre creative things so you can start
dropping things and in creating content
and includes the ability to narrate the
cartoon various story modes for you to
choose from and the ability to design
your own 3d characters once you're done
you can export the videos and share them
wherever you want like most newer apps
it has a few issues here and there
however it's also completely free to
download your friends is a third-person
shooter with a lot of online options it
comes with a campaign called warpath
mode which also has online co-op and
there is also 1 v1 PvP with a more
classic online multiplayer if you want
you'll also be able to collect various
items and use them in the game to give
yourself an advantage it's a freemium
game which means there are some pay2win
elements that said it's otherwise a
fairly solid title that can be enjoyable
