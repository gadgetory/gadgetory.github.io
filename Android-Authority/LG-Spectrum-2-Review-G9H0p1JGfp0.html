authority and today we're taking a look
at the LG spectrum to now recently LG
has been getting into the higher end
range of the smartphone market with its
optimus G and the google nexus 4 but for
a long time its bread-and-butter was
mid-range smartphones just like this one
and this is actually pretty solid when I
first heard that I was going to be
taking a look at the LG spectrum too I
wasn't all that excited but it's a
surprisingly solid device I'm actually
enjoyed my time with it quite a bit I'm
sure you guys might want to know why so
let's get started with the review the LG
spectrum tube runs a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 Krait
processor and has one gig of ram and 16
gigs of internal storage the 4.7 inch
720p HD screen has a resolution of 1280
by 720 pixels and like most other phones
on the market it's protected by Corning
Gorilla Glass the specs are rounded out
by eight and 1.3 megapixel rear and
front cameras respectively and a 2150
milliamp hour battery the build quality
is very solid while the spectrum to
isn't exactly heavy it doesn't feel
cheap or overly light like a lot of
devices in this price range will the few
hardware buttons have nice action to
them without feeling spongy or stiff
things become much more subjective when
it comes to the actual design the
spectrum to shares the same rectangular
shape is a lot of LG's recent devices
and while this may not be true for
everyone I like the design quite a bit
on top of the phone we have the small
rounded power button which seems to be
designed that way to somewhat match the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack on the
other side the left side features the
only other two hardware buttons the
volume up and down buttons and further
down we have the microUSB slot on the
back we have the 8 megapixel rear camera
and flash and the LG branding further
down we have the speaker and 4G LTE logo
if you take off the cover you'll find
the battery SIM card and microSD slot
finally on the front of the device we
have the verizon branding and 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera just under
the LG logo we have four capacitive
buttons from left to right they are back
home recent apps and the Settings button
while it's fairly easy to pull up the
recent apps list anyway I found myself
using this button more often than I
thought I would the display on the LG
spectrum to is easily one of the most
impressive features of the phone while
it isn't a fancy new 1080p screen images
are sharp colors are vivid and while the
4.7 inch screen may make the phone a bit
large for some people 720p video looks
great on a screen this size as I
mentioned at the top of the review I
wasn't really expecting too much out of
the LG spectrum to when it comes to raw
performance but the phone actually
performs surprisingly well a lot of
people myself included see a dual-core
processor and only one gig of ram and
think well yeah those specs would be
great two years ago button use the LG
spectrum to is quick and responsive
scrolling through home screens is smooth
apps launched quickly and the included
games play very well without any
framerate hitches or hiccups the LG
spectrum 2 runs android 4.0 ice cream
sandwich we'd rather see jellybean of
course but with so many phones still
launching with ice cream sandwich we're
not really too surprised about this one
the interface is skinned over with an LG
launcher but luckily it doesn't seem to
negatively impact performance and it
does have one bonus and that it's themed
abul this turns out to be very handy
because the standard themes background
and color choices make it kind of hard
to see switching to any of the other
included themes improves usability
big-time the usual suite of Google Apps
is included of course as are a slew of
other apps that you may or may not find
useful it seems like LG might have a
deal going with Amazon because the
Amazon Kindle amazonmp3 apps as well as
the Amazon
audible are all included demo versions
of a few games some verizon apps and
LG's video is round out the included
software the camera is a standard
smartphone camera quality is fairly good
and for most people it's enough to be
able to replace a point and shoot but
pictures taken aren't going to blow you
away there are a few interesting
features namely in addition from LG that
allows you to say cheese to take a photo
this is handy for getting yourself in a
group shot or for self portrait photos
especially since the spectrum to doesn't
have a hardware camera button the LG
spectrum to is capable of capturing
1080p video and it's better in this
regard than a lot of its mid-range
competitors because the video captured
is actually usable the frame rate is
decent colors aren't washed out and the
image is sharp enough to actually make
use of its 1080p resolution battery life
is fairly good on the LG spectrum too
despite the smallish battery after a day
of moderate use on Wi-Fi 4G LTE and 3G
networks and leaving the phone off the
charger overnight I found that I still
had thirty eight percent battery left at
the end of the second day the LG
spectrum two supports wireless charging
and my review unit came with a wireless
charging pad this is very cool or at
least it would be if it actually worked
I don't know if this was a problem with
the unit i received but during my
testing I never managed to get wireless
charging working reliably despite
placing the phone on the pad every way I
can think of sometimes it would charge
for a while so it was clearly working
but after various amounts of time a
message would appear saying that the
phone had been removed from the wireless
charging pad I haven't seen this
mentioned anywhere else so I'm going to
give the spectrum to the benefit of the
doubt and assume that the charging pad I
received was simply faulty in the end
the LG spectrum to is a solid mid-range
phone with decent performance and a
great screen there are a few issues but
it's not enough to stop me from giving
it a recommendation now thats it for our
review now it's your turn if you tried
the LG spectrum to if so let
us and everybody else know what you
think in the comments below I'm Chris
look for android authority and as always
we'd love to hear what you think of this
video and other videos on our channel
