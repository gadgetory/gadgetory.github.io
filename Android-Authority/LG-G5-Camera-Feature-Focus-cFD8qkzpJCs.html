the v10 after it of course one of the
main features of the LG g5 that we want
to take a look at is the camera so the
structure of a car from Android thority
what's going on everybody
and this is a closer look at the LG g5 s
camera so we're spending time with the
LG g5 here in Barcelona Spain and we
have this wonderful backdrop that we've
already been taking a lot of pictures
with using the g5 and we have the new
set up on the back with these two lenses
on the back that provide not only the
regular lens construction but also a
wide-angle lens of 135 degrees worth of
field of view of course having this new
camera setup means that the design of
the g5 is pretty radically different
from ones that we've seen in the past
especially with the g4 in the v10 but
with these two cameras what we have is a
wide-angle version that is of eight
megapixels and then a 16 megapixel
regular camera is going to accompany it
and being able to go from wide-angle to
a regular and more narrow view is going
to happen automatically as you zoom in
and out of the photo which we'll show
you in a little bit as far as the
front-facing camera goes it is a 8
megapixel shooter of course one of the
best parts about the cameras in previous
LG iterations is I had a great manual
mode we're going to take a look at that
in a little bit one of the main
shortcuts to get into it is pressing the
volume down button a couple of times and
you get right into the camera interface
now a lot of this will look pretty
familiar I'll head over to the simple
mode first and you'll see that it is a
basic point-and-shoot sort of interface
so what we have here is the wide-angle
view as you can see denoted by the icons
on the top and if we just press on any
area it will focus there using the
included laser autofocus and just take
the picture as I'm pressing the screen
but of course you can pinch to zoom in
order to zoom in and you'll see the icon
change up here as i zoom in it changes
to the regular lens the 16 megapixel
lens that is not of that very wide
field-of-view
but of course it's going to have the
same property of just taking the picture
after focusing as I tap the screen now
moving on to the auto mode this is where
you'll get a lot of different modes
available in the mode area right here
everything from auto to a nice pop out
that'll put some style on the photo we
can add a lens blur to the outer rim we
can also do the black and white for the
outside which looks pretty nice as well
I'm going to take that photo right there
and that is one of the modes that is
available multi-view as you can see the
picture right now is basically you could
see me in the camera right now you can
take a picture one by one by one to
create a very nice effect on there
other modes include a snap and panorama
mode a slo-mo which is basically for
video of course and then a time-lapse
feature that allows you to take a really
nice photo every however many seconds as
you can see in the setting right there
in order to record a nice-looking
time-lapse video using photos but that
gets all of the modes out of the way so
let's take a look at some of the
settings we do have the ability to
change the aspect ratio of course and
also to show what kind of HD photo and
video you're going to be taking
including 4k video they also have HDR
that can be turned on and off or set to
the auto so you don't have to do all
that guesswork from here you can have
some film looks as well to stylize the
shot including black and white and then
a few extra modes and settings like
image stabilization that you can use on
top of the OIS that is already
constructed into the cameras
speaking of OIS we took some video while
walking through the streets of Barcelona
and you can see it right now and the OAS
seems to be doing a pretty good job of
making even my steady hands look even
better but now we can jump into the
manual mode and this is where all the
granular control can be found you have
everything from the different sliders
that are available even the white
balance is done in the Kelvin readings
and you can see that I'm actually making
the photo that much warmer or I can make
it that much cooler and then of course
we'll hit Auto to go back to the regular
setting you can also see what you're
shooting with here at the top we have
the white balance reading at 4900 Kelvin
we even have the shutter speed at 1 over
180 and the apertures at F 1.8 if I was
to zoom out to create the wide angle you
can see just how much more of the photo
you can create so by zooming in and out
like that they move seamlessly between
the two with that just kind of 1/2
second pause in between to switch
between the two modules
even more sliders down here including
the shutter speed if you want to get
some nice slow maybe perhaps during
night shots you want to have a much
slower shutter speed or even faster if
you want to capture motion we'll go
ahead and just head that back over to
one over 125 and then ISO readings if
you need to get a little bit more punch
in your photos especially during
low-light situations so that is the
manual mode and we actually took a lot
of photos with the LG g5 while out here
in Barcelona and you can see for
yourself and judge for yourself what the
quality is like now we do have to
mention that the cameras on all LG g5
that you might be seeing here at MWC are
not final software so you have to sort
of take that into account and that is
why we're not necessarily comparing the
pictures from the g5 to any other phones
at the moment you can actually take this
as a preview of what you can expect and
if it's anything like the g4 or the v10
that came after it we think that the
pictures are going to come out pretty
great but you can always judge for
yourself by looking at these photos so
that should pretty much do it for this
quick look this feature focus on the
cameras of the LG g5 hopefully you're
enjoying all of the photos that you're
seeing right now and you can judge for
yourself what do you think the quality
might be like but there might be even
better once the extra phone comes out
because this is not final software that
said however we have a lot of fun
already with this camera especially
considering the wide-angle lens that is
included and that dual camera setup
looks like it should be really fun to
use the front-facing camera does seem to
have a fairly narrow field of view so
you might have to take that into account
when you're taking your selfies but at
least when you want to get even better
field of view for things like scenery or
any landscapes you can definitely use
that for the rear facing camera overall
however we're excited to really put this
camera through its paces and to compare
it to plenty of other phones including
the original LG g4 the v10 and even the
Samsung phones that are coming out a
little bit later this year so keep it
tuned to Android 34 even more about to
the LG g5 as we're spending some quality
time with the phone right now here in
Barcelona Spain of course we're here for
MWC 2016 so make sure you stay tuned
here for that and the rest of our
coverage because we are your source for
