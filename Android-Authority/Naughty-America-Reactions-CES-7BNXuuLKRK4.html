virtual reality pornography it oh that's
a lie it was amazing it was amazing calm
extremely open yeah in a room full of
strangers but in the comfort of your own
home yeah basically the best thing ever
don't tell my mum I said that I think it
was very intense it's very uh it feels
too real
almost yeah because like the girl gets
really close to you you get intimidated
so I don't know you you know usually
like back off but there's no what's
going on like which it's very immersive
whenever reached over and like touched
you while you were like yeah right in
the middle of the waist touching above
the waist yeah yeah never yeah alright
it doesn't there's no escape because I
mean not only is it fill your field of
vision you you can't really get away
like you back off but it doesn't move it
yeah yeah so yeah I kinda had the
benefit of my audio wasn't working
whenever I did it and so I'm not sure
but I wasn't as well it probably you
know if I was at home now but um just be
it was less awkward for me cuz I can
hear you guys talking I could still talk
to you guys I mean it was still awkward
I was gonna say here so awkward saying
that wouldn't world if there was like
this disconnect you know I gotta feel
real yeah and I will say that there's
still some bugs that need to be worked
out like whenever she like goes in to
kiss you in that one scene and like her
face like goes well like hums that's
yeah some of the scaling was a bit off
yeah some things just like it wasn't a
huge yeah I think a giant exactly yeah
yeah and her height in the beginning was
like yeah she'd be short then she'd be
higher than should be short again it was
kind of weird but yeah I mean I feel
like that's got to be the future right
like that's oh that's what that is
that's what's gonna get beyond every
home in
that games yeah yeah games worst yeah
you tell your wife you're buying it for
games oh yeah I'm gonna go gaming with
the guys yeah just don't come in
yep adore it yeah it's amazing it's
incredibly immersive very uncomfortable
very confronting but it absolutely has
to be seen to be frightened you have to
check it out yeah right well good but
