what's going on everybody and every
photo and video that you're seeing in
this feature focus is taken on the
cameras of the Huawei p9 now after we've
done our full review of the Huawei p9
and we did some extra coverage of it as
well I wanted to take the cameras out
these like a powered cameras and take a
look at their quality in a number of
different situations but first we'll
take a few selfies with the front-facing
8 megapixel camera on which you can
still use the beauty mode which in my
opinion is still kind of odd to use at
times it does help with the skin tones
and softening the image but it can be a
little bit severe at times but for
general purposes selfies are great on
the p9
now we're going to go through exactly
how the huawei p9 scammers work the dual
camera set up but before them we'll take
a look at some of the extra features
what you're looking at our couple of
panoramas which already show the kind of
quality you can get from the p9 in very
good lighting conditions but also
they're stitched together quite well but
a feature that does return in the p9
which was popular in other wali phones
is the D focusing feature now this isn't
necessarily something that's new but it
is interesting to use on this phone you
can pick a portion of the viewfinder and
then pick an f-stop to emulate as open
as 0.9 v actually what that means is
that you get that particular bit of
focus on that point and then everything
else has this nice creamy effect around
it it's nice to have when you want to
have some pretty artistic photos but
since it is emulating the effect what it
does is it tries to find the subject and
then makes that clear compared to
everything else now compared to an
actual lens that has a real aperture
ring to it this is actually a very
artificial effect and it's kind of plain
to see in a lot of these photos so while
these photos could look quite nice it is
still a software effect so you have to
keep that in mind
HDR is decent on the p9 even though you
have to trigger it yourself in the menu
but it does bring up the shadows and
adds a little bit of color saturation to
the entire scene but as you look at this
HDR photo I can go ahead and start
talking about the Huawei p9 s dual
camera setup essentially you have two 12
megapixel cameras at F 2.2 aperture and
one of them is a monochrome sensor
essentially all it is doing is gauging
in a black and white photo as you can
see here because you can still take
black and white photos in a monochrome
mode it's just taking into account how
much light is hitting the sensor based
upon the different subjects and
different objects inside of the scene
and by using that information it will
then put the color onto the photo from
the other sensor the original RGB sensor
and be able to give even better contrast
and ultimately a little bit better
detail inside of these photos the
results are actually quite good the F
2.2 aperture may not necessarily be
ideal for low-light shots but we'll get
into that in a little bit and saturation
actually looks pretty good it's not too
dull or too severe but what really gets
us here is that there's a lot of
contrast in these now that's exactly
what Huawei was trying to do here and
you'll see in a lot of these photos
especially in broad daylight that there
are some pretty dark areas of a photo
and some very bright areas of a photo
and you can see that the kind of Mary
the two very well in these scenes the
dynamic range is actually really good
here and the two cameras working in
conjunction seems to do the job quite
well
videos unfortunately don't get the same
treatment while the colors still look
pretty nice there's no optical image
stabilization so you still need a steady
hand and then you also don't get any 4k
video recording so 1080p is pretty much
all you're going to be working with and
in lower light situations the F 2.2
aperture shows its disadvantage as
videos can be quite grainy and
necessarily aren't the best compared to
plenty of other competitors speaking of
low lights we can go ahead and gradually
go into low-light situations with the
Huawei p9 and you'll see that even in
indoor situations the saturation does
start to taper off just a little bit but
that's not too big of a deal considering
the scene we're working with now I do
have a lot of foodie pictures here and
you can still see that the contrast is
being captured quite well with the
highlight still being well separated
from the shadows which is obviously what
Huawei was trying to do here it makes
for a pretty dynamic photo especially
when you have a high range and from
there you can just get some pretty
nice-looking photos even in indoor
situations it's in lower light shots as
you can see here inside of a brewery
that while the contrast is still a
higher priority you start to see the
noise and with AF 2.2 aperture of course
these photos are not going to
necessarily be the most ideal situation
for the Huawei p9 cameras the other
thing that I had to make sure I had was
a steady hand because with these slower
shutter speeds that were needed in order
to properly expose the photo having any
little bit of shake could have made
these photos all a little bit blurry but
I'll get into finally the main low-light
situation that I've already alluded to
in a number of concert videos and that
is us the duo opening for pentatonix and
it's in these situations that you get a
massive amounts of contrast and it could
be hard for a camera to actually provide
a good-looking photo because it has to
deal with two very high contrast areas
the stage and of course the darkened
audience
now the other supposed benefit of having
a monochrome sensor is that it's data of
where it only sees how much light is
hitting the sensor and where in the
scene that light is coming from is that
it could provide a little bit more
detail in these photos and I actually
think that that is the case and this is
the prime example that I have of that
zooming in to some of these photos as
you've probably seen already with the
100
shows that pentatonics even though
they're far away are actually quite
nicely detailed
of course these aren't going to be
perfect photos by any means and there's
plenty of noise in the darkened areas
but as far as concert photos go once I
played around with the exposure
compensation just a little bit to make
sure pentatonix was not blown out they
actually private some pretty great
photos of this concert that I was able
to attend overall I think that this
little experiment that Huawei and Leica
are doing is kind of a proof of concept
taking the information that a monochrome
sensor can provide actually made these
photos look quite contrasting in a good
way and actually bumped up the details
in some particular photos not all of
them but in some of them you still have
to be a little bit careful because there
are some glaring holes in the overall
experience a lack of 4k video recording
which really showed as you saw in this
video and the lack of optical image
stabilization which also proved to be a
bit of a problem as well but if you're
looking for some pretty nice photos in
welding situations the Huawei p9 is
actually a pretty good performer and I
do hope that we see this set up in a
future device may be with better
aperture numbers and also a little bit
more thought put into the software and
so there you have it for this feature
focus on the Huawei p9 cameras it is not
necessarily the kind of camera that is
able to handle literally any situation
but in the places that it does succeed
it does so with flying colors and
contrast keep it into Android authority
for all of the coverage on the Huawei p9
and don't forget to head on over to our
sister sites as well so you can see even
more beyond the world of Android and
then remember to stay around because we
are your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
