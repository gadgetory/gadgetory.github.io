with Android authority and today we're
going to take a look at the redmi note 3
arriving just four months after its
predecessor the redmi note 3 offers a
refreshed design and updated
specifications but how well does it
perform with everyday use let's find out
with our 4 review of the xiaomi redmi
note 3
Xiaomi has undoubtedly taken a fresh
approach to design with the redmi note 3
constructed of an all-metal curved
unibody shell the design is of stark
relation to the redmi note 2's matte
plastic construction although we never
complained about the redmi note twos
design we really appreciate the new and
improved look and feel especially for
the price well the curved edges do make
the redmi note 3 easier to hold with a
single hand they can also make the phone
difficult to grip for those with smaller
hands for that reason we wouldn't
frowned upon the use of a case given the
rears somewhat soft and slippery finish
this finish is carefully transitioned
into convincingly colored plastic caps
on the top and bottom of the phone
presumably placed to help with antenna
reception the power and volume buttons
positioned on the top right side of the
phone offer exceptional tactile feedback
and responsiveness there's also an IR
blaster on the top of the phone which
can be used to control anything from a
TV to an air conditioner the included me
remote app is overall very nice and easy
to use but it does lack support for some
non-chinese products like Vizio TVs for
example do keep in mind that you can
download a third-party app to regain
support for virtually all other IR
compatible products however coming to
the front of the redmi note 3 you'll
notice three illuminated lv8 dimly
capacitive keys on the bottom the first
being assigned a bowl to either open the
recent apps tray or app menu on the top
right there's a multicolored
notification LED as well as a 5
megapixel front-facing camera the
front-facing camera is nothing to write
home about
but it does get the job done reasonably
well the 5.5 inch 1080p IPS display on
the redmi note 3 looks good overall but
it is lacking a bit in contrast and
saturation in comparison to phones like
the meizu m2 note it's not incredibly
noticeable on its own but there are
definitely phones with better displays
the displays sunlight readability
minimum brightness level and viewing
angles are notably good however the
adaptive brightness feature also worked
very well during our testing with an
octa-core MediaTek Helio x10 processor
the
l-3 performed surprisingly well for the
price mui 7 seems to run very smoothly
with this hardware and there's minimal
leg and even content-heavy apps like
Twitter
although the base model redmi note 3
does include 2 gigabytes of ram xiaomi
was very kind and sent us the prime
model which actually has 3 gigabytes of
ram as expected with 3 gigabytes
multitasking showed no signs of slowdown
while using the redmi note 3 gaming
performance was also good while playing
in performance mode thanks to the power
vrg 6200 the redmi note 3 is able to
play casual games like asphalt 8
airborne with little to no lag however
keeping the phone in the balanced power
mode can cause some games to perform
less than ideally but switching to
performance mode often times helps with
gaming performance packing support for
802 11 AC Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth 4.1
the redmi note 3 offers the connectivity
options you'd expect unfortunately we
did notice some Wi-Fi connectivity
issues on our unit where the Wi-Fi will
just simply stop working altogether
until toggling it off and then back on a
quick search in xiaomi's forms reveals
many other users experiencing the same
issue so we expect xiaomi to resolve
this with an OTA update within the next
few weeks
callers did report excellent call
quality with the redmi note 3 but me y7
does not play nicely with google voice
mainly when google voice caller ID is
turned on mui refuses to place calls
unfortunately we don't think that this
issue will be resolved anytime soon
considering that Google Voice is a US
only product although the redmi note 3
does support up to HSPA+ on both AT&amp;amp;T
and t-mobile
you'll be missing out on the faster 4G
LTE data speeds within the US which is a
bit of a bummer the rear speaker on the
redmi note 3 is about average for the
price reasonably loud but tinny and
distorted it's also easily blocked by a
flat surface which can be a bit
unfortunate
on a positive note the fingerprint
reader on the back of the redmi note 3
is both fast and accurate coming from
the Nexus 6p I was very happy to find
the fingerprint reader in a very similar
functional position well it isn't quite
as fast as the fingerprint reader on the
Nexus 6p the accuracy is just as good
we weren't expecting much for the price
but we can definitely say that we were
impressed we were also impressed with
the redmi note 3 s battery life although
some users may be disappointed to find
an internal battery this time around the
four thousand milliamp our capacities
should be more than enough for a full
day of use for many users with my normal
usage the redmi note 3 lasted from 6:30
a.m. to 12:45 p.m. the next day with a
little over 4 hours of screen on time
when I use the phone more heavily I was
still able to get it to last from 6:30
a.m. to about 2 a.m. the next day with
about five and a half hours of screen on
time relatively speaking that's very
impressive
if battery life is important to you this
phone will not disappoint with a 13
megapixel rear camera and phase
detection autofocus the camera on the
redmi note 3 offers decent image quality
there seems to be a lack of detail and
saturation in most images in addition to
a tendency to under expose outdoor
images HDR seems to help with the latter
issue but it does add a couple of
seconds to the shooting time indoor
images also contain noticeable amounts
of digital noise but otherwise look
alright
the camera app found in the UI provides
an easy to use auto experience while
also offering many filters in addition
to several camera modes manual mode
gives you control over white balance and
ISO and the other modes like panorama
mode and timer mode can certainly be
nice to have software is perhaps where
Xiaomi has most injected value into the
redmi note 3 running me UI 7 over
Android 5.0 point to lollipop the redmi
note 3 offers a heavily skinned android
interface however mui is arguably one of
the most polished skins to date thanks
the amount of customization and number
of features it offers although many
Android enthusiasts still prefer stock
Android Mui is definitely a worthy
alternative there's plenty of features
targeted at enthusiasts from launcher
transition effects to weekly developer
OTA updates add-in me UI sevens smooth
animations you're left with one of the
best software experiences for under $200
however me y7 does have a few drawbacks
the launcher does not include an app
drawer you can't dismiss notifications
from the lock screen and Google apps
don't always play nicely when installed
onto the Chinese ROM there's also at
least some difficulty getting Google
Apps installed in the first place if
you're importing the device from China
you can definitely get Google Apps by
searching for the Google installer app
in the me app store but do keep in mind
that it is an extra step and it can be a
hassle if they are installed correctly
it is important to note that this phone
should be launching in markets outside
of China very soon and those markets
will prompt the release of a global ROM
which will include Google Apps out of
the box once that happens you can flash
the global ROM to a Chinese variant
device in order to gain proper Google
Apps integration or you could just wait
for a global variant to launch in your
country regardless this is another
drawback to importing the device while
xiaomi hasn't had the best track record
for keeping their products updated to
the latest versions of android they do
offer frequent me UI updates that
supplement many of the features found in
newer versions of android we doubt that
this phone will ever see anything more
than 5.0 point to lollipop so just be
aware of that before making any
purchases the xiaomi redmi note 3 is now
available in china in a base model and a
prime model priced at 899 women be and
1099-r M&amp;amp;B
respectively those prices translate to
about $140 and about 172 dollars
although importing the device can be
slightly more expensive the base model
includes 2 gigabytes of RAM and 16
gigabytes of storage whereas the prime
model includes 3 gigabytes of RAM
and 32 gigabytes of storage sadly it's
not expandable we definitely recommend
the prime model if you can afford it
especially if you plan on keeping the
device for more than several months the
redmi note 3 is not perfect its display
and camera are still about average for
the price google apps don't always run
flawlessly on the chinese rom and it can
be difficult to ignore the phone's lack
of u.s. 4G LTE support however the phone
excels in the key areas where its
competitors do not with its premium
design fast and accurate fingerprint
reader and exceptional battery life the
xiaomi redmi note 3 is a commendable
option certainly worthy of your
consideration thank you for watching
