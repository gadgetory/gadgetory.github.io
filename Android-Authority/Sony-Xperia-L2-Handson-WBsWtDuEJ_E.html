Android authority and here at CES Sony
has just announced the Sony Xperia L 2
without any further ado let's take a
look so as you may know the Xperia L 2
is a low-end smartphone on the front we
have a 5.5 inch 720p display but what's
much more interesting is the ultra
wide-angle 8 megapixel front-facing
camera so if you have some friends you
can easily get them all in a single shot
the rear camera is a 13 megapixel F 2.0
shooter although we unfortunately did
not have enough time to play around with
it to make any sort of judgment the L 2
will be offered in pink gold and black
finishes as you can see we were able to
spend some time with a stealthy black
model it's a matte plastic finish but
hey it gets the job done it sort of
reminds me of the Nokia Lumia 920 from
many years ago especially with its
nicely curved back internally there's
not really anything exciting there's a
mediatek mt6752 bytes of RAM and 32
gigabytes of storage those low inspects
combined with a 3300 milliamp hour
battery should translate into some good
battery life though perhaps the biggest
change that Sony is bringing with the L
2 is a functioning fingerprint reader
for users in the United States in the
past those users were not included for
reasons that we don't understand and
Sony's new lineup the L 2 X a 2 and X a
2 ultra all come with working sensors
all things considered the L 2 is a
pretty bare-bones package but maybe a
great option if and only if it's priced
competitively Sony is only telling us
that it will be available later this
month without any confirmed pricing
given Sony's historical over pricing
though we don't expect it to be a good
value but definitely be sure to stay
updated on pricing and further
