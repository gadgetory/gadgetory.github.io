by Toyota starts lachman here with
android authority we're here at the last
day on CS we're in the sony booth i'm
here with the gentleman named rob bong
say it's obviously a sony and we're
gonna be taking a closer look at the
sony smartband can you please explain
now what we're looking at here yeah for
sure so what we have is a sony smartband
here inside the sony smartband is
actually the sony core once you connect
it you're going to use bluetooth NFC one
touch to connect the two devices
together okay once the device is
connected you're going to use lifelog
lifelog is this application here as you
can see from the application you have
three different views you have the
journey view you have chart as well as
the map from the journey view you could
see the character as you scroll back
into your journey you can see the
character actually animate and move
first application i'm going to show you
is the fitness side cool from the
fitness side you can see all the
calories you burn how many steps you've
actually taken and how long you ran for
if you actually look into the calories
you can see exactly the goals that you
set and how well you do by day by week
by month as well as by year so this is a
natural progression right now we are
testing to testing your fitness but
Sony's all about entertainment so we
also want to show your your
entertainment as well so you can see
from the top hear your music icon with
the bubble on there the bubble gets
bigger is more music you listen to so
it's all about tracking your
entertainment as well why are you
exercise exactly so you can also
bookmark special event in occasions so
if there's something you want to
remember or there's something that you
really want to keep it a mark on you can
set a bookmark just by double tapping on
to the smartband itself interesting once
you've set that bookmark we'll see what
I actually bookmark this is my best time
on this run it's not just about tracking
your information it's also about
learning from it so I know that this is
my best run but why did i do so well in
my run it possibly could be all this
music i was listening to these are the
songs that really motivate me so checks
the psalms that motivate you when you
exercise exactly any places more
consistently while you exercise well
actually we just learn from these songs
and then you would say you know what
let's create this playlist then this
time i go last
exactly what about the actual smart band
itself can we talk about that yeah so
the smart band itself will come with two
different straps a small strap as well
as a large strapped inside the strap is
what we call the Sony core we're really
the heart of the operation all right
it's got one button here and it's got an
LED indicator to tell you if you're in
active mode or if it you're in sleep
mode so what exactly can it do can you
control your music with it or what kind
of stuff you have this is exactly it you
can control your music with it all you
have to do is press this while it's an
active mode tap on the top once to play
tap again to stop okay double tap to
pass forward okay triple tap to rewind
what about coach rube will tap quadruple
tap we'll see what happens there it is
waterproof okay ip58 all right all right
does use a micro USB charge and what
kind of battery life we're talking about
seven days of top seven days in any idea
on release date or pricing release date
we're looking at about spring spring
pricing is to be determined be
determined will be very competitive with
the market that's good that you added
that Rob is there anything else that you
already know about this particular the
biggest thing is that the
customizability so right now you get the
black bands but if you wanted to
accessorize and have personal style you
can get a multiple different color bands
with it as well as wicked man well it
seems like a pretty interesting thing we
can't wait to take a closer look perfect
thank you very much for your time sir
thank you okay starts lack of a with
Android already reporting live from the
very last closing home into the sony
booth here at CES 2014 thank you very
much guys and once again thank you to
