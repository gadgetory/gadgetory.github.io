original android hangout show on google+
I'm Derek Ross I'm Scott Anderson and
this week we're joined with Dan Charlton
again dan thanks for joining us on the
show we love having you always nice to
be here so Scott what's on the agenda
this week we had a lot of device news
adding on to our rumors that we had last
week we have a lot more nexus of rumors
also apple released the ipad mini we're
going to do a little comparison of the
devices that are out now what kind of
budget devices you can look into and
what are the benefits of each device and
how does it really stack up if it is
this an invite innovative release or not
there were me going into some routing
and ramen and some patent wars good news
for people who don't like the spring
back and some OEM news and profit some
earnings calls information alright so
let's start with app updates a dead
trigger I released a Halloween edition
basically you get a graveyard area
pumpkin-headed zombies and a crossbow
and then swiftkey flow basically it's
like swype but with more predictive text
there's a video on YouTube that kind of
demonstrates it it's pretty interesting
what do you guys think of it biggest in
that video yeah you know I'm not a fan
of swype its novelty wears off on me and
after the first day but I think it's
niceness swiftkey is one of the number
one if not one of the number one you
know alternative keyboards out there to
see them enter the swiping gesturing you
know text you know it's going encroach
on swype itself so i have more
competition i think it's great i think
yeah you know after i watch their little
demonstration video that was pretty neat
am I gonna try it more probably but I
won't stick with it yeah I mean we'll
swype and SwiftKey also had very
different sort of approaches to the
market right like individuals can't just
yet
swype by and large they're trying to
sell to OEMs to bunt letting the htcs
and bundle it into other manufacturers
devices where's swipe lyst you know just
there for anybody yeah now that we're on
the topic of keyboards and rumored nexus
keyboard with swype like features what
you guys think about that would you guys
be excited about that I wouldn't be
surprised to see Google integrate some
kind of gesture raced into their
keyboard yeah I mean that was that was a
rumored in the on which we'll talk about
later in the show but it was rumored the
that that was going to be coming out at
least the text that was on a car from
warehouse said gesture typing so it
enough people like it enough people use
it sure I mean you know I think it's a
viable option it's just not something
for everybody now so Derek since you're
a huge fan of turntable and I just don't
have the time for it ow what happened
with that up up up there well turntable
earlier in the week late last week came
out an update for their app that allowed
you to view Halloween habit are so you
know on on turntable depending on how
many points you have or how many points
you don't have you can select your your
various uh mice and or gorilla suits and
you know and now based on your point
allotment you can select Halloween
avatars so that's all the the app update
added the ability to see the new avatars
not a major update just a festiva update
for the season that we're in you know do
they still have the monkey suit yes you
can still be the gorilla you can still
be the gorilla um I I however changed
mine earlier i am not to knock the
gorilla anymore i'll even know what i am
he has like a red gas mask on Scotty
brown and I picked the same one earlier
where DJ and earlier today so had the
his good taste and then are continuing
on with app updates fxcamera had a big
app update on
it also had a price drop danby know more
about that I know they added a bunch of
actual features of the articles that i
saw talking about it made sure to
comment that I mean they added some
filters too but they like to point out
that filters or filters not features as
much as Instagram might like you to
think otherwise um but they added a lot
of different uh sort of controls to it
and higher level controls I mean I'm not
really a big photography guy but a lot
of different sorts of not zooms but
balancing and like control and gamma
control and some kind of weirds I
role-based focus thing that I don't
understand but it seemed really
interesting especially if you're into
photography at all I DeRay you won't
talk about uh so uh jelly bean updates
we don't really have a lot this week
it's pretty much the galaxy s3 so the
international version is rolling out
still in our chances are you have it if
you're across the pond somewhere if
you're here in the good old US of a
sprint started pushing out the jelly
bean update for their variant of the
galaxy s3 now unfortunately a whole lot
of other galaxy s there are um jelly
bean update news hopefully it's it start
sketching on faster more more devices
that you know start getting in here in
the very near future but uh speaking of
devices the Galaxy Note 2 launch event
was this past week and right now you can
snag it arms are you can you can snag it
for tmobile and for sprint right now
it's for sale however AT&amp;amp;T and verizon
are a little bit different in US
cellular is a little bit different as
well as up north and canada so on
verizon you can pre-order it starting
today it'll ship on the venom burg 27th
and unlike other variants out there you
have a custom verizon branded home
button just in case you didn't know what
carrier you were on verizon is going to
tell you buy the home button as i say
eighteen t you can pre-order today
as well you'll get a little bit sooner
november seventh it's dropping on AT&amp;amp;T
US cellular October 26th for pre-order
and in Canada most carriers are going to
allow you to pre-order it on October
thirtieth such as or I'm sorry it's
arriving October thirtieth like Telus
bell rogers and so forth now if you've
been watching the show in the past
you've probably heard us talk about a
rumored HTC devised a five inch device
you know we've called the HTC di X's was
rumored to be called the droid
incredible X then last week you know as
well maybe it's maybe that I isn't an L
I'm sorry me and maybe the eye is an L
you know maybe it's the the DLX and not
the dicks so the DLX was called a deluxe
there was a tall that's its final name
but now we have some leaked information
from verizon showing an HTC droid DNA so
we don't know what that is chances are
that will be the verizon name of the
deluxe at least that's what rumors and
speculation are pointing at now so if
you're waiting for the 5-inch phone from
HTC on verizon chances are it'll be
called DNA at least that's like I said
that's what we think now I wonder how
they're gonna play off the DNA I wonder
if it's going to be some type of
remember the original atrix the finger
uh thumbprint unlock maybe they're not
play often I don't understand whether
going with DNA I mean so at first I
think God deed now obviously droid right
HTC d so what's what's the na stand for
I business you still need to be there
yeah I might just be DNA as a whole yeah
yeah so yeah well yeah I unos um I guess
we'll find out in the very near future
so the celexa boats are changed on those
rumors and it's up to 2 gigabytes now or
is originally they've been talking about
the incredible X being delayed 1.5 gigs
whereas they've set it up to two to
match the butterfly J and pretty much
the butterfly J spec says that's the
phone that was
you know released in japan those either
don't know basically that's that's the
phone we're talking about we just don't
know what it's gonna be called whenever
it comes up two different states here
yet did you see those videos on YouTube
about it no I had not have you Scott
yeah there it looks like a really really
nice device only the 1080p to screen I
mean that's yeah over 400 pixels per
inch that just blows the retina of all
the things out of the water I just wish
it was a nexus you know what and I said
it all along if the the HTC nexus 5
rumor panned out that was gonna be my
phone like that this is what I wanted to
buy but now that it's not make sure i
could probably really don't know that
it's not i just think that it's not 11
next week it's it yeah it's no it's not
yet yeah yeah where i will you we don't
know but uh I I don't know I still want
that phone I guess what is X is fun so
speaking of Nexus murmur speaking Nexus
rumors you know since you know there's a
major event happening in just a few days
here in the 29th we better start ramping
up these rumors you know every single
day having something new and we have a
lot of Nexus information I just fear
that we're all gonna be burned out
before the 29th uh no no no no no don't
you remember less actually yours that
gives us something to talk about every
single day scar true not like the
election yeah all right so nexus 7 32
gig well that's pretty much a done deal
considering the fact you can order it
from office depot right now um they may
have done it Jump Street firms yeah they
may have jumped the gun but it's listed
for 250 bucks which is the same price as
the 16 gig variant so uh yeah so if you
happen to buy one from from office depot
make sure that you're not getting the
same one is in stock is the 16 gig make
sure you're getting the 32 gig version
of that staples retail system also
showed leaked screenshots of the 32 gig
nexus 7 4 250 bucks and you know to
continue to add to that
rumor speculation that really is pretty
much anything but confirmed from the
source right now the the Play Store 8
gigabyte variant just says coming soon
so is that going to be dropped
completely is that going to be the $99
tablet you know we don't know is the 16
gig version going to go to two hundred
dollars and then 250 for the 32 we don't
know yeah I mean there's all sorts of
speculation what do you guys think on
that I mean I will see that I probably
think that the eight gigabyte will go
away it might come back as 3g only but I
don't think you'll get the eight gig
Wi-Fi anymore and then they'll make the
16 gig 200 yeah I really think that we
will not see the egg gigabyte anymore I
think it it it will just be phased out
because they need to compete and all for
a base that is compatible with other
bases and comparable with a size hard
drives are a hundred bucks an eight gig
device that that's competing in nineteen
oh my that's what I don't think that
they'll drop the egg egg nexus 7 to one
hundred dollars that's not gonna happen
yeah yeah you know I I do agree with you
there i think if the hundred-dollar
rumor does turn out to be true that
might be a it would be different
hardware a three and that might be the
3g version which let's talk about that
so just recently you know the nexus 7 3g
rumors started running rampant again
because why it passed through the FCC so
what a device runs through the FCC here
in the US that means it's coming uh
necessarily but it did did give me to
this case yes but not okay stuff so the
device basically it's the same model
number as the Wi-Fi version except as a
G on the end of it and then in design
schematics also point out various radios
the radios that are on there supporting
ATT and tmobile hspa+ bands so it's a
gsm does that mean we're going to see an
LTE version will not yet so question
about the 3g arm i personally don't
think it's a smart move just released 3g
if it gets released but what would be
their thoughts behind just releasing an
old technology I mean what would they
ever do it they're thought behind it
would be that's what's functionally
possible with the hardware in the device
mmm and you know hspa+ 3g is just as
fast as verizon's LTE is in most areas
now ah not 18 case for tmobile says
t-mobile's you you're right oyaji
mobiles okay I don't know many people
have tmobile but when I compared to AT&amp;amp;T
LTE on verizon just blows them out of
the water t-mobile is doing it right now
there-there's is much faster so but but
either way I mean I think they may be
went with the lower technology you know
a 3g maybe for price maybe I don't know
but what about dumb carriers you know
kiedy carrier subsidized or it would
have to be bound to a carrier you know
if they went to if they they had LTE
possibly no I don't think so because I
think that if Google is going to sell it
they're going to do it in the same kind
of way that Apple does where it's a we
sell the tablet you the consumer can add
on a you know lte-capable one and then
the plan is all on you mm-hmm and I
don't think it would be interesting
though if it did have 3g or LTE being
carrier subsidized and being free you
know or maybe ninety nine dollars yea
nor I think that they could subsidize it
a little bit more um but a free device
free free tablet for you know just
adding on some data storage you know
that's only like Wilfer verizon it's ten
dollars per device on you guys yeah yeah
that's pretty nice actually now Paul
Brian from Monaco which generally seems
to know what he's talking about since he
added this device way back in September
beginning a sep tember I believe he he
said that the 32 gig version is the only
version that is going to have 3g so
we're not going to see a 16 gig 3g
and maybe not an eight if they're
completely doing with the eight they
said that the that the 3g version is 32
gig so we'll see what happens with that
here i guess in a few days but that's
interesting that so it's the more
expensive model so maybe we will see it
subsidized someone who knows maybe yeah
so let's move on to other devices other
Nexus rumors so the Nexus 10 continue to
leak a few different places this week we
saw the famed the rite of passage the
picasa leak and if you don't remember i
know that is a pretty much you have to
leak on picasa to be a Nexus device in
my opinion every every Nexus device in
the Nexus 4 on picasa yeah Nexus 4 is on
there the Galaxy Nexus Nexus 7 Nexus S I
mean they they all leaked picasa images
you go to you log in the picasa you look
at the exif data and you get down
through and it says device name device
type and it says no nexus 10 so it's
showing up there it's also worth noting
that it's very easy to take that data it
is very easy to fake that data you are
one hundred percent we're all getting
excited about the rumors 229 exactly so
so uh besides data that can't be faked
images that could be faked but then they
look pretty darn real I'll showed up on
a Korean blog site today they were the
paperback manuals for the nexus 10 and
it gave us a little bit more information
about the Nexus tendon we didn't
officially have we found out about the
micro USB port they might grow HDMI port
which is interesting and an LED it kind
of actually looks like a lot like a
Galaxy Nexus and with the rounded
corners and then the LED on it just like
obviously 10 inches um has a rear camera
and a front camera which we knew a
little bit from the leaked information
before but one thing that is interesting
at least to me is it has a proprietary
charging port like other Samsung devices
do
I you know that's usually not how a
Nexus rules it usually is micro USB but
maybe it has to have proprietary
charging port for power reasons maybe
USB just can't push the juice for that
for the larger battery and then maybe it
needs a larger battery for that
jaw-dropping 2650 by 1600 Apple retina
destroying display I actually find that
hugely disappointing for a couple of
reasons because if they can't do it over
my car USB that means that they aren't
able to use USB 3.0 they aren't able to
use USB 3.0 means it's not connecting us
5 mm I guess we'll find out because it's
supposed to have an exodus 5n so I guess
we'll find out in the very near future
all I can say is I may or may not have
talked to somebody that played with it
recently and they said it was phenomenal
in terms of quality out so don't care
why a picture on it was better than
other 30 inch LCD TV oh yeah so okay I
would have both micro USB and a
proprietary or charging port what are
you gonna do with micro USB port if you
already have this proprietary cord how
do you need the transfer data to what to
something values this private military
court is gonna do that meant the
proprietary cords maybe it's just for
charging so you have two cords that's
even worse no I'm not saying it's good
i'm just reading information that's on
the that's on the the leaked manual mean
who knows i I'm I'm fairly certain that
that's what's gonna happen I mean may it
makes it doesn't make sense but it makes
sense off the images you have your
charging cable no you're you're because
you know apple doesn't right you have
your charging cable and then you have
your unlike Apple then you have a USB
cable to transfer data so those are all
in one so well they can
because we know patents okay so all this
hardware talk what do you guys think
that they're gonna price it at that's
that's actually very interesting i I'm
gonna bet it's going to be a higher-end
price it's not going to be able to base
the base model for the ipad is 499 for
the ipad yeah for the ipad is yeah 50
500 and the iPad Mini is 329 and do you
think they're going to offer a premium
tablet for comparable to like in the
middle of that or do you think that
they're going to go straight ahead and
try to attack the ipad with full-blown
high quality everything and like 450 I
think that they will undercut the the
retina iPad I think they'll I think
they'll match the ipad to the four
hundred dollar price 400 okay I I think
that that would be a good price point
350 if they can do 350 and I'm just be
no no I i know i don't know if it's
possible but the thing is if they can
sell it add cause for 350 and be just
above the ipad mini and that would
really really really get like they'd put
a very big dent in apple's fourth
quarter I don't know what happens I hope
it I hope it does I do too but the thing
is you know when people look at those
two devices oh I have a you know tenant
screen and though I have you know a
smaller one at 7.9 um and it has an
extremely high resolution it's
ridiculous and I think it'd be very easy
decision yeah definitely especially with
that have a resolution that's way above
what the even the the new new super new
ipad 4th generation is alright so let's
so we'll talk about the ipad here a
little bit we go over the neck the
almost said nexus many god someone
punched me in the face we're going to
talk about the ipad mini a little bit
less taco let's tell ow sorry google
let's uh yeah don't hate me Oh
that's odd the nexus for a big
imagination let's say that's actually
geek a little bit talk a little bit
about hardware with a nexus 4 because we
know we know a lot or at least we assume
we know a lot about it so who said you
know Nexus 4 is like every other Nexus
device we just mentioned is leaking all
over the place it's going to be
announced in a few days you know car
from warehouse actually today had it up
for pre-order and then apparently
somebody said oops um the image that
you're using isn't even the real image
it's a fake image you shouldn't have it
up here so they removed it what's that
Dan the fake image was of a custom rom
yay it wasn't just like a fake Nexus
image it was a custom rom like the way
damage that had that had that was three
battery percentages on it or look a
center that of the battery was 92
degrees and the temperature outside was
92 degrees something it was something
was glad I was not like obviously fake
oh yeah yeah I saw that thing as I yep
that's not real why would they put
third-party apps and the official yeah
yeah but anyway so so it was taken down
before was taken down we got to read it
thoroughly and see a lot of interesting
things on it so it said that it was
coming with jelly bean Android 4.2 it
didn't say 4.2 is called key lime pie
and I'll just fine quite 1.2 somewhere
in there yeah well now and then a little
bit later actually in the in the header
or in the big bold it said android 4.2
and then when you dug down in the
overview like the technical specs the
fine print it's an android 4.1 point2 so
obviously they still know what exactly
it's coming with there's a little bit of
discrepancy there um but one thing I can
tell you about the device man what we
might not know what version of Android
specifically it comes with and that's
fine a numbers a number i really don't
care but it is pretty awesome um it it's
better build quality than the Galaxy
Nexus meaning that it feels a lot more
solid it doesn't creak or you know
there's no play to it it's just a lot
better built device and it looks exactly
like the Galaxy Nexus a pro
except for there's no curve glass-like
and then we turn it over obviously the
backs different but it's extremely solid
and man it flies because of the hardware
I mean the hardware is amazing it it
you're going to want this device and
sadly we haven't seen it popped through
the FCC yet for an LTE version so I'm a
little conflicted with that but let's uh
let's get into some hardware here so so
Dan you're my hardware guru so I see the
Galaxy Nexus its GPU was 384 megahertz
it was a power view our chip versus the
Adreno 320 which runs at 400 megahertz
how big of a difference is that in terms
of like graphics those of us the one
else took to gain you know is that
massive massive now dan I know and I
know that the the 384 that can be
overclocked and what are the oh and I
know that you can overclock it to like
500 something um yeah no I I know some
kernels like franco.kernel can do that
but what is the overclocking ability of
the Adreno is there more I have
absolutely no way of knowing that yet
okay okay these are all obviously specs
that are based off of the optimus G and
then specs that have been leaked from
various websites that have leaked the
device and had a little bit of hardware
specifications how I get a bunch of
hardware specs we must get various
websites my sources are the manufacturer
and the code that they're putting into
the check well good good that's why
you're a hard work idea all right so so
let's move also make 100 megahertz
that's because that's what the code says
it is all right so let's move a little
bit talk about the CPU i can say we're
gonna geek a little bit talk about
hardware so the Galaxy Nexus right it's
a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor
cortex a9 the LG Nexus 4 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core krait so it's almost a two
more course but besides being a no-go
core a9 CPU I mean that mean it's quite
a different chip obviously it's a beast
but but what but what's that what's the
big difference there Dan well even if
you were to ignore the two extra core
works then you'll be talking about the
the s4 right the 1s the 1x the s3 the
the samsung galaxy s3 all of those
devices versus the Galaxy Nexus that's
already a huge difference in performance
because the Quakers are that much better
than the cortex a9 cores in the Nexus
and it's not the ti built a bad chip
it's just old at this point and putting
four Krait cores and do it is it's just
not even a fair competition it will
crush the Galaxy Nexus and it's going to
be substantially this this processor is
substantially better than anything else
that is currently available I don't know
how it stacks up against the Exynos 5
because there isn't a realistic
comparable I mean there's the Chromebook
but I mean it's not running the same
operating system so that exactly i saw
some benchmarks on that trying to
compare it and I was like that's
impressive but there are two completely
different offerings yes very out of
contacts yeah and you can't get an
accurate price on her or not price a
comparison on that show up continue with
our geek out here so Ram yeah double the
RAM like to nexus one gig LG Nexus 4 to
give me well it's also a higher clock
speed ram and it not as fast as you're
honest so even if it were just one
gigabyte of ram it would still be better
RAM and there's double higher clock
speed memory and those of us that play
games know that we wanting a lower
latency memory faster memory i miss my
gaming daisy or just have a lot of
processes in the background or the more
you can have running in the background
is that it really helps out with project
i'm sure people are still gonna complain
about how oh my god i'm still using
sixty percent of my ram but that's how i
enjoyed west coast dear it's supposed to
do that you're gonna have two gigs of
ram and you're gonna complain they're
using 1.5 oh my god such a memory hog no
it's just cashing things that you racist
stuff that you would have to reload in
like hard processor time with our own
yogurt banks stop comparing it to your
desktop LS comes it up i say what's on
your linux but not similar to windows so
let's talk about the screen real quick
trying to born
but here's the Galaxy Nexus it uses
super amoled screen with a 16.9 aspect
ratio and 316 pixels per inch a little
bit better on the LG Nexus 4 it's a
actually so very very slightly saw
screen bump it's coming from a 4.65 24.7
very very very slight bump the screen
but the big thing about the screen it's
an IPS LCD screen so it's a 318 pick the
a and not pentile 318 pixels per inch so
that's basically the same slightly
different aspect ratio those 16 x 10
yeah um so so so so the difference
between Super AMOLED and IPS LCD it's
it's light years ahead in quality you
know brightness and saturation the
colors on it should be so much better
it's just a lot better technology and
for the screen and the battery you know
since it doesn't have a removable
replaceable battery the LG Nexus 4
people are saying oh you know we want to
be able to buy a bigger battery for and
like code for the Galaxy Nexus well
remember remember the Galaxy Nexus the
stock battery was seventeen hundred
million bowers the LTE had in 1850 and
it was replaceable so you get the big
guy at the 2150 if you wanted to which a
lot of people did the LG nexus 4 it
comes to 2100 milliamp hour battery
that's also LG's new battery technology
that's supposed to be something like
sixty percent more yes exactly LG said
that they can get sixty percent more out
of the same capacity than their
competitors that's a bug is crazy price
and how about the screen with power
consumption how does the pentile
compared to the IPS that's going to be
in there I mean IPS is a very low power
but nothing beats and will let in terms
of power consumption I mean that's why
Samsung like sitting this very low power
R that's because when it's displaying
black it's not using power right like
most displays when it's displaying black
it is displaying black it whereas on an
AMOLED screen black is just the absence
of display
so I mean it uses less power
particularly if you use a lot of dark
themed applications backgrounds etc yeah
so moving on the camera and a lot of
people have gripes about the 5 megapixel
camera but it had 5 megapixel autofocus
single LED flash and 1080p video
recording LG Nexus 4 nice bump to 8
megapixel autofocus single LED flash and
1080p video recording again I think
that's becoming the standard and don't
know why the Galaxy Nexus was released
with five remember remember it doesn't
really so much matter about the
megapixels I mean it's nice to have more
but it were really more concerned about
the actual hardware the camera the
actual lens and sensor no I agree but
the one in the galaxy nexus isn't
amazing feel they're using the same
8-megapixel focus or a sensor that
they're using in the AT&amp;amp;T LG whatever
it's called Optimus G I think it's
actually the same one that HTC uses in
the 1-series nobody that would be decent
image so in such a pickle with a very
high quality sensor ok I said when we've
seen these pictures taken of the latte
show up on picasa and it wasn't bad you
know we also actually a the Belarusians
site took a bunch of pictures with it
and posted and now they were obviously
using a beta device and all you know so
you know quality you know comes to get
better once you know binaries are
updated drivers or you know perfected
and everything like that so it looks uh
let's you know let's stop talking about
nexus rumors for a minute let's talk
about the big guy or the little guy that
was released this week that was
revolutionary everyone's client it um
yeah so so Scott tell me about the ipad
minute you want one right you're by like
six right I so the ipad mini Wi-Fi only
version we're going to compare three
different versions we're going to
compare the ipad mini nexus 7 kindle
fire HD all our Wi-Fi only we're going
to go by base price based models and
we're going to see who kind of wins here
and where you should put your money and
where we are going to put our money so
the ipad mini seven point nine inches
it's a 1024 x 768
aid that's a 163 DPI at the base model
costs three hundred and twenty nine
dollars and that has 16 gigabytes of
storage it's a claim to get 10 hours of
battery life it does not have NFC
because apparently they don't think NFC
is catching on it all Wi-Fi model
doesn't go is it yeah um Wi-Fi model
does not have GPS which is that's
amazing which is completely I mean
that's very well the thing is I don't
think they need GPS because their Maps
don't require me I guess that makes
sense I mean if you can't figure out
where you are on GPS then why have it
yeah well so let's say you're the year
at a coffee shop right because iPad
users are you know the drinking coffee
right so you're in there you're getting
that you're getting the coffee made and
you're like huh on the check in on
foursquare what do you do well oh you
can do Wi-Fi yeah but you can't position
you within roughly a thousand meters no
I mean well with Google and Android and
how it remembers all that stuff like
like location history it's gotten pretty
dang good like I can literally get on
the bus and it'll show my location as I
go down the street just with Wi-Fi on
it's actually kind of scary but it's
getting more accurate and it's pretty
cool so and that saves me battery life
because I want to turn on the GPS but
they don't have life I bouncing on and
off and pulling all of those uses a
crapload more battery than your GPS well
you know why they know where all those
Wi-Fi hotspots are Scott yeah I know
because they drove around and yeah okay
so um so basically uh Dirk you want to
explain the meat to you do ice yeah so
it I don't like iOS devices ah but I can
appreciate good technology because I'm a
tech geek at heart so I can appreciate
if something's good and generally the
ipad and the iphone have usually set the
bar pretty high for comp for you know
for other people to compete against for
people to try to beat and when you
compare a device
android device everybody always says
well that's compared to the ipad it's
compared to the iphone that they do that
because it's a benchmark that we know
that those are damn good devices but
with I mean the ipad mini just is not
that type of device you know it is it's
almost like they said seven inches
taken off we need something smaller
let's let's come up with something let's
get it out quick and they got it out
quick and it's using last year's see
baby was just no it's not even using
last year's if they just repackaged an
ipad 2 into a smaller screen with a new
connector and cut seventy dollars off
the price better go through so they're
using it all what will the ipad 2
processor in there using the ipad unit
freeze resolution on I mean you what's
amazing is is my whole life even though
I haven't used apple products it's I've
always known that Apple products have
amazing screens that mean they did I
mean that's why designers use de meo for
code for video for inning of editing
graph getting that they're amazing
they're just clothes are top-notch so a
company that's known for their display
quality puts out this piece of in
my opinion I mean seriously a 1024 x 768
display Hey look at this uh the goal of
this was to compare three so let's move
is doing the comparison Scott 1280 by
800 so it's less pixels in general plus
it's over a larger screen which
apparently is a feature cuz when you
want a small tablet your big selling
point is it being big yeah I can't
believe that they actually put up a
bullet point saying our screen is bigger
than the nexus 7 well that's cuz you
designed it bigger it's not a selling
point no no if you want a bigger screen
you're gonna get a bigger tablet if
you're gonna get it anyways just like
okay so moving on let's go over the
specs of the other two tablets so NASA 7
Wi-Fi also so the nexus 7 scott compared
compared force the ipad mini nexus 7
Wi-Fi only 7 inch tablet 1280 x 800
resolution
and that's a 216 DPI uh that's roughly
50 DPI higher than the ipad mini mmm
what is that thirty percent more pixels
per inch there you go yeah also costs
199 dollars for the eight gig of I
version or a hundred and thirty dollars
less than five hundred and thirty
dollars for something it has better
better hardware and we have you seen
anything extra for lesser hardware and
the thing is we have yet to hear about
the october 29th which it's rumored to
drop lower so that price difference may
be bigger and you may be able to buy
more for less so it'll be very as 32 gig
for 16 yeah for still eighty dollars
less yeah and I think that's what
they're going to do because
realistically the Nexus 7 has to if
everybody is releasing a base model of
16 gigabytes they kinda have to get on
the bandwagon with 16 gigabytes but
they're apo by entry was the initial
let's get in let's really undercut
everybody yeah as far as people being
upset about the like oh I bought it
early also aren't doing all the freebies
anymore like if you buy a new nexus 7
today it doesn't come with $25 of play
credit and it doesn't come with ten
dollars of google wallet and it doesn't
come with a free movie and free songs
and all the other crap that they threw
him before so yeah does it come with the
those free play store content I wasn't
aware that I knew that I think it comes
with anything I know the google wallet
in the $25 credit was gone but I'm
surprised that it doesn't come with the
content yeah I think it was just an
initial let's get them a lot of stuff so
then we can sell a lot of them and then
we can figure out what we want to do
with the price so then we don't have to
give away the thing to make up for the
price differentiator we just have to
lower the actual device cost so moving
on a 10 hour battery life about the same
kindle fire HD Wi-Fi only again now this
is more of a content consumption based
tablet so it's it pretty much a
different type of tablet compared to the
ipad mini and the next
7 but it's seven inches as well the
resolution is the same as the nexus 7 at
1280 x 800 216 DPI again better or
higher resolution than the ipad mini
also it does come in at one hundred
ninety nine dollars for the 16 gigabyte
version which is an interesting price
point and is way less than the ipad mini
and you do get double the storage of
compared to a nexus 7 and it also does
have 11 hours of battery life which is
good when you're going to be using a
tablet for content consumption strictly
add because there's not much more you
can I mean it's pretty much bread to be
a content consumption so the list is the
nook HD which actually has an even
higher resolution 7-inch screen
everybody always forgets about the look
for some reason I don't know why the
hardwood the hardware's better but
nobody ever until they have talked about
it yeah it's gonna 1440 x 900 screen
which I think it's 264 DPI and it's the
same 16 gigabytes had one hundred ninety
nine dollars but I don't know it's
battery life offhand I probably guess in
the eight to twelve are probably right
around the same mark okay so I have a
question for you guys and our viewers /
listeners if you had for two dollars and
you had a decision to buy these tablets
what would you buy and why yeah let's
let us know in the comments what are you
buying if you if you had foreigner bucks
to spare out of those four three or four
devices I mean don't get me wrong Apple
is a hell of a marketing company they're
gonna sell millions is called millions
of them it you know they're gonna sell
millions people are going to say how
these this jumpstart the economy and all
this other crazy stuff because they're
gonna sell a lot there are a hell of a
marketing company but I just can't
believe that that that they're touting
this is something amazing when it really
isn't it's a little sad I'm disappointed
I mean as i said i'm not an iOS device
user never have been but I've always
respected them they actually lost a
little bit Derek points on this one yeah
James Gray says that when you break it
down it seriously
seriously does not compete to the Nexus
7 I definitely do agree and if you gave
me four dollars and now I'd buy to Nexus
Evans I buy a nexus 7 of the nook yeah
yeah yeah I I'd give away another nexus
7 though what's uh as gives let's talk
about rooting and rom and there's a not
a whole lot of news this week here but
just two little titbits information so
uh ruin and ramen uh or rude and Robin's
ramen noodles noodles me Felicia yeah
aokp released jelly bean version 5 jb 5
they added some new devices they added
the AT&amp;amp;T galaxy s3 and the AT&amp;amp;T galaxy
note some new features or custom navbar
for tablets that's nice navbar widgets
they're basically back from ICS a big
bump in this update was bringing their
ICS features to jelly bean also the
addition of highly customized
customizable lockscreen rings jb version
4 didn't have this which was kind of a
bummer and I was kind of waiting for
these features to come out but they
released him in this build and they're
implemented very nicely also you have a
alternative default app picker kind of
looks like the jelly bean version if
menu you I overfly to overflow toggles
which is nice also you have the option
to disable vibration for notification
expansion that was released in four dot
one dot to also you do have a ram bar in
the recent panel so when you click the
recents on the bottom right on a Galaxy
Nexus you'll see a ram bar on the top
and i'll show you how much ram you're
using kind of nice kind of nice to know
what's going on with your device also
you do have time out instant lock
options for your slide to unlock and you
have a whole bunch of new icon types or
designs to look at and you have VPN
traffic the amount of traffic in a
readable format so darica what about
cm well you know this is more like a
honorable mention it's not a whole lot
of major news but a lot of people freak
out about it so we know we got to talk
about it real quick so earlier this week
a bug was found in the cm10 code what
was happening was a piece of code was
running and logging all of the screen
unlock patterns that users were using
and creating um the code was most likely
left in there from you know debugging
and testing purposes you know to get it
to actually you know work and so forth
testing something um how big of a deal
is it well somebody would actually have
to you know gain access to your phone to
be able to do anything with it so not a
big deal but you know rest assured if
you were scared which you shouldn't have
been cm once they found out about they
had it patched within a few hours so the
nightlies i think starting on the
twenty-fourth of um had it patched i
believe i might be off on a day on that
but either way if you're running a
recent nightly you should be fine and
you know so why was it in there well if
i said that it was in there probably for
debugging and testing purposes remember
cm10 is still in development they're
just nightlies they're not stable build
yet so these things will happen I mean
it's a development-stage wrong so of
course you're going to have development
code in there not a big deal there see
em team is doing a great job and keep up
the good work guys nothing to see here
you know move along yeah if that's my
opinion on at least dan you think
differently no no I mean good it's a log
on your device yeah so I'm just gonna
have to get past your screen unlock in
order to get to the log that tells them
how to get a screen on exactly you mean
it I mean it's nice to have some added
security it's like saying oh god no my
keys are sitting out for anybody to take
them inside of my locks house so this is
my favorite part of the of the segment
mrs. bird and talks about patent wars
did they get down and dirty with the
patents Oh
and downs this week especially yeah I'm
so gonna um so first the patent and
Trade Office the US patent and Trade
Office has rejected apples bells
backpack the rubber banding patents for
when you scroll too far in the list
bounce back or in browsers bounce back
and they actually rejected it on
multiple grounds this is still a
preliminary decision so it's subject to
for the review and the appeal and the
appeal an appeal but yeah it's it's not
likely that it's going to come back at
this point um so that's definitely good
news for samsung since that was what
patents that they lost on in the case in
California um but in bad news for
samsung the ITC has issued a preliminary
ruling siding with apple and finding
that Samsung infringes on five apple
patents three for utilities and 24
designs and I don't know offhand
specifically what all five of those are
but yeah design patents have
traditionally been very weak and their
utility patents haven't been
particularly strong either so not
surprised but then again the ITC
generally operates under the assumption
that the patents are valid which is the
same thing that the court system is
forced to do and then after the courts
have already done their thing the USPTO
comes back and says oh no wait we're
just kidding so this is certainly to
keep going on then in the Netherlands a
accord in The Hague found Samsung not
infringing on yet another one of apples
touchscreen patents which wasn't
particularly surprising since one of the
same patents that Apple's lost on all
over Europe to samsung and motorola and
HTC so they should have seen that one
coming and then in more bad news for
samsu the Department of Justice
according to Apple is apparently
investigating samsung for and violations
for fair reasonable and
non-discriminatory practice violations
on their standards essentials patents
basically what Samsung has been doing is
saying we have these standards
essentials patents if you want to
license them your test
point four percent of cost of device for
the pad that shakes out to about six
dollars a device apple meanwhile in
documents that have been released has
been going around telling everybody that
they Apple are owed thirty to forty
dollars per device in royalties for
patents that Apple clearly believes you
cannot build a touchscreen device
without infringing on them which is
pretty much the definition of a
standards-essential patent so Samsung
asking for six dollars advice is being a
horribly violation violating of fair and
reasonable and non-discriminatory
practice but Apple turning around and
asking for thirty to forty dollars
totally fine Wow yeah we'll see how that
goes I don't think the DOJ is actually
gonna get involved because they don't
have a lot of ability to institute what
constitutes fair reasonable and
non-discriminatory also one of the other
salient details that a gram of the DOJ
has forgotten is that even for very
reasonable and non-discriminatory
patents the owner is on under absolutely
no obligation for the initial offer to
be fair reasonable and
non-discriminatory they have to
negotiate in a way that is fair
reasonable and non-discriminatory and
come to an agreement on price that meets
those standards but their initial offer
of you owe as a million dollars of
device is free game and Apple just
refuses a carp Lodge every time whatever
the offer is no we don't need to do that
because we're Apple so I don't think
it's gonna end up going their way
because they just keep losing patents
the tape put it up to sue over so let's
move on to some huge news that was
actually just released recently Samsung
just released its financial results for
quarter 3 2012 and it's a pretty big one
basically the sales of smartphones and
display panels drove up revenues to 51
or 52 point 118 trillion won which is
about 40 7.5 billion dollars basically
that's a twenty-six percent increase
over the same time frame
last year and operating profits they
increased their basically 7.4 billion
and that's basically an all-time high
for samsung and that amounts to a
whopping ninety one-percent increased
from last year Wow so that 1 billion
dollars they have to pay apple not a big
deal yeah we'll be yeah it's go
ridiculous I mean they'll fight tooth
and nail and probably spend close to a
billion dollars to avoid having to pay
that billion dollars to Apple yeah but
no if they had to pay it not really good
yeah if their revenues up twenty-six
percent to make fifty billion ya mean ya
there okay there okay to lose that funny
billion yeah so smart phones and display
panels that was a combined 40 7.5
billion just their mobile communications
wing of Samsung generated 23.9 billion
in revenue just their mobile more than
half of all of Samson's right and
Samsung builds a lot of not smart phone
products yummy things that aren't mobile
they build tons of electronics they're
the biggest electronics company in the
world for more than half of their
profits coming from mobile that's
impressive a revenue excuse me not
profit pretty ridiculous and I don't
think that uh the court case hurt them
at all if it still you know completely
goes through know that all indications
are that it's been great sales pitch for
some devices yeah I mean they're just
really it's crazy um I did want to touch
on a comment that was made by yusuf
islam he was talking about the nexus 4
and there was a leaked article or a
pre-order page that had the Nexus 4
listed as a base model of 8 gigabytes
internal storage and it's an interesting
topic because you look at past Android
devices and we call them lesser Android
devices when they had partitioned heart
of internal storage that people were
just running out of space to store apps
and
a big nuisance and it kind of still is
if people have older Android devices but
what do you think about the nexus for
offering a base model of 8 gigabytes if
it happens all right so if the a gig
version is true we don't know yet we
won't know officially for a few days um
that is I'll be honest that's the
stupidest thing I've ever heard in my
entire life when if somebody wants to
play a game especially with new android
games like high quality android games to
take advantage of this amazing hardware
right these high quality games are one
and a half gig you get a couple of those
somebody likes to play games you're
screwed you can't do anything to put a
space for apps now what about pictures
you know having a gig on a tablet it's
cool because you don't take pictures on
tablet well at least you couldn't the
nexus 7 it was only meant for hangouts
and you know video chat but so you on
our phone on about you but I take tons
of pictures on my phone I take tons of
video on my phone I have a lot of
pictures online my phone I don't want to
have to worry about having to go in and
delete because i only have eight
gig of storage that's that's stupid you
know I store all my music on in google
music so I don't need local storage for
that but I do need storage for pictures
in for it in four games I mean 80 gigs
not gonna cut it I I am that's cool if
an eight gig version is out there to be
to be sold really cheap for somebody
that can't you know can't needs to save
50 bucks but they need to have a lovely
a 16-gauge I'm happy with 16 give me
personally if you were to ask me about
that uh the eight gigabytes is a step in
the wrong direction a hundred percent
wrong direction yeah it it allows people
that may not know a whole bunch about
phones still be pissed off about the
fact that they can't hold them any apps
not necessarily because it's cheaper but
the fact that people just don't know why
it's better to get 16 gigabytes as
opposed to eight right now my google
plus cash is at 1.2 gigs buh-bye so if I
had in a gigabyte device right now I
would have
serious problems and I'd have to delete
that cash and I have to keep reloading
it and everything like that so 8
gigabytes step in the wrong direction if
it's true but we don't know right now
i'll open it's not and you know who
knows maybe I'll never have a chance to
be pissed off at this device cuz I
haven't seen a verizon radio go through
the FCC yet and I'm not switching care
I'm not switching carriers because I
can't there's nothing else in this area
that I can use please give me a verizon
version I'm begging you i will buy it
the minute it drops yeah i mean i get
that people want the extra storage space
it's not something that i particularly
need especially on the phone but I mean
I get that a lot of people want it and
when you're competing against apple and
your choices there are 16 32 and 64
coming out with eight it just doesn't
cut it I mean just 44 sharemarket
reasons it's not smart yea high
performance top-of-the-line device oh
alright well there's no more questions
we're gonna call it a night alright well
