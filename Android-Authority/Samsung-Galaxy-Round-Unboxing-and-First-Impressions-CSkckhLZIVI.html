next big thing it's trying to pioneer
what could be the next big trend hey
it's Josh regard from an authority
what's going on everybody and it's time
to unbox and give my first impressions
on the Samsung Galaxy round and here it
is the Samsung Galaxy round as you can
see the box is actually fairly large
this is still a large phone
despite its new feature of having a
curved display and that curve goes from
left to right so without further ado
let's go ahead and jump right into the
actual device you can already kind of
see that there's a concave on there that
if I was to go like this it does rock
back and forth woohoo that feels
actually not as weird as I expected it
to feel I expect it to have a very very
odd feeling when I when I picked up this
phone because I mean the curve it's not
necessarily something we're very used to
yet in the space here is a micro USB 3.0
charging cable an adapter or rather an
AC plug that has the 2.0 micro USB on
there and it's not detachable so this is
a dedicated one and then after that we
have here is a battery charger so you
already have a spare battery as you can
see right here that's an interesting
development and actually in the second
battery actually comes in a case that's
pretty cool so what we have here is a
secondary battery charger that you can
have in order to get extra power out of
here and then finally we have our
earbuds here Samsung devices do
typically come with earbuds and this one
in particular has controls in lime and
just a quick look there you go there is
your curve you'll see the curve there's
and it does make a phone of this
particular size this is a pretty big
phone fit pretty squarely in your hand
pretty comfortably oh and also the back
is that textured plastic that is a great
addition that Samsung it looks like
Samsung is going to keep that from the
note 3 which was a big success in terms
of the material choices to go right over
there
so I hope there is a charge in this
battery let's see it's still a light
phone it still feels pretty freakin
light in your hand and that's that's
really interesting nonetheless it does
actually look like a pretty nice phone
it does look pretty pretty actually
that's the word that I wanted to use
their galaxy round now after doing the
quick setup there I will admit that you
do get a little bit of a shake there I'm
not sure if you can hear the rattle when
I'm pressing on either side of the
screen but nonetheless the shake is very
minimal it it's noticeable but it's
minimal and it really doesn't hinder
from the typing experience not one bit
you know full disclosure I was actually
really expecting to take out the galaxy
round and think it was well pretty weird
feeling after all a curved display is
pretty somewhat new when it comes to the
smartphone market it's not something we
see every day definitely pretty rare
however the Samsung Galaxy round with
its rounded back that is made of that
texture of plastic that we all loved
from the note 3 actually made this phone
pretty damn comfortable I have to have
to admit it's really really nice and it
feels really good in the hand that con
that that that curve on the back
definitely makes it just sit really snug
in your hand in the curve of your palm
it just feels really really nice
actually
and on top of all of that not too sure
how it even was was was achieved but
it's really really light for a phone
that is about this size you know we're
seeing a lot of bigger phones out now
these days this is probably one of the
lightest ones I've ever handled I'm very
very surprised for such a large screen
like this having a bit of a curve does
allow you to feel like you can reach
more parts of the screen now that's a
nice thing and of course Samsung really
wants to drive home the idea of the
curve by adding in transitions between
the home screens and the app drawer
screens that sort of push back a little
bit so it actually looks like it's going
across that curve it's a nice aesthetic
choice but in reality the main thing
takeaway here is with the curve that you
have right
it does allow you to reach more parts of
the screen even if just a little bit and
incredibly subtlety now as is the case
with plenty of Samsung devices we do
find that the new features that are
introduced in particular phones do tend
to bring up the question of whether or
not they're practical in this case I
looked into the settings and there are a
few new things that you can do the quick
glance is the one we probably all know
about already when the phone is on a
table and you just tilt it forward a
little bit or to its side it will give
you a small screen that shows you a
quick glance at all of your
notifications now that is arguably
pretty useful and the other functions
include changing the track in the music
player by tilting left and right and a
couple of other functions after that I
do think that there could be more
possibilities opened up by taking
advantage of the curve but for now we're
just seeing just a certain particular
amount so maybe in the next iteration of
the galaxy round we'll see even more but
for now we're going to see what the
features inside of this particular phone
mean for the general user in our full
review coming soon
we're going to see how the rest of the
phone fares in our continuing coverage
of the galaxy round so stay tuned to
