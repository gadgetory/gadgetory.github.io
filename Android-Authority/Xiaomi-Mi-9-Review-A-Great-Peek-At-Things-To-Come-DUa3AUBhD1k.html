so the Xiaomi me line has had some stick
in the past for being a little bit
derivative it's not a trendsetter it
just tends to copy what all the big
players are doing we know that Xiaomi
can innovate they demonstrate that with
the pocket phone f1 with their mEEMIC
series but the me Series their flagship
are somewhat vanilla and it's true for
sure this is definitely not a device
that is in any way particularly standout
but my question is does that really
matter if you're getting a really great
smartphone with tons of cool features
and a great design doesn't really matter
if it did that stuff first I'd argue
probably not and in fact whilst you can
hardly call it innovation the me 9 is
among the first smartphones to spot
these Snapdragon 855 so in that way it
is leading the way this time and it does
have a couple of other tricks up its
sleeve which we'll get to in this review
so starting with the design the Xiaomi
me9 is a really beautiful piece of kit
that feels fantastic in the hand this is
a slim weighty metal frame covered
entirely in glass it has a gorgeous 6.3
inch AMOLED screen but in excellent
19.7% screen to body ratio it's only fhd
plus that's to 340 by 1080p rather than
a quad HD like some of the competition
but you'd never notice it to look at it
like the best Samsung phones it almost
looks like a sticker rather than the
screen and that dewdrop notch is really
small and unobtrusive the screen is also
covered in Gorilla Glass by and that's
good news for me because I keep smashing
my devices and getting into trouble it's
great for consuming media and although
it only has one speaker grille down the
bottom it does a perfectly adequate job
the back of the device is a kind of
tapered glass affair mine is a gunmetal
type color although Xiaomi calls it
black now they do also do some other
more interesting colors they have this
holographic spectrum which comes in blue
and purple and shimmers and catches the
light in really cool ways you also have
a transparent version much like that old
Nintendo Gameboy transparent edition
anyone but I must say I like my black
version actually it doesn't have that
holographic effects but it's kind of
smart and understated and premium it
looks like a little man in a suit in
short the Xiaomi 9 feels so great to use
and look so great that it actually makes
you want to pick it up and start using
it
haven't felt this way about a device
since the early days of the surface Pro
and I'm just going to come out and say
it I like this design more than the
Galaxy S 10 its slimmer it's cooler it's
not as fingerprint prone so yeah
fantastic job there chamois and this is
why someone would choose the Xiaomi me 9
over the inevitable Paco phone f2 but
that nice design doesn't come without
its compromises the Xiaomi me 9
unfortunately does not have a headphone
jack which I know it's going to upset
some people it also doesn't have an SD
card slot for expansion which is a bit
of a bummer
the version I've got only has ticks with
4 gigabytes of storage and it only goes
up to 128 megabytes so you might find
yourself filling that up fairly quickly
especially with those 48 megapixel
photos and 4k video that you might be
grabbing it does have a dual SIM slot
though and what's also a little lacking
is the battery which is only 3300
milliamp hours that might not sound like
a lot in a 20-19 flagship where a lot of
devices these days have 4,000 and above
however I didn't find it to be a massive
problem I was able to use it fairly
normally that means consuming media
watching videos playing games and I only
have to top-up
rights in the evening and even then not
always obviously not a fantastic battery
but it's also not a problem or it wasn't
for me
and I think that's probably down to the
efficiency of the snapdragon 855 so yeah
whilst it might be nicer to have a
bigger battery I wouldn't let that put
you off if you like miss device
otherwise and the other good news about
the power of course is that you get that
impressive 20 watt wireless charging and
Xiaomi is selling a bespoke wireless
charger that should help to get the most
out of this it does charge very quickly
and it's very convenient to use I will
say though that I try putting the Xiaomi
9 on another wireless charger I had the
only other one I had to test it with and
it wouldn't work for some reason I don't
know if that was just them not getting
on or if maybe the camera bump was in
the way and that prevented it from
sitting in that sweet spot something to
note it would be interesting if other
people have had the same experience and
another more interesting feature that
we're seeing a lot more of these days is
the embedded fingerprint sensor this
basically allows you to use your
fingerprint against the screen this
little image of the fingerprint appears
at the bottom to help guide you to the
right place
and that'll unlock your phone in much
the same way as a traditional
fingerprint sensor
meaning that you don't have to have a
big chin or spot on the back to try and
grope around to find and it does work
quickly it does work well is
quite as snappy as using a traditional
fingerprint sensor and especially
because you're unlikely to find the
sweet spot right away and your obably
gonna need to move it around a little
bit
luckily I actually find it quite fun
using this it has a great animation so
that kind of mitigates the fact it's a
bit slower whether you'll still feel
that way after years of using it who
knows and what's also nice about that
fingerprint sensor is that you can use
it to activate all kinds of shortcuts if
you hold on to it and then slide your
finger into position then you can pick
from a number of apps that you want to
launch without having to navigate to
them and what's also convenient and neat
is that there is a dedicated assistant
button at the top left that's the Google
assistant no annoying bixby here and you
can just long hold that to activate
Google assistant you can also map this
to various other actions for instance
I've got it so that if I double tap it
it launches the torch however you can't
use it to launch any app you like which
i think is a bit of a weird a missed
opportunity but there you go it's still
nice to have an extra button I'm all
about extra buttons and anyways I'm sure
you can get around that limitation with
tasker and a little bit of imagination
still it was just an Auto choice I'm
also on the subject of neat little
software tricks what can we say about me
UI this time around well this time
you're getting me UI 10.2 that's the
latest version on top of android 9 and
it works really well me UI has come
along leaps and bounds in my personal
opinion if they scaled back some of the
aesthetic decisions and outlooks a
little bit less Apple s skits nice and
smooth and crisp everything's kind of
minimal and there's actually quite a few
neat features in me UI you've got things
like gesture navigation which is enabled
by default which takes a bit of getting
used to but it's a cool way of
navigating your device media to have
those buttons down the bottom you have
more security when installing new apps
you have a dark mode which from me these
days is pretty much essential and as
always there's a thriving community
around me UI 9 with the users being able
to vote on the features they want to see
remember that Xiaomi began life as a
custom rom designer and if you get some
bloatware but what's really refreshing
is that Xiaomi actually lets you
uninstall those apps that you don't want
and the file manager is actually really
useful I don't know why the me video
icon is the exact same as the Play Store
icon though that's a bit confusing
but performance is where it is at when
you're talking about the Xiaomi me 9 and
the reason for that as I alluded to
earlier is because it's sporting these
Snapdragon 855 backed up by six
gigabytes of RAM how these Snapdragon
855 isn't anything unique to the Xiaomi
me 9 it's gonna find its way through a
ton of devices of course it's gonna be
in the galaxy s 10 range but this is one
of the first devices to sport it and
yeah it's really impressive so anyone
who watches my videos regularly knows
that my personal benchmark is to see how
it handles dolphin emulation GameCube
emulation I was really impressed with
the nubia red magic Mars recently
because it managed to squeeze some
pretty decent performance out of the
Snapdragon 805 by using cooling and
overclocking but this is a generational
upgrade on that and it really shows for
such a slim device it doesn't even get
hot when you push it it's incredible so
not only can you play GameCube games
silky smooth I'm talking Metroid Prime
Wind Waker f-zero you can also play
dolphin games I was playing Sonic Colors
on this again pretty crisp framerate I
didn't change any of the settings or
tweak anything for extra performance
even plays ppsspp that's the PSP
emulator so if your interaction and the
only downside is that lack of storage
obviously you might not be into
emulation but the fact that it can
handle that means it's gonna just blow
anything else out of the water as well
it can do anything in the Play Store top
settings no issue on antutu it beat 99%
of users Gary's been testing at the
speed test G and it's been blowing
everyone away there as well so yeah this
is a performant phone and right now this
is gonna outperform any gaming foam
that's available of course there will be
many more devices coming out over the
next year which will have the same
chipset and probably more performance so
you might choose to wait and see but for
now this is ample power and I can't
really see any reason why anybody's
gonna need any more and as you'd expect
this handles the UI extremely smoothly
no glitches no stutters and the last
piece of the puzzle is that camera which
should also be pretty impressive
clocking in with its combination of a
huge 48 megapixel F 1.75 primary lens 12
megapixel telephoto lens and 16
megapixel ultra wide-angle lens that
primary lens is the eye mx-5 86 and Sony
and
toe-to-toe with other 40 megapixel plus
offerings from the likes of Huawei and
honor it's not all about pixel count of
course but the Xiaomi uses tricks like 4
and 1 pixel bidding to ensure you get
the very most from its shooter and you
can easily switch between pixel counts
if you want to keep your file sizes down
and the good news is that this performs
exactly as you would hope it would
photos come out crisp sharp detailed
punchy there's a little bit of over
saturation sometimes with there's ways
you can mitigate that these are really
nice photographs I was actually really
impressed low light performance is
really good not really much to complain
about
actually one complaint is that Xiaomi
sticks that ugly watermark down in the
bottom left by default this is barely
even an inconvenience to remove in the
settings but it's just super annoying
bokeh effects work really well and do a
great job of isolating the subject
without cutting off ears Picasso style
and the wide-angle lens are something
it's very welcomed with a 117 degree F
of E it's not quite up there with the
123 degree lens on the new Galaxy S 10
there's still plenty wide and having a
zoom lens also comes in handy
occasionally for extreme close-ups and
snapping things in the distance without
losing quality and just having this
combination of features gives you plenty
of options from messing around or for
trying to get that perfect shot it's a
fun camera to use
speaking of which also has tons of extra
features and modes it has the beauty
mode that Xiaomi phones always come with
this one can remodel your face to give
you a slimmer nose yes please
this AI Scene Recognition which is
practically useless there's a short
video mode there's a slo-mo mode oh and
video is also really good you can record
up to 4k at 30fps or 60fps with you
bring down the resolution a little bit
and according to the exo markets
actually apparently be best right now
for video although it doesn't have
optical image stabilization the digital
stabilization is really good here in
general it's a great all-around camera
whether you're doing video when you're
doing photos the selfie camera has a 20
megapixel lens and that's something I
always really like to see is when
manufacturers put some effort into the
front-facing camera because for some
types of people whether you're a vlogger
for instance
family you might end up relying on
slightly more so to conclude I'm a
really big fan of the showing me 9 is it
the most exciting phone of the year
absolutely not the Samsung Galaxy S 10
has far more features it offers
ridiculous things like up to 12
gigabytes of RAM in some cases and so
that's gonna grab all the headlines
likewise people aren't gonna make much
fuss about that triple lens camera
because why always been doing that since
the Huawei P 20 it's not the first then
like I said but shammies done a
fantastic job of picking and choosing
features that are really useful and then
offering them for a much lower price the
sixth thing about ram hundred
twenty-eight gigabyte storage model will
set you back the equivalent of about 450
US dollars so unless you absolutely want
to have the latest and greatest thing
the foldable samsung phone unless there
are features here that you really need
maybe you want the headphone jack maybe
you want more resolution then this is a
hearty recommendation and if you really
want your device both turn heads then
just go with that transparent version
job done don't find this video useful
interesting guys let us know in the

the Xiaomi 9 head over to Andrew
