we've got the new pixel phones we've got
google home Google daydream and of
course the Google assistant but I think
potentially there's a lot more okay so
before we dive deep let's just talk
about those new pixel phones what do we
got and what do we not while the pixel
and the pixel XLR google phones through
and through they're actually
manufactured by HTC say which one about
the one a nine HTC's iphone clone but
the taiwanese company really does know
how to make some solid smartphones both
the pixel and pixel XL sport and
aluminum and glass construction you'll
notice the back panel is made of mostly
aluminium save for the small glass
section on the top of the device that
surrounds the camera sensor and the
fingerprint reader both the pixel and
pixel XL come in three different colors
very silver quite black and really blue
we're not making that up so you can see
the specs right here I won't go into too
much detail about that but you know it's
the Snapdragon 820 1 4 gigabytes of RAM
that's fantastic a decent battery life
improvement and a much much vaunted
camera but what does it actually mean
for you and me now I know what you're
thinking cuz I'm thinking it too good
phones decent even decent specs but
where's the fundamental earth-shattering
change that hiroshi la Kaymer was
talking about we were expecting
something big we were excited and at
first glance not too much nice but not
great not bad but I was hoping for more
well I'm happy to tell you that I think
there is something more and it has
everything to do with AI and even then
it's not so much a I exactly as much
what AI can potentially do for us I've
said many times before that you and I
enjoyed the world wide web through these
tiny little screens this is why everyone
is hunched over and locked into their
phone and blocking out the people in
their environment around them the
potential the hope the dream that AI can
contribute to is that it frees us from
being locked into that screen if
you can make voice commands that are
contextual and smooth you can look at
your screen less that's fantastic and
the real potential here this is the Big
Bang for me I think is that Google is
allowing third-party developers to build
on their Google assistant AI so they're
becoming a platform like Amazon as a
platform like Google Play Store is a
platform that other third-party
developers who specialize in AI who
specialize in using those voice commands
can create tools and apps that you and I
really care about think of the
possibilities they're pretty big try and
remember that eighty-five ninety percent
of the world is not tech savvy and even
if they did have the aptitude to be
technically inclined they don't want to
they want to get on with their life they
don't enjoy tech as a hobby like most of
you and I do so voice commands gets them
out of the device and allows them to
interact with the rest of the world
different wearables allow us to do that
this is partly why Apple made such a big
deal out of the wireless headsets they
look a bit wonky right now but I think
wearables are going to allow us to do
that when technology and IP devices can
be put into our clothes into all devices
around us we're connected everywhere to
everything and we're not tethered to the
rock and chain that is our phone right
now I think that is the new frontier
imagine if you can just tell your
refrigerator to make a list of things
that you need to buy on groceries and
then they're immediately bought for you
on Amazon or some other service like
Amazon and it's delivered to your house
hey I can begin to do that type of thing
what are the things that you think are
possible with AI technology I'm talking
smooth fast contextual interaction what
they bought that can do the things that
frankly you don't want to do let me know
in the comments below if you guys
remember from like 15 years ago when
people were making money hand over fist
in the.com bubble remember we didn't
call it a dotnet bubble or dot org
bubble we didn't call them dot biz
billionaires we called them dot com
billionaires because that's the power of
calm now why is that because no domain
name extension tells your story with the
same degree of trust as a.com or.net
domain name dot com and.net domain name
extensions inject credibility in to your
online presence save fifteen percent on
domain names and web hosting when you
use our coupon code Android at
