lag edition I'm dare cross I'm Scott
Anderson and this week we are joined for
round two of android authority on air
and in the second round we have
returning special guest dan Charlton dan
welcome back to the show get developing
and those those colonel Japan anything
out a while let's go to call me lazy
thanks all right so sad and the lazy
chrome developer thanks for coming out
we appreciate all your wonderful insight
so Scott what are we going to talk about
this week well first of all I'll point
out den cuz I don't move sure it is it
is an android authority sherry Oh what
would close that again read ret did it
say right on the website I'm pretty sure
its than something like I don't know
periwinkle nonsense of something is so
amazingly like that thumb print like
I've seen cars with less ridiculous
color names all right Android news so
that was kinda rude news but we'll we'll
get started here so this week we're
going to be going over some act Android
ecosystem update some news surrounding
that we're also gonna be going over some
app updates um basically it was google
app update all the things this week
which is kind of cool we got some device
updates and new releases and also
upcoming releases as well as some
rumored devices and rumored devices
plural next I huh um we're going over
some routing and Robin stuff and that
carrier news and we will end it with
some patent war stuff by damn alright so
let's talk a little bit about the
Android ecosystem Scott made a whole
bunch of neat stuff happened this week
yep basically they're resilient
documented said Google sent out a letter
to developers Android developers about
in an ongoing FBI investigation on just
give developers a heads up and the FBI
said that shouldn't have been sent and
developers don't need to worry which I
question that because there are some
apps that I know if I were the FBI I'd
be looking into I think the
investigation was not so much into the
apps it's more into it it's developers
who the FBI suspects their applications
have been sold on other sort of fringe
markets without that developers
knowledge okay so there's not like any
suspicion that any developers did
anything wrong this is the FBI looking
into some other criminals more or less
on the behalf of these developers which
is why they didn't really want to have
to send out this email and sort of
browse panic but panic has been stirred
yes yes um and then later earlier this
week we had google past microsoft is
becoming the second largest tech company
in the united states um pretty far
behind after the world it's actually the
world but isn't that you guys I'm pretty
sure that the two or three largest
technology for us are the two or three
largest innocent the same if you
compared to the world but they're still
considerably far behind an apple um but
that's because they charge less for
their advices and yeah so I was pretty
cool news um and then we have a glimpse
possibly kind of a rumor um but kind of
an ongoing rumor the Nexus certification
program and basically any manufacturer
can enter as long as they meet the
hardware requirements that are set by
Google and use something like a
customization center or a theme manager
um the rumors have been going out like
that what do you guys think about this I
think it's awesome you know for four
years we at least i know i've been
saying that skins are okay it's just for
the simple fact that carriers
manufacturers whatever yeah
manufacturers need to differentiate
themselves somehow so they try to do
with skins but not everybody likes them
is not everybody wants them it's not
everybody wants to be you know boxed
into using that so we needed some type
of solution and you
for all ever people been saying probably
be so cool but if a UI if the skin can
be downloaded from the Play Store yeah
if it was an add-on well it looks like
this rumor pans out to be true that
you're gonna actually able to do that
you're gonna be able to go to it you
know system settings go there or
something like that go to a notification
customization center and in the
customization center you'll be able to
you know choose a UI maybe I if you have
an HTC phone you'll be able to have
stock Android or choose sense if you
have a motorola phone you know you'll be
able to stock android or choose you know
blur not a whole lot of details are out
there of what is it a full-blown you
know you I and also apps as well or is
it just know a little bit of bells and
whistles it just it's a skin you know or
is it a full-blown you know overhaul
like we don't know yet but the fact that
that's even a rumor is interest is very
very cool in yeah yeah I mean I think
that the thing that hasn't been
specified is if any kind of open sourced
pneus is a contingency of the
certification right like if
manufacturers can continue to release
closed sourced Forks where they're
rewriting the framework and making
changes all over the place it it's
really going to tarnish the Nexus
program yeah so yeah so does that mean
that since why I guess there is open
sans the sense isn't the best example of
that but TouchWiz does that means you
have to be a touch with no a open source
version 80 then you know for no no
because I'm not saying that they need to
open source their themes or their their
skin that they're using right like right
now in cyanogenmod there's a theme
manager the theme manager is open
sourced the whole raw is open sourced
you Scott could go and make your own
theme and release it and have that be
totally closed source and potentially
sell it as an app on the market if you
wanted to write like the full rom is
still open sourced if they're releasing
Nexus devices that aren't open source
it's going to piss off pretty much
anybody who's ever bought an accent
yeah I I agree they're gonna have to
know step around that very lightly and
make sure they do it properly so they
can still keep the the Nexus you know
name on tarick so they can still carry
them song yeah i mean the biggest thing
that i think that her that i frown upon
is if there's a theme manager and it you
know somehow bogs down or runs in the
background with something going on
that's not stock I just want stock then
I get stock um also I look I look into
like the integration of each theme is
each theme gonna have really deep
integration that differs from a
different theme I mean that might be
interesting if if they do it well and
i'll use use me you i as an example
because the theme manager that they
packaged in is is really quite fantastic
um with a theme manager that's that's
sophisticated you can literally change
any image any font any color anywhere
throughout the device and I mean you can
just bundle that up as a theme and add
it after the fact well I think that's
something that we have to try to figure
out you know it is it just going to be
through this
do it can anybody you know put up and
store and download and we don't know the
details of it yes maybe obviously the
possibility here is is endless and then
if these are thrown into AOSP imagine
how easy it's going to be to have you
know a native fee manager in Iran its
mother the other big thing that'll come
out of this I mean and the thing is you
can keep it open source and keep the
core you know the core operating system
open source but still let the
manufacturers replace just straight-up
applications problem right now is that
they aren't replacing applications that
replacing the core framework and then
writing new applications that rely on
that different core framework if they're
staying within the stock android
framework and just replacing the dialer
or replacing the contacts app or any of
the other applications wait like you can
go to the market and get go contacts and
go launcher and go everything and
basically have it basically a go overlay
with just apps that you can get on any
device rooted or not and so if the OEM
manufacturers repackage their skins into
that kind of a setup there's no reason
why update from Google needs to go
through 47,000 layers of nonsense right
like you can just roll it out to
everybody yeah but then I guess the
argument from device manufacturers would
be how do we God why we have to do less
work but no how do we set ourselves
apart it is truly you can get the same
experience on every single type of
hardware and they're going to be
bringing those apps that you can only
get samsung s voice if you really love s
voice on a samsung device from the
things you like that yeah right like if
you want to root your device and do
customizations that's great you can get
Samsung's open sourced Fork of Android
that will build but it won't have a
dialer and it won't have contacts that
happen it won't have s voice it'll boot
and that'll probably be about it and
then you have to just like flashing
google apps right like they might
release that as an additional flashable
as sort of their proprietary with these
or they might not and say you're on your
own yeah
um so Android for dot to uh jelly bean
or key lime pie but yeah well part of
that rumor that part of the made of
rumors that came out this week you know
was saying that the next version of
android will be four point two key lime
pie um and some people you know
initially you know grab pitchforks and
torches saying oh look supposed to
version 5 well you know what version
numbers really honestly don't really
mean a whole lot oh my goodness they
mean so much to me you know in honeycomb
in honeycomb 3.08 high country 103.2
even declare was what to 2 point 0 and 2
11 so it's been done it's not a big deal
ah its chances are you know fingers
crossed confident I that my sources are
correct it's gonna be key lime pie and
it's gonna be four point two so yeah I
plumbing I think this good general
consensus from what I've seen is that
4.2 is just salad yeah the name is still
somewhat flexible and we'll get around
to that little bit later we talk about
some of the Nexus Nexus devices that are
letter rumored but for now and said what
what's the what's the name going to be a
chances are like I said if my sources
are true it'll be key lime pie and 4.2
but uh so Android has a whole bunch of a
market share and tablets more than I
thought huh Scott yeah more than I
wouldn't beg to believe I don't know if
I'm the source on that okay so go
Hornets earlier earlier this week we
posted an article that forty-eight
percent of the tablet market here in the
US is actually owned by by Android and I
live those as an end of q2 and yeah and
now that that's a lot higher than I
thought I mean twenty-two percent of
that makes up the kindle fire which
makes perfect sense cuz kindle fires you
know the best selling that
twenty-two percent of the whole market
not twenty two percent of the ambulance
yes yeah yeah that's roughly half of all
android tablets in the end of q2 were
kindle fires and mexico in which is why
google one off the success of the kindle
fire to release you know and make the
nexus s but it's also important to note
that these numbers do not include the
nexus 7 or the new kindle fires that is
there is one hundred percent correct
they're only off of uh leave the end of
key to so the other so there are three
month old numbers yeah and what do we
know we won't have to three into meq
three just ended so we won't have that
for another day another two or three
months the spectacular thing though is
how far Apple has fallen how quickly
well I mean it's really not i mean with
the onslaught of devices that are in
runtime surprising I'm just saying it's
impressive about a year ago last time
they were at eighty-nine percent of the
market and they've dropped 252 they lost
thirty percent of the market in a year
well the planets are vastly out selling
ipads over the last year vastly
outselling yeah i mean they were the
first people in there that majorly in
there majorly in there um that pushed
that type of device and was and were
successful with it okay so no I I
understand but like that they were an
extremely extremely successful with that
and now people are starting to you know
look for cheaper options that still have
the same features if not way more
features so more bang for your buck yeah
I think consumers are getting a little
bit smarter in that sense well I mean
that's it it's getting back to sort of
apples core problems may be other
reasons why Apple computers have never
sold that well is bang for your buck
they're expensive computers and you can
get a similarly capable non-apple
machine for half the price and then you
can argue that you get what you pay for
which in some cases is true as yeah I
mean there are definitely cheap makers
of brock's house now
okay and then uh Android for dot
whatever you want um basically android
for is on ICS and jelly bean together
yeah so Scott just say in case you in
case you weren't sure so Android 4.0
1203 no.4 as well as jellybean 4.1 point
one is all included those numbers to
twenty-five percent of all android right
now is using at least android is a year
old or newer yeah that's an eighth of a
billion people are using jelly bean or
ICS right now no it's not enough yeah I
mean Apple may like to brag about how
fast they can update and they do update
fast and this is a problem in Android
the fact that you know jelly bean has
been out for a month or not a month I'm
sorry since July they open sourced it
and ICS has been out for almost a year
now and only a quarter of the market has
the update that's ridiculous that's also
125 million devices that's true I mean I
just think that these statistics need to
get bigger and bigger it needs to be
they do huge problem I really can't wait
to the point where and maybe this won't
even happen but the day of release a
quarter of all devices will be able to
upgrade yeah that would be cool that'd
be nice I mean I think that's kind of
what they're pushing for potentially
with this nexus program Leah they're
going to be able to update more devices
faster that's the whole reason that
that's the endgame but we have that
Alliance Program which you know people
forgot about it and that's going to do
anything and nebula understand that but
I mean you can say something and not do
it I mean I just have hope it looks like
a more solid program well they're coming
out you have five amino minimum five you
know they more eventually different
companies selling nexus devices you're
going to have you know five times the
amount you assume of Nexus devices out
there you're going to draw are even more
than that
you're going to drastically increase the
footprint of Nexus devices you're going
to drastically increase the footprint of
devices that get updates faster some
devices you're going to be cdma some
aren't going to get them as fast as
their gsm you know counterparts but you
know what we're still going to get them
faster than non vanilla Angela and I
would argue that there any longer I
would argue that you're going to get
that updates longer than you would with
oh you've got a Atrix 4G ok you get one
update it's an incremental update but
it's not the next version of android you
know I mean actually there's a petition
around right now to take it beyond night
because ice cream sandwich was cancelled
for theatrics yeah but that's later on
all right so uh to finish up the Android
ecosystem here uh there's a new poll
going around customer satisfaction on
android 4.1 iOS 6 which that makes sense
because iOS 6 came out in the world
ended you know they didn't have a you
couldn't get to your destination he
couldn't use Wi-Fi Siri was yelling at
you from the lock screen it's i'm just
going to lake somewhere it's missing
cities like number two x two I mean but
but maps aside um not society r you
can't tell you your whether your battery
doesn't last your wife I can't connect
and you click your ice chips all the
time and it chews through data on
verizon and AT&amp;amp;T like that's its job
when you're holding it wrong if you take
a picture of the Sun listen below yeah
not just the Sun indoor lighting works
just as well up it works just as well so
does it don't worry what if you were
holding it you know inside right I
wonder if Google's going to release a
native app or if they're just gonna
chill with the UH browser version
because they just announced with their
health quality Anglia browser version
for a while but eventually they're gonna
build a nap I think there's not and for
it I wonder how much Apple will have to
pay them
you know that might be what they're
trying to do is for somebody the browser
version and force Apple back to the
negotiating table on that Apple you
won't like that Google way to sit on
worldwide mapping on the fly definitely
all right so we had a whole bunch of app
updates this week especially from google
Scott will talk about some app updates
yeah um we had a lot of app updates from
google on first log Google Wallet not
did some bug bug fixes as well as
gesture support which what do you think
that is going to be four years our roof
Escher's I didn't know I don't know I
could wave my NFC enabled phone that has
to be a millimeter away from a you know
an NFC tag in a gesture to buy so what
I'm gonna be like hold it up in the yeah
I don't know what you know like what
we'll see sorry you can only make
purchases here if you do the Macarena
with your phone first we had some other
updates we had google music just some
bug fixes on there um it's a pretty
solid app from my experience and people
more people just need to go on I think
it's just the the amount of songs that
they have is really just kind of
fingering it right now um then we had a
docs update backs um we need google docs
update and it was a pretty big update
via tablet support on you i support on
Cloud Print yeah car works and it works
great I tested it actually earlier even
now cloud from from google doc now you
have to hit open in browser is and then
hit the little down arrow and then hit
print so it's still in the app but it's
not in the app yep hit open browser but
still works it works great i printed to
my printer right here a little bit ago
so yeah it doesn't that's nice you don't
have to install a third party app to be
able to do it anymore yep you can filter
folder contents by file type you can
give the option
to auto sync pinned content lon three T
or rat um also like i said before basics
basic tablet editor you can create reply
and resolve comments in the document
editor you can also change font you can
also pinch-to-zoom pinch-to-zoom
improved drastically the support for it
before was it was laggy and it had
issues and it is very very nice now if
you haven't used it um not tonight all
of this affect the nexus 7 or is it just
for the full-size tablets know it
affects it actually all devices Oh
excellent that had it so it's really
nice um also you have the option to
resume interrupted uploads which is also
nice that is very nice and then we also
had updates to gesture detection which I
guess there are gesturing all the things
I'm updates so hey so for fifty bucks
you can buy a map app right or you can
use google maps don't buy it if you have
a device that's even remotely modern so
Tom Tom you know now Hector of Apple
maps yeah it tom toms trap dog sir is
that not a selling point if you wish to
get lost and find gas stations and
airports on top of City skyscrapers for
fifty bucks Tom Tom can be yours in the
app and the google play store but not if
you have an HD screen so not your nexus
7 probably not really any tablet not
your Galaxy Nexus your one extra Voyager
but it's 50 bucks so it have for a nap I
know that's ridiculous oh um ok so this
this just in Google Translate updated
and it has a did you mean suggestion
which I like that's awesome eyes um so
you you like because you actually use
Google Translate before Scott that's
cool details but um I use it to
basically show all
my people that have I devices that I can
do it quicker than they can Oh so
actually if you actually have used it
and not know I'm used it it's actually
quite nice okay all right that's cool so
uh i'm updating right now good good good
besides google wallet like app updates
um did a little Google Wallet update i
said it's part of the whole google we go
system here google wallet now is able to
power online micropayment so you can pay
for content for websites using your
Google Wallet account which is nice you
know it in time people that want to be
more and more intertwined in the
people's ecosystem it allows you to do
that so that's nice to be able to have
that big stiff against take out yeah it
is so let's talk about device update so
we have a whole mess information this
week because you know it's fall you know
we have new versions of phones coming
out new versions of operating systems
coming out and year old devices getting
your old android update so uh or or not
getting them so the jelly bean for the
Korean version of the samsung galaxy s3
is coming here in a few days on the 9th
so if you're one of our Korean viewers
search spam Annette off update button in
a few days for jelly bean um ice cream
sandwich you know announced a year ago
in two weeks is not coming for the year
old Atrix 4G or photon and that's a
little bit of a sad face for a bunch of
people that have a year old from the uh
you know so there's actually an online
petition right now saying hey google me
or a motorola your company right
whatever you have done on the Atrix 4G
or photon to get it up to speed on ice
cream sandwich and then decide to scrap
it don't throw it away release what
you've done so far so developers can do
something with it or at least give us a
workable kernel that will work on Ice
Cream Sandwich and jelly bean and we'll
take it from there the developer
community is crying out saying okay
that's cool for you
release it but don't leave us in the
dark we'll go ahead and take it from
there and do what we do best will hack
android so that's cool way I mean so
people that are into you know routing
and ramen you know uh you at least have
you least have that option available for
jelly bean or ice cream sandwich if if
anything ever happens to that so look
for that petition sign it posted share
it you know get some get some traction
on it um the acer iconia a500 my first
android tablet as well as its little
brother and sister of the 100 and 200
were announced this week to not get
jelly bean officially it doesn't mean
doesn't work I've been running jelly
bean online for a while but but
officially you're not getting it so if
you do not route do not run you will not
be getting ice cream sandwich on old
icon yes but however new icon is or
getting jelly bean and actually this the
new 700 actually yes but shipra fit i
believe right or than 110 new 110 sorry
um Ice Cream Sandwich for the pantech
element and burst is a is coming out
jelly bean has been released by asus for
all of their tablets except for the
original transformer prime but they
original transport pride said soon you
know soon just the original transform
I'm sorry there it yet you're in the
original transformers soon it's coming
next week or so you know but who knows I
mean they pushed out the infinity and
the Treasury hundred team in the prime
in the few of the pad 300 already so
they're they're jelly bean and all
things and their devices you know
they're doing they're doing it right my
opinion the other contain your tablets
very quickly so if you have an original
and og transformer one of the original
best-selling tablets I mean you're gonna
get in jelly bean soon very very soon
jelly bean the for the HTC x + 1 ass
international you're getting it however
if you have a V you're gonna have a sad
face honestly though that's not
surprising yeah i mean the V is the
low-end mala it's the cheapy you know so
you get what you pay for i guess the
wasn't spectacular just began I mean
yeah you pay for you pay for very little
for something it's hard to support it
into the gym I mean it's roughly the
same Hardware just what was in the
desire HD that came out in 2010 so on to
Nexus rumors my favorite part of the
show it's not I I love talking about
nexus rumors not a lot no lastly create
a lot this week we have a lot and i'm
assuming punch in the next three weeks
until one of these damn things actually
comes out and as announced we're going
to keep getting more leaks and more news
and more speculation so 32 gigabyte
nexus is showing up and so far two
different sales retail sales systems the
price no pressure doesn't matter yet we
don't really know anything but but we
are seeing a 32 gig Nexus 7 so if you
have an eight gig or a 16 gig you might
might be a little upset about that six
months later they come out the larger
version because a lot of people to get
them originally because they only had
little storage and you know you could
argue I argued well to cloud device
doesn't need the storage go to yoga but
still I mean not more storage is nice so
soon that we should know more on that if
that's actually going to happen now
following on that there last weekend we
talked about the $99 nexus 7 that might
be coming out here soon x7 just
anonymous Nexus tablet anonymous Nexus
tablet it was pegged as being a nexus 10
lessons is it what I mean you tag it
that way should not be writing for any
sort of professional organization it's a
it's a low-end nexus 7 maybe we don't
know how about that we call that a
low-end Nexus em back yeah that's like
saying and what about the wheel with a
low-end evo 4g also with your rumors
maybe it maybe it's going to be the
nexus 7 it's just TouchWiz 4G key lime
pie five point 0 wishin we don't know
yeah only time will tell always time
with that price book for the Tegra 3
alright so let's talk about it let's
talk about another necklace friend you
were so wrong you dropped out now that I
was so wrong i dropped out alright so
the LG optimus Nexus is pretty much all
but confirmed at this point if you like
to believe rumors and if you'd like to
believe inside sources um I like to
believe my inside sources so yeah so the
LG optimus Nexus is coming out soon most
likely to be announced the end of the
month with a November launch date it
might be announced by andy rubin when he
talks up in all things d here in the
near future it's a mobile conference the
end of october maybe that is when it
will be announced or maybe even the
nexus program will be announced then you
know and then we'll see a phone
announced you know week or two later but
either way any route
a few weeks so for him not to say
anything is going to be highly unlikely
in my opinion um rumors are speculating
that google hopes to have five Nexus
devices the thing that Wall Street
Journal talked about many many moons ago
now look now earlier we are talking
about yeah Nexus rumors and you know key
lime pie jelly bean version numbers yada
yada yada so the next version of android
is speculated to basically look and feel
like jelly bean obviously because tell
me it looks and feels like ice cream
sandwich separate soul faster I mean
they got everything right now they're
just polishing their tweaking you know
they're not adding major features or
just you know building on something good
and supposedly we're gonna see improved
power management you know some type of
new fascinating awesome google play
store edition they're going to be laying
the groundwork for five point 0 for when
the major changes happen um we're going
to have maybe home screens is that is
tabs so home screens are going to go
away and you're going to hit a tab at
the top to move around between your
different home screens but you're not
going to spike around maybe we don't
really know um then is well what we
talked about earlier the big thing in my
opinion is the nexus customization
center what uh what do you guys think
about those speculations about the
upcoming versions Android and the LG
optimus Nexus I mean it's it's
interesting i'm not really gonna take
too seriously any UI change rumors until
i see them um i mean it's it's so hard
to rumor about a UI change until you
actually know like what you're looking
at you and your wooden is not gets it's
fairly i mean it makes sense i think it
would be a step in the right direction i
think changing something right now would
be would be good and new and fresh and
all my check times google change the
android market now we know it's being
the google play store I mean they like
changing things and I think Google users
like change
um you know especially when it's better
in the right direction to something that
is more concise and better so I I'm
liking it so continuing with Nexus
rumors you know once again you know we
had a report on the samsung galaxy s2
the HTC dicks face device the droid
incredible x um in non Nexus device news
though uh the LG optimus G on which the
the Nexus LG is supposed to be based
appears behind most sprint and AT&amp;amp;T with
you know absolutely no information at
all when that's going to be but
apparently the AT&amp;amp;T version will only
have an 8 megapixel camera because I
don't know AT&amp;amp;T doesn't really like
their customers um terror firmer severe
alia of a samsung galaxy s3 mini by
which they mean a 4 inch device which is
yeah that's good me I was kind of funny
did 15 just went up to being four inches
and when Samsung makes a phone at that
size it's a mini I know I that would be
actually kind of like a nobody by this
but it's just a fu to Apple yeah and
like that be so funny if they decided to
make like a limited supply of them so
they could just make fun I that be a
step in the wrong direction I mean yeah
I think they're doing it just to do it
like you said the iPhone 5 is a 4 inch
device and Natalie hey look we can offer
for two because why we have number one
selling Android phone why not why not
experiment and you know what what screw
lawsuits we don't care we'll just we'll
just make something for throwing more
devices on the market until people buy
them yep we're gonna have 87 4-inch
devices so that your users have way more
choice than you well it's not like
Samsung has
four-inch twice before oh no I
understand that and I the one x+ appears
to be exclusively going to ATT yeah
exclusive icity with a loss I I hate
that I really really did I like it but
that's how they throw around their money
and that's how they make a lot of money
that's how they guarantee to sell
devices for certain manufacturers yeah
all part of carrier politics speaking of
carriers we had two major major carrier
news this week yeah we had a misclick
t-mobile is going to merge with metropcs
and by merger i mean they're gonna
operate as two separate companies but
t-mobile is going to unload no no no
which means no that is that he actually
doesn't mean that now is actually a test
to see if Danna we're paying attention
hahaha actually operate as t-mobile that
is if sprint doesn't actually buy them
because sprint now jump down this is
this ain't this is now just pending
government approval today well today
sprint announced they'd like an
opportunity to buy them though uh
presumably that ends after metropcs has
already signed paperwork allowing
somebody else to buy de yeah yeah there
were the Sprint was in talks with
metropcs and tried to buy them and
Sprint's board said no sprint really
doesn't get the opportunity to come back
six months later and say no our board
was lying we really do want to buy you
and particularly not after they're
already signed the deal plus let your
pcs is going to get a way better deal
out of this than they were ever going to
get from sprint because this is what's
good for sprays sprays you know spring
is just starting to roll out LTE and
metropcs already has an established LTE
network with voice over LTE capabilities
so that's good that's a very tiny
footprint you know that that's great
that's great news yeah but I mean it's
it's a good deal for metropcs because
well the brand
operate as t-mobile really metropcs is
getting t-mobile out of this yeah it's a
reverse merger so Deutsche Telekom the
owner of t-mobile USA is going to own 70
foot six percent of the new entity and
mesh row basically is going to home
twenty-four percent and then they're
just going to start selling back the
shares so then it will be a standalone
company and not part of Deutsche Telekom
anymore and their girls mentor is
getting one and a half billion dollars
out of the deal they're going to
eventually then phase out the metropcs
cdma a few years yeah good yes I'm not
sure one of the things that they said
was that most of their users the vast
majority of their users replace devices
every 12 to 18 months so they can just
atrophy people off the network fairly
quickly yeah that'll be good and
exchange t-mobile gets a lot more
spectrum a lot of AWS spectrum to build
out either their LTE or their hspa+ and
then a lot of other 2g again I mean and
that's great for t-mobile is you know
they're they're a very popular small for
their size they're great they're great
carrier i mean i wish i had t-mobile
service here i would probably drop
verizon in a second for them but you
know i don't you exactly in in the data
plans i mean that there are very good
every night i have tmobile I I like the
carrier a lot you know what kind of
spectrum are they gaining out of this
deal a lot of AWS spectrum uh and really
the big benefit is going to be not so
much in in new stuff as it's going to be
in stacking on top of what they already
have so they'll be able to one of
Sprint's problems but their LTE is that
they're delivering it over a very narrow
band I believe it's on five megahertz
compared to verizon an 1880s 10
megahertz of like each individual block
ltu that's going out wrong I mean that's
that's not a very good way of describing
it and that's not technically very
accurate ah but because verizon and AT&amp;amp;T
are using a wider band that can
basically provide higher speeds this is
a little out tmobile to
together they're 5 plus metros 5 in a
lot of areas where they can do the wider
bands when they would not have otherwise
been able to uh it's also going to allow
them to pick up a lot of coverage in
specific geographic areas where Metro
has a lot of spectrum and a lot of
coverage and team up with doesn't
particular than Northeast and a couple
of other random places like mid michigan
and dallas and florida Metrozone a lot
of weird places yeah company should be
interesting coverage wise to see if
t-mobile will increase their coverage I
mean around where I am I've heard good
and bad kind of a hit-or-miss where I am
yeah I was so 0 points mother carrying
news a few things here and there um II
is set to turn on that's everything
everywhere everywhere yeah they're set
the hook what is it orange and t-mobile
UK yeah yeah they're they're UK carrier
by ten-thirty they're going to start
turned on LTE and they hope to have a
nationwide rollout by the summer 2013 so
a little less than a year from now in
the UK that's the first of their kind
right yes yes yes in the UK they're
still waiting for an auction of spectrum
that everybody else wants to use for LTE
a tmobile and you and I think it's
orange and basically are merging
together and forming everything
everywhere and using repurposing old
spectrum of theirs into an LTE frequency
so they're pushing LTE before any of
their competitors have even purchased
the spectrum to do it on so a no
perspective on why they can roll out so
fast the UK is not a very large country
is it a good version or good based
version of LTE to start rolling upon
because I know that you know I don't
know enough the tech details on it ok
because I know sprint is starting off on
a good area expandability wise and I
don't know the network architecture that
they're using for it
and then LightSquared Oh LightSquared
let's weird white square d looks good on
paper yeah LightSquared is trying again
reframing pieces of their spectrum
holdings note that they can maybe get
some kind of something out of it or else
they're gonna owe a lot of people a lot
of money I hope they're successful I
mean it's another competitor to the
high-speed mobile data networks you know
you calm down I mean I said I like I
follow what they're doing I think it's a
good initiative but so far that you know
they just can't seem to get it off the
ground yeah I mean LightSquared really I
think kind of got shafted by the
government on this one cuz the problem
isn't that there's something wrong with
light squared spectrum the problem is
that GPS makers are building shoddy
devices by that right like if or if AT&amp;amp;T
bill devices that spilled over onto
verizon's network verizon be pissed yeah
and yet it wouldn't be verizon's
probably be a tease problem to fix it
right like this is basically the late
square getting told oh no these other
people are doing their jobs so badly
that you know you doing yours within
your own rights would infringe on theirs
so you can't actually you know use this
stuff that you own because these people
that don't omit are using it but with
the GPS be the carriers or would that be
the manufacturers it's not Coors its
manufacturers of GPS equipment okay and
ultimately that can't be reversed I mean
I mean it can't if there's a lot of
options I mean one thing that has been
suggested is basically forced the
government to buy back chunks of light
squared spectrum because they're
basically saying this spectrum is
reserved for duty yes yeah if you're
going to say it's reserved for GPS then
you better be willing to buy it back
yeah the reason why that's not going to
happen is because it's technically the
spectrum that they home is approved for
satellite communications and they're
trying to get authorized to repurpose it
for a terrestrial network when it is
being used for satellite purposes it's
not a problem for jerkass which is one
of the reasons why I was originally you
know slated for satellite here so let's
talk about our favorite thing patent
wars I believe Dan's favorite female
judge did did some interesting things
this week yes so in in Samsung's filing
to set aside the jury perfect as more
details are coming out on it there at
this point pretty much accusing the jury
foreman a frog so evidently the jury
foreman used to work for I think it's
seagate yes and it got into some kind of
legal kerfuffle with his one-time
employer and the the problem here would
be that the majority owner seagate is
Samsung technically he didn't break any
rules because the litigation was far
enough back that it like it didn't
violate any disclosure rules but that is
certainly something that you know you'd
think is kind of biased he basically got
sued by Samsung in the past and when i
croaked because of it one that said he
was the jury foreman he's the one that
yeah I'm hatnin said everybody yep
they're back yep yep very good can other
jurors back that up and he was
previously sued by Samsung lost and went
bankrupt no he has no motive back at
Samsung her all I saw him whether wasn't
disclosed yeah that's one of the things
that Samsung saying why wasn't this
disclosed it's very also in the
courtroom of Lucy Coe um he has no
rescinded her babe galaxy tab 10.1 after
saying that she liked the jurisdiction
to do so because i really don't know why
she thought that the appeals court
disagreed with her and told her no no
really you do need to make a decision
and you do have the authority to revoke
your own injunction um and it's the way
device in preliminary injunctions work
is the person asking for it in this case
Apple has to put up a bond to secure the
injunction basically saying in the event
that you enjoying this on our say so and
it's found not to be infringing were
coughing up all this money to pay for
damages Apple is definitely on the hook
for their 2.6 million dollar bond but
potentially more than that for you know
every not sold device during the time
that they were banned realistically
we're talking about the galaxy tab 10.1
so you know what they're five hundred
dollars pop we're talking about maybe
maybe five thousand dollars good and
it's it's very small Pyramus I think
right yeah um and in other patent news
Motorola's big case against well
absolutely everything that Apple makes
has been withdrawn for no reason
whatsoever yes so the question is is you
know there's a rumor back a few weeks
ago that Tim Cook in and Larry Page were
good meat did they meet I don't know I
can tell you that quid pro quo like that
in an explicit sense of like we've said
if the if there is a signed deal the
fact that there is any kind of a sign
deal not being disclosed well
withdrawing the case would be a legal
problem for both parties so I would
assume at this point there has been no
formal agreement one here ever why they
dropped it thing however one party
suggesting that the other one dropping
their litigation might allow for more
favorable negotiating position is
totally fun which is probably why
motorola hasn't really given any details
on why they've pulled this this this
violate they've also though not done it
with prejudice so they are free to
refile at anytime they want so it was
cooking for this could be for a lot of
reasons right like motorola could have
realized that there was something wrong
filing documentation and just decided to
pull the case altogether so they can
refile it later properly without
whatever error it was rather than allow
that to be the reason the case gets
tossed it could be that you know they
want it they decided a certain Patton
wasn't very strong and they want to
rework the arguments I mean there could
be any number of not like peaceful
reasons to it could have like determined
that maybe they were overreaching and
trying to make other devices infringe on
too many things I mean it could be that
I mean it's a lot if it were something
that mundane of saying oh you know we're
not actually going to use this patent or
we're not going to search this one
against these devices that's a simple
amendment to the filing ok I would think
that there had to be something more
fundamentally wrong with the with the
filing or I'm gonna withdraw it to refil
if that's if that's their strategy I
suspect it's more likely that they
withdraw it for other political reasons
you know potentially trying to settle
things down with Apple I see but they
can also refile it anytime they want we
have a question earlier mystic that
dared more asked we find it here hbu
wanted to know and and I'm going to
defer to you on this he won't dare more
ask most of Android patches have been
merged into the mainline kernel and
armed vice street patches just got
merged into the 3.7 colonel this past
week do you think that will help it
update any lag problem on Android I mean
Android right now is still on 3-point oh
that's not true how does it not for
Brooks commander hi the Galaxy Nexus no
on jelly bean yeah that's gonna be a TI
problem really more than anything else
but it but I'm still correct though that
that the Galaxy Nexus is still andrew is
still on the three-point Oh Colonel I i
mean i don't know i don't have a galaxy
nexus i can tell you the nexus 7 us on a
3.1 it is next
Devin is on 3.1 we got to Nexus is on I
mean in either case android kernels on
like actual living devices are still
vastly behind where the current linux
kernel a sense I think 3.6 came out just
a couple of weeks ago very recently and
I know 3.7 is moving along rapidly so we
not less not unless we see three points
extra 3.7 on the next Nexus right right
i mean that's the other thing as android
does tend to make leaps to catch up but
even when they do that they're still
pretty behind and y lo exposed to be
grateful will cherry pick you know the
little cherry pick new no updates and
backport them yeah i mean as far as the
update process I don't think it's the
colonel that's holding it back I mean I
the transition to ICS had a lot of
things that needed to get changed in in
the kernel transition from ICS to
jellybean a lot less so I mean there's
some things for project butter that need
to get ported in for vsync but by and
large it just isn't a significant so I
mean once in a while like getting
getting these devices over that that
hump to ICS 24 point X once they're past
that I think that slow updates from
there is just slow manufacturers and
there's not a lot we can do about that
well hopefully uh no III hope hopefully
a much more advanced version comes out
the next next batch of Nexus devices
Alicia I mean a lot of it's on the the
manufacture the chip manufacturers right
like Qualcomm I'm pretty sure is not
building on a 3.6 kernel for their
frankly there just isn't 3.6 code for
Qualcomm chips it doesn't exist last
time I looked they were working on 3.4
which is still well ahead of anything in
a device but so the crumpled is
basically a base level for chips too
poor certain curl attributes not just
chips it's really sort of the thing that
is the layer between the physical
hardware and the device and the
operating system running on the device
so it's controlling your your image
processor it's controlling your voltage
regulators it's controlling your CPU
regulation it's controlling you know all
those low level functions low level
function that can ultimately make your
device awesome or totally broke or
totally yeah or totally not even
workable yeah yeah I mean the colonel is
is doing very little level things like
saying give this much voltage to this
specific power rail in your Wi-Fi module
to turn it on at that frequency right
like you see and you go and you touch
new tap turn on Wi-Fi the operating
system use is basically a kernel API to
say that that intense has been sent and
then the colonel actually execute the
you know the physical telling the Wi-Fi
module to go and do that yeah I just
started running Franco girl and I'm
experimenting with some of those did you
wow you know Scott hit a monster Derek
you are an animal you're rooting your
ramen your kernel and oh the hell say we
got flash next you know oh no I don't
like really all soft to change I even
flash some random APK a random ma zip
file that will change random things you
more more customization you know like me
at all dude I know inverted G apps there
you go that's your next thing okay well
basically a inverted G apps you know
regular G apps are all white let's say
you have a black theme in you want black
GF to match so basically somebody went
out wider device to use less power oh
yeah that too so somebody without
haryana have a lot screen come
it's a nexus rest my explanation danner
knows someone's pretend i can talk good
talk man no all right so okay all right
uh so in Virgie app somebody decompile
like gmail basically and went in there
and changed all the XML go from white to
black on black to later or whatever
whatever color they decide to make it
very compilat but uh yes and as Dan said
it's actually better for your battery
life because you know white is white and
light is depends on the type of screen
that's true in any of it it's a super
amoled type display blacks basically
aren't using any power whatsoever
whereas on an LCD it's still illuminated
oh it still trying to make that black
red right like it's illuminating a black
color yeah is very fine just turned off
yeah so less the last thing interrelated
I want to talk about before we get out
of here tonight is uh uh the big Android
BBQ is now two weeks away um I'll be
there in two weeks and somehow a joke
went horribly wrong and turned into this
thing that people are now donating money
to a fund for me to wear a pink gorilla
suit that's fantastic um where do i
donate yeah so yeah I made a few jokes
about how I would wear a pink gorilla
suit at the pool party at the big
Android BBQ and my loving friends and
fans decided what he said you better do
it and it may created that he has to do
you have a link I don't have a link but
I but there it's already been posted in
the comments and you know if they
actually raise the money I'm gonna have
to do it because that's a real yeah
that's a real one that's a real jerk
thing to do and am sorry if you didn't
do it I know so I'm not saying to do it
but yes you are but there's already
money in there so
I'm saying you should do it um you know
what there's free beer from a local
microbrewery at the pool party a guy's
gonna be there may be in a gorilla suit
is pink for breast cancer awareness uh
sounds like a good plan i guess yeah I
mean I'm just pushing all the money goes
to charity too I'm all about this now
don't get a chick way it goes to the
ghost of the suit charity and maybe just
maybe if it can't cost that much uh it
was like a 180 bucks i think but
apparently the guy that is in charge
with jody he said he found cheaper
versions of the suit someone even
suggested a pink furry bikini I'm not
doing that okay I don't care how much
money you raise I'm not doing that but
uh earlier and he said that you would do
it hahaha yeah but anyway so yeah so
that's going on so I'm dealing with that
um that's about it two weeks can't wait
anything else any other questions before
we fantastic before we sign out for this
evening here I'm not seeing anything we
do have a volunteer for the pink furry
bikini that I see now okay well we'll
see when we r get a donation link I'm
for up for that well what what will be
the pink furry suit couple I guess all
right so uh thanks for watching and have
a good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
