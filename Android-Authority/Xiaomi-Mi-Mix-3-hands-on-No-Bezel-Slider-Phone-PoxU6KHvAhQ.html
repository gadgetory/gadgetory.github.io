phones you remember just how satisfying
that click was well they're back
the jhemini mix three reintroduces that
classic form factor with a few
futuristic tricks up its sleeve we've
seen phones with hidden front-facing
cameras before notably the Oppo find X
and vivo next the problem with those
phones was that the camera mechanism was
motorized
adding the double whammy of a motor and
a moving part to a device that really
should have neither the mimics three
side steps at least one of those
problems by making the slider manual
using neodymium magnets to lock the
screen in place
it feels very similar to the slider
phones of old and it's just as fun if
you're a phone fidgeter like me you can
also swap out the slider noise so adding
a lightsaber sound effect is just a
couple of taps away the slider isn't
just about keeping the dual front-facing
cameras hidden though it also means
there's no need for a notch the
slide-out section houses antennas the
earpiece speaker and facial recognition
sensor if my short time of it is any
indication you can also use it as a
great place to start your fluff
collection the front-facing cameras are
a 24 megapixel primary sensor from Sony
with an F 2.2 aperture lens and a
secondary 2 megapixel sensor for
capturing depth information for portrait
mode the primary lens uses pixel winning
to combine light data from four jason
pixels into one super pixel for better
low-light selfies there are two cameras
on the back as well both a 12 megapixel
resolution the main sensor is a sony OEM
x36 3-wood dual pixel autofocus with an
f 1.8 aperture lens with 4x soas the
second sensor is from Samsung and offers
2 X optical zoom and F 2.4 aperture
now Shami made a pretty big deal about
the me mix threes low-light performance
saying it's even better than the Huawei
p20 pro we'll put that to the test soon
and substitute the p20 for the brand new
mate 20 pro so keep an eye out for that
comparison the Memex 3 is jam-packed
with AI beauty modes portrait bokeh
effects studio lighting and face
reconstruction software you'll get
Android 9 PI and me your way 10 running
out of the box and speaking of the box
inside it you'll get a free 10 watt
wireless charger there's also a 3.5 ml 2
USB type-c headphone adapter because you
know there's no room for a headphone
jack on this phone a quick charge 3
charging brick is included although the
mimics 3 also supports quick charge
called plus if you want to buy a
convertible charger then plastic case is
also in the box
works just fine with a slider mechanism
now the mimics three is sliding form
factor unfortunately means that the
battery capacity took a bit of a hit
coming in at just 3200 milliamp hours
there's also no IP rating for obvious
reasons and if C is included though and
well it looks like they're stereo
speakers on the bottom only one produces
sound with the other simply housing a
microphone the mean mix three is once
again built out of ceramic and is pretty
hefty of 218 grams that's a whole 10
percent heavier than the Galaxy Note
nine although the mimics 3 has a
slightly smaller footprint despite its
six point three nine inch full HD AMOLED
panel which is also made by Samsung
there's a dedicated voices system button
on the side for the ji virtual assistant
but the global version will likely ship
with Google Assistant pre-loaded as
Yahweh I only supports Chinese languages
as for the specs it's all top-notch
stuff Snapdragon 840 5 6 up to 10
gigabytes of RAM and so on perhaps the
best part about the mimics 3 is that
Jeremy still refuses to overprice its
handsets so the base model with 6 gig of
ram and 128 gig of ufs 2.1 storage will
only set you back the equivalent of 475
US dollars even the limited edition
forbidden palace museum variant the one
with 5g support and 10 gig of ram only
comes in at 720 US and it includes a
wireless charger and 10 gigabytes of
free data per month me mixer he goes on
sale in China on November 1 with armies
other global markets soon to follow
there's no regional pricing available
for those markets yet but you can
probably work it out based on previous
devices I don't know about you guys but
from the short amount of time I've spent
with each army me mix 3 I am pretty
pumped to see the global version when it
rolls out it's unique it's retro it's
futuristic it's jam-packed with great
specs it's very affordable and it looks
great as well jump in the comments and
let me know what you want to know about
the me mix 3 I'll do my best to answer
them and until next time keep it locked
to Android Authority comm because we are
your source for all things Android
this is what happens when you set up for
a voiceover in a driveway at a hotel in
China</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
