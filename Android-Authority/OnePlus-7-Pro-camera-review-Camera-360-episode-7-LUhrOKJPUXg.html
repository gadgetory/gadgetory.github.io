Thor T and welcome back to another
episode of camera 360 where we attempt
to break down a smartphone camera in
three minutes give or take now our goal
on this show is to highlight some of the
most important aspects of a smartphone
camera that we think you should know and
we try to do it in a very short and
sweet fashion now if you guys are
interested in a more in-depth analysis
you can always check out the written
version of our review which will always
be linked in the description below with
all of that out of the way let's get
into today's episode with the 1 plus 7
Pro like many smartphones in 2019 the 1
plus 7 Pro comes equipped with a triple
camera system on the rear the primary
camera is the oh so popular 48 megapixel
Sony sensor and it's paired with an 8
megapixel telephoto lens with 3x optical
zoom and an ultra wide-angle 16
megapixel camera with 817 degree field
of view the front-facing camera also
comes in at 16 megapixels and supports
features like portrait mode and face
unlock one plus the software has always
struck a perfect bounce between
simplicity and features and the same can
be said about their camera app you've
got the usual shutter button camera
rotation and image preview buttons at
the bottom and right above that are four
simple modes you've got video photo
portrait and nightsky along the top
you'll find additional options that will
vary based on which mode you're in more
advanced modes like the manual pro mode
and the camera settings can be accessed
by swiping up from the bottom it's a
really easy camera app to navigate and
everything that you're looking for is
really only a couple of taps or swipes
away now most smartphone cameras
typically perform pretty well in
daylight conditions and the 1 plus 7 Pro
is really no different images are well
exposed and details are quite sharp
colors pop just enough to make photos
look attractive and skies exhibit a
really nice bright blue colors overall
are really well balanced and the 1 plus
7 Pro does a great job with saturation
vibrancy and contrast to make photos
come to life dynamic range could be a
little bit better as shadows tend to be
much harsher than we'd like and we don't
really see much detail in these areas
close-up shots of subjects retain a lot
of detail and there's very little
softening when you zoom in for a closer
look the details and the threat of this
ball of yarn can be seen clearly and
there's plenty of texture on the meat
and cheese on this Mexican dish the 1 +
7 pro's camera is certainly punching
above its weight here portrait mode on
the 1 + 7 Pro is pretty convincing but
doesn't exactly stand out from other
smartphones in its class it doesn't have
much trouble with outlining a subject
and separating it from the background
and even does surprisingly well with
complex edges from things like hair
you'll have to look pretty carefully to
find mistakes but we're not particularly
a fan of how some shots wind up with a
hazy effect and low-light you have the
option of shooting photos and auto like
normal or relying on one pluses
nightscape mode results in auto mode are
a little underwhelming as noise is
pretty apparent and there's a noticeable
amount of softening turn on night scape
though and you'll instantly get better
results exposure dynamic range colors
and sharpness are significantly improved
and you can see much more detail in
highlights in shadowy areas nightscape
does take a little bit of extra time to
capture these images but the results are
definitely worth it as far as selfies
from the front-facing camera go it's
pretty average at best exposure is good
but colors are a little on the washed
outside the 1 + 7 Pro also likes to over
soften skin which is something we're not
particularly a fan of with front-facing
shooters the 1 + 7 Pro does pretty well
when it comes to recording video colors
and exposure are on point and autofocus
is fast and smooth despite recording on
the back of a moving motorbike the
footage was still surprisingly very
smooth given the conditions you should
have no problems getting smooth footage
if you're just casually walking and
vlogging it's also pretty nice to have
4k resolution at 60fps as a recording
option overall the 1 + 7 pros camera
provides a nice value with good
performance in most conditions but it
doesn't necessarily go above and beyond
expectations most people should still be
plenty happy with this camera though and
it offers quite a bit of features and
versatility with its three lenses we
give the oneplus 7 pro an overall score
of seven point eight four out of 10 if
you want to see a detailed breakdown of
this
or find out some more in-depth details

prose camera check out our rent review
