Android or authority now recently I
published a video where I compared some
of the leading processors for Android
smartphones and in it I compared the
Exynos 7420 along with the Snapdragon
810 along with some chips from qua way
and from mediatek now once I publish
that video people were asking where's
Intel why haven't I put Intel into this
comparison well the truth of the matter
is that Intel really only have a sliver
of the smartphone market 98 or 99% of
all smartphones sold use chips based on
the ARM architecture now of course Intel
very much want to get into the
smartphone market and why wouldn't they
because there are millions of units sold
every single year which will be great
for Intel however they have not yet had
much success
there was one phone that was launched
this year it did cause a bit of a splash
and that was the Asus zenfone 2 and it
was well received with two main reasons
one is it had four gigabytes of memory
and secondly it was very aggressively
priced now at the heart of the zenfone 2
is not an ARM based processor but an
Intel processor in fact it's the intel
atom z3580 so today what I'm going to do
is I'm going to compare the Exynos 7420
along with the Snapdragon 810 along with
the atom z3580 and let's see how they
compare with each other
let's have a quick look at these three
different processes the xr7 420 is
Samsung's homegrown processor it's an
octa-core processor that has four cortex
a 57 cause and four cortex a53 course
now this is it uses a system called big
dot little from arm which means that
there are big processors the court has a
57 cause which are used for the heavy
lifting for the high-performance work
and there are four causes are more power
efficient more battery friendly that are
use for more simpler tasks for example
if you're watching a YouTube video early
the cortex a53 calls will be used if
you're playing a 3d game then the cortex
a57 course will be used now the Exynos
7420 has a GPU from arm as well and that
is the mali t760 now next that we have
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 that's also
an octa-core processor with four cortex
87 cores and for cortex a53 cores in
this big dot little arrangement for
performance and power efficiency but
difference in the Samsung chip is that
it uses Qualcomm's own GPU the Adreno
430 now next to that we have this Intel
chip the atom z3580 now it's a
completely different system architecture
is a completely different way of doing
things and Intel take the same
technologies they use on their desktops
and in their servers and they try and
squeeze it into a small chip for mobile
now it's only a quad-core processor is
built using a 22 nanometer technology
and for a GPU uses imaginations power VR
g64 30 now it's a quad-core processor
because intel don't make octa-core
processor for mobile it doesn't have a
big dot little equivalent or a HMP
equivalent that allows it to have power
efficient cause and power of performance
calls it has to just rely on the
performance and the power efficiency of
its individual cores so let's have a
look to see how these three chips run in
benchmarks and real-life situations and
see which is the best processor so
before we go on to the individual result
let me tell about the telephones I was
using to test the Exynos 7420 I use a
samsung galaxy note 5 to test the
Snapdragon 810 I use the Sony's edge
five compact and to test the Intel chip
I use the zenfone 2 of course the first
place we would turn to is and 2 2 now
and 2 2 is a benchmarking app it's
artificial in the in create artificial
workloads however it will tell us what
the processor is capable of and here are
my findings as you can see in 1st place
is the Exynos 7420 with a nearly 70,000
score then we have close behind that the
Snapdragon 810 with 60 2130 and then in
third place quite disappointingly
below 50,000 is the atom z3580 with the
score just 48,000 848 now you'll also
notice here there is some bars in red
now these are the result after I ran
Epic Citadel for 30 minutes the idea was
that if I ran Epic Citadel
it might heat up a device slightly and
if the device was being heated up then
maybe the processor would perform
differently because it can't use so much
energy in getting higher result and
that's actually the case we find that
all of the results drop here the eggs
dots drops down to 60 3070 the
Snapdragon 810 drop down to 59 thousand
and 51 and the atom z3580 drop down to
47 thousand six hundred and thirteen so
the drops seem to be uniform across the
board though in fact the atom z3580 does
do quite well in the drop isn't as much
as the other two processors now the next
test I run was Geekbench now Geekbench
offers as two scores one is the single
core result in what is a multi-core
result of a single core result tells us
how fast just one individual core on the
processor runs doesn't whether has four
cores or six cores or eight cores just
tells you how fast one of those cause is
and then for its multi-core test it uses
all of the core simal taneous li to
achieve an overall result in of course
the two arm-based chips are octa-core
processors and the Intel based chip is
of quad-core processors are already it's
going to lose on the multi-core test how
it will be interesting to see how well
it does on the single core score tests
so here are my results on the single
core test we find that the Exynos 7420
has the best score with 1504 next
the Snapdragon 810 with 1306 again
disappointing do we find the single core
test for the atom z3580 is only 918 now
according to other tests that I've run a
score of 918 a score of 919 is really
comparable to a Snapdragon 801 which is
a 32-bit processor or a 64-bit cortex
a53 nowhere near the speed of the cortex
857 as these results show us what about
the multi-core tests well as we expected
the zegs nor 7420 does the best with a
score of over 5,000 next comes the
Snapdragon 810 with a score of over
4,000 and unfortunate with a score of
under 3,000 again is the atom chip so
what we knew that was going to be the
case because it only has quad core one
of the interesting things about the
zenfone 2 is it when I started to run
the benchmarks a little notification
came up saying you really should be
running in high-performance mode to get
the best if your benchmarks now that
means two things first of all it means
that the speed that the processor
running normally day-to-day is not its
high performance setting and when I ran
the benchmarks I did switch over to the
high performance mode but it also means
that these notifications came up before
I actually started the test although
around the app I hadn't hit the start
test button which means that the CPU
wasn't at all being loaded so the only
reason that the phone knew that I was
running a benchmark was it recognized
the name of the program that was running
which means it has a database built into
it of benchmarks and high performance
games that need high performance mode
now that can be quite sinister because
we don't know what other things the
phone is doing in the background to
compensate for the fact that it can't
run these high performance tests very
well if it's only bringing up a
notification that's fine but if it's
doing other things things in the shadows
things in the dark that we don't know
that could be a bit dubious anyway what
I did do was I ran Geekbench in high
performance mode and then I ran it again
in its normal mode to see what the
difference in the performance between
the normal mode and the high performance
mode was and here are the results as you
can see in high performance mode there's
an individual single quartet of 918 and
a multi score test of
under 3000 as we've just said however
will you run it only in normal mode you
actually find the score drops quite
significantly 755 for the single core
test and 2311 for the multi core test so
this shows us that the Intel chip cannot
run all the time at high performance
mode because it will just eat into the
battery and that when it's dialed back a
bit to get better battery life actually
the performance drops quite
significantly and that's an important
thing that mode doesn't exist on the
Snapdragon 810 phones or on the samsung
phone they just run at the best of their
abilities and that's of course one of
the advantage of having the octa-core
big little system it has both for
high-power cores and for power efficient
calls in there which you can switch
between depending on the workload of the
intel chip can't do that just a round
off our set of testings I ran a program
called the CPU prime benchmark which as
you can imagine calculates prime numbers
and it just sees how quickly can
calculate thousands and thousands of
prime numbers and then gives us a score
so let's have a look at those results
and there's nothing surprising here
again we find the Exynos 7420 winning
then we find behind it the Snapdragon
810 and then quite away behind it again
we find the Intel Atom chip so the same
pattern here is emerging Exynos 7420
first Snapdragon 810 second and the
Intel chip in third place
now of course benchmarks on everything
we do have to do some real life work
some time so I've devised two tests here
that will help us see the real life
performance of these particular
processors one is to just start a game
in fact is the need for speed game and
just see how long it takes to start up
now I do know that there are course
other things involved in this including
the speed of the flash memory it's not
only about the CPU however it should
give us an overall feel of how fast
these proteases are let's have a look at
the results in this particular graph
lower is better and we can see that the
note 5 was able to start up Need for
Speed in just 28 seconds next with a
Snapdragon 810 on the Sony z5 compact 43
seconds and then again in third place
was the zenfone 2 which took 47 seconds
to start up the same game now the second
test that I'm using is the kraken
javascript test and
test developed by Mozilla to see how
fast a JavaScript engine runs inside of
a web browser now we all do lots of web
browsing on our phone so how fast the
JavaScript engine runs is important for
all of us says have a look at those
crackin results on this graph lower is
better we can see the best score came
from the Exynos 7420
with a startup time of three thousand
seven hundred fifty three milliseconds
after that comes the Snapdragon 810 with
a score of four thousand two hundred and
fifty three and then again in third
place is the atom chip with four
thousand nine hundred and ninety four
now as we saw the zenfone 2 can
recognize the benchmark apps that we're
running because there are really only a
handful of popular benchmark apps out
there and two two Geekbench and so on so
to get around this I've written two of
my own benchmarks but Asus had cannot
know about neither can Samsung and
neither can Sony and I've written those
myself they've never been published
they're not out there for anybody else
to find I've got them and I've run them
on these phones to see what results we
can find
now the first test does some
mathematical things some hashes some
prime numbers some sorting and it just
runs through a series of tests and then
gives us a result in seconds at the end
and let's have a look to see how that
comes out the results here are in
milliseconds and the best phone this
time round was the Snapdragon 810 which
called twenty two thousand nine hundred
and thirty seven and thirty thousand
three hundred and seventy is the Exynos
7420
now you then go almost double that time
to fifty-five thousand nine hundred and
twenty and there you have the Adam
Schiff now that's quite a bad
performance by the atoms it could it be
that there's some things going on in the
background it doesn't it knows about
benchmarks doesn't know about my won it
didn't perform that well I'd hit perform
it in high performance mode but the
score is almost double of what you find
for the Snapdragon 810 interesting my
second test is a 2d physics test is a
test that runs droplets of water into a
container and they fill up and the GPU
and the CPU need to keep a track of all
those droplets of water and all the
motion that goes on inside that bucket
more and more water is poured into it
and what happens is that a new drop of
water is added to the animation every
frame
now if the CPU can't keep up it starts
to drop frames at the end of it it tells
us how many frames were dropped in fact
it tells how many frames managed to put
drops of water into the simulation and
we can calculate how many were dropped
because the maximum score should be
5,400 so let's have a look what the
results are well we can see here that
the note 5 major score of five thousand
three hundred and fifty nines only
forty-one frames were dropped during the
whole simulation close behind it we have
the Snapdragon 810 with a score of five
thousand two hundred and twenty two and
then again in last place we find that
the atom dropped almost four thousand
frames and couldn't cope with all of
those drops of water in the simulation
so again using my benchmark which no one
else knows about the atom did really
really bad now one thing you have to
talk about when you talk about
performance is battery life because if
we had a phone that she was really
really thick and we Slyke a really
really big battery in it then it could
afford to crank up that CPU to higher
clock frequencies and it could do more
work and produce more heat but the
performance would be great because we
don't want that we want thin phones and
we don't want them to overheat in our
hand so I did some battery test just to
see how well these phones cope under
different circumstances so test the
battery I did two things one is I ran
epic to the bill and it run for half an
hour and see how much battery was used
in that time and their news I to
extrapolate on how much you could run
Epic Citadel from a full charge in the
second test I use an app that I wrote
myself which brings up a web page every
20 seconds it loads it up over Wi-Fi
displays it wait 20 seconds then brings
up a different web page sites like the
BBC CNN and so on I let that run for an
hour and see how much a battery loss
there was during that hour and use that
number to extrapolate to hear the
results as we can see the Snapdragon 810
and the Exynos 7420 can run this game
for 300 minutes now we must note that
the Snapdragon 810 is found inside of
the z5 compact with its 720p display and
the Exynos 7420 is found inside of a
note 5 with its 2k display but even so
taking that into account they can
both played for the same number of
minutes however the atom z3580 which is
using the zenfone 2 with its HD display
only managed 250 minutes and when it
came to my web browsing test we find
that again the Snapdragon 810 and the
Exynos 7420 I have the same measurements
at 10 hours 600 minutes however the atom
z3580 can only manage 461 minutes of
course all of these phones have
different sized batteries if you have a
small battery it will go down quickly if
a large battery it will go down less so
we need to compare this battery usage
for web browsing to how big the actual
battery is so what I did was I took the
battery size divide it by the number of
minutes and that gives you a rate of how
much battery in milliamp hours is used
per minute of web browsing and that
levels the playing field across all of
these three phones and here are my
results we can see here that the
Snapdragon 810 inside the z5 compact
does the best it uses just 4.5 million
powers per minute of web browsing the
next comes the Exynos 7420 in the note 5
which uses 5 and then in last place
again we find the atoms 8 3 5 8 o which
uses 6.5 1 so regards to the size of the
battery this is how much is energy is
used when surfing the web on these
phones so what does all that mean well
unfortunately the atoms it came last in
every single one of our tests both in
performance and in battery life now why
is that well first of all we have to
understand that it's actually a slightly
older chip but also it shows you that
the Intel chip isn't very popular
because people are building phones with
their latest chips now the silvermont
architecture was announced in May 2013
I'm recording this video at the end of
2015 the actual chips themselves were
released somewhere in the middle of 2014
so we always a year went past from when
the chip was announced until when it
first appeared and then another year
went past until March 2015 when the
zenfone 2 was officially launched so
what does this mean well actually if we
look at how Intel prioritize its mobile
chips we find that really it doesn't
take mobile
seriously at all because in 2013 other
chips based on the silvermont
architecture were released for desktops
and servers and they took another six
months before Intel released a chip for
mobile and then another year until the
phone was released by Asus of course
they were using that chip in the
development cycle there so the problem
is that Intel take chips that are
designed for servers and desktops and
they try to shoehorn it into a mobile
chip and they don't get it right arm on
the other hand only make designs for
low-power situations all of their chips
are designed to only use a certain
amount of energy if it doesn't use that
manner major they go back and they redo
this design and check again we run their
simulations until that particular budget
of energy and thermal budget is actually
met now Intel have the capacity to make
a really good chip but they haven't
really been serious about it yet until
they do get serious ARM based chips are
going to be the best ones for our
smartphones what my name's goes tin from
