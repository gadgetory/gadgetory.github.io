enough to send us a sample unit of the
LG optimus G we're excited to open this
box and see the goodies inside join me

security stickers there's one on the top
edge and another at the bottom which

Snapdragon processor 2 gigabytes of RAM
and 32 gigabytes of internal storage
this is a very powerful phone with a
powerful hardware it's green is 4.7
inches in diagonal and we expect it to
be very crisp especially since it uses
the true HD IPS + LCD screen so let's
open it here it is guys the LG optimus G
as you can see it still has its
protective plastic cover on even at the
back so let's set this aside for now
let's save the best for last what else

there are two tags inside the sashay and
these are the user guides they're in
Korean here are the two pen european
standard wall charger plug the USB

club beat earphones see how these look
like they're nice literally these are in
ear headphones with soft earbuds the
cord is narrow and flat and there
noodles here are some spare earbuds in

tool you'll need this for opening the
SIM tray let's set this aside for now
okay the minor goodies out of the way
let's now look at the main attraction
the optimus G is still dressed in
plastic so let's address it there's also
protective plastic covering the edges
and the backside the screen looks very
nice it's black and glossy there's the
LG logo over there and the front-facing
camera let's look at the back it's all
white ok there's the LG logo and the
back camera we have the loudspeaker down
here and on top we have metal gilding
over there and there's a headphone
headphone jack and we have the small
hold their TV antenna over here and the
power button over here hey and the
volume keys and the sim tray right over

screws let's take a peek at the software
and interface ok let's power this baby
now ok the LG logo showing up sounds

time this phone has Buddha the startup

default language to English ok let's set
this up all right I'll set let's walk
around the interface very briefly and

default home screen wallpaper looks
amazing and colorful the app icon looks
very sharp I haven't seen jitter or lag
yet while swiping between scenes it's
super smooth screen transitions are
buttery very slick so let's find out
what Android version is pulling the
strings here right let's look for the
settings hey aah hey oh it's Android Ice
Cream Sandwich I hate I was initially
expecting Android 4.1 jelly bean in here
because the operating system is buttery
smooth we're hearing though that LG will
be pushing jelly bean to this phone very

optimus G its various now be very smooth
