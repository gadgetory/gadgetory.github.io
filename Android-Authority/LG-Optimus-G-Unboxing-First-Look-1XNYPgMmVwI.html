authority calm LG electronics was kind
enough to send us a sample unit of the
LG optimus G we're excited to open this
box and see the goodies inside join me
and find out here's the unopened box as
you can see it's still sealed with
security stickers there's one on the top
edge and another at the bottom which
also has informational barcodes this
unit seems to be capable of LTE warp the
phone specs and features are printed at
the back of the box so what's inside the
box let's find out we're about to find
out what LG's newest phone looks like
this unit has a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon processor 2 gigabytes of RAM
and 32 gigabytes of internal storage
this is a very powerful phone with a
powerful hardware it's green is 4.7
inches in diagonal and we expect it to
be very crisp especially since it uses
the true HD IPS + LCD screen so let's
open it here it is guys the LG optimus G
as you can see it still has its
protective plastic cover on even at the
back so let's set this aside for now
let's save the best for last what else
is in here here are NFC tags I believe
there are two tags inside the sashay and
these are the user guides they're in
Korean here are the two pen european
standard wall charger plug the USB
charging cable we also have a pair of
club beat earphones see how these look
like they're nice literally these are in
ear headphones with soft earbuds the
cord is narrow and flat and there
noodles here are some spare earbuds in
case and here's a simple or a sim eject
tool you'll need this for opening the
SIM tray let's set this aside for now
okay the minor goodies out of the way
let's now look at the main attraction
the optimus G is still dressed in
plastic so let's address it there's also
protective plastic covering the edges
and the backside the screen looks very
nice it's black and glossy there's the
LG logo over there and the front-facing
camera let's look at the back it's all
white ok there's the LG logo and the
back camera we have the loudspeaker down
here and on top we have metal gilding
over there and there's a headphone
headphone jack and we have the small
hold their TV antenna over here and the
power button over here hey and the
volume keys and the sim tray right over
here so you need a sim pin for that the
bottom we have the USB port and torque
screws let's take a peek at the software
and interface ok let's power this baby
now ok the LG logo showing up sounds
booting up ok so since this is the first
time this phone has Buddha the startup
may take a little while right so the
phones booted up there's bugdroid right
there waving at me and setup screen that
we're seeing Korean so let's change the
default language to English ok let's set
this up all right I'll set let's walk
around the interface very briefly and
see what LG has in store for us
the display looks ridiculously sharp and
vibrant you truly have to see this with
your own eyes to appreciate it this is a
4.7 inch screen right here it uses a
true HD IPS + LCD display with screen
resolution of 1280 by 768 pixels the
default home screen wallpaper looks
amazing and colorful the app icon looks
very sharp I haven't seen jitter or lag
yet while swiping between scenes it's
super smooth screen transitions are
buttery very slick so let's find out
what Android version is pulling the
strings here right let's look for the
settings hey aah hey oh it's Android Ice
Cream Sandwich I hate I was initially
expecting Android 4.1 jelly bean in here
because the operating system is buttery
smooth we're hearing though that LG will
be pushing jelly bean to this phone very
soon we just had a quick peek at the LG
optimus G its various now be very smooth
and has an amazingly crisp display stay
tuned for our full review of this
newcomer from LG Electronics remember to
