authority what's going on everybody and
welcome to another edition of android
authority speaks it looks like you guys
really liked our previous our first
edition talking about phone cases but
this time around we do have a pretty hot
topic on our hands and we've had about a
solid week to think about it since the
announcement of the yes Nexus 6 so we're
going to talk to the guys about it i
actually had everybody put together
their thoughts and i'm going to be
putting them together for you we're
going to start off with kevin who
actually put up a long lengthy video on
his own channel and you'll see the link
right over on the corner over here if
you want to watch the full thing but i'm
going to give you the highlights on it
as per kevin suggestions for me the
price is what made the nexus the nexus
you know my argument was for half the
price you're paying for your flagship
phone or for half the price that this
phone is worth I'm getting a phone
that's just as good also that was a
vehicle for a lot of people to get off
their carriers the vehicle for a lot of
people to leave Verizon leave AT&amp;amp;T leave
sprint because hey you can buy phone
outright for 300 bucks for 30 or 50
bucks and you can then go month-to-month
of the carrier and save a lot of money
that's no longer an argument anymore I
can't tell people to leave their carrier
because they're not have a phone anymore
so that's a real killing point and thing
is you can't double the price of the
phone the following year yeah look I
know it's a huge spec boss I know it's a
better phone it's faster it's brighter
has all the bells and whistles yet and
next year would be the same thing so you
can't double the price the following
year that is asinine that's asset NS a--
11 that is ridiculous look let me
looking at the specs you can really see
a difference that the Moto X obviously
does not have the same specs specs that
this nexus 6 hat Nexus 6 is ridiculous
on the specs side of things but I don't
care about specs it's what can you do
with those specs how does the experience
change of these aspects because if you
look at any flexion phone right now the
s5 the inmates the note 4 they all
pretty much run the same the 1+1 throw
that in there too they are
from the same the NEP experiences to say
modern combat asphalt all those games
are going to run exactly the same the
only difference is that the interface
the interface is going to run different
depending on what skin you have on top
of it but the in-app experience is the
exact same they're pushing it towards
carrier so it sounds like they're really
going I hate to say it but they're going
to traditional bow then go in the
traditional route alright so let's talk
about the elephant in the room or rather
the whale that is called Shamu the Nexus
6 is it really too big well let me take
you back to help people first responded
to the samsung galaxy note the first
original phablet walt mossberg who is
then with the wall street journal's all
things D wrote that when you have it
held up to your face you quote look like
you're talking into a piece of toast or
how Rohani robin said the note may be
too big for humans but it's just right
for elephants and other people said
let's just call it what it is a new
widescreen TV so people's memory seems
to get a little bit short because when
the galaxy note came out it was a joke
but within 18 months it became one of
Samsung's most popular phones and it was
only five point two inches and at the
time it was considered huge and now a
5.2 inch display is considered normal so
I gotta say I think saying that the
nexus 6 is too big is a bit premature so
I'm going to talk about what I like
about the nexus 6 and what I don't like
about it so let's go ahead and start
with what I do like about it so one quad
HD display so since its quad HD you know
it's going to be super sharp and look
absolutely gorgeous 2 is the specs
Snapdragon 805 3 gigabytes of RAM so you
know this thing is going to be a beast
when it comes to performance 3 the
battery life it's a 3200 milliamp hour
battery so we're expecting this thing to
last a very long time on a single charge
and hopefully it does for is the build
quality since it's based off of the Moto
X 2014 it's going to have really awesome
build
Levy and five is the most obvious one is
and that is android 5.0 right out of the
box now let's talk about what i don't
like about this phone and there aren't
as many but you guys know it only takes
one for there to be a deal-breaker so
the first reason why I don't like the
Nexus 6 is these sighs I personally
think it's too big I was not wanting a
phablet nexus phone I wanted a no more
than 5.5 inches at the most so the fact
that it's six inches is kind of a deal
breaker to me and even if it has really
thin bezels it's still going to be a
large phone regardless because then
bezels can only help so much and the
larger the screen gets the less of an
impact then bezels have it's kind of a
diminishing return but to the second
reason why I don't like it is the price
and this is probably something that a
lot of people are going to agree with
now I'm not as bothered by it as as MIT
as much as other people are because the
price is definitely justifiable it has
great specs and there's basically no
sacrifices being made on the Nexus 6
like there are like there have been on
previous Nexus devices like the Nexus 5
and the nexus 4 there's no sacrifices
being made here so the price is totally
justifiable and six hundred fifty
dollars is not an outlandish price by
any means it's a pretty average price
when it comes to high-end smartphones a
lot of phones cost six fifty seven
hundred dollars without a contract so
this is a justifiable price but I do
understand where a lot of people are
coming from it's a very jarring jump to
go from 350 to 650 and potentially even
700 if you get the 64 gigabyte model so
I get where people are coming from but
those are basically the two reasons why
I don't like it and that's pretty much
all i have to say about the nexus 6 ok
so my quick thoughts about the nexus 6
it's a huge phone it has awesome specs
and it runs stock Android personally
I've been waiting for this Nexus device
to come out for
a couple of years now um is six inches
too big for me yes it is a little bit
too big for me I use I'm a huge fan of
fabulous too it's not like I walk around
with you know four and a half inch
phones all the time you know I have the
you know the Galaxy Note 3 right now and
I was thinking about upgrading to the
Galaxy Note 4 but you know at 5.5 5.7
you know that's that's kind of like the
upper crust of of what I'm willing to
carry around in my pocket and in my hand
all day so um yeah the Nexus 6 is just a
little bit too big in terms of price
though I think the price is actually
fairly reasonable I mean you look at
every other device that has similar
specs that's the similar size you know
the note 4 is like what 800 bucks you
know you look at the other big huge
phones are coming out the LG g3 and you
know all those other ones and you know
they're also super expensive devices and
they're all actually more expensive than
the nexus 6 I mean you know the nexus 6
comes with a pretty hefty price tag but
the things that it competes with are
more expensive so really you know in my
mind's eye it's still the cheaper option
it's just more expensive than we're used
to seeing out of Google and I think
that's why a lot of people will be
giving it a lot of flak because you know
they were getting ready to fork out 300
400 bucks and Google's asking for 200
more which is still a bargain compared
to all the other stuff but it's you know
it seems like it's less of a bargain
compared to the stuff that google
released last year so those were all of
our guys talking about the nexus 6 maybe
a couple of ramps here and there but all
in all they pretty much summed up
everything that I was thinking about the
nexus 6 but i do want to give you a
couple of the highlights especially if
off the top of my head and also kind of
a thought that I had when it came to the
industry as a whole when considering the
Nexus 6 I do like that the nexus 6 is in
existence it's great to see that the
next program is still going forward but
I feel like it may have lost a little
bit of what it was originally made to do
it was supposed to be somewhat of a
reference device and reference is not a
bad term by any means because it also
allowed for a very easy entry point for
a lot of users with a lower price point
and basically a design that while
attractive was also pretty minimalistic
because it was more about the experience
underneath it's no longer just about the
fact that you have an easy entry point
into a stock Android experience it's
also about having literally the best of
everything
and I know the Nexus 5 at the time was
definitely one of the better phones that
was available it had top top of line
specs but it still came in at a very
reasonable price now when you make a
phone bigger you have to make everything
else bigger we have all of the big specs
quad HD display which is an argument in
and of itself and then finally a 6 inch
size to the phone now big phones are not
really that big of a deal that there's
something that have actually been around
for quite a while and we have a lot of
good examples of them being executed
beautifully like the Samsung Galaxy Note
floor and the huawei ascend made seven
ultimately the nexus 6 kind of stands
alone and that's probably the only
reason why I'm a little bit iffy on it I
wish there was a smaller version of it
maybe an update to the Nexus 5 like like
some of the other guys already said but
ultimately I keep thinking to myself if
there wasn't a samsung galaxy note line
we wouldn't have a nexus 6 and there was
no iPhone 6 plus maybe we wouldn't have
a nexus 6 if there weren't these large
phones that everyone's really just sort
of on this race to make the biggest
phone that everyone can use then the
nexus 6 might be a different phone
honestly I really was hoping that the
Nexus 6 was like the Nexus 5 in terms of
size and general feel and quality except
it was just beefed up the Nexus 5 is
still available and that's perfectly
fine but it's it's kind of weird talking
about the Nexus 6 in the Nexus 5 being
brethren when the next 6 6 is really a
departure from what the Nexus program
originally felt like what the four and
five that includes everything from this
from the size of the phone to the price
when I recommend to people what kind of
phone to get given a certain price range
it's just a little bit disappointing
that I can't recommend the latest Nexus
solely because it's too big in a lot of
different places and that might not be a
very great entry point for a lot of
people out there where the next is it
used to be that so thank you guys very
much for watching and I hope you enjoyed
