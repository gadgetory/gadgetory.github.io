Europe but it comes with a few changes
hey it's Josh of a car from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is the ZTE axon Elite yes you are
looking at essentially the same phone
that we already reviewed in the ZTE axon
but the elite is coming with a few
particular changes underneath the
surface however below the 5.5 inch full
HD 1080p display you get a lot of the
same great high-end specifications
including a Snapdragon 810 4G LTE is
obviously going to be what this phone
will be able to give in terms of mobile
Internet and on the rear that you can
already see the dual rear camera that is
used for depth shots the secondary
camera is of a 1.8 aperture that will
provide some really great depth of field
shots when it does work because it is
software optimized the camera in the
rear itself is a 13 megapixel with a 8
megapixel front facing camera with all
of the modes that you would hope for in
a camera like this that should provide
some pretty good quality and some fun
selfies and even beyond
and from there we also have a 3000
milliamp hour battery and all of the
other features underneath that include 3
gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage that can be expanded
with microSD cards and then of course we
have all of the other connections and
various connectivity options that are
available as well so we're going to
focus on are the main editions in the
elite that will come to the European and
Asian markets but first in design the
5.5 inch display is flanked by two
grilles on the top and bottom that have
this triangular design the pattern that
is kind of the trope of the axe online
but they do provide sound and our dual
front-facing speakers you'll find this
triangle design in a number of different
places on the phone as well however on
the back however instead of just this a
sleek metallic unibody you will still
have some extras on the top and bottom
the top let's say 10th in the bottom
tenth of the phone are now with
leatherette designs it's basically this
faux leather that gives it a somewhat
more executive look that we do think
that it's feels just a little bit out of
place on a phone that was supposed to be
mostly metallic and then of course in
between those elements you're going
have the dual rear facing cameras but
now you also have a fingerprint sensor
yes the ZTE axon Elite is now focusing
on biometric security and the
fingerprint reader is one of the first
places that you'll be seeing that move
over to the voice command now one we did
really show in this demo but you can use
your voice to unlock your phone as well
and the reason why we didn't really show
it was because it was really loud in our
particular area but we can show you is
the sky eye which is basically the I
printed
security measure that is available here
when you set it up now one thing I will
say is that you should probably have
your glasses off when you're using this
and we've seen this in previous ZTE
phones as well it will scan your eyes
using the front-facing camera and make a
print of them so that when you are about
to unlock the phone you just have to
swipe down from the pattern or the pin
lock and you'll be able to have the
phone scan your eyes and since you're
looking at the phone already because we
had scanning your retinas and your eye
pattern you'll be able to just move
right into using the particular phone
it's a pretty unique and a pretty nice
way of unlocking the phone and certainly
makes the ZTE axon elite a little bit
different from the other axons that are
available especially the one that we've
reviewed very recently so really it was
just a look at this European and Asian
version of the ZTE axon that we wanted
to look at its differences and really
see where ZT is putting some of the
features that we do think should have
been coming to the American version but
unfortunately are not going to be doing
so that being said however the ZTE axon
elite is at further enhanced version of
what was already a pretty good offering
from ZTE in their flagship phone and
really we just wanted to bring you this
look at the axon elite so keep it tuned
to Android auto for even more don't
forget to check out the actual review of
this GTE axon so you can see what this
phone is really like and site if it is
for you and then of course the X on the
leave for our European and most of our
Asian audience which you would be able
to see if this is a phone you do want to
have in your respective home countries
nonetheless Kiba tunity r2 and rotary
for even more from Aoife in Berlin as
we're coming to you live from the show
floor here with ZTE</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
