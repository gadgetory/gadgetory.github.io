Hindy the android authority app guy and
it's nearing the end of July which means
it's time to check out the best new
android games from the last month if you
want to check out any of these games for
yourself you can find those links in the
video description below Borderlands 2
was released for android this month and
it should be noted that it was released
solely for Android TV and the Nvidia
shield console in this port you'll get
the classic Borderlands 2 experience in
every way and the port is fairly
faithful on top of the regular game this
port also includes new characters new
classes new areas to explore and more
additional content it's a bit lame that
it's only for Android TV and the shield
console but if you have one of those
this is probably worth the 1499 price
tag Blue Angels aerobatics sim is a
flight simulator that is officially
licensed by the US Navy and this one you
get to pilot a blue Angel and engage
with all of the aerobatic stunts and
flying that you would see during an air
show it features a variety of game modes
including an airshow mode brie can
perform stunts and additive mode where
you can create your own scenarios you
get scored based on how accurate your
flying is and it also features pretty
decent graphics it's free with in-app
purchases CSR racing 2 is the
long-awaited sequel to the intensity
popular CSR racing in this game you'll
be drag racing high-end cars against AI
opponents in order to prove that you're
the best the game has very good graphics
simple controls and a ton of missions
and quests for you to go through it also
features tons of actual cars that you
can buy there is an online component
where you can race others to earn
rewards it's a freemium game through and
through but it's not a bad way to spend
a few minutes if you have time to kill
fear the walking dead dead run is a
unique runner where you must survive
hordes of zombies and stay alive the
game's claim to fame is the ability to
play through various scenarios from the
TV series to see if you would survive
them it adds to the tense atmosphere by
using silhouette graphics you'll have
over 50 weapons to choose from and
you'll be able to play as a variety of
characters from the show it's nothing
groundbreaking but it is pretty fun
Final Fantasy brave XVS is the latest
freemium Final Fantasy game this one was
developed by gumi makers of brave
frontier and you can see the
similarities in gameplay you'll play as
two characters who are trying to stop a
madman from destroying all of the
crystals you'll be joined by memory
spirits from final fantasies past to do
battle with you it's full of final
fantasy fan service but thankfully
mechanics aren't half bad it's worth
picking up if you're a fan of the series
after months of waiting Final Fantasy 7
finally saw its official Android release
earlier this month the game remains
untouched from prior releases and all of
the gameplay elements storyline and even
the graphics are pretty much the same as
they were before it's a rather large
game and will require 4 gigabytes of
space to get it up and running it also
includes some additional options to help
you play through the game faster the
price tag is pretty hefty but there are
no in-app purchases and it's one of the
best JRPGs ever released of course the
cultural phenomenon of the year is going
to be on this list Pokemon go has
already captured the hearts of millions
around the world for those of you who
have been living off of the grid for the
last month Pokemon go is an augmented
reality location-based game you collect
pokemon by going to actual places take
Jim's in various areas and hit up pokey
stops to collect items it's gotten more
people outside than house fires and
health warnings combined and it's
definitely worth a shot the rooms of
doom minion madness is the latest game
out of the same studio that made Crossy
Road this one is an adorable
side-scrolling platformer where you must
help the animals to feed the aptly named
dr. doom it featured the same type of
graphics from prior Yoda one game titles
and the controls are easy enough to
learn it features 12 rooms that you'll
be jumping and moving through along with
25 minion hybrids that you can play with
it's family friendly and tough to finish
which makes it a good game to try The
Suicide Squad Special Ops is a fighting
game where you'll be able to play as
your favorite member of The Suicide
Squad it uses a unique first-person
perspective and you'll be running around
using your special powers to defeat tons
of bad guys your goal is to survive wave
after wave of the bad guys explore the
city to find loot and a lot more there
are also leaderboards to track your
progress and the graphics are pretty
decent it's a fun little time killer
even if it is a freemium game titan
quest finally made its way to android
this last month it's a faithfully made
port by dot emu a company that has a
history of doing good ports of classic
pc games this game is an action RPG
recreated character and explore many
historically significant regions all
over the world it includes many
different creatures items and character
skills that offer up a ton of gameplay
and plenty of character customization

few action RPGs that features no in-app
purchase
