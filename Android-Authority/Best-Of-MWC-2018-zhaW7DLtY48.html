everybody and we're here to take a look
at the best products at Mobile World
Congress here in Barcelona Spain MWC
2018 was an incredible show and we want
to show you what we thought took top
honors here at Mobile World Congress you
know what we should just start off with
the big one the Samsung Galaxy S 9 yes I
have an S 9 plus in my hand right now
but there are a lot of reasons why this
phone gets one of the top honors it
comes with a dual camera on the s9 plus
along with dual aperture in the main
cameras for either of the phones now
that mechanical iris is an incredible
feature something that we see in DSLRs
but now it's something we see unsmoked
of course it comes with all of the same
enhancements you would expect from a
flagship along with a brand new feature
a R emoji which is a new way for you to
express yourself back at CES we did take
a look at a concept phone from vivo that
put a fingerprint sensor underneath the
screen we took a look at that phone
again here at MWC but it had more tricks
up its sleeve
including a pop up camera that is used
to make the bezel as minimal as possible
but still have a front-facing camera for
your selfies this particular phone is a
wonderful concept and we can't wait to
actually see a put into future phones
especially from vivo the Alcatel One X
the Nokia one and the ZTE tempo go while
we're not really giving an award to any
one of these devices but the whole line
of them in Android go Android go
provides an apparatus of Android or EO
that is incredibly lightweight on phones
that are maybe $100 or less what this
proves is that it's possible to have all
the same security features and all of
the same general features in a cheap
smartphone without having to pay an arm
in the leg and that's why we give
Android go one of our awards you might
not have heard the name Nokia in awhile
but they're definitely back and they're
trying to be a major player in the
Android space with the Nokia 8 Sirocco
they have their best foot forward
all of the major specifications you'll
want are here but also a dual camera
setup with a wide-angle
the glass on glass design looks great
and underneath the surface you get
Android one the most stock like version
of Android you can possibly get we
actually think that the Nokia eight kind
of looks like Nokia's play on the Nexus
program so that's one of the reasons why
it's incredibly exciting for us for any
fans out there of truly wireless earbuds
like myself this one might be incredibly
important for you
Qualcomm has added to their qcc 5100
chipset Qualcomm true Wireless Stereo
technology now typically true wireless
earbuds require one of them to receive
the signal from the phone and then
transmit it over to the other earbud
with some delays happening from time to
time it's probably something you're
familiar with but this time both of the
earbuds will be able to receive
information from the chipset so that
they can share the work and then of
course you have left and right stereo
quality machine learning and AI features
that you might be seeing in phones that
get close to $1,000 in the price don't
necessarily have to be a thing of the
future the Helio p 60 by mediatek is
trying to bring a lot of those features
into phones that would end up being
priced around $500 or less that's an
exciting prospect and if AI is going to
move forward it has to be ubiquitous
this is one way to do this one might
seem like it comes out of left field but
the cat s60 one definitely impressed us
it still has the same thermal camera
from last year along with a number of
other tools for those of you who need to
use it in let's say construction
situations like for example plotting the
distance between two points using lasers
on the phone now there's one thing about
the cat s61 that we have to mention it's
using Android Oreo 8.1 out of the box
even the Samsung Galaxy S 9 can't say
that a seuss is not pulling any punches
or in this case any notches with the
zenfone 5 Z now there is a notch at the
top where all of the front-facing bits
are but this has a 19 by 9 aspect ratio
screen where one of the 19 is used
primarily for notifications that's kind
of cool of kind of clever way of making
a notch for an Android phone but you get
a lot of different specifications on top
of that including the snapdragon 845
great amounts of storage great amounts
of RAM and all of the power that you
would want from a phone that is priced
under $500 and that's really what makes
us so excited about this phone don't
worry about all of the AEI stuff that
they're talking about the fact that this
is a sub 500 euro phone
you want to look at and so there you
have it all of our top honors for Mobile
World Congress 2018 here in Barcelona
Spain thank you so much for watching all
of our coverage remember to stick around
we have a lot of content coming
including ones on this right here the
galaxy s 9 so you can stay tuned for
that once again I was Joshua Vergara and

Mobile World Congress because we are
