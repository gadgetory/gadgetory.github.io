us off that they had a brand new piece
of software for their in particular oppo
n3 the old boy m3 already has the
rotating camera and some nice features
underneath including the fingerprint
scanner but their new software update
mostly focused on the camera experience
so with that in mind they also
challenged us to see in the way that we
would if the camera was basically on par
with all of the other flagships or
hopefully beyond so that's exactly what
we decided to do and consuming that this
phone is not even out in America per se
we also wanted to get people's reactions
on the phone itself so not only are we
going to talk to a few people see if
they have an Android phone or even an
iPhone in their pockets maybe they'll
take a picture and we'll take the exact
same photo and see what they think about
the Oppo camera you'll also get their
reactions about the phone itself out
here in the West
I will buy my if I lie if you guys will
bring to him while the company was the
size it work you know I don't they want
to put a case on it because it feels
like I would probably break it off I
just had it without a key oh it's the
same Cameron and rotini I am rockin the
iPhone 6
alright we're testing out the camera
quality and you were you said you'll be
down to take some photos with us yeah so
right behind us is the iconic Viera data
and it's a great picturesque area even
just standing here you can see it in the
background it looks really great why
don't you take a picture of the video
okay and I'll take the exact same photo
and then we'll talk about what the
quality is like it okay you got it
alright massaging get all the way in
there in that Versace there unless I can
get on recession as well as far in is
you're gonna be able to get you can see
that the quality between these two
cameras is actually not too bad I mean
we have a lot of good exposure there and
if we go up to this top part here
still got a nice level of detail they're
still pretty nice but what I did there
actually Steven was closer I was able to
head over here and I took an ultra HD
photo what it did was it took the photo
and superimpose it on itself to create a
sixty-four megapixel photo so if I were
to zoom all the way in I can get really
far in there oh that's awesome
so if you want to get a lot of detail
out of a photo and be able to really see
all of the elements you can really get
far in there yeah it's definitely a lot
clearer there's a lot less caves in this
one over here yeah if you were trying to
get something farther away then it
definitely helped yeah okay you know if
you were trying to do like a panoramic
I'm sure I'm sure that we have a lot
scenes yeah definitely and where is it
from
China China yeah it takes a little long
to low fell yeah Oh ice movie no oh
that's really nice I just knew study
that makes a lot easier yeah cause like
when you use iPhone you're through
yourself and you know we're in Beverly
Hills having a good time I actually do
have my Samsung Galaxy s6 which is not
on the market just yet but I have done
the review on it I do want to see how
the n3 fares against their six so I have
a really nice little shot in front of me
I'm going to go and give that a shot
right now do the same exact thing but in
terms of just the quality and the detail
they do seem a little bit neck-and-neck
there's a little bit more detail in the
Samsung Galaxy s6 one but the entry is
not too far back can do la without
having some in
fresh right now too
that's just my so Chris I really want to
fight
to fit in my pocket can I try and put it
before
pretty cool I like I like the camera
flips when you take a selfie
all right cool
and it's like not that heavy either you
receive the hitch-pin see the between
Oh
same camera news posted around no way
I will admit though like if we're
looking at these photos you did put the
filters on so it's a little bit it's a
little bit closer now okay I do like the
color on the the front-facing camera on
this one on the iPhone but the but
obviously the thing here is because it's
the same camera as the rear just turned
around you have the high resolution
stuff so much it's like so far you can
go so far I can go but at the same time
the photo itself is going to be a lot
larger on this one had the UM the the
Samsung Galaxy s3 okay yesterday
it definitely feels different from that
because this the galaxy feels like
plastic mm-hmm this actually feels a
little more substantial yeah no it feels
durable you I like that you know as
Gashi wasn't that way it cracked my
phone every later so as always thank you
guys very much for watching and I hope
you enjoyed this look at the oppo n3 as
we take it out for a day in beautiful
l.a where I come from really we're here
up in Hollywood Hills ending this video
at the Griffith Observatory but we also
took a look at the phone in Rodeo Drive
taking a few pictures there instead of
just giving you a full on camera
shootout using the new camera software
that oppa put into the n3 we decided to
kind of do something a little bit
different ask people to take pictures
with their phones and then we will
compare it with them and hear what their
reactions are and after that we were
able to get some reactions from people
about the opal entry in general because
it's a phone that's not necessarily out
here in America yet so stay tuned to
android authority for all the best
coverage including even more on the
