tablets that bring a few nice features a
couple interesting accessories and the
company's mixture of fun and work in a
couple of sizes this is Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody and these are
the Lenovo Tab 4 in 8 inch and 10 inch
variety before we get started I should
mention that there are plus editions of
these tablets that trade the textured
backing for full on glass panels this is
a change that while easy on the eyes is
unfortunately not as easy on the hands
the Plus versions with about a bit too
easily making me wish that the textured
material remained throughout regardless
of size the differences in performance
and hardware are basically traded the
same ways the snapdragon 425 powers the
original editions while the plus tablets
upgrade to the snapdragon 625 2
gigabytes of ram goes up to 4 on the
plus and the IPS screens get a
resolution bump from 800 P to 1200 P
those storage in all cases can be
expanded via microSD memory the plus
tablets get 64 gigabytes onboard and the
originals get 16 or 32 internally the
size of the tablet dictates the size of
the batteries and both 8 inch tablets
have 48 50 million power batteries and
the 10.1 inch devices get 7000 million
power units all tablets have the Dolby
Atmos enhancements for their speaker
sets and they sound pretty decent
despite lacking in the low-end at least
in my short tests and though tablet
camera usage is pretty low for the vast
majority of users the original tablets
put two and five megapixels on the front
and back respectively the plus tablets
bump those up to 5 and 8 respectively so
admittedly that is a bit of a mouthful
to remember regarding these tablets but
there is a lot to like about these new
additions of the Lenovo tabloid the
continued move towards specific use case
scenarios what you're looking at now is
a kid's version of the tablet that gets
a bumper case for protection and a
kiddos interface that provides only some
content to the young user in an inviting
leaked cartoonish manner lenovo found in
surveys that a growing group of infants
and children have access to or even
possess their own tablets some people
might call that babysitting but to each
their own
the tablet comes with a cute backing
that can be changed to a few other skins
everyone else however entertainment and
productivity are the main points for
entertainment the HD or full HD displays
quite good even if they are not
exceptional and as mentioned before the
dolby atmos enhancements allow for very
loud mps and audio for productivity a
folding stand and keyboard is available
for getting work done and it operates
somewhat like a sink pad docking working
station using the 10 inch tablet we set
it on the stand and it moved into a
Productivity mode that moved the soft
keys to a taskbar that also houses any
recently used applications a little bit
like Windows the keyboard feels
comfortable enough to type on and the
foldability is a very welcome touch
overall Lenovo continues to bring a lot
to the tablet game a market that even
they admit isn't necessarily booming but
it has its specific and very worthy use
case scenarios as far as price goes the
Lenovo cab 4 in 8 inches is going to
start out 109 dollars while the Plus
edition will be $199 the 10.1 inch
Edition is going to be $149 while the
plus Edition goes for 249 and all of
these tablets are due out in May just in
time for some summer fun and usage keep
it tuned to Android authority for all of
the best here at MWC 2017 in Barcelona
