we hope to find in android phones come
2015 and it's okay I know what you were
thinking cuz i was thinkin it to make me
coffee walk the dog or compose love
poems for my dear wife totally not
playing daddy long legs and starting us
right at the top of the list is battery
life or lack of it there is technology
in the works to charge your device while
it sits in your pocket but is this the
kind of charging that will really answer
our battery woes charging speeds have
been increasing and improved over time
and there's obvious vowing being able to
fully charge your phone within an hour
or less but that still won't solve the
problem of running out of juice to begin
with battery saving software has also
improved as well but maybe the designers
need to be more considerate of power
usage alright so this has got to be one
of the most common complaints in both
the forums and in the youtube comments
and that's about battery life I mean
there seems to be a huge disparity
between innovations in displays and
operating software compared to the
battery life by 2015 we should have
better battery capacity or just smaller
batteries that have more juice in them
or simply operating software that
economize is better on the batteries
that we have you'd think you hope that
our manufacturers will hear our cry when
it comes to batteries alright so second
on our list of hopeful features come
2015 is tougher phones and I'm not
necessarily talking Navy SEAL tough I
may be talking not brownie week this has
been tackled to some extent with Sony
pushing waterproofing or water
resistance into the mainstream the
trouble is is that the general toughness
of our phones have not improved at least
not that much I resent having to slap a
case on my beautifully designed
smartphone I want it naked there are
some great case manufacturers out there
but there's still a reluctant necessity
rather than something to get excited
about you see because we use our
smartphones every day for almost
everything they need to be designed less
as a jewelry accessory and more as a
rugged tool let's hope third up is no
more passwords no more wallets no more
please imagine let your smartphone knows
when you're holding it without you
having to enter a password pin or
pattern biometric finger or I scanning
or voice recognition are all potentially
much more convenient it could even learn
the way you move measure distances
recognize your gait a combination of
factors could make this really secure it
should unlock automatically when you
hold it or lock it up when someone else
tries to unless told otherwise now a lot
of non geeks out there will cry about
the dangers of such a system but this is
coming from people who take cash into a
bank and give it to a perfect stranger
and trust that system I'm sure we can
trust a system that's based on software
and force is flexible displays now we've
seen 80 dipped in the water with regards
to do flexible displays as Samsung and
LG have experimented with curves in the
shape of a samsung galaxy round and the
LG G flex but a very slight curve in the
rigid displayed is not what we've been
waiting for the samsung galaxy note edge
is a real step in the right direction
here's something that is genuinely
innovative it has a strip on the right
edge that can come to life independently
of the main display and offer extra
controls now I'm a little bit on the
fence on this does it not seem a little
bit gimmicky I mean does it offer that
much functionality I'd love to hear from
galaxy note edge owners tell me what you
think in the comments below but I'm sort
of leaning towards it being gimmicky and
tell such time as we can get flexible
displays that either go in our clothing
or wrap around our bodies or somehow
make wearable technology more functional
and less scary and fifth and finally is
Google now and all its possibilities I
am extremely excited about Google's
potential pre-emptive powers of google
now as Google now spans more devices and
potentially has access to more data
about me I'd like it to do more for me
for start it should be able to sync
across devices and update accordingly
when I dismiss something I don't want to
see the same card I swiped away my phone
and again see it on my tablet or desktop
it should be the hard-working personal
assistant that most of us cannot afford
remind me to send a message to a person
without me having to set a reminder tell
me of my favorite band that is playing
close by without me
to search for it how about telling me I
could save money by switching to
so-and-so service or alerting me to a
big discount deal on something it knows
that I want now because of all the crazy
data that Google has on us there are
wonderful possibilities for Google now
but it's a bit disjointed and awkward
right now for example Google knows that
I played badminton at the same place
every time every week and it warns me
hey you know there's extra traffic on
your regular path you may want to start
a little early which is fantastic but at
the same time when Google knows because
of my email that I've purchased
something on amazon it tends to tell me
when the Amazon product has already been
delivered rather than warning me about
that it's been shipped and it's going to
be two or three days that's the kind of
data I should be given that's the kind
of data that it should be able to
provide considering all that it knows
alright so thanks guys what do you think
did I miss something what's a feature
that could be coming in 2015 that you're
looking forward to most you don't forget
about my brother's nandra Josh Joe and
the tech ninja Kevin lon and Chris Gary
Nash all working real hard to deliver
the best android content on the web I
read all my comments and out replies you
can connect with me right here and it
will respond to as many as I can I
should see you next week on Android Q&amp;amp;A
yes I got that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
