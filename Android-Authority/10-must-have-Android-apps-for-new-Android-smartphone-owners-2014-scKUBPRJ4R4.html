Hindy the android authority app guy did
you just get a brand new phone and
you're looking for some awesome apps to
put on it if so you're in the right
place first up is the Android device
manager and for good reason you just got
your new Android device and you should
put at least something on it in case it
gets stolen Android device manager has
developed and maintained by Google and
it's very easy to use it comes with the
basic features like phone finding and
wiping your device if it gets stolen
there are other apps out there with more
features but this is the bare minimum
that everyone should have in device
recovery most Android devices come with
a file manager but they pretty much all
pale in comparison to ES file explorer
this is a full-featured file browser
that lets you view your SD card your
downloads folder and all of the other
folders on your device this is a great
way to stay organized or to find stuff
that you downloaded previously and it's
also totally free Evernote is feature
for feature the most powerful
note-taking app on Android the app is
well designed and it also has
cross-platform support so you can use it
on your PC Mac or even an iOS device if
you have say an iPad the free version is
very solid but if you pick up the paid
version there are a lot more features
that you can take advantage of there are
other more simple options but this is
still great even for jotting down a
quick note google play music has evolved
quite a bit over the last year you can
use this to access music you keep on
your device or you can upload up to
20,000 songs to the cloud and stream
them from there for free if you fork out
the nine dollars and ninety-nine cents
per month you can also have access to
various curated music stations and
you'll have access to pretty much every
track on google play music for free with
the upcoming youtube music key
integration that takes ads out of music
videos on youtube along with other
features this is the music app you
should at least try out for android
google hangouts has also undergone quite
a few changes over the last year with
this application you can message other
hangout users for free enable text
messaging so you can use this
application as your texting app and you
can even do things like call other
hangouts users for free and video chat
with up to 10 people which is also free
since you already have a Google account
which is required to use the google play
store there is no setup required just
download it and go but you may need to
talk some of your relatives into using
it as well I have TTT stands for if this
then that
it is a really unique and fun Android
app using this you can create
connections between applications on your
Android device some popular ideas
include saving photos automatically when
you view them on Instagram or you can
have it save the photo automatically to
Google Drive the possibilities are
virtually limitless and it'll save you a
lot of time it is inevitable that people
will eventually start wondering if they
can connect their phone to their
computer in a way that will let them
check notifications and such on their PC
pushbullet allows you to do exactly that
you can check and even send text
messages see all of your notifications
send files to your phone from your
computer and vice versa and a ton of
other stuff to make working between your
devices easier it's also free and that
makes it a fantastic deal swiftkey under
when a lot of changes this last year and
remains among the most popular and best
keyboards of all time its predictive
text is very good and it does great work
auto correcting once you teach it how
you type there are dozens of themes to
choose from that you can purchase
through in-app purchasing including
material design and some more colorful
and festive themes it's a great
replacement keyboard with a lot of
customization options and it is also
free to do as does a to-do list app that
helps you keep track of the things that
you have to do you can use it to remind
yourself to do anything from grocery
shopping to picking up the kids from
soccer practice and even stuff like
work-related activities it works on a
karma system where you earn points for
doing tasks and you can do stuff like
create repeating tasks and organize them
into different categories it's a
powerful and simple application to help
you stay on track last and certainly not
least is zedge with this application you
could find a metric ton of ringtones
notification tones alarm tones and
various wallpapers the ones that came on
your device are probably pretty good but
more is always better you can find stuff
from all kinds of sources like movie
quotes funny stuff and various sound
effects the wallpapers are updated
frequently and feature all sorts of
stuff ranging from holiday and seasonal
wallpapers to art landscapes and space
it's an application that everyone should
check out once again I'm Joe Hindy from
