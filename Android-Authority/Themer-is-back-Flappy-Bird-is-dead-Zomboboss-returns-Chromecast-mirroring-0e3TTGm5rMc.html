Friday which means it's time for another
episode of Google Play weekly this week
we're going to talk more about the
pebble app the triumphant return of
femur and the triumphant demise of
flappy bird without further ado let's
get started the continuous back and
forth between couche and google /
chromecast functionality has been
nothing short of enjoyable to watch it
appears now that couch can now mirror
android devices using the chromecast he
released a video which we're showing you
right now that shows him mirroring his
android device to his television the app
is called mirror and for the time being
root access is required because it needs
higher level permissions to use although
couche has stated that he's working on
making it work without root as well
details are scarce so things like an
official release date or when it will
come without root is currently unknown
however you can get access to this
application by joining the clockworkmod
community joining the mirror beta and
then you can download it from there so
if you have root access and you're
curious check the written companion in
the video description and we'll have a
link to the instructions last week we
talked about the pebble appstore and why
it was released on beta this week we
found out why a pebble engineer went on
record with a blog post over at pebbles
official blog to kind of clear up the
rumors and explain in detail why iOS got
an official release while Android
remained in beta the answer according to
the engineer is the pebble app requires
a lot of resources to run including
Bluetooth and internet access and that
it takes some time to get it right on
Android he goes on to explain that
because there are thousands of Android
devices and at least 27 versions of
jelly bean alone that the developers
have to optimize the app a number of
different ways in order for everyone to
get a good experience in other words
fragmentation is to blame which makes
sense because fragmentation is androids
biggest problem there is still no
release date or an official release but
hey they are working on it the
increasingly popular themer application
was pulled from the play store this week
after apple cried foul about one of
their applications and then it came back
the theme in question called 7 actually
did look a lot like iOS 7 so we can see
why Apple complained about it we don't
agree but we can see why following the
complaint the app was pulled from the
Google Play Store which as you can
imagine caused a lot of understandable
anger at Apple since then themer has
rectified the issue and the app has been
allowed to come back to the Google Play
Store we imagine the offending theme
probably been removed and everything
else runs as its supposed to frankly I'm
cool with it because who really wants
their Android device to look like iOS 7
anyway it's by far the worst looking iOS
this next piece of news is among the
happiest news I've been able to bring
you all here and that is flappy bird is
dead even though the developer was
making more every day than the average
person makes in nearly two years he
decided that enough was enough early
reports indicated that he was just tired
of the pressure and later reports
confirmed that the game upset his quote
unquote simple life the developer whose
name is dong apparently wants to creep
back into the shadows with a mountain of
cash as promised the game is no longer
available but unfortunately it has
spawned a number of copycats one of
which currently holds a top 5 spot in
Google play's top new games and it's
called clumsy bird so even though the
official fad is over the essence of
flappy bird will be around pretty much
indefinitely thankfully the copycats
haven't garnered the same amount of
success or attention as the original our
last bit of news actually took place
late last week in a move that made total
sense google has renamed the Google
Experience launcher at the Google now
launcher along with the name change came
a fuller launcher experience when you
first activate the launcher it will now
import your home screen settings from
your old launcher and it simply acts
more like a full-blown launcher rather
than something that was pulled off of
another phone this lends credibility to
the rumor that the launcher will be made
available to the masses sooner than
later our own robert triggs took a
second glance at it and reported that
the experience is not altogether unlike
the first one there are setup steps now
but the launcher pretty much acts like
it did before simply with fewer bugs
this means the same strengths and
weaknesses apply for the time being if
you want to install it check the written
companion but we'll have a link to the
instructions this one wants to see some
trending applications as usual if you
want to check any of these applications
out you can find the links in the
written companion which is in the video
description slam dunk 2 is a new game
where you slide your finger across the
screen to toss the basket ball into the
basket it's a simple game so if you're
into more hardcore gaming you may not
like this title but if you're more into
casual gaming this will probably be more
your speed the entire game is online
multiplayer so you're always facing
other people it comes complete with
achievements and unlockable content and
we have our official review linked at
the end of this video plants vs. zombies
2 got an update this last week that
added
new content there is a new power up
called snowball power that freezes
zombies and the more exciting news is
they brought back dr. zomboss in a new
level that's themed after ancient Egypt
if you haven't picked up this game yet
we recommend you give it a shot it is
free the time pin is a genius little
application that probably provides more
security to your phone than any lock
screen we've seen in a long time here's
how it works time pin will change your
lock screen pin based on what time it is
so at 730am the code will be 0 7 30 at
seven-thirty 1am the panel 2 07 31 thus
it's always changing and it's always
different there are also options
available to make it more difficult to
guess like putting the numbers in
reverse order and adding more numbers if
you use a lock screen pin you should
definitely check this one out next up is
a potentially helpful application if you
have diabetes called the aad ii diabetes
goal tracker the premise for this app is
simple it helps diabetics keep track of
all the things they need to do to remain
healthy with diabetes this includes
medication eating habits exercise and a
whole lot more you can share goals and
see the goals of others if you have
diabetes is worth looking into this to
see if it can help you path is an
up-and-coming social network it allows
for posting sharing and checking in like
all of the other popular networks and
the Android app has recently been
updated to include video supports you
can now take up to 30 seconds of video
on any device running Android 4.0 and up
and post them to your path profile the
app is already well-regarded and the
network is getting more popular so it
can't hurt to check it out right well
that about does it for this week once
