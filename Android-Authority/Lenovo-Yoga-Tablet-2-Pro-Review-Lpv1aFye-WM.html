andrew authority and when it comes to
pro tablet it's a relatively niche
market there aren't exactly a whole lot
to pick from but if you happen to be one
of the few that are on the lookout for
one this particular tablet might be one
to consider the name is kind of a
mouthful but let's go ahead and take a
look at the Lenovo yoga tablet 2 pro the
first thing I noticed when I got the
yoga tablet 2 Pro is that it's big I
don't mean big in a bad way it's big in
a really awesome way but you sort of
expect it to be big since its carrying
the pro name so if a big tablet is what
you want then a big tablet is what
you're going to get it is pretty thin
though - the cylinder at the bottom and
while the size can be a little awkward
at times it feels great in the hands
despite being made mostly of plastic
this definitely isn't a one handed
tablet nor is it the most portable so
don't try carrying it around with one
hand or traveling with it without a book
bag the physical hardware is what really
makes this tablet interesting this is a
yoga tablet after all and it wouldn't be
a yoga without the built-in kickstand
this is one of the few parts of the
tablet that is made of metal and the
weight of it really keeps the tablet in
place when it's propped up there's also
a button to release the kickstand that
you didn't get on previous yoga tablets
making it a lot easier to open and
hidden underneath that kickstand is a
microSD slot for up to 64 gigs of
additional storage with the kickstand
comes a few different positions that you
can prop the tablet and you might
already be familiar with them if you've
used a yoga tablet in the past there's
these stand positions that props it up
at a relatively steep angle which is the
best position for watching videos and
movies but I did find it really hard to
hit the power button in this mode
without making the tablet slide all over
the place so a tap to wake feature would
have really come in handy here then
there's the tilt position or what I like
to call the all-purpose position it's a
much smaller angle so you can pretty
much do anything here like type play
games watch videos browse the web and
whatever else you normally do on a tap
with the revamped kickstand lenovo has
introduced a new position called hang
and as you can see the kickstand now has
a hole in it and I'm not exactly sure
where or what you would hang it on I
personally did not have anything in my
house to take advantage of it and the
example that Lenovo likes to give is a
coat rack so I guess if you have a coat
rack you can hang it on that or you have
one of those hanging pot things in your
kitchen I don't know what it's called
you can hang it there too for like
recipes and stuff but personally I think
it's more gimmicky than anything else
and it's probably one of the least
useful positions on this tablet but it's
there if you want to use it and if you
don't want to use it you don't have to
use it if Lenovo yoga tablets weren't
unique enough there is now a pico
projector that lives on the right side
of the tablet 2 Pro to further take
advantage of the kickstand right above
the projector is the projectors power
button and towards the back is a
physical slider to adjust the focus the
projector is powerful enough to project
up to a 50 inch image before the quality
starts deteriorating so this isn't going
to replace your home theater or anything
but it can be pretty useful for
presentations or sharing movies videos
and photos with your friends without
having everyone huddle around the screen
if you're going to consume a lot of
media on this tablet especially with
that projector you're going to want
great sounding audio to go along with it
and the tablet 2 Pro certainly has that
on the front you're going to find 21.5
watt speakers flanking the left and the
right sides of the kickstand and a 5
watt JBL subwoofer on the back they're
quite loud with great highs and mids and
possibly some of the best speakers you
can get on a tablet right now obviously
having them on the front doesn't hurt
either and it just makes consuming media
that much better
the display is the main reason why the
yoga tablet 2 pro is as large as it is
you're looking at a 13.3 inch LCD with
quad HD resolution and it's pretty
amazing to look at it's bright and vivid
colors are very saturated viewing angles
are nice so it's a really high quality
panel at 221 PPI you might assume it's
not all that sharp especially if you
compare it to smaller tablets with
higher ppi s but don't think of it so
much as a large tablet think of it more
as a laptop without a keyboard and if
you compare it to most laptop displays
the PPI is actually quite high since
it's a much larger display than most
other tablets you're not going to be
holding it quite as close to your face
either
so pixels aren't as noticeable as you
might think regardless this is one of
the most enjoyable displays that I've
gotten to use on a tablet gaming on it
is a lot of fun although depending on
the game it could feel a little bit
awkward but even then it's still pretty
awesome the internals are a little bit
different from most other Android
devices but different isn't always a
good thing instead of the usual
Snapdragon processor the tablet tube pro
is being powered by an Intel Atom
processor with 2 gigs of RAM it is a
quad core chip clocked at 1.8 6
gigahertz so it sounds good on paper but
it doesn't perform nearly as well as
you'd want it to it opens apps quickly
and plays graphically demanding games
just fine but it's the small things
where you'll notice a lot of performance
hiccups animations can appear very
jittery scrolling through webpages is
choppy and there's even a wake lag that
happens fairly often when pressing the
power button the projector is also a
resource hog so all this is accentuated
even more when the projector is turned
on it's kind of hard to pinpoint why the
tablet 2 Pro has such a hard time
keeping up but all those pixels that are
being pushed by that 2k display
Lenovo's choice of processor and
possibly the lack of software
optimization could be to blame hopefully
it's more software than hardware because
it's kind of disturbing to see an
Android device in 2014 lag from
something as simple as swiping through
home screens if you absolutely have to
take a faux
on your tablet lenovo did include a
camera on the back it's an 8 megapixel
sensor and like most tablet cameras it's
probably nowhere near as good as the
camera on your phone the interface is
very simple straightforward and easy to
use with just the most basic of
functions like panorama and macro you
get a big and spacious viewfinder to go
along with it but it's just awkward and
embarrassing to use in public the
autofocus is also extremely slow taking
about 2 to 3 seconds for it to grab onto
something so you're not going to be able
to rapidly fire off shots but you most
likely won't be too impressed by the
photos you do take photos look dark and
dull colors are washed out details are
soft and full of noise and it's even
less reliable in nighttime or low-light
situations it's not a camera that you're
going to feel very confident about but
if you're in a pinch and this happens to
be the only camera you have on you then
it will do the job just fine but I
wouldn't expect much more than that
if you've watched my previous tablet
reviews in the past you'll know that I
primarily only use them for gaming and
watching youtube videos so I guess you
could say that I'm a heavy user when it
comes to tablets so it's a 9600 milliamp
hour battery which sounds about right
for a tablet this size and I will get a
day out of it with about 5 hours of
screen on time so it's not the best
battery life that I've experienced on a
tablet I've used tablets in the past
I've lasted a lot longer but these
tablets were generally smaller with much
lower resolution displays so considering
the size of the display and the quad HD
resolution I would say the battery life
is adequate and if you're a much lighter
user you only you don't really game or
anything like that I would expect to
charge it every two to three days also
if you plan on using the projector a lot
for something like movies one and a half
to two movies is the most you will get
out of it I think lenovo really nailed
it with the majority of the hardware but
the software doesn't do that great of a
job at taking advantage of it it's
running on Android 4.4 KitKat with
lenovo's own custom skin that looks and
feels similar to an OS made by a fruit
company it's flat and colorful with a
lot of transparencies and there's also
no aperture
or so you'll have to use folders if you
want to keep your home screens looking
clean the biggest problem with Nova's
skin is not its appearance it's the lack
of optimization for the 13.3 inch
display and what they screen the size of
a small laptop you should be able to see
more and do more you can obviously fit
more widgets and shortcuts on your home
screens but if it's going to carry the
pro name it needs to be more than just
an extra large tablet the notification
shade for example is just blown up to
fit the entire display and you're not
getting anything extra out of it the
recent apps menu is also disappointing
because you're limited to seeing only
three apps at a time and this doesn't
matter whether you're in landscape or
portrait I do however like the slide up
panel from the bottom that gives you
access to commonly used settings and a
brightness slider but outside of that
there's not much that Lenovo got right
here there's a multi window feature that
lets you put up to 4 apps on the screen
at one time but right now you're limited
to only a handful of apps and the
majority of Lenovo's own apps aren't
utilizing the display to its fullest
potential in portrait mode the
calculator app is just a blown up
calculator and in landscape you do get a
few more functions but not nearly as
much as you might think for a display
this large then there's Lenovo's gallery
application there's just a ton of wasted
space and without a split view the app
looks like it was made more for a phone
than a tablet the same can be said about
the weather app you've got your current
weather and five-day forecast but that's
all you get
I could see potential for other
information being shown here like an
extended forecast a temperature graph
and other information like wind speed
and humidity because if I can get that
information from a weather app on my
phone there's no reason why I shouldn't
be able to get that on a tablet since
this is all software related it's a
relatively easy fix and I hope Lenovo
gets more creative with their apps and
their custom skin in general because
these software it's what's going to make
or break the user experience not the
hardware the yoga tablet 2 Pro is
available directly from Lenovo for $500
which is a pretty fair price for a
tablet of this size it's Wi-Fi only at
the moment but we should see an LTE
model coming soon which will most likely
cost an extra
50 to $100 but that is going to do it
for the Lenovo yoga tablet 2 Pro there's
no doubt that lenovo has built an
Android tablet with fantastic hardware
and they're continuing to push the
boundaries when it comes to design now
they just need the software to
complement it and if they optimize their
software better they will have a truly
amazing and powerful tablet on their
hands that's deserving of the pro name
but as of right now it's just an
oversized Android tablet as always guys
