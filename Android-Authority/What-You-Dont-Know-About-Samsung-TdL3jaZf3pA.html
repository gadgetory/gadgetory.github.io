brought to you by Atlassian build what's
next
Samsung was destined for greatness from
day one or at least its founder thought
so the company's name choice reflected
this ambition built from the Korean
words Sam 3 and some stars and the tri
symbol is said to culturally represent
something like big numerous and powerful
at its founding this was a pretty bold
claim from a company that was nothing
more than 40 employees dealing in
locally grown produce and in the
creation of noodles since then though
Samsung has certainly found its way into
more than just noodles which leads us
into another interesting fact samsung is
made up of around 80 different companies
and has employees numbering over three
hundred and seventy thousand people
these companies range from construction
to financial services shipbuilding and
even medical while the Samsung logo
changed a few times prior to the 70s
after this it pretty much stayed the
same changing only three times until the
current logo was settled on in 1993 if
it isn't broke why fix it Samsung
Electronics as we know it really began
with a major philosophy shift in 1993 it
was in 1993 that Samsung's Chairman Lee
kun-hee pushed forward a new management
philosophy which encouraged product
quality as its number one core tenant in
fact he encouraged his staff to quote
change everything except for their
family Samsung's Human Resource
Development Center created new training
and development courses to help with
this professional growth the Samsung
sh100 was released back in 1996 making
it the very first phone to utilize CDMA
technology in retrospect being the first
one to use a standard that many see as
restrictive and inferior to GSM probably
isn't much of a bragging right today but
at the time CDMA was new technology and
in the days before 4G and LTE
technologies actually had some real
advantages over GSM Samsung was the
first to pioneer a watch that also
doubled as a phone this bad boy was
dubbed the samsung SP hwp 10 and this
unique watch could not only tell time
but it could make phone calls for up to
90 minutes after that the battery would
be depleted and you'd have to use a
charger now Samsung may not have been
the first to make a smart phone by any
means but they were one of the first
players to truly get aggressive about
the market and introduced the first PDA
phone with a color display in the US
market in 2001 it was called the SPH eye
300 and this bad boy was designed for
Sprint network users and rammed palm
Iowa
the key to a winning product is quality
right well quality helps but marketing
plays a massive role sometimes more
important than the quality of the
product itself you could have a great
product but if no one knows about it
then it just doesn't matter and Samsung
spends a lot of cheddar to stay at top
how much we talking about well in 2013
it was around nine billion dollars and
it certainly isn't getting any lower
today unleash your team's potential with
Atlassian's collaboration software so
you can work and communicate better
together a sign track and manage tasks
for any project no matter how complex
that's the clarity of JIRA creating
share content organize results and bring
team members up to speed that's the
flexibility of confluence now what I
especially like about Atlassian is that
it doesn't force you to communicate with
your team in one way if it's too tedious
to type at a conversation in a chat box
you can do video chat that's a good
thing that's Atlassian comm unleash the
potential of your team build what's next
now do you know of an interesting fact
about Samsung that we left out if so
please leave it in the comments below
we'll be reading them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
