handy the Android authority app guy have
you just received your first Android
phone confused on which apps to get well
after the intro will show you our
recommendations for 10 apps that all
Android phones should have if you're at
all interested in what's going on in the
news you'll need a good news aggregator
our staff picked feedly is the number
one option and there's a reason why
because it's awesome it's functional and
it looks really good
it's back-end is also called Normandy
and we think the world could use more
Mass Effect references you can make it
look like Flipboard but act like Google
Reader if you're new to Android this is
a great way to customize your news
experience but even if you've been here
for a while it's still a really good app
to use if you're looking for something a
little more flashy our runner-up in this
category was Flipboard and cloud storage
is where mobile storage is headed anyway
so it doesn't hurt to already have this
set up for when it inevitably happens
our staff picked for cloud storage was
Dropbox the reason for this is that it's
Dropbox and it's already one of the best
cloud storage services out there you can
set your device to auto upload to
Dropbox for things like photos so you're
already backed up if something goes
wrong there's an initial limit to how
much storage you can have but through
occasional promotions you can actually
increase this storage free of charge a
runner up in this category is the
equally awesome Google Drive music
streaming is all the rage these days and
Spotify is one of the best music
streaming apps out there you can use it
for free if you don't mind suffering
through a few ads or you can get a paid
subscription for all the music you can
listen to ad free you can download songs
for offline mode listen to single tracks
or create radio stations it has a simple
interface and even some social
networking built in if you use Facebook
don't worry though as you can still use
the app even if you don't have a
Facebook if you're planning on making
your Android phone and all Google
experience our runner-up in this
category was Google Music everyone takes
notes one way or another and Google keep
was our staff pick for the note-taking
app everyone should have it has a dead
simple yet colorful and fun interface
where you can take all the notes you
want to supplement this you can sign in
to drive.google.com backslash key if you
want to access all your notes on a
computer we've reviewed this app a
handful of times already so our longtime
fans may think we're beating a dead
horse here but we really can't rave
enough about keep it simple
it's powerful it sings to computers what
more could you possibly need in a
note-taking app if you want something a
little more complex our runner-up in
this category was Evernote mobile
devices have become so powerful that
light gaming is really no big deal
anymore when we recommend light gaming
the votes went to Angry Birds it's a fun
addicting game that's already well known
the world over on top of that there are
six Angry Birds games to choose from
seven if you count bad piggies it's
really hard to argue with a billion
downloads so we didn't really try every
game follows the same basic simple
premise and there are hundreds of levels
to play and master if Angry Birds just
isn't your thing our runner-up was
Temple Run or Temple Run like games such
as one epic night consequently mobile
devices have also become so powerful
that heavy gaming is no big deal there
are a lot of big-name titles to choose
from and we chose dead trigger it's a
free first-person shooter where you can
mow down zombies really who can't get
into that the controls are a little
complicated but you get used to them
over time and the game is easy enough to
be fun while remaining difficult enough
to be challenging if you want to try
something different a surprising number
of our staff recommended PlayStation and
64 SNES and other console emulators
everyone takes pictures and photography
is a pretty widespread profession and
hobby lots of people do it and if you
want to do photography on your Android
device you'll need a photo editing app
our choice was Snapseed because it's
powerful easy and best of all free you
can apply a lot of filters and edit in a
number of different ways this isn't as
powerful as computer image editing of
course but it's definitely among the
best if you're in a pinch or on the go
if you want something a little more
hands-on our runner-up was photoshop
touch creating editing and sharing
documents is pretty common these days
with smartphones and tablets so if you
want to keep up you'll need an app that
can do that our staff pick was Google
Drive the reason is simple it's solid
it's stable it's free and if you're a
fan of consolidation it can also double
as your cloud storage you can only
create spreadsheets and documents in the
mobile app however these can be shared
with anyone edited in real time by
anyone has been shared with and it has
all the tools necessary to create a
really good document if you need more
features like presentations we recommend
office suite pro like note-taking more
and more people are using their mobile
devices to keep track of the stuff they
have to do so a good task management app
can help turn your hectic day into
something a little more manageable for
this we recommend Wonder
it's everything you need in a task
management app you can create new tasks
add sub tasks and even organize them in
various categories so if you have a work
folder a home folder a vacation folder
etc you can really keep track of your
day pretty well you can even sign up for
an account for additional features if
Wunderlist just isn't what you're
looking for our second recommendation is
tasks by team tasks last and certainly
not least is shopping we buy things all
the time online these days so why not do
it from your smartphone for this we
recommend Amazon its giant selection
above average reliability and solid
mobile app make shopping on your
smartphone easy and enjoyable you can do
pretty much all the basic tasks you can
on the website you can order stuff you
can track packages you can browse around
search for products change or one-click
buy settings and much more if you don't
like Amazon or your country doesn't have
it available our second pick was eBay
here is everything so you can take a
look again usually we do a leaderboard
but comparing apps to perform different
tasks is comparing apples to oranges so
we didn't bother with this one if you
want to check them out the links are in
the video description usually our app
lists are based on things like
popularity Play Store ratings and other
factors this time that is not the case
these apps are what we recommend based
on how our staff voted so if you think
there's an app that should have been
mentioned that wasn't feel free to leave
us a comment and let us know
once again I'm Joe Hendy the Android
