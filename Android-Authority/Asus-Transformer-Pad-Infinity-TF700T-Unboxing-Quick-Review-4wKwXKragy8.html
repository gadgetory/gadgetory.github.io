Clayton Youngberg coming at you as
always from Android authority calm your
number one source for all things Android
today we're pleased to bring you an
unboxing of the Asus Transformer Pad
Infinity this is the model number TF 700
T and we're also going to be unboxing
this mobile dock so let's just get into
the unboxing of the Transformer Pad
Infinity here now the TF 700 T is gonna
be what is phasing out the transformer
prime this is the high-end tablet from
Asus now as tablets coming at us with a
super IPS display that is LCD we've got
our 64 gigabyte version we'll take the
tablet out of the box and we can just
read some of these specifications on the
side here so you see we're rockin
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich
we're also rocking our full HD display
now this has a resolution of 1920 by
1200 this has the super IPS plus so it
has ultra bright colors it's coming in
at 600 nits we've got a quad-core Tegra
3 processor this is Packingtown
Corning's Gorilla Glass 2 we've got an 8
megapixel camera on the rear and we've
got a 1.2 megapixel in the front we also
have the a satanic master technology and
we have a pretty large battery in this
let's open it up as you can see we have
our brushed metal on the back now that's
a 1 key indicator that this is a Souza's
top-of-the-line tablet is the brushed
metal now it's really us dirty actually
from surprised at the durability and
then we have our actual holes right here
for our speaker on the bottom we've got
our little slits for the mobile keyboard
dock as well as our connector pin for
charging here's our camera LED and our
small microphone got our power button in
the top right here and our volume
rockers right there take our little info
off there and we'll power the device up
now while the device is powering up
we'll check out what's in the rest of
the box we've got one flap here within
this flap is our information we've got
our Asus tablet warranty card and then
our user manual North in the user manual
basically just shows you how to use the
tablet obviously we're not going to be
checking that out
put this back now we have our cleaning
cloth at asu's kindly packs in the box
also got our AC adapter and our charging
cable very handy now one note about
these asus tablets a lot of them don't
often work with other AC adapters I've
tried with other AC adapters with the
original connector here and it just
doesn't work you need to use these and
there's sometimes I'll faulty AC
adapters I've heard about that so just
be wary guys now once we powered the
tablet on we can see we have our
beautifully bright IPS panel we have our
super IPS plus mode which we can turn
off and then we can simply choose our
brightness so this is full brightness
without the IPS plus on and then we
press the IPS plus and we do have even
more visibility for outdoor viewing
situations we can go to our settings
right from here we're rocking the
Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich and
we've got the Asus overlay atop that but
the overlay doesn't actually provide too
much bloating or you know gaudy looks or
anything like that is pretty nice and it
sticks to AOSP very well in my opinion
going into our apps here we do have a
few packed from Asus such as a globe all
in the Tegra gaming zone to demonstrate
the Tegra 3 s gaming and processing
abilities we've got the asus v 2 a
blocker app backup we can go through we
got our widgets we got some cool a seuss
widgets like the task manager the
battery we've got the my zine which is a
basically a aggregator for all your
social networks and stuff like that and
just the basic stock Ice Cream Sandwich
experience we've got our recent app
windows and stuff now this feels really
great in my hand it feels a lot better
than the TF 300 T will bring that
side-by-side here in just a second now
will also open up our mobile keyboard
dock while we have this handy we'll just
remove the plastic
so here is our mobile pad dock this is
gonna differ from the other mobile pad
docks and that it is the brushed
matching aluminum very nice-looking we
have our little information in here as
well some owners manual for the dock now
the dock itself has a battery inside and
it boosts the longevity and the life of
the TF 700 t we go ahead and we just
lock it in the keyboard dock just like
that once it's locked in we have our
little slider that we can slide to the
left release and we slide to the right
and we also get our sound notification
that the ASOS is in the keyboard dock
now the hinge is really great it feels
awesome it doesn't have too much give or
too much slack and it closes just
perfectly nice clamshell design you can
see right here we have our charging
indicator and our connector we have
access to all our ports on the actual
asus including our micro SD our h mini
HDMI out and then our headphone jack
we've got our small mics over here hinge
is constructed very very well all of the
colors match nola gonna we're going to
be doing a side-by-side comparison and
head-to-head smackdown but this is the
Asus TF 300 T and this is the TF 700 T
as you can see they're both pretty
similar but the 300 T is this a little
bit more bulky not as sexy not as sleek
and slender and we can move it on our
sides just like that bring it up like
this another quick mention is that
there's no LED or mic here on the TF 300
T there's a lot more weight in the TF
700 T the back of the tablet is a little
heavier so it's a lot nicer it's not
going to tip over it is easy when you're
actually viewing this we're having a set
on a surface we've also got a different
pad here for Mouse control as well as
different click functionality
let's remove this one it feels really
solid in the keyboard dock like this and
it's gonna be a joy to use just great
profile great ergonomics great looks and
of course awesome performance from a
suits and the TF 700 T so stay tuned for
a full review guys we always get one of
those after I've had enough time with
the tablet to work out the pros and cons
but check back in you guys we got plenty
more where this is coming from and also
drop us a line for requests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
