CES that's ok cuz we got a lot of CBS
goodness just for you and right off the
top we got to talk about the bad boy
that stole the show and that was the LG
G flex 2 the LG G flex 2 has a 5.5 inch
1080p display the latest flex iteration
is powered by a Snapdragon 810 64-bit
octa-core processor with an Adreno 430
GPU making the G flex 2 the first soon
to be widely released device to offer
Qualcomm's latest processing package in
addition to the killer chipset the phone
will come with either two or three
gigabytes of RAM depending on whether
you choose the 16 or 32 gigabyte storage
configuration for this device regardless
of what model you get the G flex 2 also
brings a microSD card slot with
recognition for cards up to two
terabytes no that's not a typo two
terabytes so the Flex to got a lot of
attention at CES both from our own team
and from pocket now and they did a tango
team video you can check that out in the
links below but what do you guys think
is the LG G G flex 2 going to be the
flagship to beat now let's talk about a
phone that most of you may not know that
much about and it's called the Sega's v2
and it's also storage happy starting
with a five-point inch 1080p display the
Sega's v2 packs a snapdragon 801 2.5
gigahertz quad-core processor with 3
gigabytes of RAM and runs android 4.4
point for KitKat now it also has a 21
megapixel rear camera with a dual flash
and a 13 megapixel front shooter as well
it comes with a fingerprint scanner and
wireless charging also a nice touch
focusing on the media side sound comes
to you out of a Harman Kardon speaker
and you won't have any trouble taking
your media along for the ride with the
support for a total of up to 320
gigabytes of storage space now I know
that many of you were really a
seddie to hear about the new Snapdragon
810 processor but it turns out that
there may be some overheating issues
according to sources from Korea and
analysts with the US investment firm JP
Morgan the Snapdragon 810 is suffering
from crippling overheating issues
apparently this problem is caused by the
high performance cortex a57 cores they
overheat when reaching clock speeds of
1.2 to 1.4 gigahertz this then causes
the chip to throttle back on performance
attempting to prevent the whole system
from overheating now I know what some of
you may be thinking because I'm thinking
it too what is an investment firm like
JP Morgan doing investigating technical
issues like this now sony has come up
with what they hope will be an audio
files dream it's their new walkman no
not that walkman this one the new
walkman is an android-powered device
with a 4-inch triluminos touch screen
Wi-Fi Bluetooth NFC the 128 gigabyte of
internal storage is matched by a microSD
expansion slot and battery life that is
projected the last 60 hours while
playing mp3 titles down to 33 hours when
playing higher res audio audio support
is an exhaustive list including the most
popular audio formats that are not
protected by copyright now to be clear
this is for audio geeks only people who
demand the highest level of audio
quality and boy they're going to pay for
it to guess how much not three or four
hundred dollars not even a thousand
dollars twelve hundred dollars for
sony's new walkman wow thanks for
