no stopping same song the galaxy s7 has
been such a great success for them for
ZTE though they're still trying to make
a name for themselves here in the US and
they're about to launch their latest
high-end smartphone hey guys John Vee
here with Android Authority and this is
a quick video comparison between the ZTE
axon 7 and the Samsung Galaxy s7 they're
two totally different looking smart
phones these eto axon 7 goes for the
metal approach the full unibody metal
design and looks really nice feels quite
substantial in the hand this is
significant upgrade over last year's
design and we definitely like the way
it's the way it looks and feels but on
the other hand the samsung galaxy s7
goes for also a premium edge might not
be as premium feeling has the all-metal
design of the ZTE axon 7 when you
combine into glass and metal trim bezel
design it's pretty nice on the hand and
same time to the s7 is a little easier
to handle with one hand but we should
note that the s Evan continues to be one
of the few flagship devices out there to
feature a water-resistant construction
now quick look here the displays are
amazing both handsets they both employ
AMOLED technology you have a 5.1 inch
quad HD Super AMOLED display in the
galaxy s7 versus the larger 5.5 inch
wide HD AMOLED display in the ZTE axon
seven now from a normal distance they're
both exceptionally detailed vibrant
great viewing angles it's tough to say
which one here is superior but we should
note that the display of raw and NBCT
axon 7 is actually coming from Samsung
it's honestly toss-up when it comes to
the Android experience on both handsets
now either one will suffice just depends
on which one you live with the galaxy s7
of course you can have touch with some
people like it some people don't but
it's incredibly deep with its set of
features you have things like true
multitasking you have a one handed mode
and so forth now
more of more interested in a stock like
experience the ZTE axon 7 has that has
more of that with it
so you might find that a little more
straightforward easier to learn but at
the end a it's just going to be a matter
of preference the ZTE axon 7 runs pretty
fast
it's utilizing the latest chipset from
its Qualcomm the Snapdragon 820 with 4
gigabytes of RAM with the galaxy s7
depending on which one you get you'll
either have the latest Exynos octa-core
processor or the Snapdragon 820 with 4
gigabytes of RAM now just quickly look
into handsets they're both pretty
effective and responsive with basic
tasks so it's really hard to say which
one's going to do better in the long run
by now the galaxy s7 has built this
reputation for being one the best one
comes to snapping photos with its 12
megapixel camera and at 1.7 aperture
lens it's fast and take some detailed
images and it's also pretty good under
low lighting conditions with the ZTE
axon 7 they slap a 20 megapixel camera
in the back there with an F 1.8 after
lens optical image stabilization you
have phase detection autofocus and they
say it's going to be good also for low
lighting situations you're going to have
pretty much the same set of shooting
modes and you also have manual controls
from both you might find just a little
bit more shoot modes with the ZTE axon 7
but we're curious to see how actually
fares against Samsung's best the bone to
beat so far this year is the galaxy s7
it's just a feature-rich phone great
performance and you can get things in it
that people don't find in other devices
like a water-resistant construction the
built in wireless charging and then
heart rate sensor on the back but don't
to count up the ZTE axon 7 because you
know it's going to probably come in at a
lower price point and you still have
some good features in it like being
unlocked it's going to have some support
for all four major carriers here in the
US and as also the Adobe Atmos 3d sound
experience so if the savings is going to
be what you're after you might want to
check out the CTX on 7 so because I
won't learn more about either our
handset
