everybody and I'm here to talk about
smartwatches again now if you remember
my last piece about hybrid smartwatches
I had sort of forgone the whole idea of
having a touchscreen on my wrist because
I was missing some more tactile feedback
now I had a lot of reasons for that
buttons were the main reason because I
wanted to be able to navigate the
operating system or to do things like
change songs or pause music without
having to look at the touchscreen well
what we have right now is a look at the
fitbit Versa and this has already been
reviewed at andhra 30.com by jimi
westenberg who said that this watch is a
very good starter SmartWatch for a lot
of users my first quip about this
SmartWatch is that it's kind of missing
the point about buttons at a first
glance the design language of the Versa
is a lot like the pebble there is a lot
to like about how this watch has been
developed you have a button over on the
left and then over on the right you have
two one less than was available on the
original pebbles but it looks enough
like a normal wearable that it doesn't
scream runner or the FitLife to any
other people the way the ionic did the
comparison to the ionic is fairly
obvious however it's nice to see that
the fitbit Versa is fairly neutral it
has a body that is really light so you
barely notice that it's there until the
good vibration motor actually triggers
and then you have a bunch of different
SmartWatch bands that you can put on
here and in my case I have the leather
which works with this kind of semi
semi-formal thing I got going on right
now the button on the left does go
backwards in the interface however if
you hold it you are able to get to some
quick settings and to music controls
more on that in a second the two buttons
on the right allow for not only two
shortcuts that can be programmed in the
menu but if you hold the top button then
you can bring down the notification
shape this notification shade shows you
basically the exact same thing that the
Android notification would if you
expanded it now the touchscreen is not
bad in and of itself but the Versa is
obviously trying to marry the two
concepts and the problem I have with
this is that it never really goes all-in
on either of them certain functions
require the buttons while others still
ask the user to look at the screen and
have pinpoint precision as to which
button they're trying to press this
proved the most cumbersome with music
controls which are already a bit of a
headache to get set up so inside of this
watch there are of
you gigabytes of storage that you can
use and if you have local files you can
transfer them via Wi-Fi to the watch and
be able to listen to bluetooth
headphones directly from there which is
great you can open up the music app
inside and be able to control music
using the on-screen elements much like
on other touchscreen smart watches
however my main function would be to use
Google Play Music in order to stream
music from the phone to my earphones and
control them with the watch so let's say
you're driving which is the situation
that I mostly find myself in but there
are people out there who might be on
bikes or on boosted boards just in
transit in general you want to be able
to change the song without having to
divert your attention but that's exactly
what the versa and other smartwatches
are asking you to do you're able to do
something without looking at the watch
which is bring up the controls but then
the controls require you to divert your
attention it's just not ideal and that's
always been a pain point with
touchscreens on my wrist customizations
of the buttons would really help here if
I was able to program a hold of either
of the right side buttons to trigger
let's say next song or next track or
something like that then that would be
great that level of customization is
something that I hope the Fitbit OS will
provide in the future but if
touchscreens are going to be their main
focus moving forward I don't think it'll
get that far
I still enjoy my Skagen hybrid
SmartWatch because it gives me the
controls that I was talking about
earlier but also because it became a
filter for my notifications
I even customized a chamois ban - in
order to just vibrate when specific
notifications came in like for example
messages from my girlfriend or from the
workplace and in that case I was able to
use the SmartWatch as a kind of filter
that only told me when I really need it
to get to the phone but in the case of
the versa if you have notifications
turned on for an app you get all of them
which means that your wrist is vibrating
more often than you probably would want
to now obviously this is another portion
of the fitbit os that can be changed in
the future and the app ecosystem is in
its very infant stages there are some
developers from the pebble side that
have moved over to Fitbit OS and that's
nice to see however what bothers me
about Fitbit OS is that it's kind of
like a walled garden even though there's
no official word that this is the case
as it stands right now Fitbit OS will
not allow third-party developers to
replace functions that Fitbit develops
themselves for example the sleep cycles
the sleep cycles are something that you
would want to see at the end of a long
nights of sleep so you know how much
deep sleep you've got but it would be
nice if an alarm app was able to tap
into it so that when you're in light
sleep it would alarm at that point
rather than just at the time that is
simply set in the symbol alarm app now I
know that I've been kind of being
specific about what experiences I wish
this Smart Watch was able to provide but
those are my use cases you can look at
this video as a little bit of a JV rant
of sorts but really there's a lot to
like about the Versa and I would implore
you to look at the for review that Jimmy
made a little while ago so you can get
the full story that said I have talked
about some negatives but here are some
really great positives the fact that
Fitbit is the maker it's one of the best
fitness trackers for general consumers
that helps track steps active minutes
which is a better metric by the way and
even water intake sleep tracking is good
but like I said there's a little bit
more that you can do with that
information and I think that users could
actually benefit from those features
being in the watch it comes with a heart
rate sensor that's always firing so you
get to know what your resting heart rate
is and then there is GPS but via the
connected smartphone so you have to have
that around at least that functionality
is still there the exercise app does
give you a lot of options for tracking
many different types of activities
however there is a basic workout mode as
well and I use that when I was hitting a
bag with some sticks and doing some
punching drills and I was able to burn
200 calories at least that's what the
watch was telling me so it's good to
have that level of information and
having more information can help you get
informed about your health which is
exactly what Fitbit is trying to do one
bright spot is the coach which is
something we saw in the ionic these are
built-in workouts that use the strong
vibration motors to give you feedback
about when the sets are done and then it
gives you previews of the upcoming
exercise there are three different
workouts here you have the 10 minute abs
the seven-minute workout and the 15
minute warm-up if you're looking to get
a proper workout done every single day
you have them on your wrist at all times
you should do all three of them as a set
and maybe it'll take about 35 minutes
but that's a solid workout that you can
do every single morning if you're
looking for a good starting point
basically you bought a SmartWatch but
remember you're also getting a great
fitness tool don't forget to use it the
times when I was happy to have the Versa
on my wrist were contradictory when I
hardly remembered I was wearing a
SmartWatch it was just a good-looking
piece of tech that told me the time and
rang when I hit my steps where it
bothered me when I was sitting for too
long however when I was actively trying
to use the fitness tools that was also
when I was really happy to have the
Versa as my daily SmartWatch but if you
have used a Samsung gear aware OS or an
Apple watch this is not going to be
really a viable alternative the search
for a simpler wearable life did not lead
to fitbit's latest device it just
reminded me why I moved on in the first
place after that very company were moved
to the one that I already had on my
wrist in any case you can stick around
to Android Authority remember to
subscribe to this channel if you haven't
already hit the subscription button but
there's also that bell on the side so
you know exactly when we put out any
videos throughout the week after that
you can go ahead and drop some likes on
these videos get in the comments down
below and let us know what you think
about this or any SmartWatch and then
stick around at Android authority comm
