Clayton young we're coming at you from
Android authority calm your number one
source for everything Android today
we've got a head ad comparison between
the Android 4.1 jellybean operating
system in the Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich operating system the jelly bean
being newer and the more developed
version of Android coming in on the
Nexus 7 and the Galaxy Nexus stock then
the Ice Cream Sandwich operating system
released some months ago in the winter
of 2011-2012
coming on the Galaxy Nexus first and
we've got two Galaxy Nexus here to
compare these two operating systems on
my right I'm running the jellybean AOSP
operating system no mods complete
Android open source project install and
then on the Left I'm running the Ice
Cream Sandwich operating system complete
factory stock on both so we're just
going to compare um you know the UI the
speed of each of the browser speed there
quadrant tests now both of these phones
have the exact same hardware so we've
got an even result we're not going to
have any hardware accelerated
performance so we're just going to go
ahead and walk through the differences
of each of these operating systems so as
you can see we do have our Ice Cream
Sandwich on the left and our jelly bean
on the right they're basically the same
as far as the stock dock bar here the
same in the navigation bar as well and
then we've got a similar layout on as
far as the status bar on top let's go
ahead and pull down the status bar on
each you can get a feel for the
notifications as you can see on the
jelly bean operating system the
notifications have a nicer UI a more
refined look with some nice animations
to the left now if you happen to have a
notification with say a contact image or
something like that if you get a text
you'll have your nice image coming up
here on the left that's the same on Ice
Cream Sandwich but they've dedicated a
little more space and a little bit nicer
UI on the ice cream no on the jelly bean
operating system I'm sorry anyways in
the top left we also have our date and
time on jelly bean as well as our
settings easily accessed with the slider
there now our settings are also easily
accessed on to the
right of the date on the Ice Cream
Sandwich operating system now to remove
all of your notifications on jellybean
you simply tap the little tiered layer
thing there and then you tap the X on
the Ice Cream Sandwich operating system
now what we're going to want to do is go
into the settings we'll go ahead and tap
these at the same time
looks like the jellybean came up faster
than the Ice Cream Sandwich operating
system so now we'll just walk through
the actual things included in the
settings here we have our Wi-Fi of
course Bluetooth and data usage
monitoring on each go ahead and go more
again it looks like the jellybean made
it there first we have our mobile
networks our Android beat'em and NFC on
each so both of these do have a native
NFC you're going to need a phone with an
NFC chip which are going to be seeing a
lot of all hardware integration in the
newer phones to facilitate that
sometimes let's go back looks like maybe
the ICS I got that first this time we
have our storage options our display our
battery and apps now the cool thing with
jellybean is uh in the apps we can go
ahead and go to any one of our apps that
we want we'll do the same on the Ice
Cream Sandwich we'll actually go to the
same app browser and the cool thing
about jellybean is that we can disable
the apps from actually producing a
notification in our notification bar so
if we don't want the apps to give us a
notification at all we can just deselect
that and turn off notifications for that
app it's really helpful for a lot of
apps that just have spammy notifications
even though Google has now enacted the
no longer having ads in the notification
bar up there but anyways we'll just go
back now continue going through our
settings here on our accounts settings
on jellybean
it is a little different we have our an
entire accounts drop down menu here that
we are lacking on Ice Cream Sandwich the
accounts are accessed through accounts
and sync on Ice Cream Sandwich and then
we have our Google accounts and we can
add any accounts simply by pressing the
Add Account
now we have similar developer options
between jellybean and Ice Cream Sandwich
now the cool thing about jellybean is um
you at
I have to turn the entire developer
options list on and we have USB
debugging on each 2d hardware
acceleration all that stuff go ahead and
go back and go to the about phone
quickly see we are running 4.1.1 and
then we're running 4.0.4 we do have
easter eggs on each so there's our
easter eggs and we'll go back now
another cool implementation of a jelly
bean is the framerate running at 60fps
at all times so that produces a really
nice transition effect now they're both
very fast you won't notice any you know
difference in transition from just
staring at the phone screen our eyes can
pick that up that fast but they're both
very fast but the jelly bean is running
at 60 frames per second all the time it
also has a 60 Hertz refresh rate to
match the hardware of the Galaxy Nexus
device now it also has triple buffering
which the phone actually starts
buffering and almost predicts which
action you will do next depending on
where you touch the screen it's kind of
guess um you know which action you're
going to do next and start actually
buffering that before you even follow
through now sticking with the homescreen
we're going to go ahead and go into the
apps now as you can see the jelly bean
did make it there a bit quicker than the
ICS now we do have the links to the
market up in the top right and we'll go
ahead and go to the widgets on each
we'll grab a widget and add it to the
home screen on each of these as you can
see on jelly bean the widgets actually
interacting with the existing icons
whereas it's not here on Ice Cream
Sandwich now anyways we do have it
dropped down now once we do that we have
resizable widgets on ICS but not for all
of them
but every widget is resizable or
practically every widget here on
jellybean and going to messaging and
will start a new message so you can see
the keyboards are almost identical we
don't really have much difference in the
keyboard once we go ahead and type in
the
actual messaging here we do have
predictions on each we also have our
voice search and then our voice detect
dictation excuse me on the jelly bean
and the ICS now the cool thing is that
jellybean OS offers offline voice
dictation so you can actually speak into
the mic
it will know what you're saying and then
it'll type it being offline you don't
need the mobile network for it to match
your voice against the other samples it
has in a cloud as you do on ICS you get
a better experience with the jellybean
OS now anyways in place of the next key
we have the return key on jellybean and
also regarding messaging we have high
resolution contact photos now in Android
jellybean so if you can see um just go
ahead and scroll down until we meet a
contact photo leave that one up here was
the only one higher resolution for the
contact photo as you guys so we'll go
ahead and get into some comparisons such
as speed the quadrant in the browser
so before we actually get into comparing
the speeds and how the hardware
interacts with the software of each of
these OS is we'll just get into some of
the other small but noticeable changes
that are available in jellybean such as
changes to the Play Store now when you
download an app on the Play Store or you
update it for that matter you don't have
to actually update the entire
application say you're downloading a 13
megabytes the original size of the app
and then they come out with an update in
a few days um you'll only have to
download the actual space needed to
update the app you don't need to
download another 13 megabytes to totally
replace the app you just download like
say 1 megabyte to actually update the
app now that's differed from the Ice
Cream Sandwich where you would need to
download the entire application we also
have a new YouTube functionality and
Google Plus so if we go into YouTube so
you can see here the Android authority
channel has a nice different UI nicer UI
and then on the ICS it's the classic
YouTube where we a scroll through the
favorites activity uploads all that sort
of stuff where we can scroll left on the
jelly bean and access all of our
channels and stuff like that ok so I
went ahead and did a SunSpider test on
the browsers I'll go ahead and bring the
phone's up to the camera so you can see
what we got on jellybean we got a score
of 1692 milliseconds total for all the
processes it ran and then on ICS our
score was eighteen hundred eighty
milliseconds now be smaller the better
so it took less time for the jellybean
OS to actually run through all the
SunSpider tests such as the 3d tests all
the string tests all of the different
tests it runs in the SunSpider
JavaScript benchmark tests so the
browser is optimized in a bit faster on
the jellybean operating system than it
is on the Ice Cream Sandwich operating
system now they're both set up in the
same way we have our tabs we can simply
add new tabs just like that we just
swipe away tabs and again and it will
close our browser our app management is
the exact same such as the recent apps
we bring it up see we have the browser
here I'm going to put these three
together swipe to get rid of anything
either direction all right so we saw
that the browser is a
milliseconds better and it has a faster
rendering speed and stuff so let's
actually just test the speed of the UI
operating on the phones themselves we'll
go ahead and perform a quadrant test on
each phone and we'll monitor the frames
per second that the animations are
running at so let's get this started
so we did get our results here for the
quadrant test our Galaxy Nexus running
jelly bean
I got a 2,295 total score than our
Galaxy Nexus rocking the ICS got
nineteen hundred and thirty two so on
jelly bean we did a score higher but
that is because of the i/o and the 3d
performance we actually got higher CPU
speeds and memory speeds on the ICS
device anyways we'll go back and
speaking of hitting the home button
there is the Google malfunction allottee
with jellybean which is of course one of
the gems of jellybean that ICS is
lacking completely there is no
comparison here anyway so this is the
Google now feature I will go ahead and
go to what Google now is it basically
shows you traffic cards I can show you
your airline flights we're going to have
to go ahead and enable the location
services to use Google now so we'll go
ahead and go into our settings use the
GPS satellites in the Google location
and now what it actually does is it
shows us how many minutes it will take
to get to our house to work it'll show
us the weather in our area nearby
restaurants our airplane itineraries all
sorts of great stuff and then we also
have the new of voice search integrated
which brings us to our next test we're
going to go ahead and compare the voice
search of ICS to the voice search of
jelly bean now we've already established
that the jelly bean has offline
dictation but we are connected online
for maximum search results going to go
ahead and hit the mic speak something
into it and see which one gets us there
faster and which one gets more accurate
results now I'm sure a lot of you know
jelly bean does have the vastly improved
voice search function functionality that
has completely devastated Siri you might
have seen videos like that but let's go
ahead and actually test these two I will
go ahead and hit our mics here
go to Android Authority comm so we do
have the Android Authority comm already
opening here on the enhanced Google
search but it did get there a little bit
faster on the ICS as you can see it is
already there on ICS in fact we're on
the mobile version of the website for
both of these and it took us there very
nicely we're going to go ahead and try
one more
navigate to the seller Idaho Falls Idaho
got it and this one got it as well
our GPS is disabled but it looks like it
is taking us here to the cellar and we
have the option to actually navigate
right here we can go to the web page but
on the navigation here with ICS it is
already showing us the route and I live
right near this restaurant so it looks
like both of these did actually want to
navigate us to the cellar
so they both are pretty great The Voice
search on the ICS is nothing to shake a
finger at it is really great it works
well under so does the Google Voice
search on the jellybean system we'll try
one more how tall is the Eiffel Tower
Eiffel Tower is 1060 3 feet tall so it
looks like the enhanced Google search
gave us an aural result and it did show
the image here in the nice card form
like Google now does and then the ICS
did bring up the result we got 1063 feet
as our first result on the Google search
so they do work perfectly now we do have
the option to scroll through images
places and we have our settings here on
the Google now but they both work fine
and they both actually kill Siri now
anyways let's check out how some of the
hardware interacts with the software
we'll do some camera tests and see if
each of them are any faster than the
other
and we'll just do that so you guys can
see you can see the transitions are a
lot better here on jellybean as we take
a picture they kind of slide to the
right to get to the gallery on each of
these devices what we can do is a on Ice
Cream Sandwich click the little recent
photo icon we can have our sharing
options of an access the gallery like
that but on ice then on jellybean we can
actually just swipe to the right and
bring up our recent photos and we can
swipe to the left to go back to the
camera
or we can press the small image and
bring up the entire gallery with our
sharing options here now I find that a
little more intuitive and easier to use
than the ICS way of doing things so now
finally we can just go ahead and check
out our lock screens we have the top
having the status bar we can access the
status bar on jellybean but we can't on
Ice Cream Sandwich from the lockscreen
anyways where I have our custom sliders
we can go to the camera or the unlock we
can also access Google now on the lock
screen of jellybean and we can just go
to the home screen on ICS but anyways
guys that was our comparison between
Android Ice Cream Sandwich and Android
jelly bean 4.2 4.1 if you guys have any
questions go ahead and drop them into
the comments section we'll have our full
written review accompanying the video
very soon here umm tell us what you guys
think do you guys want a rock jelly bean
or are you good with the market
dominating Ice Cream Sandwich for a
while I mean if you've got a Galaxy
Nexus you can get the dumps and flash
them right to your device there's many
other devices coming out with fully
functional builds of jellybean as we
speak but uh what are your thoughts guys
do you like jelly bean or do you like
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich go ahead
and drop us a line this is Clayton
Youngberg with Android 30.com and have a
great day guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
