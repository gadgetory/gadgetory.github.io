playing games writing calculating web
browsing watching videos listening to
music chatting emailing editing photos
drawing these are some of the things
that you can do on your desktop or
laptop you can also do these on your
Android phone or tablet but wait there's
one other important thing printing you
can print files and documents from your
desktop and laptop but can you also
print from your Android tablet or phone
hi I'm mark welcome to Android Authority
today I'll show you how to print from
your Android tablet or phone before you
can print from your Android tablet or
phone you first need to set up your
printer to use the Google Cloud printers
it's extremely easy to set up if you
have a cloud ready printer because you
won't need to physically connect it to a
computer but even if your printer isn't
cloud ready you can still connect it to
the Google Cloud Print service from any
computer I'll show you how using this
old samsung ml 16:10 printer as an
example before beginning make sure that
you have a Google account and that
Google Chrome is installed on your
computer if you are using Windows XP
you'll also need service pack 3 run
Google Chrome and click the chrome menu
button from the menu select settings
then select show advanced settings
scroll down to the Google Cloud Print
section and click this button login with
your Google account to enter Google
Cloud Print a confirmation message will
appear indicating that the printer
connected to your computer will be added
to Google Cloud Print click this button
to confirm that's it your printer is now
connected to Google Cloud Print just run
Google Chrome on your PC and log into
your Google account every time you want
to print via Google Cloud Print remember
that both the computer and the printer
attached to it must be turned on before
printing the computer also needs to be
connected to the Internet for cloud
print work how do you print from your
Android tablet or phone you're now just
a few steps closer to doing it there are
several ways to print from your Android
the first one is for the Google Cloud
Print app just download and install it
then login to the same account that you
used for registering with a Google Cloud
Print service let me show you how to
print a photo from my Nexus 7 first
launch the cloud
then tap the print button to select a
file to print you'll see a list of
supported apps that can print to your
printer in this case I'll use the
gallery app because I want to print the
photo the next screen shows you a list
of printers registered to your Google
Cloud Print account tap on the printer
name to select it the Print Preview page
will appear on the screen at this point
you'll be able to select the orientation
media size resolution and number of
copies tap the arrow button at the top
to create the print job and start
printing the page and here it is the
photo print out for my tablet via Google
Cloud Print through the Google Cloud
Print app you can also print documents
and files from Dropbox Google Drive and
local files stored on your device some
Android device manufacturers like
Samsung include built-in support for
printing via Wi-Fi Wi-Fi direct
Bluetooth or USB if your Android phone
or tablet has that kind of support you
might want to use that because it
usually won't need an internet
connection you can print not only photos
and documents through Google's cloud
print service but also webpages and
Gmail messages to print webpages for
example just open the page on your phone
or tablet's browser then tap the Menu
button tap share and select Cloud Print
from the list of apps you can print your
Gmail messages to but not through the
Gmail app for Android which doesn't
include any printing support yet a
workaround for now is to print from the
phone or tablet's web browser just open
the mobile version of Gmail through your
phone or tablet's browser and print your
mails from there through Google Cloud
Print Google's official Cloud Print app
isn't the only Android app to enable you
to print from your phone or tablet there
are other apps too such as the Cloud
Print app by Paulo Fernandez and printer
share more bile print by mobile dynamics
Pablo Fernandez is Cloud Print app also
uses the Google Cloud Print service that
allows you to connect your phone or
tablet to a printer the free version has
ads and has limited features the paid
version though removes the ads and it's
restrictions this app is quite easy to
use too before you can print with it you
first need to set or add a Google
Account that you have registered with a
Google Cloud Print service on the next
screen select the printer that you
registered with Google Cloud Print
select your printer from the list that
appears on the screen after that you
might want to check whether the printer
has been properly set up tap this button
to print a test page to verify that your
printer has successfully connected to
Google Cloud Print
now you can use the app to print files
or data on your Android phone or tablet
to begin open the apps local tab to
select files and data that you want to
print such as SMS messages images
contacts and other documents you can
also create scribbles and drawings jot
down notes or photos scanned documents
and then print those files from within
the app you can also access and print
your Dropbox or box files Facebook

Cloud Print service to connect your
Android phone or tablet to your printer
the apps paid version lets you connect

launching the app is to open the

dialog you can choose the connection
type of your printer Wi-Fi Bluetooth USB
Google Cloud printer or remote printer

pictures contacts calendar entries SMS
