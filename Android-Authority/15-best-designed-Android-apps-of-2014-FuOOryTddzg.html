handy the Android authority app guy and
in this video we're going to take a look
at the 15 best design Android
applications of 2014 inbox by Gmail
storm the headlines for two reasons it
was made by Google and because it
challenged the current email application
paradigm
the results were polarizing because some
people liked it and other people hated
it however would you get past the shock
of the change in boxes a very clean and
organized email application it also
integrates with Google now's reminder
functionality which is nice it's also
free to use live link bubble is a
browser hidden inside of a floating
notification the idea is that you can
open a bunch of links from your favorite
apps and social media sites and then go
back and look at them when you choose to
do so it's an amazing idea and it
definitely alters things like how often
people engage with content you don't
have to wait for the browser to open so
you end up opening more stuff and then
going back to look at it later
the free version gives you a taste and
the full experience costs 3 dollars and
99 cents not a lot of people knew the
purpose of Google messenger since Google
Hangouts exists but it turned out to be
a very well-designed application and
very useful it is a light text messaging
app that first minutes appearance on the
Nexus 6 and it's now available for most
devices there are some light
customization options like changing the
color for various contacts and it's
totally free to use moots i live
wallpaper isn't the most popular
application on this list but it has a
very loyal following it's a live
wallpaper that shows you the most
classic artistic pieces in history it
definitely adds a little class to the
home screen and there's even an API
available that other developers have
used to integrate this application into
their own such as Chris Lacey's action
launcher it's totally free and a good
way to enjoy some classic art my stocks
is a stock market application that lets
you keep an eye on the stock market your
stocks and news revolving around the
stock market and your stocks it has a
bucket load of features that are
cleverly hidden behind a solid holo
interface that is complete with
analytics graphs and other information
what makes this app impressive is how
much information there is and how well
it's organized if you do stocks you
should definitely try this one out with
Microsoft released next lock screen from
their Microsoft garage project and it is
something a little bit different it
warps your home screen into a
combination of lock screen contacts
application at
or and calendar app it's great for
people who use those functions regularly
and the ability to put that much right
there on the lock screen without that
overwhelming feeling is something pretty
special it has some problems with bugs
but the design itself is solid snack
exchange is a huge website with a lot of
content that has helped countless people
over the years and they just released an
Android application earlier this year
the design is classic holo and it
manages to give you access to all of its
websites and subsidiaries without too
much effort and without making it feel
too crowded there are even some
customization options available if you
need that it's a great application and
anyone who is curious about anything
should have it the sunrise calendar was
a big deal for its colorful and
organized design and it was around
before the announcement of material
design it's compatible with Google
Calendar exchange and even iCloud for
those of you who may need those services
other than that it does pretty much what
calendars do there are some behind the
scenes stuff that could be fixed but the
design is extremely pretty and solid
plus it's totally free the talent for
Twitter has been a huge hit in 2014 it's
sleek designed fun layout and
customization made it a favorite for
many Twitter users so much so that the
original application hit its Twitter
token limit so the developers had to
release a second one more recent updates
added a bunch of material design and
that has allowed talent to remain
probably the best design Twitter app
currently outs the only bad part is that
it's only available for Android lollipop
right now uncluttered is such a great
idea and it's coincidentally wrapped up
in a great design the premise for the
app is that it allows you to check and
clean your cloud storage abuse list junk
and free up space for other files and
also lets you find duplicates so if
you're like me and you uploaded your
camera roll to two different places you
can identify that and correct it the
interface is simple hollow UI mixed with
a card UI that makes its app very
effective and easy to use qualia is
another material design app that grab
the headlines and took the internet by
storm unfortunately it was shut down
after the website that hosted the
wallpapers this app showed went down but
it's back now with a new set of
wallpapers and all of its material
design glory the app is a great example
of what material design can do for
otherwise boring tasks like finding
wallpapers and it's also totally free
email is another application that wants
to change how people email on mobile
unlike inbox which requires a bit of
organization skills we mail turns the
email experience into something akin to
a chat application
emails are organized by sender rather
than chronologically and there are a few
features like voice emails and a solid
if somewhat incomplete material design
it's free to try and it's definitely
something different a v8 launcher
received so much press this year that
Yahoo went and bought the damn thing for
reported fifty million dollars it
simplifies the home screen and puts
applications and categories for easy
reference
there are also some customization
options but the big thing here is how a
v8 managed to simplify the Android
experience and still look really good
doing it it remains totally free even
after the Yahoo buyouts
and it's a unique style of launcher no
window weather is a beautifully done
weather application that turns your
device into a window of the weather when
it's sunny the application is sunny and
when it's rainy the application is
raining you can check the weather by the
minute by using a very nifty slider
functionality and you can get your
weather forecast as you normally would
it looks amazing and it's definitely
worth picking up the free version to try
it out with Nokia Z launcher is another
launcher that tries to simplify the
Android experience using some very
unique interface choices there is one
home screen with a clock widget that can
be swiped to look at other information
like the weather the rest of the home
screen is dedicated to trying to guess
which applications you need based on
where you are and what time it is the
big feature is the ability to write on
the home screen and search for apps very
quickly that way it's still in beta but
it's in the fitting choice
