Hindy the android authority app guy its
nearing the end of October which means
it's time to wrap up the best apps and
games that were released this month
Adobe started out October by releasing
not one but two Android applications and
they are adobe capture CC and
illustrator draw capture CC is a design
application that lets you create things
like brushes stamp shapes and other
similar things for later use it's a
fairly simple application and it comes
with Adobe Creative Cloud support
illustrator draw is a drawing
application that lets you use vectors
layers zoom and various other tools to
create works of art both applications
have a few issues here and there but
they're both entirely free to download
and use cloud chasers is a survival
adventure game about a man and his
daughter who are trying to make it to a
better place you're stuck in a desert
and you must worry about things like
feeding yourself and protecting yourself
from obstacles and of course bad guys
there are some unique gameplay mechanics
and the game itself has been
consistently described as beautiful
which we also agree with it's four
dollars with no in-app purchases which
is a decent price but do be where the
game is experiencing some early bugs
drive mode is an application that is
meant to be used in the car it works by
giving you swipe gestures and large
colorized buttons to help you keep your
eyes on the road and off of your
smartphone it seems to work pretty well
and can be useful for those who keep
their phones in their car with it you
can listen to music answer text messages
answer phone calls and plenty of other
tasks the unique UI and usability make
it a pretty decent application to pick
up and it's totally free with no in-app
purchases minecraft story mode is the
latest episodic adventure out of
telltale games this one features
minecraft style graphics but instead of
the usual grinding and open world
exploring you're actually playing
through a storyline is voiced by an
all-star cast of actors and actresses
including Patton Oswalt Brian Posehn
Corey Feldman and many more as with most
telltale games your story decisions
affect other parts of the story which is
always a nice touch minions paradise is
a game that was meant to come out with
the latest minions movie so we were a
bit disappointed when it was delayed for
about a month for most people in this
game you must help fill the minion build
a paradise for his fellow minions you're
in charge of pretty much all of the
construction and there will be cameo
appearances from the movies all in all
it's a well done world builder type of
game if you can get past the in-app
purchases parchi is a free and
lightweight notetaking application that
came out of Microsoft's garage project
as you'd expect you can take a variety
of notes with it
including regular notes and lists you
can also add extra stuff if needed the
unique feature of this application is
the use of hashtags to help label notes
using the hashtag you can easily search
and find notes that you're looking for
or a series of notes if you reuse the
same hashtags it's totally free with no
in-app purchases legend of the brofist
may be a really lame title for a game
but darn it all it's actually a pretty
fun game it's a 2d platformer that uses
retro graphics so the gameplay and feel
of the game shouldn't be too unfamiliar
to people who have been playing games
for a while the game also features
little tidbits and references to various
internet memes and several famous
YouTube gamers make appearances it's a
tad pricey but at least there are no
in-app purchases prune is an atmospheric
puzzle game with a simple but strangely
enjoyable premise in each level you'll
be given a tree that is growing and of
course a light source your job is to
prune the tree in such a manner that it
grows into the light so it can bloom
pretty flowers it's simple to play but
can be challenging to complete the music
the graphics and even the gameplay
mechanics are made to help you feel
relaxed by your playing it and that's
definitely a vibe that we got there are
no in-app purchases with this game
Wonderwall is a backgrounds and
wallpapers application released earlier
this month it's done with a simplicity
that we found enjoyable and most of the
wallpapers for landscape camera shots
this is a fun little application to try
if you're into that kind of stuff and it
even gives you the option to contribute
your own pictures if you want to other
features include the option to set the
wallpapers manually each day and various
settings to control things like search
history data usage and more is totally
free with no in-app purchases last up
this month is excerpt this is an
application that allows you to create
good-looking screenshots of blood pages
so that you can share them on Twitter
the idea is that you can share a quote
or some text from a webpage without
wasting your valuable 140 characters
when you go to tweet it out it's a
simple application that works off of
screenshots that you take and it's quite
easy to use it's also totally free with
no in-app purchases and they must have
for Twitter users who share stuff once
