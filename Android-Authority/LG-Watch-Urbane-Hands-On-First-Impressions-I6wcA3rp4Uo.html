android authority and we are live here
at Mobile World Congress 2015 hanging
out with LG taking a look at the LG
watch urbane and this is LG's latest
Android wear SmartWatch and essentially
this is very similar to the g watch are
so basically what you're looking at is a
watch that's just aesthetically
different but for the most part it's
very similar to the g watch are so
you're looking at the same exact specs
here so Snapdragon 400 half a gig of ram
ip67 and the real difference here though
is going to be the design so you're
looking at an all metal design for the
for the body of the watch which is
practically the same as the G watch are
but it is a little bit sleeker more
elegant more classy looking and then
with the leather band here you have real
stitching that goes around the band
which is really nice and it's also
available in this particular silver
color that you see here and you'll also
get a rose gold color as well which i
will show you here right now and I just
as a quick come size comparison with the
actual g-watch arts so they're pretty
similar in size but they do have a very
different look to them and this
particular band here is a this this is
not actually come with a G watch our
this is a a custom band so I don't pay
too much attention to that there but you
can see they do look fairly similar in
size but have a they're they're very
different in appearance with the watch
urbane being a little bit more classy a
little bit more elegant as far as
pricing and availability goes it will be
priced very similarly to the G watch our
and availability is to be announced and
on the software side of things you're
looking at android wear again and it is
running the latest version of Android
wear so you have all the same
functionalities as you would expect this
has been a quick first look of the other
watch urbane a stay tuned for the rest
of our mobile world congress 2015
