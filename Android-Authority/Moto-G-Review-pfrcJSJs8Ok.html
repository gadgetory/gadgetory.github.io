have the mini moniker and thus it is
implied that it should be considered on
its own and it really should be because
it's Josh regard from Android thority
what's going on everybody and this is
the full review on the Moto G perhaps
the biggest part about the Moto G is its
little price points however we'll get to
that in a little bit because we'll start
off with design the Moto G does pretty
aggressively hit the mid-range game with
its smaller form factor due to a 4.5
inch screen it is smaller at least by
today's standards but that doesn't take
away from the build quality of the phone
one bit the phone is plastic all around
smooth and somewhat slippery in the hand
and it doesn't take fingerprints very
easily even though smudges might show up
from time to time the button layout is
on the right and all has a very meaty
feel to them when you click down on any
of the buttons or the volume rockers you
get a real stiff feel to it and it's
really really nice the headphone jack in
the microUSB port are centered on the
top and the bottom and overall the phone
just is really easy to handle with a 4.5
inch screen you'll see that in one hand
you are able to reach everything on the
phone pretty easily without having to do
any hand gymnastics and finally of
course the Moto G is also customizable
allowing it to have a back cover that is
a different color because it is
removable one thing I will say however
is that back cover is also quite secure
it takes quite a bit of effort to get
the back cover off so that definitely
gives the Moto G a few extra points in
the sturdiness category we find some
really refreshing elements in the Moto G
screen this is a 4.5 inch 720p screen at
326 pixels per inch and reminds us just
how spoiled we can be sometimes no this
is not a 1080p screen like we're all
pretty much used to nowadays but at the
same time even at 720p you don't really
notice that much of a difference the
screen overall does provide some pretty
nice quality as the sharpness allows for
pretty good text especially considering
the size of the screen and the color
reproduction is pretty good even the
viewing angles are quite nice so there
are some definite points in the Moto G
screen here
overall this 720p display is just
another example of how we don't
necessarily need the biggest or even the
highest resolution
in order to have an enjoyable experience
on our phones indeed the Moto G comes
with the Snapdragon 400 the quad-core
1.2 gigahertz cortex a7 variation back
to by the audrina 305 and one gigabyte
of ram performance empirically is
actually not too shabby at all if you
saw my speed test hitting the Moto G
with the Snapdragon 400 against the
Snapdragon 800 found in the Nexus 5 then
you would know that the Moto G really
didn't perform that badly at all yes it
came in behind the Nexus 5 but really
not by much for any of you average users
out there I am sure that you could have
this phone and be able to perform all of
your daily tasks without really any
problems overall the Moto G brings you
exactly what you need and not only that
because of its processing package it can
also go the distance in terms of battery
life which is coming up next but in the
end the Moto G does exactly what you
probably would need it to do and if you
need to get things done you don't do a
lot worse then the Snapdragon 400 and
the Moto G when it comes to hardware the
Moto G does try to keep things pretty
simple 8 or 16 gigabytes of on-board
storage are available in either version
of the Moto G however it is not
expandable the general bevy of
connections are available within however
NFC did not make the cut here and
finally when it comes to the speakers
yes they do get quite loud
however the problem here is you do get
kind of what you pay for as the sound is
lacking richness and fullness call
quality left nothing to be desired as
calls came in through the phone speaker
just fine
further attesting to Motorola's pedigree
in that department and in one make or
break situation here the Moto G is not
LTE compatible that means that when you
use this phone on AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile you
will only get 4G HSDPA connectivity it
is definitely not as fast as LTE but it
is also not that shabby either so if
that is something that you really need
your super high-speed Internet then the
Moto G is not something that is for you
one big positive point for the Moto G in
its hardware is the battery life yes
this is actually a mid-range device with
the matching specs however it's battery
is a pretty sizable 2070 milliamp hour
units no it is not removable however you
don't have to worry about that because
it will go the distance I was able to go
and
most full two days with this battery at
moderate usage even if I was a power
user I should be able to get a whole
day's worth out of this battery and then
some so nightly charging is something
you're going to have to do but even then
you don't have to worry about running
out of juice before your day is over
when it comes to the camera we do get a
five megapixel shooter that is backed by
a pretty simple moto application quality
is obviously not going to be spectacular
from a budget camera like this however
it's also not that bad at all the
pictures have good color reproduction
brightness and have a very nice vibrancy
to them especially when you're using HDR
speaking of which Auto HDR inside of the
camera is a really nice function that
allows the camera to determine whether
or not HDR is needed for the frame that
it is taking it takes some of the
guesswork out of whether or not you
should be using HDR for particular shots
picture quality is quite good like I
said before however once you zoom into
the details you'll find that the details
simply aren't there there's quite a bit
of pixelation there and because of the
low megapixel counts you won't be able
to take these pictures and use them for
too many applications other than the
typical instagramming or facebooking or
things of that nature focusing takes a
little bit longer than we would like and
then once you hit the shutter button
whether or not you're using HDR you
still have to wait for the actual file
to be created when you're using HDR it
takes quite a while which is expected
but even when you're not it's still a
little bit longer than we would like
when it comes to software we see that
the Moto G has a pretty stock Android
experience with Motorola additions
however the two big additions that were
put into the Moto X that really
differentiated it are not here and this
is something I'll only say this time
right now those are the touches control
and the notification peaking and it's
pretty obvious why these two functions
are not available it is because the
hardware that makes them work is simply
not here for notification peaking we
don't have an AMOLED display for the
touchless control there are less
microphones all around on the phone and
also that extra core that processes
voice control is not found inside
overall this is a vanilla Android
experience which actually plays to the
strengths of the Moto G afterall stock
Android still proves to be minimalistic
streamlined and provides a very good
experience without taking too much power
at all it's simple doesn't really come
with in many crazy extras and is still a
good canvas for your creativity and for
everything that you want or need to do
and finally we make it to price and that
is probably the biggest part about the
Moto G because at $179 you can get it
unlocked at the 8 gigabyte base model
now I've said this for plenty of many
devices in my day and while it is true
for all of them I have to say that it's
never been truer than it is right now
because the Moto G takes the crown of
being the phone for the every man and
every woman now what makes the Moto G
different from those other phones well
quite simply it is that price think
about the last time you complained about
your phone maybe you complained that the
screen was too big or the handling
wasn't that great or perhaps you saw
that there were a couple things that
were in the phone that you didn't need
and so it felt like a waste of money
those are complaints you're not going to
have with this the complaints with the
Moto G that you might have like maybe
the screen is too small or things like
that are all based upon our wants
they're all based upon things that we
truly truly desire but don't necessarily
need because even if say the screen is
not as big as you want it to be you
still have a screen in front of you that
performs quite well let's say you don't
have the fastest processing package but
in reality you probably don't really
notice anyway and then of course when it
comes to the battery life the Moto G
actually knocks the socks off of plenty
of the high-end devices today that can
even keep up to a whole day's worth of
work and in that regard I give the Moto
G so much credit because it sets out to
do particular things the essentials and
it actually succeeds with flying colors
in the end if you just want a phone that
doesn't break the bank then you have it
right here but also if you want to phone
that for all intents and purposes just
works and you also have it right here as
