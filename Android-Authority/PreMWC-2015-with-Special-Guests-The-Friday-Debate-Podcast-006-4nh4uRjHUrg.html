Friday debate podcast by android
authority I am of course your host for
the fdp Joshua vagar from android
authority what is going on everybody and
today we have a bit of a special episode
if you are not already able to tell
because this episode is being released
on a Monday but it has been a very busy
lead up into the mobile world congress
of 2015 here in barcelona spain if you
can't hear the sounds of the cars going
by and the people walking through the
mean streets of Barcelona maybe not so
mean but they are going to get really
busy over the next few days because mwc
is officially starting but I have been
here for a good four maybe five days
already because I've been here with the
HTC frequencies panel in order to take a
look at what you now know is the HTC One
m9 but that is of course not the only
thing that we're seeing here at mwc but
I wanted to get a couple people together
my usual collaborators when we go to
text shows michael fisher from pocket
now and of course nicole scott from
mobile geek so three of us always seem
to get together whenever we go to a
trade show together and I call this the
trifecta of collaboration but
nonetheless we got into a rather echoey
room and put a mic in between us or
among us rather and we all just sort of
talked our faces off about all of the
things that we had seen up until that
point on the one hand we had HTC we had
alcatel and then we even had Samsung and
LG now all of the embargo times were
before us talking about all of these
things on the podcast so the release is
far past those embargo times so we were
able to sort of just riff about how we
felt about all of the devices but my
favorite part about this particular
podcast that I hope you'll enjoy is that
the first 20 minutes we actually didn't
talk about anything tech related we just
want to share our experiences with
Barcelona Spain so I hope you all really
enjoy it for those of you watching on
youtube remember that you can find the
android authority friday debate podcast
on all of the podcast channels including
pocket casts stitcher and itunes and
don't forget to drop us some review so
that we'll get a little bit more
visibility and thank you for all of you
who are listening to this podcast
without any further ado we're going to
jump into this episode 6 pre Mobile
World Congress with michael fisher
pocket now nicole scott of mobile geeks
hope you guys enjoy
cuz we use the last podcast to get to
get into the groove yeah for the most
part how we met were just jealous well
now what was once loopy is now delirium
so we're just gonna start being like
oops i had boobs like it's the product
of us just being here for the last few
days talking specifically with HTC
they're the reason why we even sitting
in the room were sitting in right now
this is very true how was your how was
your guys's uh like you know mwc is not
just about the trade show in the tech
that's there but it's also about the
city itself like what we're in Barcelona
guys I love Barcelona this is one of my
favorite season one of my favorite trade
shows yeah idea absolutely because it's
so focused on mobile and I see yes
you're like washing machine car blender
blender what are the first time I would
say you food there is a huge washing
washing machines coming out of it yeah I
can't see any bubbles when I was there
oh man you got ripped off the interest
in doing here yeah I I said that he
thought was my favorite for a little
while because Berlin's are very easy
City Berlin is easy and plus EFA's very
news focus because everything's in
Germans feel like I've German and then
you're like actual news right so it's
actually really easy to focus in on like
interesting stuff at Aoife and then it
sits and it's also in that perfect place
where you're like what is everyone going
to buy for Christmas right so you also
have this other easy focus in on like
these are the last products that are
going to be released and for me if
there's a lot of laptops that come out
of that shows oh yeah I've always liked
for sure I'm walking around seeing all
these great ultravox with my msi which
is a great altar boy I don't know why
you can call me out on it nobody on
Vanessa yeah I think I had to ask what I
asked you want that was that a pc
I swear I'm gonna find someone to
emissary to give you computers cuz
nobody if no love to yeah let's brings
to a photo shoot and i'll say yes sit on
the stairs an affair of the heart i
witness company oh yeah it's big we must
know somebody there's been a word for
something house i was not a personal
injury in you right now anyway I'm very
well actually you know by the way I
didn't get to compliment you on the
shirt so she given the news that that
was going out yes thing when like oh
yeah let her name like that yeah a
couple days ago yesterday and addington
this is the shirt to wear ya know what
to tell you guys he has a communicator
yeah is that right yeah and we'll over
here okay so uh huh no it's wonderful
because you fly over here from the east
coast and if you're made you live in
boston and there's snow banks that are
taller than you everywhere oh yeah exact
middle of the misery of winter in New
England is februari for me is terrible
time so to come over here where the
people are you know walking around in
like coats like it's cold but it kind of
looks like everyone's just playing
pretend because you're walking around me
like this is great tropical and paradise
out here 160 degrees awesome yeah that's
wonderful it's like it's like a scrum
time in the world winter and barstow not
agree with you I think it's a wonderful
city I'm not I'm not terribly attached
to it I just like being here with people
who are in our industry who I like and I
think we're fortunate in that regard I
feel like we don't maybe this is not
sure if you guys but actually we don't
often sit around us and like bitch about
people because we don't like there are
people we don't like you know in the in
the same videos about like the for an
asshole curse on the showman's let's go
for it good um I don't have I don't have
a rating on it yet so okay um I don't
have a hard line yet so make it explicit
when I come okay but no I feel like we
have a lot of good friends and other
outlets and it's really great to see
them in person and to just hang out
like what are you doing now yeah great
spaces it's like an excuse to hang out
that's always the and I'm going to use
the wrong word because I can't find the
right word for it but it's the it's the
trade show aphrodisiac of sorts like it
makes the whole experience better you
know and it makes it and it also
romanticizes the whole experience party
because yeah I don't know maybe my
romanticism is kind of high because i'm
actually really excited to be here and
I'm walking around and and lawns who's
gonna be on the the cast for our next on
our posts nwc show this is his first
time here and I I just got so excited
like all I know all these places to
bring you man like I was so excited it
is true yeah and walking around I gave
you the the tip to walk by yourself to
our sessions venue it wasn't a kid in a
tip there was a transcendent experience
more than another so we're talking about
going to the things they just like
chance their shuttle me I haven't a
kettle over there whatever i'm gonna get
on the bus or something like that yeah
josh is like no man you gotta think you
got it you really got it to just just
walk I'll see if anybody's walk out
feeling naw man you gonna do it by
yourself you gotta like you know
listened and listened I think the people
speak in the language or the Michael was
like why you touched me you are like
spiritually experiencing the city well
legit yeah yeah and it's awesome I mean
that's great because I like something
you can even get jaded really easily
words all right or too much work to do
think about I'm sorry it's my fault
everyone oh it's fine it's uh it's
something that I've really fought for
with my colleagues to you know just just
kind of remember where we know where we
are and it's not that they have any
problems doing that it's just I'm always
reminding them ah yeah so and it's also
like I'm always fortunate because I'm
because I'm like because I booked my own
tickets for the most part so it's like
I'm gonna show up three days early and
then leave three days late like I don't
know I got I i got into tech blogging
because I was like I gotta find a reason
to buy plane tickets for work you know
and like that's that's actually like one
of the big draws of this of this
industry is that is
my travel is so consistent and great
places and like it sucks that I don't
get to choose the places I go anymore
and this is like my ninth here in
Barcelona but at the same time like I
love coming back here and I love going
to Berlin for Aoife every year in here
and nine years you stole whenever I see
you at a place like this you still have
the eyes of wonder which is the way yeah
you're not slogging around being like
one of these people who do like I feel
like that's that's that's such so common
it's almost a stereotype right you this
one you know many down news reporters
like oh that's exactly what I keep
reminding people you know live in this
moment you know it's what our work is
important we love what we do but you
know if you get too caught up and you
might not be able to like what was that
r is good that none of Bruce Lee saying
you know just like it's like a finger
pointing to the moon and then he slaps
the student don't concentrate on the
finger or you'll miss all that heavenly
glory oh yeah yeah music but I'm don't
don't you feel that the thing that
everyone's saying now is that
smartphones are predictable we all know
what's going to happen the HTC FM you
were here it was really iterative
everything's really iterative sir sons
put a curve on the on the edge right
like is that useful or is that build
like a WOW factor to get people to pay
attention to you anymore because there's
no real use for the edge on the display
yet well okay we're going to get into
the specifics but I love that you
brought up the more existential question
when it comes to what we do and what
we're covering here um I think that this
year's crop of flagship smartphones so
she here at mwc given what I've seen
today it's all about creating the phone
that the phones in the past should have
been in the first place it's not
necessary about a massive innovation
it's not about really going far beyond
past iteration but passenger is and
incremental updates it's picking up the
phone and thinking man a couple years
ago this is what that should have been
like hmm and I really truly believe that
that's I'm choosing to be positive about
and thinking to myself like with the HTC
m9 which will talk about One m9 which
we'll talk about in a bit of course I
had that phone in my hand I said they
should see one this is the wine like
this feels right this is the one my
precious but I also don't think that
using a city like Barcelona is a is a
what was the right term for it is like
interaction you know like I don't think
it's I don't think I don't think that's
the case it's it's a cherry on top of
what we do as as people as our as our
occupation as our station that being
said I've spent this my third year here
and the last two years I've never felt
like fully safe here I've never felt
like I I really was a part of this city
but like with that block and like this
morning when I walked from this hotel to
45-minute walk all the way to uh to to
where android authority of staying yeah
that's it was a slog that was a SOG I
still enjoyed myself because it's such a
nice day is mine yeah I want to plaza
espana today yeah so it's worth at the
old fear or the old env WC was oh well
did I forgot my wallet it was good
because intro nothing else pocket I
guess nitro tomorrow probably up kept
calm or something but um I don't you
feel about that assertion I put out
their lab you know obviously you haven't
really seen all of the phones that we're
going to see at mwc just yet if i'm not
mistaken yeah but you know am I am I out
of line there's I don't think you're out
alondra I do take a different
perspective because i think it is easy
to in our field we we all three of us
make videos right and we like making
pretty videos and it's easier to do that
when the products were pretty and
products are sort of getting prettier so
making things look good is really easy I
need always try to shy away from any
mindset that's going to make me try to
make it commercial for a product of
course and naturally right but you know
so I find myself maintaining a if I'm
airing I'm erring on the side of
critical yeah because every phone if you
think about it is what what smartphones
should
and four years ago not a man yeah really
it's so I try to retain the sense of
wonder than that because that's exciting
this you won't reasonably do this right
yes like oh but I can hold all this
power in my hand and it can still
somehow be usable and beautiful this is
amazing I didn't love what I do because
I get to play with these awesome to it
through the same time I'm like people
are gonna drop a ton of money on this
thing mmm bring out mr. cynical face
yeah oh look he's been here the whole
time so yeah I try to walk them on yeah
you try to walk but there's a but
there's a difference between being jaded
about the industry and critical and
being critical about product yes sir
right is it was a big difference because
I think when we're critical were more
passionate that we're upset that they
don't go wrong yes sir like that's why
did you God take a picture before you
handed in the south how did you think
that was the seniors black you know what
I mean like just like so like some of
these blade airs and and I'd like it we
all get critical because we're still
passionate but I think that I don't I
think that it's different that a lot of
people are just like this is predictable
I expected this of course that's not
better and like there's a there's a way
to be dismissive dismissive in your
critique and I think that that's what
I'm getting a bit bored of in the
industry and that's what I'm getting a
bit bored of in my peers yeah right yeah
totally yeah they're kind of persistent
that like you can jump over it yeah yeah
I do hear ya I do believe right get out
if you don't like that right but again
that's where that's where am I that's
where my perspective comes anymore it's
like if you hate the war guy just be
passionate about something i I'm okay
with someone who's a little bit jaded
about what it is that we do people
people who have been in this for like a
dozen years I can definitely ask you but
if you're gonna stand in the middle of
Barcelona and be dismissive about life
staring at a gaudy museum / church /
apartment and you're not having some
sort of reaction yeah i satisfy that
requirement because i didn't have a
reaction who's that I vomited in my
mouth terrible structure this
environment I don't and don't get me
wrong I am I feel amazingly good i'm
grateful that I got to experience it on
the outside two years ago on the inside
of this trip really it's something you
should see but I hate it really like it
does not did you see something so
chaotic yet so symmetrical at the same
time is not right now it was like a
bugger to our faces he's holding his
eyes cuz she's crying I you the actual
description of what's happening like you
look at you ever get that structure in
any of the structures and you think to
yourself like yeah this is such this is
the weirdest shapes that I I know that
there's just just just chaos happening
but somehow it makes sense sure you know
no like HTC yeah well before we get into
the specific devices I will I will
preface everything that you know we're
here right now it's it's so late and
we're looping delirious we're recording
before the times that we're supposed to
be broadcasting these things we're
talking about which is why you're
listening to this far after that time
and we're supposed to be sleeping
getting ready for days 0 wash starting
the event before anybody keeping this is
day four yeah they're all of us yeah I
moving for any of any of the listeners
keeping score i have not started one
video yet and you're about to see 9 come
out at the end of this stay yeah yeah so
I have a long long night ahead of me but
you know as some of my listeners do know
that's the kind of that's how I am when
it comes to these shows I didn't use you
very very late but not being said we are
like we're saying here in Barcelona for
the mobile world congress of 2015 as
always we are already into the thick of
it
a few days in we were here for HTC
frequencies that is as it is called but
of course a lot of stuff happens right
before the show and to varying degrees
we have seen some of the devices we may
not have seen all of them I probably
have seen the most out of the three of
us and we're going to talk about them a
little bit what we're probably excited
about I will lighten our hour and I will
flow into this I did mention HTC and I
do want to get agency out of the way
because we just spent an hour in five
minutes talking about it at length for a
previous podcast so the pocket our
weekly bug yes oh yes I hope that goes
up so I mean weakens given that we have
a lot of topics that we're going to talk
about because a lot of devices yeah we
don't have to go at length about the HTC
One m9 but I will ask you general
opinions on the phone itself will start
with Michael as I looked at Nicole I
keep reaching for it as I still expect
to have the review device yeah I like to
refer to um it is a it is the
manifestation of what we were
complaining about a second ago with the
people who are over it you know if you
are someone who is not easily impressed
by changes that are not visually very
apparent than this phone will infuriate
you this is it just did the same thing
again making it up you're too good at
that voice but it's not that you know
that's about subtlety on the outside and
on the inside it practiced quite a few
improvements it is not a I do not think
it is a Grand Slam device i don't think
that HTC thinks it's a grand slam device
it's not it's it's the iteration if the
sensible improvement done up in HTC's
typically excellent industrial design
and if they figure out how to sell it
it'll sell very well and they probably
will take a long time to figure out how
to sell it now if we if their history is
any indication and so I don't know
I don't know I will say that I I didn't
immediately fond of it okay I
intellectually understand that it's a
very very compelling smartphone but when
I first touched the m8 there was a
something that happened with me and it
mm-hmm the opposite of alyssa gratitude
that's right and they just didn't happen
with the m9 for me so that's just that's
my my situation okay because i think
that that thing i mentioned earlier
about how these phones are what they're
lying should be like that's how I felt
with the m9 like this is the one and I
did definitely feel that way but there
are obviously some flaws with it and you
know it was it was a mostly the camera i
think we all agreed on that cuz bit of a
misstep given that it might improve yeah
right it's pre production software and
they made it clear that its
pre-production and fingers crossed yes
play better yeah it has to mm-hmm it
must is imperative yes they should not
release it with us your general thoughts
on the phone i really liked it i was a
little like man um I love the m7 not not
so much into the enemy I think I prefer
the m9 over the m8 just because I am the
biggest klutz ever with my phones and it
is impossible for me like it's just two
slits in a bar of soap sleep walk me
while you're the white bar of soap that
will fly into your eye so I just I guess
I you know I like my friends I don't
want to kill them by the phone I can't
carry animate is such a good-looking boy
yeah and so like I think that the design
was done really really well there were
they squirt of the corners like that
they've almost overcompensated too much
with the edginess it's quite sharp but I
quite like that it feels very very
substantial I do like the two-tone I'm
excited that they launched it with four
colors here here at the show and that
the possibilities are endless for the
colors they could go with right and I
like that they're demonstrating to
tongue now and if they were to like I
like the idea of silver and black or
like
red and black or like something like
that I think I think they could make
some like really really dynamic and
interesting well bed hun sets and I
think that industrial design is going to
become increasingly something that
smartphones are gonna have to
differentiate on yes everyone she's
getting so rated it if there's something
that HTC knows very well is that their
design has always been received quite
well so you perfect let's say perfect
their design in this m9 is something
that I'm really in tune with I really do
think that they've gone in the right
direction without going so far that we
forget why we like the HTC in the first
place maybe it's just a question of
expectations for me I think when the ma
leaked which they all lead and when the
ma leaked I thought what is this
Photoshop monstrosity with this weird
second eyeball and like these two
mourners I was like up and then I held
it and then I got it instantly yeah and
now i look at the m9 and with its with
its narrow radius corners that evoke the
m7 and once again i understand that it's
very pretty but i don't think it's as
comfortable I debt you know you said it
goes that it is it's shark you know when
you handle it it's not it's not as
holdable and if you want to hold it
you've got to put a clear top view case
on it and you know then it feels like
cheap Isaac no I keep talking about the
pinch on there you know use you yeah you
have that tactile feel that you know to
grip on yeah a little bit more you know
it's true it's easier maybe I just like
a little bit of pain on yeah maybe I
need to get rid of my dishpan but it's
also that they have two lips on it right
that there's like the sharp edge of the
back and then there's that that kind of
like lip for it's not a floating display
because they look lens away for down but
it's almost that kind of aesthetic that
comes with that fluid and display look
that I really like in that if I feel
like I'm not gonna break it and I'm not
gonna drop it Wow nice way to go well
I'm a cutie to close out our talk
that particular phone I do want to make
it clear like one of the best
experiences I've ever had on a phone is
right now on this one because we had one
other phone come out with what is
supposed to be the fastest processor
available the Snapdragon 810 right and
unfortunately it just was not the right
showcase for it and we will we will
segue into that in a little bit but this
sense iteration since seven it flies
screen yeah it absolutely wants tears it
and it's funny because we've been
spending the last two or three days
being very critical issues keeping very
polar very very honest with them yeah
obviously on to an extent Oh tin extent
yes to an extent and um seeing how
smooth and fast this operating system is
and how how much fun it is to use
because of just how nice it looks and
smooth and goes through transitions very
well and I can I can use the recent apps
screen like so so so seamlessly I
realized I really am the kind of person
that notices stutter and I'm in an
interface I always used to let it slide
but now we're coming in and I would love
to hear you guys thoughts on this we're
coming into an era of smartphone
technology wear stuff like stutters are
so much more scrutinized because we know
what kind of processes were getting so
she in something like the 810 which is
being marketed as being the most
powerful processor out there and then we
have something like the LG G flex 2 that
just did not live up to that expectation
we and I thought maybe the 810 is not
quite what we thought it would be but it
wasn't that case once we got sense in
our hands but I mean like LG's never
been good at making there you are clean
fur so I'm in at the LG g3 you know
that's why I don't wait i took my can't
wait to get to a certain point later but
the UH but yeah how do you feel about
that idea cuz good boy today I had I had
the confirmation that i became that
person after after being the the the
combination of I know what a super fast
and speedy in her face feels like now on
the a 10mm and the last two days of
being encouraged to be critical I kind
of tour
alcatel a new one on this year is their
phone and they SAT us down and Jason god
bless the god bless you and your
colleagues who sat down said give us
your honest feedback and this click went
off in my head you were home by three
days I said I wouldn't feedback yeah
yeah I said what what processors in here
that is the 610 in their case and their
their skin on the phone that they are
releasing here at our launching or
announcing here at mwc is a very light
skin on top of lollipop and what I
noticed was that the lolipop elements
were nice and smooth but the alcatel
elements were the ones that stuttered
and struggle to come out and I oh my god
i told i pointed out every single time
it happened and when I was done I was I
feel so bad yeah and and and that camera
on the idol church I mean look how good
it looks and I'm like tap tap I'm like
are you sure do that there's some really
horrifying things I'm seeing on the
screen I think I was like that was it
literally I'm like this do you have ID
I'm kidding but I mean like the
potential for that phone actually i
think is quite good yes but i think i
think it's early i can't judge them too
hard on the stutters and um just cuz
it's still not release break yeah you're
right i'm doubtful they'll fix it yeah
right but but for that price point i'll
forgive that that's the i made that very
clear with right for that for that price
i'll be designed yeah it's beautiful
it's light or display looks nice the
camera I mean it has it has all of the
things you want to say it's got hyper or
it's got time lapse it's got you know
big you know well its got time didn't
show you the picture in the bar that
yeah so thank you they can see can see
their faces yeah I don't know what was
it it was such a subsidy they stopped
short of actually saying the price and
said sub 2 50 so it's 10 or so it's 249
okay that's why I was thinking too and
then there's a 4.7 inch
that is so why are we giving where we
are we forgetting interface lag on a
phone that's 249 when I used phones that
don't have it almost at all I've 179
well I never said that was really
forgiving it I mean for them and you
want as I said earlier no you did yeah
but you said you oh I I tend to review a
lot of Chinese phones right so like um
times manufacturers just do not do
software for her you all right they're
like it is getting a lot better right so
I actually reviewed a 1 plus phone 1
plus clone at 160 ya know for sure and
like I actually was slow to move off of
it on to another phone because you know
the camera was decent enough um the you
I was was clean there were stunners but
if you just change the transitions then
you could you could work around it yeah
right so that's my thing is that the I'm
forgiving of the stutters because then I
just take one subway ride all right sit
down and I'm like what do I do so big
about to make it better yeah hmm right
and so a lot of the time you can look at
the way that you interact with your
phone to think something like that yeah
absolutely um I'm forgiving of it
because I can take the time to fix it it
is some things you cannot sometimes you
cannot it's true sometimes you cannot
but I feel like with the alcatel phone
that you could figure out what
transitions you would turn off and what
days you would remove to make that
totally fine i was just astonished that
the person that came out once they said
give us your feedback nourison even
Darcy was looking at me like this this
very positive man just changed in front
of my eyes yeah that's what did you see
the alcatel phone yet no I took a look
at it tonight but I've seen that you
know the bellissimo oh sure yeah I
flipping that phone over I like the fact
that was reversible you pick it up in a
direction on their screen I'll flip to
the upside down kiss yeah it's an
interesting marketing strategy
yeah and everyone's going to say
spider-man but that I'm still not sure
why they were so big on pushing that
that mixer like the there's a music mix
tehreek e DJ probably to showcase the
front facing speakers where is quite
loud be we're pretty reddit yeah I've
said but the mixer the thing that I like
about it is it will tap into streaming
services nice yeah at some point google
play and Pandora will be a part of it
and it will just buffer it on one side
of the turntable and then the other side
just whatever you want so yeah I think
I've funds I one touches still one of
those companies to where like if that's
what you're promising me okay now when
you deliver her then we'll try to look
at it right it's I just can't wait to
see like a house party where the guy has
one cord into a huge sub and trying to
do DJ stuff on the phone never mind I've
seen it really mom he's like mixing
songs and I was like what would what I'm
the band I'll give my friends are nerds
doggie well I mean the stutters and you
know moving from there into let's let's
let's let's visit LG ok and they don't
have a flagship phone that they're
talking about here at mwc rather it's
for mid-range phones which you know what
I'm always excited when LG puts on
mid-range phones is that true that a
sentence that anyone has ever said that
because it isn't like the Bella you
thought the fellow is you know what it
was is uh I have this have this the one
portion of me that despite always
wanting the flagship phones and messing
with them I have let's say I have a lot
of relatives in the philippines to ask
me all the time what funds that they
should get and i always i'm thinking
about like the recent android one
release in the philippines i was all
over that that article that we put on
our website i was so happy about it and
i hope that it's successful because they
III my dad consistently goes back to the
Philippines with phones I don't use
anymore to give to our relatives oh yeah
and you know I want I want a good
experience for people out and varying
part of the way you know um but you know
the four ones also Darcy had me train
has two years ago I covered every single
Ellen F oh yeah we did that too oh my
goodness ya may not fun there are no
differences between them I did not I
made Roland do that we did that's why we
learned our lesson then we looked at the
analytics and I was it was like when
we've we didn't do many people loop them
together it / / f and Ellen I think we
did I think this didn't want to do is
just what I did to my I did I did I did
a single walkthrough I was like let me
walk down this aisle with you and I will
just shout things up call yeah they were
like somewhat bigger screen someone
bigger screen as I wonder y a
5-megapixel what LG did show us today
was me hace today was respond yeah I
know everything in the morning and i do
want i do want to be part of the reason
why i was excited to do this for this
version of the podcast was to excite you
about later best if of course what i
tell you is exciting to you but but from
LG it is obviously the wearables and you
all know about the urbane not the g
watch urbane trust me tell you one thing
no but the watch is still then there's
just the g that's not it see that was
confusing it or meeting I didn't know
yeah I didn't know about it personally I
don't know if it was true or not I I
still don't know whether to call to
watch urbane or the urbane sandwich
because there's a there's our main place
I know oh but we have a silver iteration
without the DB markings on the bezel
it's a bezel yes yeah the chronograph
there you go mmm so we've all agreed on
yeah there's Michael pounds over there
hi okay shoulda called it the number
rings
the thing you don't use yeah but also a
rose gold edition mmm rose gold edition
so did you guys already have like some
opinions on you obviously have to put on
your wrist to get a really good
fit on my wrist why don't they make a
rose gold edition hey are you know it
might because it's it's significantly
less diameter asst than the GV much
hotter right it's significantly narrower
isn't it good dog it is it is it is more
narrow it's definitely smaller than the
g watch or I will tell you that both is
that impossible are testaments chunko
this is more than the Moto 360 it no ok
yes because this is a bigger shoulders
on Tom exactly it has it what what what
it is to me the urbane is a horrible
name but also but also like the ads yeah
it's it's it is a watch electronically
you know what I mean yeah it has the
feel of an actual sort of high-end watch
like if you were to buy say a girlfriend
or yourself a michael kors watch that is
exactly what you're getting here except
it has an android wear inside and i like
that rose gold actually seemed to me
like a good choice you know especially
if not that they're specifically trying
to say that they're going for the
feminine market but i was there when the
g watch our came out and they received a
lot of flack about it because of they
stood there and told me that that was
for women yeah i was like we stood in
front of an end cap that had a pilot and
a matter of boat and then like the
leather and then like aviator glasses
like well this is for women I was like
are you kidding me like just try it on
I'm like okay it's funny you mention
them because well as a good friend Flo
was I was was was the one asking the
questions about you know this isn't that
is there gonna be an iteration of this
that is suitable for women and as she
says hi to flow as as she was saying
they're one of the
women from LG we know what's her pants
suit on and all that like she she I saw
her twitch her wrists like she knew what
she was talking about like yeah she's
right it felt like she knew it's heavy
and painful how did you feel what did
you watch are you were you the one that
covered in free go I didn't cover it and
um I thought it had admirable traits to
it but I could very easily relate to it
because like I'm dude and also it's
sometimes I go into the woods to walk
around and if I were slaves that she
loves it yeah but but I don't know I
didn't love it I thought that the bezel
was was too thick i thought the numbers
in the bezel were totally unnecessary
yes and I didn't 0t easy right it didn't
wrote it not that that makes a
difference because I don't I just spin
it when I'm nervous you know like yeah
but which is always their positions yeah
there are times the screen is beautiful
um in there are times that I don't want
to bring my moto 360 into because I bash
that thing on door jambs you know I'm
clumsy and it's it's held up well yeah
but if I beat up the do you watch our
I'm going to feel a lot less bad than if
I beat up my my 360 so it has a place is
like a working Rams or in road where
watch so what does so what does a fully
polished metal frame compared to gia
watch are a little bit smaller yeah what
would that say to you having already
used if you watch our to me it doesn't
do it doesn't do anything for me because
I don't think I don't think it's a very
elegant casing from what I've seen we
mentioned the watch brackets the band
bracket on top and bottom then yes it
looks like a watch yeah I'd like the
conventional idea of a watch is active
the to me that's rather generic i bought
a moto 360 because i like it's like that
it's a circle they decided to make like
a can and and make it that minimal and
make the screen go and then and not have
these these things taking up with
distracting you from the circle except
of the flat tire and then the shitty
screen and a bad processor and all that
kind of stuff yeah and it's a delusion
is sort of broken i will admit when you
loo you look at the watch screen off and
you're like oh you know that looks like
a watch and then screen comes on you're
like well I expected that and then you
turn it around and the back has the
harbor
alright I'm just like and of course the
heart rate monitors on the actual
wearables Android wearables haven't
really been like great I know no one's
far as volume oh the the band is genuine
leather real stitching it rather than
fake that's good so the honest there's
certain elements to it that they're
trying to get right you know I don't
know if it's cuz it's like 145 in the
morning but I am animal when I can't
play in the wearable space but I'm so
bored of this conversation because yeah
because worry no no because because it
doesn't make sense to me that we're
iterating a brand new category of device
into something that was 250 years old
the first pocket watch was 250 years ago
and why are we like praising a device
that looks like something from a million
years ago trying to be like well now
let's innovate how we're going to use
this but let's jam it into something
that has nothing to do with what we're
trying to do with it like I just I'm so
and then like but like blazing but its
true like you guys sit there and you
debate the virtues of how watch like it
is and it's the metal stir the leather
strap with the stitching but you want
all the high quality things and you want
the luxury and you want all these
amazing things but why if we're
technology degree the lists are we not
like more engaging on like why why is
Android wear so crap what would we
actually do with a SmartWatch like what
what what do you want out of it is it
simply a notification screen right like
all of these other things and I'm just
like why are we still doing this and it
has it's only been a year terrified that
is what I'm like right now what its
gonna be like in a year they better give
me a SmartWatch what actually works for
women soon or else I'm just gonna be
like I was in the direction of your
frustration back in new phone when I was
on your podcast and on your live stream
yeah and by the way like it seems that
during these trade shows we are going to
be the trifecta collabera
every single time it so burned out any
choice why are we doing this again are
we talking about wearables yeah I don't
want to be on one Accord some new facts
about watch history she can't talk
friends all I'm not gonna be there
doesn't know the chronograph a this is
well yeah I remember remember voicing a
similar opinion if technology the way
technology has become so great aside
from just you know becoming ubiquitous
in our lives is that it has owned its
own form factor yeah and watches just
orange technologies you know you and you
know I kind of got made fun of because I
kept using the job we have to own it
technology has to own this is where i'm
using the word million yeah strong right
now I got a milieu trove yeah yeah yeah
solid solid solid vernacular but you
know and we don't have to talk about the
settling this next part but they do have
the urbane LTE yeah okay so tell me
everything all right so this is
essentially LG creating their own
version of the timex triathlon the
garmin forerunner the super high 299
dollar one but this one will probably be
something like five hundred dollars I
bet you I'm not changeable band because
inside of it are the actual antennas for
LTE gps bluetooth okay all right it's
snaps on and it is huge it is big i
think if you thought that you watch i
was big this one because you can't
change the band it just feels like you
are putting on a shackle like it oh yeah
it's like an arm cuff not a what it has
the limit of one of those super crazy
digital watches from from leg as a feel
of that from the 90s okay with the G
watch our aesthetic so it's not but it's
not the same casing as the webos watch
from CES know the audi boyd subject yeah
no it's not
this is its own standalone thing and
speaking of iOS they put so many changes
into the webos interface for this LCD
edition that they're not calling it what
the less it's the LG watch it's the LG
wearable platform yeah because webos has
a very specific connotation exactly yeah
in a discussion I will say the interface
is quite lovely that is this particular
one it's a circle earlier ok and having
the connectivity there was great but
what we were told was it's not made for
connectivity with a SmartWatch it's
supposed to be completely standalone
with a smartphone it's not not it's not
made it's not been right with a smart
exactly which to me sounds a little odd
I'm still not quite there when it comes
to devices like this well I've been
figuring out the Omate for a while so I
kind of have the concept of like this is
by itself and I actually kind of like it
because I I often try to disconnect mmm
so if I'm being let me leave my phone
but I'm gonna try something else so if
someone really needs to get ahold of me
or something like that then I do have
this on those times where I'm like bad
at disconnecting so I've been trying to
use like that oh wait a little bit and
so i get i get the moment where that's
useful actually ok yeah like not not as
like a i had one sent to me and i didn't
pay for it and i reviewed it run right
but I don't you know I don't I don't
know who was gonna go and buy this but I
do see if I have one kicking around that
I do kind of like it I can't wear it
every day but the only it's not really
meant for everyday use i think i spent
like four weeks trying to get that with
the gear s they're trying to understand
that that thing that people there's
always that commenter when you do a
SmartWatch pieces like until it's
self-contained I don't wanting and do
with it I'm like I don't understand why
that is why would you want that so yeah
and I keep like I but I feel you well
you know I need it was only the
smartphone home for a second and just
like I would still be connected on the
wrist it was cool to play like Inspector
Gadget for a bit yeah and to be like oh
I go to whatsapp right let me read it
let me because like the keyboard cool
and like honestly you have that like wax
but this is what but this is the very
height of impracticality right I mean
yes it's you everything you do on it is
frustrating because you can't just money
I get fed up with a android wear pebble
I'm just like I'm this is just wish my
phone you're getting funny thing but
when that is your phone it's like I
poked I need to punch someone in the
face no this is like to it's cumbersome
let's get again so I don't understand I
don't know really how I could fit this
yeah but I mean like the original Oh
mate was for extreme sports Wow right
yeah well I do those all the time too
there's a swipe really i do lots of
extreme there's a little love of fitness
fitness tracking that they're trying to
sort of push with this one but it is
supposed to be an all-in-one device and
i did play around with a call and the
message stuff like at the very top of
the imaginary watch our and right above
the chronograph is a small slip for a
speaker and then right below the bottom
of the chronograph is a small slit for
the speaker so you're gonna be able to
take calls and stuff like that much like
the Garas um but then actually keyboard
on that didn't didn't really frustrate
me as much um you know it's still small
and if you're gonna you're gonna sit
there and going like this for a long
time you gonna look like him is it has
swype i didn't check actually I'm sorry
just a touch typing right now that I
didn't even yeah I was like is that
honest like swype on those one on the
watch screens no problem oh really
whatsapp chat with you ten minutes no
way okay yeah don't don't believe I'm
gonna take many photos of myself next
time I do that okay it's such an odd
thing though because that fitness
tracking one like it has the GPS it has
the ability to track a lot of stuff
there's a heart rate monitor on it also
but you know it's still large and I
don't wanna say it was too heavy but it
definitely was more cumbersome than your
let's say pebble like the one I'm
wearing but if I was running my left arm
will probably be stronger than my right
on because of uh yeah yeah alright so I
wanted to move into I want to change
switch gears a little bit we will talk
about samsung and i will give you guys
you know the somewhat you know info that
i that i have and how i feel about it
and you can tell me but was there
anything I here at mwc that you were
actually looking forward to those
outside what we may know of already did
you have something sort of on the skirts
like maybe a sewn even though we heard
component at
they're not really pushing mobile as
much anymore totally good not it's not
sounding for me but I told they have one
yeah oh yeah I totally okay yeah mine is
from your favorite company goal oh yeah
well stay on your favorite company or
what is your favorite company oh well
mine is from your second favorite is to
sis's for laptops sony or grab something
for smartphones a sous uh should teased
there's in zum-zum at CES but wouldn't
let it out from under the plastic box
you seen here wow they are there
nothing's did read that there at the
Trump Hotel their third a day do they
have somebody here yes good because
they're little teen didn't come out it's
it's that's why it's the people you
introduced to meet you yes the people I
met because of you but no when my people
told me they weren't here they like you
more I'm kidding oh god wait do they
tell you well oh right I'm sorry this is
we'll talk about it off there but not
know if they good to be there okay fine
and that was 90 seconds I go drinking
with even more like with the tab last
time right no but what about you so this
is the soon what is it is Anton soon
okay i want to see that really that I've
wanted to see it for a while and it did
you know who I love this sort of sub
movement of manufacturers who are doing
this thing where it's like it's a camera
it can also be a phone but it's a cat I
know like the Panasonic thing oh I can't
wait for that lenovo vibes and the sis
is doing really good with their camera
technology where they calling it the
pics of pixel which is so much faster
yeah yeah they're doing really well with
that they beautify is disgusting oh you
get pointy chin you put it on my lowlife
butterfly box
and that's under two hundred dollars and
fun yeah I just and this thing is built
with a big old I Lumia like Oreo in the
mac obvious they're pushing the camera I
want to see what they can do when
they're actually like saying yeah look
at this yeah it's in heaven yeah I
remember I see yes they wouldn't let out
the case it wouldn't let out of the
bottle actually what they did I got to
hold it no great that they would
probably do anything yeah so that when
they told me that no don't say that
about I still took a shot of myself
taking a picture with it just yeah I
would have done the same thing yeah
exactly I was still like what's the
camera lies you know like I wish I could
tell you it was there yeah mine I mix it
well i miss Emma cited for two things
the two things that I want to track down
on the show floor when it opens I want
to go see the yellow tablet yes and I
want to go see the as a project ara
right at four oh yeah yeah those are the
two things that I'm kind of King for
because like I saw everyone forgets this
but ZTE at their booth last two year two
years ago shield under glass a modular
phone actually they had three different
examples for how they thought the phone
of the future would look like and i made
a video about it now success no mods
convenient no one watched it nobody
cared i was just like really and then
like literally four weeks later predict
era was announced and i was like guys
but CTE totally to do that nobody Carol
dabrander yeah I am I guess I could
cause see that assoc back one ZT you put
it out because yeah I people probably
looking at like a modular phone that I
have to put together myself yeah so I
don't go to korean BBQ that wasn't there
yet yeah
why are they cooking my own food yeah
buddy I I gave you with that Toki it
slipped my mind to it I was supposed to
put it on our list and I didn't gotta go
you're welcome fellas you're one of the
coaches who saves my ass remember thing
oh yeah yeah just fight you're watching
I from me I'm looking I think I've seen
what I've wanted to see already in terms
of like you know what I want to set
aside in my mind you know that but you
know I'm always I'm always willing to
look at the fringe products i love
visiting archos oh yeah still love our
cousin will never do another archos
review but i still love seeking pathetic
exactly you have to say they've been
making tablets longer than anybody yes
and the reason why is because they
started off making portable media
players so uh way back in the day like
05 and I had a PMP and it was like the
eighth think because you had to fit a
laptop hard drive in there it's and then
had a little joystick and I used to
watch i watch that kill bill on that
thing I remember was great and this nice
to see them in the Android space because
some of that language translates to
their current smartphones is that French
carbonaceous yeah yeah it's like
articles yeah so yeah you know I don't
have too much that I'm itching to see
that's outside of what I know I'm gonna
see anyway hmm but if I had to say I
love seeing the French products i love
seeing about the ones that don't
necessarily get the most traffic on our
site but it's still interesting you know
what's funny is to look like I feel like
the wearables has a is it ever growing
sort of dumping ground of sort of
half-assed products every time I come to
a trade show I sort of forget that
there's a lot of crappy smart watches
out there and i'll be walking past rows
of them it's always the same ride for me
cuz I'm was like oh sweet oh these look
awesome and then that the crushing
disappointment of like oh these are just
dummies eh just dummies because you
haven't figured out how to build this
yet the cool concept or be like Oh
literally a dummy yeah
yeah it's a widget on your race where
it's like one of the super minimal ones
it's like super niche target I got a lot
of people like the way things thing and
them because I don't care about what
it's just a step tracker and yeah yeah
my size yeah that's fine yeah okay here
we go so once again to it right so um
hopefully our lives and we're going to
be going over my usual a lot of time but
I'm perfectly fine with that because you
know we're having the conversation this
is our first since the pilot live
episode of the Friday debate podcast all
the rest of the telecommuting so you
always have that clock on the side
telling you one and hours coming up oh
but this one no it's not really phasing
too much because I know we're gonna get
into it great conversation all right so
i hope the listeners have been enjoying
this hang in an hour that's that's
that's that's really half of what i was
really hoping this was going to be and
i'm happy about that right but now mmm
samsung samsung TV in front of us
actually i just realized no way there's
just a rare la how permanent that I
recognize that just now um so we spoke
about this a little bit earlier um yes
there has been there have been a few
briefs on this particular day but this
like I said this podcast is coming up
far before after i should say for after
the embargo times so you notice that our
conversations are back in time hmm
Michael you told me that you've heard
but there is needed to be heard about
the samsung device what is it that
you've heard I've heard that it's made
of metal and glass and that these things
work together to make it I know this
sounds like a snarky stan is really a
bird that it's glass up top metal and it
looks beautiful so that's whatever I've
heard it is as far away from the dimpled
plastic nonsense as you can get I've
heard some people say it's the most
beautiful samsung phone they've ever
held I have heard some people say that
it's more impressive than the m9 in
terms of its look and feel I've heard
all kinds of crazy things not many of
them negative about this way okay i have
to corroborate the positivity damn that
one wolf I I was sitting there ready to
be underwhelmed by what might be yet
another weird move by Samsung to put
maybe there are two heart rate monitors
of the bag you put two fingers on this
extra accurate but I was expecting to be
underwhelmed by whatever innovation they
had but as the slides were being
presented each thing made me think
Samsung finally listened and every next
thing they said was another thing I
wanted on a phone hmm and it's insane
it's insane and then I got the thing in
my hand we're not even talk about the SS
its s6 edge yet good which we
technically we don't really have to
because the edges are if you've held if
you mess with a note edge it's two of
them yeah both sides are edge ya don't
need them well one side now let me give
you the one feature of the edge that's
actually really cool now if you if
you've used the note edge you know that
it's a information panel yeah when it's
off you uug eugenie wipe it and then and
it comes up at the time and the weather
know it to be fair when it's off you
swipe a turd a couple times and then it
acts like you don't exist I'm not stupid
sweet spot that gives it away okay here
you see Robin you know what I'm so glad
that my last stop which is interrupted
cuz i was going to say really awkward so
yeah okay um so that's that's the left
panel the right panel is a people calls
and messaging oh and I wants a messaging
people on calls and when you swipe from
us from from that area you get a quick
widget with all of your contacts so you
can easily just call people so the idea
is this in your right hand you swipe
over you hit the person's face and then
you start calling all right but you will
sign a color to each one
and what happens is if your phone is
upside down that edge that comes up from
off the ground off the table i should
say if you're getting a call from
somebody but your phone is upside down
and silent it will glow the color you
picked that person from the
demonstration we have showed him getting
a call from his colleague and it looked
like a ricer like a like a like a like a
JDM import tuner car the bottom portion
goes around back yeah thanks Ron which
wish you know what I have to say when
that happened I was like that's cool but
why I'm just very presupposes that you
put your phone facedown your current
phone okay know if you are being polite
out with people you put your phone
facedown because it shows that you're
gonna need you okay all right or the
other notification like like some it's
annoying and all I can I get it but but
but this phone looks so dumb I'm side
down on the table with a flare of that
curve how many times did you get a phone
call in a week or get a phone call in a
week that thought came up later it was
like I will never be able to use that
yeah it is exactly the kind of feature
the temps I would have put in the galaxy
s4 because like this is this is from
that era of thinking where it's like
yeah we're gonna get a bunch of people
at a party together they all have galaxy
s4 so they're all gonna be independent
speakers and it was gonna have a great
party like it's like they're going in
the lab well therein lies the segue
okays because that's that's that's
basically the main feature of the s6
edge that I can give you right now and
it's not that there are many more but
that's the one that they presented to us
and to be honest the s6 edge actually
economically feels pretty good whereas
the note edge was really weird because
this guy they added enough of a rim to
it that you can hold it comfortably and
the smaller size at 5.1 inches makes it
a lot easier to hold that's all racial
okay so give it that don't give you that
much you have me I'm interested again
okay yeah with what you put it in your
hand you like wow this actually feels
really right here you know s4 how did
you feel about the S whores
like in general as foreign to the most
boring flex your phone I've ever
reviewed really yeah it was pecking the
things that we was packed with to make
it unboring Lord didn't work right or
were honest favorite galaxy a lot of
them I am so sorry i was this a is for
go TS or i go see know what I mean I
galaxy yes yeah uh history because
otherwise would be no for but that's
what for me ah yes I'm as to ya s2 was a
lot of people favorite I think yeah that
was like I thought was well worth well
regarded yeah like the camera to today
still looks good yeah we havenít
surrealism cuz i really wasn't convinced
by i have one studies i think is like I
wasn't bloom were we in the industry
when there's two ozone as he was the
first absolutely free from you I did for
me was technically yes for I was in the
middle as in the interim between this to
me for the ps4 was boring so boring see
the s-1 was the first time I features
right about all of them I'm relevance
for every egg it was it would like the
s4 to screamed at you the entire time
you had to deal with it central away
with the s5 which I'm sure it's nothing
yeah exactly a surprise but the espera
was the first one that when I put it in
my hands they given given that the you
know I have was just in the industry for
a little while before that when I put
into my hands it just kind of fit and
you know the flat sides and it was just
the right size it was really it felt
right you know and I mean he's not
phrase a lot but you know that that's
the thing I know he's no I bring that up
is because the best way for me to
describe the design of the s6 is that it
is a metal and glass as for in the sense
that it's the same side it has the same
deal it has the same like but this is a
thing sure they can't look like no it
doesn't it doesn't it has the has the
tapered edges on the size of the note
that's what the s4 felt like that like
to you yeah set my long time ok so maybe
to you because I crack to I that s for
cost me 400 extra dollars I cracked it
is like twice playing you don't even so
I'm like that feels like crap well I'm
glad that I can share my
my reactions of the field because that's
what I felt but I will tell you that all
these suspicions that people have that
you may have about it are completely
true is the best iphone 6 clone you have
ever seen right down to the speaker
grill on the bottom that is in the same
placement as the iphone 6 1 now the
difference is between the two and I wish
I have my camera to show you or that the
edges of the metal on the sides are very
much like the milk force what there's
just a tape would lift yes that's nice
the corner buttresses look like it has
its own tropes it has its own tiny
little design languages but when you put
them side by side with the slight curve
on the sides of 2.5 d glass if you will
it is definitely it's going that's the
vitriol is going to get it's too much
like it and it felt to me that samsung
said we know exactly why people love the
iphone 6 we don't have that in android
yet we'll do it it's the mandroid iphone
6 no but like to be fair the iphone 6 is
it is an amazing fun yes nama qui to me
that's when i went there the hardware
feels great the camera yes how's the
camera ok so the camera yeah we have a
now I'm blinking I'm blinking on though
I'm blinking on the front cameras
megapixels I want to see Jay and then
the rear is 16 and what we have what we
have there you can I don't have the info
I think my phone died actually but um
1.9 temperature which is nice and low
auto live HD are on both sides on both
cameras with smart OAS on the rear what
has he what makes it smart well it
wasn't something that they iterated but
i think it's the it's the same oh yes
that was on the note 4 that's why i was
which is an amazing camera yeah like
never before straight up that's an
amazing if I would carry a phablet I
would be carrying the note 4 mm front is
5 megapixel 598 sorry yeah I thought it
sounded like too much the interface on
the camera allows you to to get into a
manual mode that includes manual focus
nice yes and
the various elements or just buttons on
the screen it does look a little bit
nicer though once you hit like the pro
mode it gets a little cluttered the
various and modes are still in there
like you know the pro mode is nice and
then the selective focus is there
obviously too and whatnot it felt like a
samsung camera still just somewhat
different but I'll obviously the claims
of super great picture quality is
something we have to figure out later
yeah I mean like I can only imagine that
it would be better than what their do
demand note for ya never was so good
yeah yeah I absolutely think so too and
associati but I had a sub 2 point 0
aperture so the point mine the metal
styling like how did it like you're
saying it feels good but like how do how
does the actual metal feel that's where
that's why the analogy to the iphone 6
comes in because it is as thin it has
the glass back so it feels a little bit
like an experian that way but really
when you have it in your hand the metal
feels cold to your touch and it's just
narrow enough that you're able to have a
grip on it that's super great and it's
also very light thumb it's a very light
phone so once i did my comparison video
with the iphone 6 it felt like i was
holding the same phone how many million
pairs this is this the battery and it's
something like twenty six eighty they
brought it down in size didn't they yes
because the operating that the the
processor and this is the part that I
wanted to get to it because I need to
talk to you about the software oh yeah
me too I need to ask you about yeah we
need to talk about the software via the
processor yeah worldwide globally XE
knows no more call common right and a
bit of a precedent I have to say ah that
makes me hella nervous because we get
the exodus versions in Taiwan and they
are nowhere near as good no that would
they were not compared to the crate
snapdragons and that is not what the
a-10 but it's the you I experience no I
know but the big gooey well the UI has
been updated to the lollipop edition
obviously
and there are a lot of aesthetic changes
to it it actually kind of feels like
they've minimized it a little bit
they'll go a little bit I won't say a
lot there there are certain elements to
it that have an optimized for us
particular experience and the one that
will get that wow factor from you is the
double tap the home button to launch the
camera now what you're gonna do is you
got double tap that thing and within a
fraction of a second let's have the the
home button that the camera just sort of
slides up from the bottom and the
fraction of a second cool and the best
way for me to describe it is that most
if not all the interface feels like that
and hold super surprised I was in court
I was floored and this is why I keep
bringing up the idea that this is where
we're scrutinizing performance so much
because these process are supposed to be
amazing right you know there's really no
excuse for yeah and if you can't nail
move it around your your home screens
like help like what hope do you have of
doing anything I do obviously we will
when we're doing our actual reviews
these opinions might change we're in the
thick of liking I'm sure but I honestly
I I was floored by what what what that
software performance was like now the
most important question about the
software experience is when you tap on
interface elements does the phone make
us sound like you're dripping watery in
a cup no oh thank god see this i'm
saying analyze a little bit you know and
it just feels like yeah i mean briefing
is still there which lavigne you can
take it out though you could yeah uh but
I know I I did I hit the recent apps
button and I kept going to the cards and
I went everywhere else and then it
brought down the notification drop down
and I just really didn't feel like I was
being slowed down at all that's great oh
yeah okay great okay I think that though
is the experience I have a note for the
note for didn't didn't bog down on
almost every the s5 even was speeding
when I when I reviewed it it will give
us the excellence s5 was a disaster the
Exynos versions of all those rich
worship yeah totally that was always the
case but the Snapdragon one we're good
almost but it so it has been about speed
so much I'm in touch with still is heavy
and it feels heavier over time and
that's a problem but it just ugly as sin
so have they fix that like do the is it
at all modern it's still colorful and
bubbly and you know but but but it to me
it didn't feel anything like the note
for TouchWiz I have to say it didn't
feel like it while it still punched you
in the face with color and some of its
features are still in your face because
of the notification drop down it somehow
felt very different so the transitions
when you hit an application it's sort of
like floats in from the bottom and then
comes up and then when you hit the home
button slides down as if you're putting
it away and they are very very hate to
say it but very iOS like movements in
and out of applications and menus and be
because of how smooth they were because
of how it felt like there wasn't much
keeping it from doing what I had to do
it was a very interesting experience
Samsung made it very clear to us at our
briefing that they wanted to go back to
fundamentals to create a phone that
focused on what they knew was right and
what they knew was going to work and
just refine on those things so from a
design standpoint I think they succeeded
despite what other inspirations came
from and it feels great it looks pretty
great because the the backings on these
are all translucent so it's not just
like a solid color but because it's
glass it have that reflection you could
almost feel like you can see right
through the back so design actually is
pretty good or maybe the software
experience and and and the performance
to me it's I don't know they might have
hit it out of the park at this point how
are they doing the waterproofing now
that wasn't really presented and I know
Darcy asked that question what I don't
have
that information right now and those if
they remove that that's gonna be a huge
I think thanks that's terrible that's
terrible it's a requirement um now that
I have it yeah like after I got having
it on the s5 having had on the z3 um I
think all phones should just be
waterproof i mean i don't i don't see
like after having it I don't see why i
wouldn't have that nursery like as like
a protective option of just against
accidents if i'm going to keep this
expensive device for this long how many
times has someone spilled a drink on my
phone sure I mean I may be held at the
bar too much I don't know but maybe not
even like it's just one of those things
in the condensate I live in a country
that's quite hot yeah and you put your
phone you do you put your phone down
beside a drink and then suddenly sitting
in a puddle yeah you know it's just like
it and I've had phones that I've taken
in it like you dropped it or it's wet
inside I'm just like that's just two
minute at this country I'm sorry I
brought this foam from a trial and to a
wetland right right so it for me it is
really important that that it has done
hmm yeah good I don't think this was
this representative said because I spend
half the year on it and the beach or on
a boat so it's very important to me too
okay but I think we are a huge minority
of people I've never had someone asked
me like he's like oh man I need a
wonderful film event unless this was
like someone who worked on a boat so I I
think it's a really specific thing I get
that from women yeah yeah I've started
tracking that actually huh um yeah I've
actually started tracking that among
among my friends when we go through
features that would want and I'll throw
it out there I'm like it what about
waterproof women more than men say yes
to that huh yeah I just feel like they
made me put it into the s5 thinking that
a lot of people were gonna hail this is
a great is a great thing and I killed no
one really talked about it after you
know it wasn't it wasn't covered very
well in the Howard little section of the
press
no fair I guess I guess so but I think
it's a great feature I I don't remember
if it certainly wasn't explicitly
articulated in the presentation well I
mean if they've gone that fin the
waterproofing is one of the things that
will stop it from being that thin and
Samsung did you the seals on it so then
would add to the thickness and if
there's a really thin phone then they
may not be in there well going deeper
into the specs there was a yes txt knows
it's going to be a visit as a 14
nanometer processor which was going to
help it with its power consumption given
the smaller battery ish smaller inch
battery um ddr4 ram mm-hmm let me see
here what else is there Oh fast charging
in half an hour we'll get you like
something like a lie okay I believe it
was a best charging is also becoming
something that's more yeah wireless card
over fifty percent of chur wireless
charging built-in yeah for both
standards for all the center section
said yes and they are going to push the
great yeah they are going to push their
samsung pay with theirs their version of
it but it's via NFC the second standard
and barcodes so they're trying to cover
every single spectrum so that you will
always have an option when you're using
the Samsung i'll never be excited about
that yeah I wasn't too sure about either
like it's like I tried google wallet
when it first came out on the guys nexus
and I had a great time the carrier's got
in and started singing with the secure
element then they had to dick around and
do that and now I Apple pay is the thing
oh and so many support half the nose or
more about the which retail
establishments have it was like it's
just a big more ass and now your Samsung
say no no what we can do it too but
they'd say that they could do all of
those standards but the thing but the
thing about Samsung they saw the
fingerprint yes it's a it's a press type
now no longer swipe that is good news
yes but that's the thing about Apple pay
is that it's frictionless right because
because of the fingerprint reader when
you just bring it near it's frictionless
right the screen light
and you decide if that's what you want
then you swipe right with Google look
these enter your passcode open it up
yeah right and then sometimes the system
will recognize as a card sue the
designer put in your pin alright so I
mean like the levels of friction for
Google Wallet are still quite high
whereas an Apple pay it's frictionless
I'm quite certain that Samsung pay right
wheels so if there is an android version
on a phone that is first and less then
that could be quite interesting yeah I'm
quite certain that they mainly made a
big deal about how their version of pay
will cover ninety percent of all the
places available in the terminals and
say okay all right um I didn't get to
the the other like obvious spec 5.1 inch
screen quad HD move likes well over 500
pixels per inch yeah waste waste of
resources total waste of resources yeah
I'm trying to avoid but is it like yeah
like this great importance gonna like
blow my mind it screams at you it
absolutely screams at you super amoled
like I said it jumps out of the screen
of my tree zoom in the face yeah and
yeah those words you know it's feeling
like and it's it just constantly felt
like you know they're packing in a lot
of these specs that if you're into the
spike Wars you're gonna be satisfied no
but not not one specific subset of
people you know who people who have
bought samsung phones for generation
after generation because they have two
things removable battery an expandable
memory yes these are the new agey yes
thank you for reminding oh my god right
but this is also out of me but yeah this
is this is also a this is also what they
were saying is going back to just the
fundamental it's just like what is in
there is what you get and it should work
already and if they succeed in that
ensure 32 16 32 128 64 all of those
still available actually not 16 i think
that's not thing anymore but um the so
you know the hope is obviously that this
phone will be able deliver on all fronts
and it didn't really feel like it might
because you have such a lightweight
package in an attractive package and a
metal back
it has all of you that has all of the
features that at one point or another
you tried and you said I want this M
minus those two obviously right now but
those are two really big ones yeah
they're certainly the ones people get
vocal about yeah oh oh but we are no
microSD card slot no expandable storage
when you get two years of 100 gigabytes
onedrive events were here right now he'd
be throwing a table I'm not just so what
I just said I would be uploading all the
time it's true oh you're using my
connections yeah so that's that's the
story of the samsung galaxy s6 australia
that wireless charging thing is
admirable I yes wish they had fully
leveraged that opportunity to do
something no other OEM is done and put
the wireless charger in the box mmm you
pitching something accessories an
accessory that's gonna cost them more
money and it's never gonna see the
adoption that they could yeah if I'm
some manufacture didn't decide to eat
some money and just try and push this
this thing I just really look forward to
when you get that phone in your hands
and to see what you're actually are here
your first very visceral reaction is
because the first thing you're going to
feel how light it is how comfortably
it'sit's if you thought that the iphone
6 was a great way design phone that this
comes very close honestly and I'm saying
that on the android authority podcast so
yes I have now lost all credibility as
I'm sure all the YouTube comments will
say horrible fanboy I don't know if I'm
ready to live in a world with a
beautiful samsung phone that's not a
note for an alpha you know I think it's
about time though it's beyond time yes
well and and if we if we kind of look at
what the rest of the landscape looks
like 4 flex it bones in that space this
is this this is it for like basically
for mwc right okay right like it has to
be the headliner well I mean
it's just timing wise and everything
else they everyone's gonna put it say
that the m8 right and that's not that's
not a enough of a design change is that
the s6 is a huge design change oh yeah
like a huge design chain to do me a huge
risk no on that and then I'm sad that
Samsung's gonna steal the show again and
really in the BR and it's also sad in
the sense that they're doing it was so
so few things it's just the one fun
we're not getting new tablets when I get
any wearables or like a mid-range phone
well thank god they're stopping back is
they honestly weren't very good at
wearables I'm glad maybe taking a break
hold on let's maybe go back to the dr
okay turned out but it's crazy that you
know i was standing in that room and
there only two tables with three of each
of either phone and I said I said to
myself yeah this is gonna be the one
everyone talks about is the one
everyone's gonna love you know because I
I'm having a weird reaction to it right
now like I'm actually holding an S line
phone and I love it hmm it's great
that's what I mean that's police in a
very recent apps have recent apps have
recent apps happen no slow now because I
got no problems in my matches notes
that's impressive yes that's the other
thing that I wanted to say early /
suspicious okay what did it make sense
though that they would be able to fully
optimize the operating system on their
own processor that would make sense that
if you'd heard Joshua hope this is a
second name-dropping second project is
about a non-tech talking about how those
things run like they're just apparently
there are some laughable oversights and
how and how those those processors
operate and and they're not as efficient
as they could be if they were designed
better Casey but if who cares if the
operating system flows like that yeah
and it's and it happens when you take
home a production device yes and it's
not in the demo room um then that's
awesome yep but you have some
inefficiency i'll sacrifice seven
percent of battery life just you know
because they wanted to get it on the
market now and so they're six months
from now it sort of fine it runs great
then
use your own trips and the absolutely on
alright it wonderful how often you still
get to you know have your phones be a
showcase for your products and like a
just a destination point for your
assembly lines of components like this
yeah hey cool move them absolutely and
who knows the fact that this version of
XE knows will prove itself to the point
where it's something that's put into
other phones other other manufactures
phones Samsung Taiwan that happen I know
they finally love it well I mean I
really looking forward to seeing what
you guys think of it afterwards no cuz
you've given we were given such a small
amount of time to mess around with it
but I was satisfied with every little
bit of it aside from you know why our
universe is iphone 6 that's good to hear
that I mean at the same time I'm I'm
glad that we've got like a phone that's
not disappointing from Samsung yeah yeah
yeah you know right two generations yeah
yeah and I am asked to be excited yeah
and and and the fact that you know that
everyone's gonna go and buy it or it's
gonna be the benchmark for your
comparisons and all the other flagships
are going to come out and if it's
legitimately a great product that I'm
excited to try to take it down yeah
right yeah be great to do comparisons to
it not because we want the key word
because it's a legitimate embarrassing
yeah yeah but so I mean though that that
that maybe makes 2015 more exciting yeah
it definitely does yeah yeah I I'm still
not convinced the TouchWiz is gonna be
great it's not gonna look the way you
wanted to observe it but I just couldn't
get over just how how nice it was and
and I understood where they they cut
corn my cook corners well where they
sort of changed it up to make it seem as
faster than it might be night might or
might not be in production units and
again iphone 6 in one hand galaxy s6 and
the other certain elements look exactly
the same from one to the other mm-hmm
like to like to like open up open a
folder when you get the chance on that
thing background blurs and it floats
into their face really
really um I love this don't get away
with sure like that open and close
applications and you'll see that while
it's a different type of animation it's
the same speed um when you lock the
phone it fades out in a very nice way
you know there's certain things to it
they all do we just got done last job
talking about HTC's stealing stuff from
a v8 right yeah and you know it's a all
everybody steals from each other i get
it's just samsung did it so good you
know because the question is always what
do you guys never give anybody else
about samsung of his takes crap from you
guys like a samsung did it blatantly for
a long time and got their asses sued for
it and if that legal battle still
continues and you know what no one at
the briefing i was at and despite there
being a small group but still no one
said anything even when I was right in
front of the design the person who gave
us the presentation yeah we were in
comparison cuz they're worried about
losing access I wonder what that's like
pretty thank you nevermind I I felt like
I felt little weird doing my comparison
in front of them because I I wasn't sure
if able to say anything most felt like
they were be almost felt like Samsung
knew what they were doing they know what
the going for spots are going to get in
terms of that comparison mm-hmm and
they're just like yeah okay but in any
case stay tuned to android authority for
when we get our hands on the galaxy s6
and all of the other phones from mwc
2015 but also tune into the pocket now
