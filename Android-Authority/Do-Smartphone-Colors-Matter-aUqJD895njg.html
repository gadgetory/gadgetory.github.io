on everybody and we're here to give a
bit of commentary and just to have a
discussion about this trend that we've
been noticing in 2018 s flagships the
fact that color seems to be a feature
again and by that we mean that color is
no longer something that you just sort
of gloss over because the manufacturers
themselves are paying very deep
attention to the way that their phones
actually look more so than in recent
years it seems so the obvious question
here that we would be posing to you and
we encourage you to let us know what you
think in the comment sections down below
is if color truly matters to you when it
comes to selecting a smartphone and if
so why and it's funny because when I was
thinking about this topic I can actually
kind of pinpoint when this shift was
starting to happen it was at Mobile
World Congress 2017 Huawei was bringing
out their p10 and they were really
pushing to have so much exposure in
Barcelona at the time that they had this
huge almost overcrowded it was
overcrowded a press conference and it
was there that they brought on one of
their partners panto now Pantone is a
thought leader and expert on when it
comes to colors and they are the ones
who generally designate the top color
for that year basically they're telling
you what's hot and the representative
from Pantone proceeded to be on stage
for a long long amount of time just
talking about why the color blue and the
color green or in Pantone's case
greenery was the top color of the year
and why it was great to have those on a
smartphone it was really hard to watch
and the p10 turned out to be a pretty
great phone lied to that presentation is
something that kind of just sticks into
your memory after it has happened but
what we didn't realize at the time was
that Pantone's representative was
basically telling us what's going to
happen for the next year or so in
smartphone design that shift is made for
pretty exciting year so far and it kind
of makes sense why manufacturers are
trying a lot harder with their
smartphone designs when you have a full
screen experience up front with maybe a
notch which is another trend low not get
into right now and there's no headphone
jack which is again another trends but
we're not focusing on that right now and
the marriage of form and function seems
to be the same here as it is on plenty
of other flagships what do you do to
differentiate yourself well the answer
is as it turns out color and I think the
reason why this is a big deal to a lot
of people is because they're craving
that
choice and they're also craving
something that's unique and of course
having a different color of a smartphone
that otherwise does all the same stuff
as the original models means that
there's something that little thing
that's different about it
users crave choice that's one of the
reasons why Android is so popular but
smartphones are also now very ubiquitous
that means that smartphones are
basically extensions of ourselves and by
choosing something that is unique and
different it kind of reflects upon the
user just earlier this year the Samsung
Galaxy S 9 the ninth iteration in a
phone that we all expect to be pretty
good every year introduced a lilac
purple now they've done different colors
before but for some reason this
different shade of purple that again was
Pantone's best color of the year for
2018 became the hot ticket item even
here at Android Authority it's still the
version that we look back on and want to
have as a daily driver if at all
possible and then of course we don't
even really have to talk much about
Huawei's contribution in this with their
p20 there's the p20 the p20 pro that
comes in a few different gradients which
has itself become a trend as well and
those gradients look different from the
rest in particular the Twilight Edition
that everyone in the comment sections
loved there's one more example that I
can put out there and it's a fairly
recent one that does even more than just
change the color of the backing HTC is
u12 plus HTC is even taking you a step
further really kind of embracing the
whole idea of a translucent backing that
lets you see what's underneath it and
that's exactly what they did with the
blue version the transparent blue
version or translucent blue version
rather of the HTC u12 plus it makes it
very clear to the user which which one
they really want and they wouldn't be
able to make that choice so
enthusiastically if in the first place
there weren't any choices like those to
begin with and that's the trend that
we're noticing this year we don't know
what's going to come with let's say the
pixel 3 or the note 9 or any of the
other flagships that we're going to be
seeing in the next number of months
leading to the end of 2018 but it seems
that there's an ebb and flow happening
at right now we're in the flow of color
so with that in mind we are putting out
a few polls asking you to tell us if
color really matters to you and your
smartphones and you can also tell us why
depending on what platform you're using
as a matter of fact down in the comment
sections down below I want to hear all
of the different opinions
why color matters to you why certain
colors seem to have more
than others because certainly there are
different colors of every phone every
year why is it only now that we're
starting to really notice and of course
you can head over to the polls into the
comments sections in general and then
remember to subscribe to the channel if
you haven't already and hit that Bell
over on the side so that you are
informed of every time that Android
Authority puts a video up from there
Java some likes on this video as well as
your comments and then head on over to
andrew authority comm and use the intro
thority app on the Play Store so you can
keep up with everything that we're doing
because we are of course your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
