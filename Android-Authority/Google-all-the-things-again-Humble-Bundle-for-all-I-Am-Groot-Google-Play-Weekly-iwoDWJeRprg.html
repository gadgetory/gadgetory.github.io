hindy here and it's friday which means
it's time for another episode of google
play weekly there has been a lot of news
in the application world this week so
let's not waste any more time first up
this week Google's Wednesday update
happened and a few applications got some
updates the first one we'll talk about
is Gmail which got an update to support
more languages including non-latin
characters as well as accented Latin
characters google music also got an
update which adds a new one by one
widget to instantly access the i'm
feeling lucky radio and it reskin the
other widgets youtube let arguably the
biggest update that has changed some UI
elements around including easier access
to the add to playlist button and
contextual menus in playlists after
crashing so epically hard that it made
headlines Facebook updated their
facebook Messenger application to
support Android wear the update is
rolling out currently so most of you
should have it pretty soon if you don't
already as we talked about last week the
main app is now totally separate from
the messenger app and we have a feeling
things like this are the reason why with
the update you can now respond to people
in facebook Messenger using only your
voice aside from that for the usual bug
fixes and performance improvements next
up we're gonna talk about humble bundle
and you know how much I love even a
mediocre humble bundle pumple mobile
bundle includes a total of six games if
you pay whatever you want you get eelus
infinity duet premium and combo crew a
special edition if you pay more than the
average which is four dollars and 46
cents the last time I checked you'll
also get threes minds of Mars and Joe
Devers lone wolf there is also a yet
unannounced game that you'll be able to
get if you beat the average next up
we're going to talk about an application
in development that may be a good
alternative to Android auto it's called
digital car and you can kind of see how
it works based on the video it is an
alpha testing right now which means it's
not really fit for consumer level use
just yet it requires quite a bit of
setup and some of the features are a
little buggy right now it comes with a
full screen interface a dedicated app
launcher and much more if you really
want to try it out we'll have it linked
up in the written companion which is in
the video description below in our last
bit of news this week
google bought EMU the smart messaging
platform this is an interesting purchase
because emu had some unique features
including the ability to add events to
your calendar based on the information
in a message we assume Google wants to
integrate these smart features directly
into google hangouts that means the EMU
messaging platform will be killed off
stripped for parts and those parts will
eventually end up in hangouts we don't
know how many of these features will be
included but keep an eye out because
this is something that is happening so
who wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the briton
companion which is in the video
description below first up this week is
Google now launcher the increasingly
popular launcher from google has been
updated to now function on all Android
devices running Android 4.1 jelly bean
and later that means the majority of the
Android ecosystem can now use this
launcher it's exciting news if you love
all things google and it's available in
the Google Play Store free of charge
right now guardians of the galaxy came
out in theatres and did amazingly well
because it's a pretty amazing movie
there was also a mobile game released
and it's actually pretty good as well it
features simple click and drag gameplay
an original story has no in-app
purchases and doesn't require an
internet connection to play it's four
dollars and ninety-nine cents but
considering you get the entire game that
is playable offline this is the kind of
stuff a lot of you have been asking for
now it's time to put your money where
your mouth is the highlight android wear
release this week was an application
called a dopey dia it is an open-source
application designed to let you browse
wikipedia on your Android wear device it
has a fairly interesting and efficient
design where you swipe down to pick
yourself heading and then you swipe left
and right to read the information in
that subheading it's a fun little time
killer and it's totally free so why not
check it out our next appt is fairly
simple a bright presumably young person
is trying to cash in on the guardians of
the galaxy crazed by releasing a
keyboard that lets you talk like groups
well it works because the keyboard is
actually fairly entertaining it's a
dollar to buy and no one is going to
blame you if you don't feel like it's
worth it last up this week is assassin's
creed pirates this is a fairly
entertaining game that is on sale right
now for a measly 10 cents this is part
of a much larger summer sale that the
google play store is having which you
can find a link to
the written companion below there are a
bunch of great games on sale as for
pirates I mean come on it's only a dime
