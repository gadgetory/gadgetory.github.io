handy the Android authority app guide
BlueStacks has been the gold standard
for running Android on PC for some time
now there is a new challenger called
Andy roid can the King be dethroned
let's take a look okay so here's how
this is going to go down we're going to
be judging these two applications based
on five different things that is ease of
usin set up gaming productivity mice
latest features and overall if at any
point you're wondering exactly which one
I'm talking about keep your eye on the
lower left hand corner of the screen
because I'll have it posted there for
BlueStacks setting things up was
ridiculously easy you go to the site you
download the application install it and
go it's super easy once you're inside
you can browse and install various games
and access them on the bar at the top
when it comes to ease-of-use and setting
things up BlueStacks is practically
idiot-proof Andy started out the same
way downloading and installing the
application was easy I did have a
problem actually getting it to run but
thanks to their support I was able to
figure out the problem once you actually
started up it runs like any Android
phone or tablet so the interface is
familiar Andy does get some points back
for having a good support staff they use
Facebook as their support page and their
people are generally pretty
knowledgeable in fact shout out to
Charlie from Andy because he's the dude
that helped me out still at the end of
the day I have to give the victory and
ease-of-use and set up to BlueStacks it
simply doesn't require any effort and it
really is just that easy of course what
are the main reasons people want Android
on their computers is for gaming
fortunately both of these emulators
support game play on Android in
BlueStacks it appears as though the main
focus is for gaming they don't really
recommend any normal applications and we
assume the recommended games are ones
that have been tested and work well with
BlueStacks the games run fairly well you
can get ones in the Play Store that
aren't listed in the BlueStacks
recommendations but they tend to run a
little more clunky than the recommended
ones andy focuses on an overall
experience so there aren't as many
features there for gamers for instance
BlueStacks has keyboard shortcuts built
in for some games whereas Andy does not
it does play games and in some cases
like clash of clans it actually
the game better than BlueStacks in terms
of stability this is especially true for
Network based games which seem to load a
lot faster on Andy Andy does have a
remote option where you can use your
device as a controller for better gaming
support if you so choose BlueStacks does
allow game controller support as well
but it requires a wired controller
thanks to the fact that it runs a newer
version of Android the remote support
and just general performance we have to
give Andy the win here there are some
people who wish to use Android on their
computers for productivity reasons here
BlueStacks doesn't fail utterly but it
does come close it doesn't seem to like
to run regular Android applications as
well as it does games and that's a damn
shame as you can see here there is an
excruciating amount of lag when simply
typing things in Google Drive it doesn't
recommend any productivity apps so you
have to go out of your way to even find
them really BlueStacks wants to be a
gaming emulator and this is an area
where it shows that said there are a few
productivity apps that do work well so
if you need it for something very light
like some word processing it could still
work for that like we stated earlier
Andy focuses more on a rounded
experience and this is where it shows
the same sort of problems I was having
on BlueStacks simply we're not present
in Andy the Google Drive lag wasn't
present apps load it quickly and worked
well it's also worth pointing out that
Andy can run things like hangouts as
well as third-party launchers it can
deliver real notifications and even use
widgets it is worth mentioning that
BlueStacks does run on an older version
of Android while Andy runs on a newer
version that means in terms of things
like app compatibility Andy will
probably have more applications that are
usable than BlueStacks I think it's
pretty clear who the winner is with this
one and you delivers a more traditional
Android experience than BlueStacks and
that makes it a lot better if you're
looking to be more productive we've
talked about the big stuff but what
about the little things here are the
miscellaneous features BlueStacks is
pretty much a
what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of
deal in a small way simplicity is
elegance and that means there isn't much
guesswork that said you can sync
BlueStacks with your Android devices to
sync app data text and the like if you
really wanted to you can also side load
applications which is a fairly simple
process overall there are some things
but really not that many spoiler this is
the part in the video where Andy really
starts to pull ahead you can do pretty
much anything with Andy that you can do
with an Android phone that includes side
loading applications putting
on there from your computer if you need
to real file browsing and some stuff we
mentioned earlier like fully functioning
notifications widgets and you can even
route the thing if you really want to
one of the things I really liked
personally was the ability to install
third-party launchers since it runs
pretty much like any other Android
device you can customize it pretty much
like any other Android device so between
the custom launchers wallpapers widgets
icon pack set cetera you can turn Andi
into a little window of customization
and really make it truly yours the last
thing I want to mention here is the
ability to change the specs on Andy it
runs in a virtual machine which is
actually customizable you can open up
the VirtualBox that comes with Andy and
give it some extra RAM change how many
CPU cores it has and various other small
things as well
beware though this is advanced user
stuff but you can totally go in there
and give this bad boy 3 gigabytes of RAM
instead of the one and actually improve
the performance it also runs a higher
version of Android than BlueStacks and
that means you'll have a higher app
compatibility as well as better app
stability obviously the winner here is
Andy and I don't really need to explain
why overall picking which one is better
really depends on your needs if you
really just need something super simple
that plays some light games and you
really don't need it to do much else
then BlueStacks is still probably your
best bet after all like we said earlier
there is an advantage to having
simplicity however if you're willing to
go through the slightly more complicated
set up process than Andy is by far the
more full-featured Android emulator it's
way better for customization and
productivity and in some cases it's even
better at gaming with the power user
stuff available like route and adding
resources Andy is simply a better option
for more demographics if you're
wondering yes I am saying that
BlueStacks has been pretty much sorted
as they go to Android emulator on PC if
