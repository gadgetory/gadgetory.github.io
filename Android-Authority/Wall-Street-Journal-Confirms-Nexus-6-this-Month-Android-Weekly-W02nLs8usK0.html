is Jace and I know many of you last week
were suspicious that the Nexus 6
otherwise known as Shamu would be as big
as the reported 5.9 inch while the wall
street journal also believes it proving
that our appetite for phablets is
insatiable I mean how big can a phone
get hey bloody how's it going yeah just
calling you my new Nexus 27 yes that's
right The Wall Street Journal has
confirmed that there is a nexus 6 or
Shamu and it is a 5.9 inch display and
they also believe that it will be
released sometime this month although we
have no confirmation of a specific date
but we do believe that it won't be a
massive event it will be likely a blog
post because we have not received a
press invite just yet and we also caught
a glimpse of what we think might be the
nexus 9 it looks like this the source of
this image is up leaks a Twitter user
who has shared good information about
HTC in the past most recently the desire
i specs and images the image here seems
to show a device made of plastic not
metal as previously reported and
according to up links the material is
similar to the mat soft plastic on the
lg-made Nexus 5 and the asus nexus 7
2013 the vertical Nexus logo is very
similar to the past Nexus devices though
the camera looks different from the
Nexus 7's distinctive design be aware
this image could be fake so time will
tell now you should know that some
people believe that Google is releasing
these larger Nexus devices because they
want to show off certain features of
Android L Google's new version of the
Android system and it should be released
sometime this week look forward to that
alright so let's talk HTC and I'm sure
many of you will agree that the HTC One
series is a very popular phone the HTC
m8 is a daily driver for many android
authority staff but when it comes to
sales or actual market share HTC lags
behind a lot at about six percent of the
whole android market out
to combat these issues HTC is focusing
more heavily on its mid-range desire
lineup the product category where
they've had the most success recently
the other half of HTC strategy is to
improve brand penetration and market
appeal through new innovative products
and that's where they re camera comes in
it apparently is just first in a new
lineup of stand-alone devices aimed at
non HTC customers HTC's recamara
supports a 16 megapixel sensor shooting
1080p at 30 frames per second it has an
820 milliamp hour battery and enough for
1,200 photos or one hour and 40 minutes
of continuous full HD video recording it
has memory up to 128 gigabytes via a
microSD card slot it is waterproof and
has bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity now
the recamaras said to be about 199 so
for all you go pro fans out there would
you drop your GoPro and go for a read so
let's move on the news about the Droid
turbo and it turns out that Verizon on
Friday had a bad social media day droid
landing the account that verizon only
uses to promote incoming launches of new
droid devices tweeted on Friday a
beautiful high-res image of the red
version of the droid turbo the image
shows a rather good looking device
wrapped in red Kevlar the design is
distinctly Motorola but it doesn't share
resemblance with the new Moto X or the
rumored Nexus 6 now because at least
some of the droid turbos manual was
leaked online we know that the droid
turbo will have a 5.2 inch display and
sport a 21 megapixel camera thanks for
watching android army my name is Jace
love do connect with you right here on
Google+ or Twitter I read all the
comments and at replies you can check
out my brothers in Android they're
working real hard to deliver the best
content on the web I should see you next
week on Android weekly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
