Bluetooth and Wi-Fi direct are two of
the most popular means for wirelessly
sharing files between two Android
devices but these two wireless protocols
need some setting up before you can use
them enter Samsung's sbeam app sbeam
eliminates the hassle of manually
setting up a Wi-Fi direct connection
instead near-field communication or NFC
sets up the connection without any need
for your intervention just tap the two
devices and bam open highway for file
transfer through Wi-Fi this feature is a
Samsung exclusive and even then not all
Samsung phones have this feature if you
have a high-end Samsung device such as
the galaxy s3 or the galaxy note 2
you'll be able to use sbeam in this
video I'll show you how to use sbeam to
share various kinds of content to use
sbeam you need to activate both the S
beam feature and the NFC chip on your
phone the good news is that NFC
automatically turns on when you also
enable s beam so just go to the settings
page then open more settings here you'll
find the switches for NFC and s beam
switch S beam on and you'll see that NFC
also activates if NFC is inactive s beam
will not work because NFC handles the
automatic authentication and pairing
between the two devices so ensure that
both are activated at this point your
device is now actively listening for any
other NFC enabled devices nearby in case
you're wondering Android Beam is still
here tap on the NFC item to check
whether it's active S beam is not a
replacement for Android Beam rather in
the samsung's expanded variant of the
native Android Beam functionality
regular Android Beam handles data
transfers over a Bluetooth connection
but s beam transfers data over a direct
Wi-Fi connection resulting in faster
transfer speeds beaming with S beam is
extremely easy in fact the process is
just like beaming via Android Beam
regardless of the content that you want
to beam the general beaming
process is as follows open the content
to be shared tap both devices backs wait
for the confirmation sound and vibration
tap the screen of the sender device to
start sending separate the devices wait
a bit and presto content beamed from one
device to the other yep it's that easy
so let's demonstrate how easy this 2
beam content using s beam let's try
setting a photo for example first open
the photo then touch the backs of the
two phones both will detect each other's
presence and will confirm with a short
vibration and a sound you'll see
something like this on the sender device
the image won't be beamed until you tap
the screen so let's tap the screen let's
take a look at what's going on on the
other devices screen once beaming begins
the receiving device gets notification
of an incoming beam and another
notification when the beaming finishes
there I've successfully shared this
image from my galaxy s3 the process is
the same for beaming music play the
music file to be sent put the phones
together wait for the vibration and
sound tap to beam great music files sent
to the other phone what about sending
huge files such as HD videos let's try
it open the video file tap the phones
backs tap to beam and wonderful video
beam successfully contacts are very easy
to beam open the contact page tap the
devices backs tap center screen to beam
contact sent can you beam apps you bet
though this method won't send the app
files themselves run app tap device
backs tap the beam there the other phone
launches the apps page on the Google
Play Store share webpages via s beam -
like sharing apps this method won't send
the webpage itself instead only the URL
is sent and the other phones browser app
opens the URL it's a simple process open
the web page in the browser tap the
devices backs tap to beam
your L sent YouTube videos can be beamed
too just like beaming an app this won't
be me YouTube video file itself rather
it will being the video page and cost
the other device to open it in the
YouTube app open the YouTube video on
the sender phone back tap here the
confirmation sound tap to beam voila
YouTube will launch on the other phone
and will play the video thanks to NFC
and s beam sharing files and content
among Samsung phones such as the galaxy
s3 and the Galaxy Note 2 is much faster
have you tried using s beam do you use
it frequently what do you think of the
feature share your thoughts in the
