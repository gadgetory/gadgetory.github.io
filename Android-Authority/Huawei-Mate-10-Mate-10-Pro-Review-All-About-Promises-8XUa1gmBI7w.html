promises the promise of AI in your
smartphone the promise of a rising star
in the industry and the promise of a
better long-term future for your device
well where's being hot on the heels of
Samsung for many years now slowly
increasing its global market and its
Western mind share in fact it's no
stretch to say that while way rather
than Samsung is now the premier
innovator in the smartphone space and
the huawei mate ten series a very
promising example of where Huawei is
headed while way is essentially
marketing these phones around four main
selling points the display the camera
battery and AI base performance the
display is the first point of difference
between the two phones both comprised
metal frame sandwiched between sheets of
Gorilla Glass with Huawei's new
signature stripe highlighting the dual
wiper engineered cameras there are
departure from wild ways typical metal
phones but they fall in line with the
current 2017 flagship trend will be it
without the addition of wireless
charging on the upside you now have a
place to store your fingerprint
collection the mate zone pro is the more
expensive version with an eighteen to
nine aspect ratio OLED display and up to
six gig of ram in 128 gig of storage the
mate 10 sticks with an IPS LCD at 16 to
9 resolution with 4 gig of ram and 64
gig of storage while the mate tens dual
SIM slot can be used for microSD
expansion the pro version only supports
dual SIM both models have HDR 10
displays and while there's still not too
much mobile HDR content around right now
there will be over the lifetime of these
phones both panels hit 713 it's in
brightness but the make 10 pros OLED
panel producers punchy of colors and
white of whites for some reason why we
chose to put a full HD plus resolution
panel on the pro version while the
regular may 10 gets a quad HD panel
meaning the regular May 10 has higher
pixel density but unless quad HD is
really important to you you won't be
disappointed by the Pro versions panel
plus the combination of the brand new 10
nanometer chipset Aoi battery management
and OLED display with a black theme and
lower resolution means if you're all
about battery life you can squeeze even
more battery out of the pro version on
my best day I managed to hit around 6
hours of screen on time while I was
inside and had the brightness set to
around 40%
obviously your mileage may vary
depending on how you use your phone and
how bright you have your screen but that
number generally hovers around 4 to 5
hours
speaking of the battery both units come
with a four thousand milliamp hour cell
with Huawei supercharged with the phone
turned off you can charge a third of the
battery in 15 minutes a little over half
in half an hour
and around 85 to 90 percent in a full 60
minutes Huawei is taking Samsung's
misfortunes to heart and has stepped up
its battery safety as well having its
fast charging solution certified by TUV
Rheinland the battery is also the first
place we see a eye on the may 10 hey i
power battery management promises the
world much like while weighs born fast a
fast mantra but like that performance
over time promise you're going to have
to wait until the huawei mate n learns
all of your habits only then can it
better allocate resources to eke out
more battery life for your particular
style of usage of course this will only
happen or not long after you've dropped
your cash on it but history has shown
that while waste combination of a large
battery great fast charging and solid
battery management means that May 10 and
May 10 Pro will likely be among the best
battery performers of the year now as
you may have guessed AI plays a pretty
big part in the performance of the may
10 to the Kiran 917 chipset has a
dedicated neural processing unit that
handles complex processing tasks on
device rather than in the cloud but it
must be noted that AI has a prominent
but limited place on the May 10 I
wouldn't go so far as to say it's pure
marketing but the benefits of AI and the
NP you will only really be felt over
time as there are precious few features
using their full capabilities right now
whywe assures me that more will be
delivered over time not held off until
the next device in the series
Google Translate will soon join
Microsoft's Translate app which uses the
mp4 near-instant photo based translation
and the 13 objects in scenes the camera
can currently recognize to automatically
adjust settings will increase as the NPU
image database expands Google's AR core
will arrive via an update later this
year and the neural network ap eyes are
coming next year the cur√© 970 is also
being positioned as an open AI platform
for developers meaning further
applications to tap its full potential
are sure to arrive in time but for now
the NP you and AI kind of sit in the
background speeding up some parts of the
experience totally learning your habits
suggesting smart tips based on context
awareness and generally just promising
more benefits in future I primarily use
the May 10 Pro during this review and
found the experience to be reliably fast
if
not light-years ahead as the a I promise
might have you believe they experience
the usual stutters and glitches coming
into any phone and had a few issues with
Google Apps playing nice with emui the
main tends run android 8.0 oreo out of
the box with emu i ate on top several
oreo features are on board like
notification dots launch app shortcuts
smart text selection and
picture-in-picture mode but while we
can't exactly be relied upon for the
most faithful implementation of google
features and several others don't make
it at all including adaptive icons and
notification channels fortunately oreo
brings with us the promise of project
treble meaning that updates in the
future shouldn't be a sluggish as they
have been in Huawei's past while way is
even said as much with two years of
guaranteed updates and at least one
major Android version bump as always
huawei like the Samsung of old makes up
for it by loading on more software
features than you can poke a stick at
perhaps the biggest ticket feature on
the may 10 and a big middle finger to
Samsung is a Doppler desktop mode you
just need a USB type-c to HDMI cable
with DisplayPort support and you can
plug your phone directly into a monitor
lore'l lets you attach various
peripherals like a bluetooth mouse and
keyboard where you can use the phone as
a kind of trackpad to get you through a
presentation it's a little sluggish but
it works any calls or messages that come
in while in desktop mode will still be
handled by the phone and not show up on
screen to maintain your privacy it's a
little weird to get used to but a handy
option to have and it'll be interesting
to see where this kind of functionality
goes in the future other software
features include smart split screen so
if you're watching a video or playing a
game and a message comes in the main
tone will let you jump into split screen
mode so you can do two things at once
now if snooping is an issue for you you
can register a fingerprint which
accesses a whole other version of your
phone that way you can keep your dirty
secret secret by unlocking your phone
with your clean finger or pattern a
floating navigation dope lets you open
up all that screen real estate by using
a floating bubble that works much like
fingerprint scanner gestures to control
navigation without the usual on-screen
buttons now can go on endlessly about
the specifics of huawei software
features but if you want to read the
full review head on down to the video
description because now I want to move
on to the camera which I firmly believe
is the most impressive part of the May
10 series 2f 1.6 summer Lux HD lenses
sit on the back of both mate
a 20 megapixel monochrome sensor and a
12 megapixel RGB sensor four-way what I
focus is very reliable and oh is on the
RGB lens helps with image stabilization
especially in low-light conditions
I found the photos out of the may tend
to be generally very good well you get
some impressive shots out of the mate
nine if you were using full manual
controls the may tenant offers the same
level of quality but in auto mode
bringing Huawei's photography potential
mainstream low-light photography
especially was impressive with very
little noise or visible brain it has to
be noted though that the May 10th ends
to crush blacks in its attempt to stamp
out noise altogether making most
nighttime photos look good but visibly
darker than the actual scene depending
on how you feel about noise versus
overall lightness you'll either love or
hate flyaways approach here other phones
like the pixel to try really hard to
lighten the scenes that tend to add much
more noise than you'll find on the may
10 some of this no doubt has to do with
the AI scene recognition which you can
thankfully override but only by using
the manual controls or choosing another
preset like HDR which is not my ideal
solution if you don't like the a I
assisted results a simple toggle in the
camera app for disabling AI scene
recognition would be a much better idea
but IIM the camera is not all bad though
io motion detection means capturing
moving subjects without blur is quite
easy with the maintain able to capture
action shots without any visible
movement even in pretty poor lighting
the scene recognition works very
reliably to automatically adjusting
settings to best capture the subject or
scene it'll just depend on whether you
agree with the AI or not on what
constitutes the best settings the only
real problem I had with the may 10
camera was over sharpening the
sharpening in some shots tends to make
the result look too fake take this dog
photo where everything is a little too
sharp and to look lifelike then there's
this one where everything pans out
perfectly this kind of variability is
emblematic of the may 10 camera
performance for me multiple shots taken
one after the other can often produce
very different results in HDR mode to
the HDR version would occasionally
lighten the shadows as you'd expect it
to but in others that would produce
darker shadows than the original shot
you'll always get at least one photo
that is fantastic but I definitely
recommend always firing off a couple
just to be sure in good lighting the may
10 shoots great shots like any other
high-end smartphone the monochrome
sensor doesn't always seem to provide
that much extra detail though making me
wonder how much more fun the may 10
camera could
if it had a wide-angle lens like the LGP
30 or a 2x zoom lens like the note 8 hey
I also helped provide a 2x hybrid zoom
which produces results a lot more like
those you'd find on the pixel with more
noise but a lighter palette and more
detail in the shadows
it definitely produces better detail
than a crop 10 standard shot what remote
is very reliable if not perfect and wide
aperture mode has improved since the
Mait 9 to both understandably look a
little fake but are perfectly good for a
new profile pic or social share if while
waist cameras put you off in the past
for being too complicated the may 10
rectify that situation bringing very
impressive results to a point-and-shoot
audience there's a little bit of
character to the may 10 camera that
you'll have to learn to love but if that
doesn't put you off then it's a very
capable shooter there's a whole laundry
list of other firsts and improvements on
the mate 10m 810 Pro from dual 4G voice
over LTE and cat 18 LTE to AI voice
recognition and noise cancellation and
calls both devices have stereo speakers
courtesy of bottom firing grill and the
earpiece speaker but at max volume which
hits around 80 decibels the sound gets
too tinny for my liking especially from
the earpiece and the headphone
experience is much better support for
lossless 32 bit audio at 384 kilohertz
is a nice touch of overkill but the
presence of high-end codecs in norio
will not be enough to satisfy potential
mate 10 pro buyers who prefer wired
headphones fortunately you can always
use the included types of earbuds all
live the dongle life and enjoy Huawei's
audio tuning on your favorite set of
cans water resistance qHD panels
headphone ports and microSD expansion of
the stalwarts of smartphone shopping but
by mixing and matching features so
randomly there's no obvious winner here
at 699 euros the May 10 has all the
regular bases covered
but at 799 euros the mate 10 pro is in
some ways superior well in other ways
not as feature-rich it'll be the only
version to make it to the US though with
global pricing and availability coming
soon
despite a few questionable choices the
maintainer May 10 Pro are really nice
phones and while they may not yet be
meeting Samsung head-to-head they're a
positive step in that direction if while
we manages to come through on any or
even all of the promises that's made
with the may 10 series then they're
guaranteed to get better over time as
