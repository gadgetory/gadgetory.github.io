Authority now you probably use
encryption every single day if you have
a TV or scalable service as bringing
content down to your house then probably
some of those channels are encrypted so
that only people who pay for the right
channels can get the content if you have
a connect to a website that ask for your
username and password then that's
probably an encrypted connection even if
you create a zip file with a password on
it that again is encryption there are
loads and loads of examples of
encryption every single day in our lives
and most of the time we don't even think
about it but if we just stop and think
we can ask ourselves the question how
does encryption work how is it keeping
all of my bank detail safe how is it
keeping all of my personal information
safe well let me explain so the first
question of course is what is encryption
encryption is a process of taking normal
information let's say text and turning
it into a version that can't be read by
other people now to do that conversion
you need a key and the analogy here is
like a key that you put into a lock to
open a door once you have the key you
can unlock which is decrypt that
information without the key it remains
locked as the Tom Jericho character put
it in that great film enigma it turns
plaintext messages into gobbledygook
it turns plaintext messages onto
gobbledygook the problem is the machine
has 150 million million
long residue now of course the advantage
of having things encrypted are enormous
if you want to send something like bank
details a day you don't want a cyber
thief cyber criminal to be able to take
that new information spend money on your
credit card course encryption used by
government has been used in warfare it's
used by all manner of different things
now the art of secret writing has been
around for several thousand years but of
course the most famous example is from
Julius Caesar he wanted to write some
secret messages to Cicero and to do so
he used this thing we call today the
Caesar cipher now it works like this if
you take the alphabet ABCD all the way
through to Z and then underneath it you
place another alphabet but rather than
placing a under a or b under B you shift
the bottom alphabet by it to the left or
to the right by a few characters now
here's an example for us I've shifted
the alphabet to the right by 3 now if I
wanted to encrypt the word hello what I
do is I look up H on the top row and
then I see what character is beneath it
on the bottom row in this case it's an e
I then look up e for hello the second
letter of hello and I look again to see
what's below it and I get a B I then
look up the L and I get AI and then look
up L again and I get AI and then finally
look up oh and I get L and now this word
that we have here is not the word hello
it's just complete gibberish so someone
else seeing that wouldn't know what the
message was now the great thing is if we
shift the alphabet by five characters
rather than by three we now get a
different result so H becomes C e
becomes Z L becomes G L becomes G and OB
comes J so depending on where I've
shifted the alphabet depends on how the
message is encrypted and therefore when
someone else sees it they don't know
which alphabet I've used to encrypt this
mesh in therefore the message remains
hidden to them now of course there are
some disadvantages first of all if I was
writing hello how are you today
then the spaces would also be appearing
in the encrypt
Mesa's so someone's seeing it would say
our this looks like a sentence there are
short words and longer words and there
are spaces between them but I don't know
what it means and that would give them a
clue that they need to then try to crack
this encryption also there are only 26
different possibilities to move the
alphabet left or right and now if I was
a an Army General and I had 26 soldiers
at my disposal I have just called them
all into a room and say right here's an
alphabet for all of you try to decrypt
this message and the first one that gets
some good information out raise your
hand up and actually they would do that
in just a couple of minutes so it could
be broken quite easily because there are
other weaknesses as well for example the
letter e appears the most frequent in
the English language so if I look down
my encrypted Mayson notice which one is
the most frequent I can then just line
that up on my alphabet and I've
decrypted the whole mess it's called
frequency analysis and of course a day
with computers this could be just broken
in just a mere moments because it's very
easy to crack now one way to make a
Caesar cipher stronger is to use
multiple encryption alphabets not just
one so here's an example where I'm using
five alphabets now if these five
alphabets if I take the key W V Y what
that means is I start with the Alpha
that begins with W then I use the
alphabet that begins with the V and then
I use the alphabet that begins with Y
and if we again try to encrypt the word
hello what we get is by looking at the W
and then going across for H we find D
then we move to the alphabet that starts
with the V and we go across to we find E
and now I get Z and then we get the
alphabet that begins with a Y and then I
move along until I find L and now I get
J if you continue on you get H and J
again now what's interesting about this
is that now we've got the letter J
appearing in our encrypted text twice
but J doesn't refer to the same letter
in both of those cases because they'd
come from different alphabets in fact
this system can be expanded to full 26
alphabets and that was a system used by
Visionnaire in the 16th century and it
proved to be a very popular cipher and
in fact it was 300 years before it could
be cracked eventually it was cracked by
Charles Babbage the famous inventive
inventor
the difference machine and sometimes is
called the father of computing but he
didn't publish his work and then a few
years later it was broken by Fredrik
Kaczynski who did publish his work and
the Visionaire cypher fell now following
on from the Visionnaire cypher we have
the idea of a cipher that is completely
unbreakable
that's both theoretically and
practically it's no way to break this
cipher and it's called the one-time pad
now at the top level you might have ABCD
all the way through to Z like before but
below rather than having ABCD which is
actually a sequence we really know
what's going on there if it was a random
sequence of letters then there were no
way to know what that random sequence is
and if that random sequence was as long
as the message itself then you are
always using something random to encode
the key and if you never use it ever
again that one sequence is only ever
used once then there's never any other
reference data which you can look at to
try to find chinks or holes in the
encryption is completely unique and it
happened only once and there's no way of
getting into it now the problem with a
one-time cipher pad is that the
recipient needs to have exactly the same
pair of exactly the same a random
sequence on it to be able to decode that
information and because you can't send
that over the internet you can't send it
through email or something you have to
meet them and you have to give them a
pad a page in a notepad which has got
this sequence of letters in it and then
every day every hour whatever you can
change which pad you're using and change
which page you're using and once you've
use the page you can rip it up and you
throw it in the fire and that's it is
destroyed and it can never ever be
recovered now by the time we get to
people like a Babbage we're now talking
about the Industrial Revolution the
steam age and mechanization and the
upshot of this new industry was the
encryption became meckley nice and
probably the most famous example of that
is the Enigma machine used by the Nazis
during the Second World War rather than
having to do encryption by hand the
message were typed into a machine and it
would pop out with the relevant
encryption now of course that meant that
the encryption could be very
sophisticated with millions and
of variations because the machine was
doing the hard work now of course in
crip the enigma was eventually cracked
as well and if you really want to find
out something interesting in history
about encryption then you should study
the story of the Enigma machine not only
the cryptography but also the people
involved and the history and the impact
on the Second World War and so on now
after mechanization we now have the age
of computers and this brings us into a
whole new age now computers are very
different to mechanized machines like
the Enigma machine for three different
reasons one is they're flexible the
Enigma machine was fixed once it was
built it did it only one way you could
change the key but it'd only be the
encryption one way computers are
reflectable we can write new encryption
algorithms very very easily we can test
them we can discard them we can
investigate the more flexiblity second
of course is the speed can be so much
faster than any mechanized machine and
thirdly and most importantly we are now
dealing with data rather than text
messages so even during the Second World
War it was messages that were sent out
into the field about the war effort but
now we're dealing with data we're not
dealing with ABC we're dealing with
numbers we're dealing with movies JPEG
files within with video files we're
dealing with music files with dealing
with databases we're dealing with any
kind of data that can now be encrypted
including of course our transactions on
the Internet now when you start to deal
with data you start dealing with ones
and zeros as binary on and off and you
can group those binary numbers in
together and we might group them
together as bytes or a 16-bit word or
64-bit words we do that but actually
ultimate you're just dealing with ones
and zeros now in the digital age as I
said we're now dealing with data rather
than dealing with letters so the idea of
a simple substitution that the letter H
is now equal to the letter L and the
letter L is equal to a letter J doesn't
work the same now because we're dealing
with data now one of the key functions
that's used in encryption is what's
called the exclusive-or and it's a
really a magical function now
exclusive-or basically means
that if you have two bits a and B we
want to know whether it's a or b but not
both okay so one or the other but not
both of them at the same time now what
that basically means is if you have a 1
and a 1 the answer is false 0 if you
have a 0 and a 0 the answer is false 0
but if you have a 1 and a 0 or a 0 and a
1 you get 1 ok so that's the way it
works as a logical operation on two bits
now cause two bits means think about it
the top alphabet and the bottom alphabet
you're combining two things together but
the great thing about XOR exclusive-or
is that if you run it again you go back
to your original numbers you can try
this at home the rapini of websites
where you can try this out so basically
if you do a X or B and you get c if you
then do C XOR B you get a so backwards
it goes in both directions in fact
actually if you do see X or a you also
get B so it's really amazing you can
just combine these things and which and
it goes back and forth which means you
get encryption and decryption now of
course what you want to make sure is
that the number your XOR in the
plaintext against the key is random or
is certainly difficult to guess so that
you don't you can't just X on the back
again and get the original information
so if you just use a standard XOR on a
key it's very easy to break in fact
there's a website you can go to just
give it a file and it will just tell you
in about two seconds what the key that
you use it so you have to use this in
combination with other techniques but
it's really important to understand XOR
exclusive or a or b but not both not a
and B together now there are two main
types of cipher in the digital age the
stream cipher and the block cipher now
the stream cipher basically takes each
byte or maybe something bigger each unit
of the stream of data one of the time it
applies encryption to it pass it to the
output takes a next one doesn't to it
part of the output the data streams pass
the encoder and it deals with it in tiny
any sections now our block cipher is
different a block cipher tends to deal
with the file or data as a whole now we
get the word block because it divides up
that data into blocks and the blocks
might be 64-bit blocks or 128-bit blocks
and then it does encryption on those
individual blocks and sometimes the
blocks interact with each other to do
different things so there's are two
different ways of doing the ciphers now
a stream cipher is more like the
one-time pad we're trying to have a
sequence of numbers that we can apply to
our original data that seems to be
random and the more random it is the
less chance there is of it being broken
now the problem is it can't be truly
random because the person at the other
end needs to decrypt the data which
means there has to be a starting point
and there has to be a way of generating
the same random numbers so the
information can be decrypted so
therefore we call it pseudo-random when
you look at it casually it might look
like random numbers are going up and
down the spacing the frequency between
them it seems to be all over the place
however if you wound up the same machine
plugged in the same numbers you get the
same sequence of random numbers out
again if you plug in the same key you
get the same result and that means you
can do encryption and decryption but
because of this it also means that it
can be attacked because in the end it's
still a set of numbers that are being
produced by a computer according to a
function and if you can work out how
that manifests itself you can then start
to guess the keys now rc4 was a stream
cipher and it's been used for many many
years and we find it in a Wi-Fi we find
it on the internet but it was using this
pseudo-random sequence and in the end
they've started to find ways of
attacking the random numbers in the
sequence and finding correlations
between the original data and the random
numbers and therefore they were able to
produce some chinks in it now today it's
not considered reliable because under
certain stark circumstances it can be
cracked in a matter of minutes in other
situations it might still take years
however is now considered unreliable
when it comes to block ciphers things
are a bit different there was a man
called feistel who was working for IBM
encryption during the 1970s and he came
up the idea of a feistel network now a
feistel network takes all the data needs
to be encrypted and divides it into
blocks then each of those blocks are
encrypted using a key now once they're
encrypted it goes round and does it
again and then again and then again and
these are called rounds and each round a
modification of that key a variant of
the key is used so effectively it's
being encrypted again and again and
again now the idea is the more rounds
you have the greater the encryption now
basically his work led to something
called the data
Equipe ssin standard which was basically
american government saying they wanted a
standard way for computers to talk to
each other and so here's a standard for
how to do it and you had to have a key
it would then get encrypted it could be
then sent to somebody else in a
different company in a different
department and they would know how to
use DES to be encrypted now the problem
with des was it had a limit of a 56
bytes of key size now in 1970s and 1980s
that was absolutely fine however by time
we get to the 1990s non-governmental
organizations had enough computing power
to be able to break deaths encrypted
messages in a reasonable amount of time
now the initial way to get around this
was to use something called Triple DES
which basically meant that the data was
encrypted three times using three
different keys and that extended the
size of the encryption key from 56 bits
up to 168 bits
however because of some technical issues
that actually the effective size is 112
bits now that's still pretty amazing
because if you had a machine that could
crack a DES message in one minute and
there aren't any but if you did have a
machine that could crack it in one
minute then to crack a Triple DES
message you'd need 260,000 years so
that's still a pretty good encryption
sister and it's use a day a lot by the
payment industry however the American
government again wanted to produce a new
standard for encryption and so they
started to look for a new algorithm the
result was something called AES or the
advanced encryption standard and that's
what we use today
now it's also a block cipher it also
uses rounds so it has rounds and
has keys just like a faisal network but
it's not a vital network actually uses
substitution and permutations now if you
want to find out more about faisal
networks des a aes stream ciphers and
all these things I've mentioned the
written article that goes with this
video has got lots more detail more than
I can cover in just this short video and
AES is what we have today is what we
find in android 5 and Android 6 I'm
basically Android 5 and Android 6 there
was the option to encrypt the entire
disk so the entire disk was encrypting
every single bite and bit that was done
to that disk went through an encryption
layer that could not be broken because
it's with AES now with Android 7 what
we've moved to is now file based
encryption so rather encrypting the
whole disk the disk itself is is in the
clear is plain but the files on the disk
are now encrypting that has two
advantages one is that the files can be
have different lengths of encryptions
you gather a file that's got very very
super super encryption on it and you've
got files i've got good encryption but
not as good as the super super
encryption that of course affects speed
slightly and secondly it means that only
files when they are open do they need to
be decrypted they can be decrypted
independently of each other
now that's android 7 now when are moved
from its 32-bit architecture in arm v7
to its 64-bit architecture in arm v8 it
included some extra instructions to do
with encryption now because AES is a
standard and the way it works is
well-defined
it's a published standard are more able
to put some instructions in the hardware
that made a AES quicker because it was
too handled in the hardware and because
it's a block cipher basically you've got
these blocks of numbers and they need to
be switched around they need to be
swapped about a bit and you can do that
in software you can say take this bit
here and copy it over there and take
that bit there and copy over there and
that can happen however if you do it in
hardware you can just say hey do that
thing you need to do for a is there then
basically it happens at the hardware
level in fact you get a really good
factor of performance increase because
it's in the hardware so therefore arm v8
has
AES encryption built into it which means
64-bit chips in our smartphones have aes
built into them and there you have it my
brief overview about encryption now
encryption really is a huge area of
study people do a PhDs in encryption so
this really is just the minimalist of an
introduction there's loads more things
that could be said in particular I
haven't touched at all on public key
cryptography now if you'd like to see a
part two to this video please do let me
know because if there's enough interest
