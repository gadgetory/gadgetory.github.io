andrew authority and this is the xiaomi
me mix three it's another flagship
Android smartphone with a slider design
and it's very similar in a lot of ways
to the honor magic to which I reviewed
not that long ago so if you guys want to
see that it'll either be linked down in
the description or up here in a card but
in my review of the magnitude I
mentioned that I really liked the slider
design and I pretty much feel the same
way about it on the mean mix three it
feels really well made it has a very
satisfying click when you open or close
it and it even makes sound effects that
you can customize which I thought was
kind of cool I will say though that it
doesn't feel exactly the same as the
slider on the magic to the mimics three
slider mechanism has a slight wiggle to
it which I did not notice on the magic
tube let me show you what I mean
now does this make me concerned about
the longevity of the slider not
necessarily it's just something that I
happen to notice because I have used
both of these phones now so I thought it
was worth mentioning just like the
automatic to the slider on the mimics 3
allows Xiaomi to hide the front-facing
cameras inside of the phone instead of
having to worry about putting it
somewhere on the front bezels this means
that the front is pretty much all
display with very very minimal bezels
the screen itself does look really nice
it's a quality AMOLED panel from Samsung
so it's very vibrant very colorful and
contrasting and at 600 nits of
brightness it's pretty easy to see in
direct sunlight I don't think you'll be
disappointed with this particular panel
the only real drawback to having this
slider design is that the phone is not
water resistant but when you have a
moving part like this it's a lot more
difficult to make the phone water
resistant so if water resistance is a
feature that is on the top of your
priority list when it comes to buying a
smart phone this is probably not gonna
be a phone that you'll be interested in
it also doesn't have a headphone jack or
expandable storage but the base model
starts with a hundred and twenty eight
gigs of storage so I don't think it's
that big of a deal that it doesn't have
a microSD card slot it does have a
fingerprint sensor but unlike the magic
two which has an N screen fingerprint
sensor the mimics three just has your
standard there's a gold fingerprint
sensor which I'm totally okay with
considering that in screen fingerprint
sensors aren't really all that reliable
right now or as fast the rest of the
specs though are about as top-tier as it
gets
it has your typical flagship processor
with the Snapdragon a 45 and comes with
either six or eight gigabytes of RAM
there's even a special edition version
of the mimics three that has ten
gigabytes of RAM which is just kind of
ridiculous I think the only spec that is
a little bit lacking is the battery it's
a 3,200 milliamp hour battery which
isn't quite as big as some of the
competing flagships on the market and
battery life isn't bad or anything it's
just average I'm getting around four to
four and a half hours of screen on time
which is fine for
casual use but for heavy use it's not
really going to be enough on the bright
side the phone does support Qualcomm's
quick charge for plus and it also has
wireless charging if you like the added
convenience of being able to charge your
phone wirelessly as far as the software
is concerned it's running Android Pi
with me wide version 10
Mui has always been a pretty popular
skin so if you like me why I think
you'll definitely enjoy the experience
on the mean mix 3 I'm more of a stock
Android kind of guy but me Y is pretty
pleasant to use it doesn't feel
intrusive and it uses a color palette
that isn't overly bright or cartoony
looking the interface overall actually
looks pretty clean and it comes with a
lot of customization options and
features like a one-handed mode and
gesture controls for quickly launching
shortcuts or apps my favorite part about
the mimicks 3 is probably the cameras it
has a total of 4 cameras the
front-facing camera is a very high
resolution 24 megapixel sensor and it's
paired with a 2 megapixel sensor for
portrait mode studio lighting effects
and a I scene recognition the two
cameras on the rear are both 12
megapixels with the secondary sensor
being a telephoto zoom lens for 2 X
optical zoom and it also is capable of
the same portrait mode studio lighting
and a I scene recognition the AI scene
recognition is OK to me it can recognize
a bunch of different scenes such as food
plants landscapes and as far as I can
tell it just really bumps up the
saturation contrast and makes the images
a little bit brighter I don't really
mind what the AI does to the photos but
photos without AI look perfectly fine to
me just the way they are the camera
overall takes really excellent photos
there's plenty of detail color
reproduction is on point and I'm really
impressed with the cameras dynamic range
especially when taking low-light or
nighttime shots that are filled with a
lot of bright lights highlights are
really well exposed which helps preserve
a lot of the detail I would say this
camera is even on par with something
like the pixel 3 so that pretty much
does it for the
me me makes three overall I think it's a
really great smartphone and if you live
in a region where it's available it's
definitely worth checking out the slab
design is really well done it has some
great specs and some great features it
is missing a few things like water
resistance but when you're dealing with
a design like this you can't expect to
have everything but otherwise it's a
great smartphone you should definitely
check it out and if you guys enjoyed
