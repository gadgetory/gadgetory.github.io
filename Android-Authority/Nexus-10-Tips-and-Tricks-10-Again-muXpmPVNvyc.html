of the best ten inch tablets on the
market today
so if you are the new proud owner of a
nexus 10 tablet then here are some tips
and tricks for you
hey it's Joshua Vergara from Android
Authority what's going on everybody and
Here I am to give you 10 again tips and
tricks on the Nexus 10 alright let's
start off with an oldie but a goodie
protect your investment and let's face
it nobody ever wants their Android
device to fall and break the Nexus 4
might be one of the most fragile devices
out in the market right now but that
doesn't mean that the Nexus 10 deserves
to have some protection of its own and
this is the poetic slimline portfolio
case it does use a smart cover so one of
the great things about this cover is
that when you open it up it wakes up the
screen so that's really cool but on the
other hand you have these slits right
here that allow you to fold the cover
and when it folds back you're able to
let stand on there it's a great
multifunction case that not only
provides some protection for it
it's also very slim and it provides a
couple different ways for you to view
your tablet in easy ways without having
to use an extra standard anything like
that so with a little bit of
multifunction this ported case is
definitely my choice there are a ton of
different cases out there that you can
use but this is the one that I chose if
you do a lot of typing on your Nexus 10
tablet this might be a tip that is very
useful for you invest in a good keyboard
the on-screen keyboard on the Nexus 10
is big enough to make touch typing
pretty easy as compared to the Nexus 4
or the Nexus 7 you're probably going to
use the on-screen keyboard in the way
that it's supposed to be used like
typing like this or anything like that
however
oops right there however it is nice that
Google has put into the newest jelly
bean 4.2 version of Android a gesture
typing feature that allows you to just
swipe around much like the old keyboard
swipe to make life a little bit easier
when you're trying to type that'll be
very useful for this when you're using
it on the go but sometimes we need that
tactile feel that a real keyboard gives
us and sometimes we just kind of missed
that home key field to allow us to type
four perfectly on it so luckily there
are a lot of different options for it
and unlike with other smaller devices
the Nexus 10 is big enough so that a big
keyboard like that does do the trick and
doesn't look too weird this is the
keyboard that I use it is the logitech
wireless keyboard that connects to your
tablets it's made specifically for
tablets because it connects via
bluetooth now as you can see it's just
big enough to make it so that you can
have fast typing that tactile feel and
it really is easy to use so it'll give
you that great keyboard feel without
having to worry about the keyboard that
is on your on screen so oops
speaking of typing if you text a lot on
your Android device chances are you want
to be able to do so from your tablet
luckily that is possible because you can
text from your tablet obviously one of
the things we always do on our tech on
our Android devices is text however that
is usually relegated to just the phones
well there is a way to get your text
synced from the phone over to your
tablet and there are a few apps inside
of the Play Store that allow you to do
that but the one that I'm about to show
you is the best one primarily because
it's free and it's called mighty text so
this is the interface right here and
mighty text essentially is an
application that you put onto your phone
it takes all of your text messages syncs
them to your Google account which is
then synced up with the application
either on the web or on the app that is
installed in your tablet there are also
a couple really cool features of my text
like showing you how much battery is
left on your phone and also if a call is
coming in it will tell you that a call
is coming in so you can run over to your
phone and pick it up before the rings go
out mighty text is a wonderful
application that is free and available
for you if you don't want to use your
phone because you're ready using your
tablet or because you're just too lazy
to get up and pick it out
if it's blowing up now one of the
greatest features of jelly bean 4.2
especially if you like to share your
tablet is to make multiple guest
profiles so come and be our guest now
here's a tip that I covered in a
previous tenant game video and I still
think it's a really good tip to mention
inside of a nexus 10 tips and tricks
video like this it's using a guest
profile or multiple users as a feature
that was added to the newest version of
jelly bean 4.2 this feature allows you
to have multiple people using the same
device typically you would probably use
it for tablets so that each and every
person has their own space and they can
design their user account any which way
that they so choose so that there's some
individuality among the users I already
have it set up down here you have the
multiple users right here on the bottom
I have this generic one for this example
and when you click on it at the lock
screen it will change the wallpaper to
show you that it is going to be using
that other user account now once you get
past the lock screen as you can see here
I kept it as stock as possible I didn't
change anything to illustrate that when
that new user is created they have a
completely clean slate they can change
the user account any which way that they
want so that adds a lot of individuality
for each user each person this is
something that would be very useful for
let's say couples who have invested in a
nexus 10 for each other or for small
families so that children can have their
own spaces as well everything is kept
separate so even if you're inside of the
one of the users you can just head over
to the notification drop-down where the
settings are click on the user right
there and then it will go back to the
lock screen you could just easily switch
between the two as you can see I'm back
in to mine so that is setting up guest
profiles it's a great way of
differentiating between different users
and adding some individuality for each
person that have might happen to use
your lovely Nexus 10 the Nexus 10 may
not be a complete replacement of your
laptop or desktop computer but you
should still be able to get a lot of
work done as long as you get an office
suite all right so if you already have a
wireless Bluetooth keyboard then chances
are you are looking to get some work
done now there are a lot of different
office suites available in the Play
Store and we're going to take
look at a couple of them right now let's
just put in office and what you'll see
are a bunch of different kinds and there
are a ton of them but that you're
probably going to be looking at is
Kingsoft office Kingsoft office is the
one that is available for completely
free it's almost like open office in
that way that being said however I have
to say that the one that I choose is
Drive Drive in all lessons is actually
Google Docs except a little while ago
Google decided to put Google Docs and
merge it with their Drive application
which is their cloud storage it actually
works really well it's one of my
favorite things to use because it is
really really responsive even though it
is pretty much the simplest of all of
them I don't need a whole lot from my
office suite all I need to do is pretty
much write up all of the articles like
for example the one that you're probably
going to read based on this 10 again or
any other reviews that I happen to be
doing so you just hit new you get a
spreadsheet or a document you don't
necessarily make any presentations on
here that functional is not available
it's just spreadsheets and documents hit
document name it and then after that it
will just giving you a blank slate in
order to type to your heart's content
and it's the office suite that I decided
to use because it's very simplistic does
just what I need and nothing more
because I don't need much more sure the
Nexus 10 is great for viewing movies
playing games but if you want to get a
little bit more productivity done maybe
you should catch up on some literature
the Nexus 10 is a great device for
reading now I did say that the Nexus 7
is of a smaller form factor it looks
more like a book so that it might be a
might feel better to read on there but
that doesn't mean that Nexus 10 is not
able of doing that either and it doesn't
even have to just be literature you can
have multiple ways of reading I have
read it there and then also G reader for
all of my RSS feeds and news but then if
we're talking about literature you have
the Kindle app right here if you happen
to be a Kindle reader if you have if you
had a Kindle in the past you can
probably just put it aside because you
can get all your reading done on the
Nexus 10 tablet so in this example I'll
just be using Sherlock Holmes so as you
can see here the text is very legible
the resolution of the
Nexus 10 screen makes for some pretty
sharp
text the PPI is quite high on there so
reading on here is really really easy
you should be able to get a lot of it
done so I really encourage people to use
their Nexus 10 for reading because it's
a great way of getting it done well you
know what they say all work and no play
but just remember it's okay to daydream
now this is actually one of my favorite
tips for the Nexus 10 or any Android
device that's running the newest version
of jelly bean 4.2 the reason why is
because in jelly bean 4.2 it was given a
new feature called daydream that allows
it to become a bit of like a bedside
clock or there are a few other ways of
using it when you have it plugged in or
in a doc it brings out a little bit more
usage from your Android device when
you're not using and it's just on the
side and it's charging so I'm just
connecting the charger over here over at
the daydream after 15 seconds of it
being plugged in it should go into a
daydream state and that looks like this
so it's just a bedside clock that you
can use but there are photo frames
there's even the bean fling or Easter
Egg that you can use on the side so in
this case for me I put the Nexus 10 on
my bedside table or desk as you can see
here and it is basically used as a clock
so you're able to get more usage out of
an Android device even when you're not
using and it's just charging on the side
which i think is a great feature if you
do a lot of gaming this one is just for
you take control of your games it's
about time I brought up a gaming tip
tablets like the Nexus 10 with a 10-inch
form factor the great multi 604 graphics
in there along with the powerful dual
core Exynos processor all of that
together along with the great resolution
of the screen make this a wonderful
platform for gaming and you should
totally take advantage of it now one of
the only things that might be a little
bit weird about playing a game like
especially Grand Theft Auto on a device
like this is that you're using the touch
controls now for the most part they work
quite well not every button it's not
everybody's cup of tea however so for
running around or trying to get some
stuff done in Grand Theft Auto it
it might not necessarily be ideal and
the great thing is that you don't need
to buy an Android gamepad in order to
make this work you can use ones that you
might already have in your house in my
case it is the PlayStation 3 sixaxis
controller but you do have to invest in
one of the apps in the Play Store in
order to make this happen and if you
want to really take advantage of the
features of this app you might need to
have your tablet rooted but trust me
there are ways of doing it without all
of that it will require this $2 and
trust me for if you're a big game or $2
$2 is really not a whole lot to ask for
when you're going to be enhancing your
gaming experience but also it requires
the usage of this this is an OTG or
on-the-go cable that is used to expand
the usage of your micro USB port on the
Nexus 10 or any other Android device and
then the way that you know it's
connected is when you press the when you
is when you press the PlayStation button
on the controller and that shows up on
the top left so that's how you know and
we can even use it to navigate around
get get around it's really nice so how
does that translate into grand theft
auto vice city well there you go I have
read that it is available for Xbox
controllers there's a way of getting
that done the same way but in this case
the sixaxis controller is the one that I
use PlayStation all the way here's
another oldie but a goodie let's expand
your horizons that previous tip about
using a gaming controller on the Nexus
10 might have taught you something new
about the trusty OTG cable however this
is a good time to remind you of what one
of its main functions is and that is
expanding the memory of the Nexus 10 the
Nexus 10 doesn't necessarily come with
expandable memory but with an OTG cable
you can unlock that feature basically
what you're going to do is take any USB
stick that you already have and just
connect it to here so what you would do
is connect this to the micro USB as you
probably know by now and you are going
to need an app and you're going to see
you come up right now it is the Nexus
media importer but the next is media
importer does is it connects to the USB
device and is
able to get all of the data or just read
it from straight from the USB stick
however there's one thing that you do
have to know if you want full rewrite
read and write access to the USB stick
then you're going to have to route your
Nexus 10 in order to get that with the
Nexus media importer I'm the streaming
service guy myself Netflix and Spotify
but if let's say I'm going on a long
trip I do like to put some episodes of
my favorite shows onto a USB stick like
this put it into the next media importer
and it's an easy way for me to watch
whatever I want without needing an
internet connection it's time to get
even more fun out of your Nexus 10 when
you expand your display chances are
you're not too familiar with the port
that's found on the other side of the
microUSB port on the Nexus 10 well this
is one way to get a lot of usage out of
it it's a micro HDMI port and as you can
see here I'm using an adapter on a
existing HDMI cord that I already have
in order to make it fit into this slot
on that side of the Nexus 10 the micro
HDMI port allows for the display of the
Nexus tend to be mirrored onto any
device that the other side is plugged
into in this case it's a big-screen TV
put together with all of the different
tips that I've already given you in this
edition of 10 again being able to use
your Nexus 10 for reading for viewing
any type of media for gaming even this
is a great tip because it allows you to
not only extend the capabilities of your
Nexus 10 to a TV or to a projector but
just makes the whole experience even
that much more enjoyable that's why I
think that is a great way to round out
this version of 10 again so if you have
any tips or tricks that you think should
have been on this list let us know in
the comments below or in the comments of
