convenient technologies that has not
lifted off thus yet a lot of the
flagship devices that are coming out
this year does not have wireless
charging built into them thus finding
peripherals or accessories that is built
for wireless charging can be pretty much
a crapshoot
well today's your lucky day Android
authority has the top wireless chargers
right here and I'm Kevin Lee kept ninja
going to go ahead and review those for
you right now first on the list is the
official Nexus 5 wireless charger
although Nexus 5 is in its name it's
still a Qi enabled wireless charger thus
it should work for a Qi enabled device
the wireless charging platform has a
built-in magnet where the charging
mechanism is located to keep your device
locked into place the surface is glossy
plastic and the rest of the unit has a
matte finish to it the bottom of the
charger has an anti slip rubber grip
that keeps the charger in place it's a
sleek looking accessory that's made to
blend into your desk rather than stick
out since the device lays flat it is
difficult to use the phone while it's
charging the overall space the Qi
charger uses compared to others is
impressively small and that's something
that could be important if you have a
cramped desk or you want to put it on
your nightstand it does not have a
charging indicator and I found myself
turning my screen on just to make sure
the phone was still charging the price
is 50 dollars and it can be found on the
Google Play Store or on amazon.com
here's a company that we haven't covered
in a very long time Nokia and this is
their wireless Qi charger this was
designed to work with their windows
mobile phones it uses a circular design
for charging and has a soft touch rubber
it's a decent amount of grip on it as
well it uses a proprietary cable but
it's still very slim it's a bit short
for my liking but overall it gets the
job done the power brick is on the
massive side and all thing gets in the
way of plugging into a surge protector
while it's charging it has a small white
light and the light can be dismissed
easily since it's so small the charger
comes in as several different colors to
match your desk your phone or just your
personal style if having a wireless
charger of a certain color is something
that
important to you then this is your
charger and it can be found for around
$35 next up we move to the brands that
you may not have heard of yet but they
still provide great wireless charging
solutions this is the ravpower Qi
charger and portable battery this is a
two in one this is a wireless charger
and it's a wireless battery pack as well
it's a sleek design idea and it plays
out very well the charging panel is a
bit larger than other wireless chargers
it uses a soft touch rubber and it has a
power button design where the Qi
charging chip is located this charger to
me does not have the sleekness as other
wireless chargers at the end of the day
it's all about functionality it uses a
4800 mAh battery pack which is good
enough to charge some devices twice it's
great to have this functionality when
taking it out with you and you don't
have a plug nearby and I can't stress
enough the flexibility to use this
whenever you want and however you want
is what makes this a true winner there's
also a handy LED indicator to let you
know how much battery life is left you
can plug it into the wall and actually
charge the battery wow it's wirelessly
charging your device or you can plug a
device directly into it if you wish to
save battery this charger can be found
for $60 next up is the most expensive of
the bunch but it is a dual purpose this
is the tilt
phoo wireless charger what makes this
unique is that it's a cradle sitting at
45-degree angles as well allowing you to
see and interact with your device at the
same time you can comfortably watch an
android authority video and charge at
the exact same time it's made from soft
touch rubber on top and supported by
sturdy plastic on the back the model
that I have is black but they also have
red green blue as well it's a stealth
design and it has a LED indicator at the
very bottom that shines green when it's
charging but also shines red when it's
not charging and then lights up red only
if the device isn't charging correctly
so if your device is halfway on it it
will shine red for you the cord feeds
into the back of the unit and majority
of the time it's not visible
due to the design it actually feeds
between the two plastic wedges and
slides out that way depending on the
cheat chip on your device that
determines if you can use a landscape or
portrait the Nexus 5 is able to charge
landscape and portrait however due to
the size of the Nexus 7 it only works in
landscape not really a fault of the
charger but it's something that's worth
mentioning in my opinion the tilt
charger has design and functionality to
require more expensive price tag than
other chargers in the market and it
comes in at $70 last but not least is
the Cho wireless charger this charging
pad is plastic with rubber feet on the
bottom and this hard plastic is
throughout the whole construction at the
very top it has a sort of a wireless
charging logo in front there is a LED
that displays blue when the device is
charging and it also uses a standard USB
port the charging pad is rather on the
large side but I actually prefer that
because it's easier to charge a device
on it once you find the correct spot on
your device the light turns blue and
your device is now charging but due to
the design of the wireless charger
sometimes the LED is not visible and
it's easy for your device to get in the
way unfortunately a lot of the times the
easiest way to tell if your device is
charging is by actually turning your
screen on to see if the indicator shows
charging and this charger could be found
for around 35 dollars after testing all
these Wireless charges it's safe to say
that as far as charging they're all
pretty much the same they charge the
device at the same amount of time so
you're not going to get any difference
with that it really depends on what
you're looking to spin and what you're
looking to do with it
for me the tilt wireless charger is the
best for me in my home office color to
set my device on there and be able to
interact with it as it's charging but
the ravpower portable battery wireless
charger is the best as far as
functionality and portability are guys
that was the wireless chargers round up

mention already go ahead and drop it
