a new Nexus 4 owner after the holiday
season then here are some tips and
tricks for you hey it's Joshua of agar
from Android authority what's going on
everybody and these are my 10 tips and
tricks for the Google Nexus 4 alright
let's go ahead and jump in but first a
quick disclaimer some of the tips and
tricks you might see in this video you
may have seen before and at the same
time some of them pertain more to the
jelly bean 4.2 operating system than the
Nexus 4 device itself however I can
guarantee that there is something in
this video for everyone so let's jump in
this first tip is about the Nexus 4 in
particular though protect your
investment it's no secret that the Nexus
4 is a rather fragile phone even small
drops from a short distance are enough
to shatter even the corning gorilla
glass on the front or the regular glass
on the back this is a sexy phone but
that does come with a little bit of a
price so it's best to be as careful as
possible with it me personally when I'm
actually using my Google Nexus 4 I'm
usually pretty careful with it I've yet
to drop in I have yet to have any
scratches on the body but when I'm not
using the phone
I prefer to put it into this particular
sleeve there are a lot of different
cases out there by a lot of different
companies and this crew Menna
by SGP spigen is my choice
this next tip allows you to cut the cord
the key Wireless standard is built into
the nexus 4 meaning that you don't have
to use the included power cord in order
to charge your phone this allows you to
use various mats made by energizer or
even the one made specifically by LG now
unfortunately the Nexus wireless
charging orb is still not available but
there have been reports of it showing up
on websites overseas so hopefully this
really cool dock will be available in
the u.s. very soon but now we're going
to expand our lock screens one of the
best pieces of functionality added into
jelly bean 4.2 happens right when you'll
wake up your screen these lock screen
widgets or rather not really widgets but
screens are one things that you can
swipe among to open various apps like
the camera app you see here however you
are able to add to what's already built
in there and it's only a matter of time
before more applications add lockscreen
functionality in this case I open up the
messaging screen so that I can see all
of my text messages for in a glance you
are able to use this as an easy way of
seeing all of your info right away or to
go right into different apps immediately
some of you may already know how to do
this but still worth mentioning let's
capture your screen built into every
Android smartphone is the ability to
capture whatever it is on the screen at
any given time all you have to do is
make sure that your screen is displaying
exactly what you need and you just have
to hold down the volume down and the
power buttons together and a flash
should appear on your screen showing you
that something was taken afterwards you
will see in the notification drop-down
that your screenshot was saved and you
can view it just like any other picture
taking the screenshot of what's on your
screen is really handy because if you
happen to have some sort of information
let's say from an email or let's say
this list of stories from reddit for
example that you just want to be able to
save but there's no real way to be able
to do it easily you can always just take
a quick screenshot of what you're
looking at and now you have a picture
that is easily viewable whenever you
need it
and now we're going to take advantage of
a way that Google is just trying to make
your life that much easier set your
phone right quick it probably is no
secret already that the notification
drop-down has been expanded in the new
jelly bean 4.2 just hit this button on
the side and you will be given access to
all of your mostly used settings there
is a button there to get to just the
settings screen itself but as you can
see here I'm able to access Bluetooth my
mobile data and my wife I immediately
just from a quick press it'll go
straight to the page in the settings
that's really nice but there's an even
easier way to get to the settings page
that's by using a two finger swipe it
may seem like a very basic feature
inside of the Nexus 4 but it saves those
precious seconds and allows you to
really change the settings on your phone
really quickly so just use a two finger
swipe and you go straight to your
settings rather than having to pull down
the notification drop-down and hit that
button in the corner
let's get things tidy by keeping your
screens clean I'm actually going to
start with a rather obscure feature
that's found inside of the Play Store
there's an option inside of the settings
that allows you to auto add widgets or
in this case icons for any newly
installed applications on the phone this
might seem like kind of a cool feature
to have but in all the reality it is
really annoying think of it you get your
Nexus 4 you put your Google Account
which has already been used onto this
new phone and all those applications
that weren't already installed are now
installed and their widgets and icons
populate all of your home screens if you
have a lot of apps this becomes tiring
very fast in this case I'm going to use
pulse as my example by disabling that
setting I now don't have to worry about
it being on the home screen right away I
can just grab the icon and take
advantage of another feature that keeps
screens clean and that's the folders
these folders are actually sent down to
my dog making room for things that are
more important on my home screen take
advantage of these options because they
really help to keep things clean but now
it's time to unleash your inner
shutterbug or to use a term that I'm not
particularly fond of your inner
Instagrammer the camera inside of the
jelly bean 4.2 operating system has been
updated and makes the Nexus 4 camera
experience that much better the 8
megapixel camera found in the Nexus 4 is
already a big improvement but the
interface has been overhauled in the
camera app that does away with
traditional menus for touch and swipe
settings and that just makes the whole
experience fun the gallery itself has
been given some extra features as well
as when you hit this little icon on the
bottom left you're given access to a
bunch of new settings like the filters
and the ability to crop add a frame or
even change the exposure of a photo in
order to get a whole new look this
simple picture that I took inside of the
camera app has now been given a vintage
filter and some rounded edges for the
frame pretty neat stuff
another feature built into the new
camera is the photosphere it might make
you look a little bit silly as you're
trying to go around the grid and align
the dots however what comes out of it
are Street View like pictures that have
a very nice perspective and a kind of
fun to look at in this particular shot I
try to get just the area in front of me
and what turned out was this nice I'll
be at some why
imperfect shot still pretty fun to use
this one was actually quite new to me
teacher found how to pronounce your name
built into the pupil application are a
number of different fields for contact
cards and this one is phonetic name if
you use Google Voice Search and you find
it hard for Google to recognize a hard
to pronounce the name in your contacts
you can spell it out here the way it
would sound to it but for my brother as
you see here I just put a nickname and
added the word brother because Google
Voice search will find it all the same
now I don't have to say call Ryan which
gives me the wrong contact call Ryan
instead I can say call brother and it
will get me straight to the one that I
need call brother pretty handy stuff but
speaking of Google Voice Search let's
move on to Google now which it is built
into which is where we make our phone or
personal assistant if there's one thing
I want to drive home in this video it's
this use Google now more often it's an
impeccable piece of software that allows
you to see information you didn't
realize you wanted to know right away
yeah there's the weather right there but
above it was the score for the Lakers
game unfortunately well they lost again
but the voice search is just as
impeccable just by using my voice I can
activate voice search by saying Google
within Google now after that I can say
any number of commands like setting
alarms setting appointments or opening
apps from within the phone like Gmail
other than that Google now is just a
great place to start any search whether
you use your voice or the text box at
the top it's a great place to
consolidate all the info you're looking
for and it's just a wonderful tool so
use Google now more often after all of
that I just want to remind you in my
final tip it's okay to daydream one of
the more obscure features found in jelly
bean 4.2 is the daydream function but
still really useful I'm going to
illustrate this real quick before I
explain it by using the photo frame
feature in daydream essentially what
will happen here is I pick a few
pictures and after the phone is supposed
to go to sleep when it's plugged in
it'll become a nice little photo
slideshow on the side daydream is a
function that is available whether the
phone is docked or charging so remember
to go into the settings and pick the one
that is right for you I pick either
because let's face it not all of us have
a dog but we hope to someday daydream
allows you to make your phone either a
clock there's this beam flinger screen
that allows you to play with the phone
when it's not quite in use but it's in
the middle of daydreaming but there's
also the photo frame that I showed you
earlier
so imagine every night you plug in your
phone you put it on a stand like this or
maybe you are one of the lucky ones who
has a dog once the phone is about to go
to sleep it turns to whatever you set it
to and it continues to be useful even
when you're not using it it's one of the
great little features that might seem a
little scare but turns out to be really
useful it's just another reason why the
nexus 4 is a great device and so there
you have it the Nexus 4 is one of the
hottest devices out on the market right
now and that's illustrated by the fact
that it is almost perpetually sold out
if you're one of the few people that got
your hands on the Nexus 4 over the
holiday season I hope this tips and
tricks video helped you out do you have
