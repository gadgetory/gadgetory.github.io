against one of the benchmarks of Android
it's Joshua Carr from Andhra Authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the Samsung Galaxy s7 versus the Nexus
6p now while the galaxy s7 doesn't
feature a major overhaul in its design
it does provide a lot of refinements to
what was already established in last
year's s6 we still have the glass panels
with the metal frame but this time
around curves have been added to the
back almost as if Samsung took a
shrink-ray to the Galaxy Note 5 but
those curves really make it feel
incredibly nice in the hand and there
are a couple of refinements in the
little bits and pieces around as well
the camera hump on the back has been
significantly reduced so you're not
going to be scratching that camera lens
or glass rather if you're going to be
dragging the phone across the surface
and the home button up front is actually
a little more flushed to the to the
front but larger screens will still be
the crown for the Nexus 6p as this
particular design is not one that we've
necessarily seen a whole lot of before
and it feels really fresh especially
since its inception the 5.7 inch screen
pretty much dictates what the handling
will be like on this mostly metal body
and the black bar on the top of the
backing is one that was a little bit
controversial to some people as they
weren't sure how it would really look
but in the flesh it actually looks
really nice to us and we really enjoy
the design of the Nexus 6p the
fingerprint reader area on the backing
is right next to the Nexus logo and
overall this is pretty much the somewhat
bare-bones device that you would expect
Nexus to have but you still get dual
front-facing speakers which are
incredible to have on this phone Huawei
has it done a great job with the Nexus
6p and it provides a bit of a benchmark
for what kind of high-end design you
could get with an Android smartphone and
in this case we have stock Android
underneath but first let's take a look
at the displays we have quad HD displays
really ruling the day here and in the
case of the galaxy s7 it is on a 5.1
inch display and with the curves on the
back it still actually feels like a
smaller device than just 5.1 inches and
we think that's pretty awesome
5.7 inches is what you get in the Nexus
6p and it's quad HD display is actually
also AMOLED so you get a similar color
punch in both of the displays this time
around and we enjoy both pretty much
and it should be good for all of media
games text and while the Samsung Galaxy
s7 gets the benefit of being the later
introduced flagship model that doesn't
necessarily mean that the Nexus 6p
is going to fall behind all that much
the Snapdragon 810 in the 6p has
provided great performance and it is
very smooth with Android marshmallow
in the stock iteration really showing
what kind of speed and smoothness you
can have in stock Android but on the
other hand the galaxy s7 is still
something we have to put through its
paces and we do think that it is moving
along quite nicely with the Snapdragon
820 or perhaps the Exynos 88-90 in other
markets but it's in hardware that things
tend to change up a bit
the first thing we'll talk about is the
Nexus 6p s front facing speakers and
they provide great sound definitely a
lot better than the bottom mounted
speaker of the galaxy s7 only because of
its placement but also its stereo
construction from there the galaxy s7
gets a bit of a trump card as it has now
dust and water resistance in its body
even though this body is very similar to
last year's Galaxy s6 and s6 edge now we
are able to allow the phone to have a
tumble or even go into a splash and it
will still be able to go along without
any problems the Nexus 6p is not able to
boast that and it is also not able to
boast another feature that is returning
to the galaxy s7 expandable storage the
fingerprint readers are also supposed to
be pretty good performers only on the
Nexus 6p it is available on the back and
when a finger is laid on to that area it
will unlock and wake the phone at the
same time on the other hand the home
button is still needed in order to wake
up the galaxy s7 but it should work
pretty well as well if it is anything
like last year's s6 and in battery the
galaxy s7 now comes with a large 3000
milliamp hour battery which is a much
needed upgrade and it is charged with
fast charging wireless charging and
micro USB the Nexus 6p on the other hand
has a 30 for 50 million of our unit
putting it a little bit closer to the s7
edge in terms of the capacity but it is
also fast charged by USB type-c which is
the standard that has not been adopted
yet by Samsung coming into the cameras
we actually have a similar philosophy
between these two as the Nexus 6p was
one of the phones to make a big deal
about its sporting larger pixels overall
inside of its twelve point three
megapixel camera now that camera comes
with the F 2.0 aperture
and has a 1.5 micron sensor which allows
it to have good performance in low-light
situations and we definitely saw that
the s7 this time around takes that type
of lead now has a 12 megapixel camera
and has F 1.7 in its aperture with the
sensor supporting 1.4 micron pixels
which is also supposed to give it the
same type of performance that has
benefited the 6p now of course we have
to put these two phones through their
paces and we'll do a camera shootout to
see if these somewhat similar cameras
actually bring the kind of quality that
you would need but looking at the
applications it is obvious that the
Google camera still needs a little bit
more control over the photos but overall
if the quality is good then it should
still rival that of the manual and
various modes that are available in the
galaxy s7 s camera and finally on the
software side of things you get the
latest iteration of TouchWiz on top of
marshmallow which is stuck on the Nexus
6p now the Nexus 6p Android marshmallow
is pretty much what you would expect
from a stock iteration you get Google
now on tap you get the app drawer and
you get all of the different home
screens and elements to be able to just
cater the experience to yourself making
it pretty easy for this stock iteration
to become your operating system on the
other hand Samsung has really taken
TouchWiz and tried to streamline it or
at the very least take all of the
features that TouchWiz has put into
Android and at least put them aside so
they're not all up in your face and all
of the features for the most part come
back like the pop up view the multi
window and plenty of the gestures that
are available and they're all under an
area that says advanced features but
it's also in here that we got something
that was a little bit disconcerting
getting into the galaxy labs option of
the advanced features there's actually
an option to put away the app drawer you
can have all of your applications simply
on the home screens and it looks like
this is going to be a trend moving
forward in Android and you can see why
that might be the case in an article and
video that is posted on Android or
e-comm and so there you have it for this
quick look at the Samsung Galaxy s7 in
the Nexus 6p these are both very
powerful devices coming from respective
ecosystems that in this in the case of
Samsung continues a lineage that was
started in the galaxy s6 not only in
software design but also in general
design and we do think that we like this
refining of what has
a nice change of pace for the Samsung
Galaxy line on the other hand the Nexus
6p is a simple beast it is able to bring
everything that you need with the
bare-bones sort of mentality that is in
the Nexus and on top of that it is still
providing the best experience for stock
Android users that you can get so keep
in tune to Android authority for all of
this and also the galaxy s7 in future
reviews and comparisons as we are going
to be getting it soon and you can
