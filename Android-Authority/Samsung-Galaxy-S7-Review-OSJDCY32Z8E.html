what's going on everybody and this is
the Samsung Galaxy s7 now as is the case
these days you can also find a full
written detailed review at Android
authority comm that will go through all
of the specs and also give the opinion
of Norrath Gandia and my own you can
also find picture galleries of the phone
so you could see in all its glory and
camera samples of the Samsung Galaxy s7
right here and you can also find a bunch
of benchmarks because we tested the
Snapdragon 820 version with the exceed
O's 88-90 version speaking of those
processors why don't we go ahead and get
all the specs out of the way first
while Samsung have finally done it they
have perfected their design language
taking the same metal frame and the dual
glass panels from last year with the
galaxy s6 they have further refined the
design and now have made one of the most
accessible phones ever the 5.1 inch
screen size really helps with a handling
but the bezels on the sides are also
very respectable but it's really those
curves on the back of the phone that
make all of the difference the phone
just sits so beautifully in the hand and
it's really easy to maneuver around
especially with one hand going left to
right with the phone is really easy and
then minimal hand gymnastics are needed
in order to get to the top pretty much
all of the elements are about the same
here you have the home button up front
that has the fingerprint reader embedded
underneath that is also a little bit
more flush with the body but it's really
the camera on the back that's no longer
protruding out so much that really shows
just how more sleek this phone is than
last year the phone is about a
millimeter narrower from last year's
Galaxy s6 but is also about a millimeter
thicker now that is to make room for the
curve on the back but also in order to
provide room for the 3000 milliamp hour
battery underneath especially
considering everything that this phone
is capable of doing it's great that the
body the first thing you see of this
phone happens to be really attractive
and then you get the phone in the hand
and it happens to be one of the most
accessible handling phones that are out
there right now the display of the
galaxy s7 is a returning Super AMOLED
display coming in a quad HD resolution
but it has high pixel densities given
the five point one inch size Super
AMOLED displays bringing pretty much
everything you would expect super
punched out and highly saturated colors
and also that whites aren't necessarily
true whites because unlike an LCD there
is no backlight on here what I did not
like about the display is the fact that
it requires a lot of managing on the
brightness if you were to take the
brightness slider and bring it all the
way down to the left it's almost as if
you're turning off the display I
typically have to have it around 40%
just to keep it legible especially when
indoors and then if I go outside I have
to crank it all the way to a hundred
just to make sure that it is perfectly
visible this kind of managing of the
screen brightness especially for better
battery life is just a little bit
annoying and definitely a little more
cumbersome than usual the main addition
when it comes to the display is the fact
that it can be always on when the phone
is in standby a small graphic will come
up showing you either the time or a
calendar or a few graphics which are
predefined now it may not be the most
useful feature at least not in its first
iteration right now but I do have to
admit that if I'm trying to figure out
what day a particular date lands on in
the next month it is nice to have the
calendar on at all times all in all
however you still get the same quality
from a Super AMOLED screen that you
would expect on a Samsung device the
thing is we've seen a lot of AMOLED
displays on plenty of other devices over
the last year so it got me thinking
maybe because AMOLED is becoming so
proliferated maybe we're just more
accustomed to seeing these oversaturated
colors but in performance I have to tell
you that I have been using the Exynos
88-90 version of the galaxy s7 as my
daily driver and for that matter we have
a bunch of benchmarks where we are
comparing it to the Snapdragon 820
version which I did receive recently in
order to see what the differences are
between the two but in performance I
really have had no issues with the
galaxy s7 especially considering some of
the new transitions put into TouchWiz it
also makes perfect sense that Samsung
have really optimized their processing
package for their own software and it
definitely feels like so and in terms of
gaming I do have one quick thing to
mention there is the water cooling that
is available with the processor in the
galaxy s7 and though we're not able to
really test that in real time I can tell
you that under heavy load in my case
playing Final Fantasy 9 for extended
periods of time I did not feel the phone
get really all that warm at all it did
not get as hot as some other devices
might have especially ones more recently
and ultimately it didn't feel
uncomfortable to have the phone for
extended periods of gaming in Hardware
the first thing we can talk about is a
returning feature from the galaxy s5
water and dust resistance that means
that the phone could get wet and you
just have to take a towel to it and it
should be perfectly fine to go the only
place that water will actually affect is
the speaker grille on the bottom it will
muddy out all of the audio at least
until it dries out that said however the
speaker is not really anything to boast
about it is still pretty much average
maybe just a little bit below average
considering we have plenty of better
speakers with let's say front-facing or
even dual stereo placement nowadays
which leads us to a feature that is
returning in the galaxy s7 that I think
everybody was really excited about
expandable storage we've already taken
advantage of it with a SanDisk 200
gigabyte microSD card that we put in on
day one and even though I'm not
necessarily the type of user to use up
32 gigabytes of on-board storage all
that quickly it is nice to know that
when that is used up I still have 200
gigabytes more that I could use for
photos videos and music and that leads
us to the battery the battery is a 3000
milliamp hour unit inside of the galaxy
s7 and it's not removable but with this
unibody and very sleek design that is
kind of okay-- on very heavy days I'm
able to get screen on time of about
three and a half hours but if I'm using
the phone more normally I can get up to
4 maybe even 5 hours of screen on time
without any problems nonetheless however
if you are a more moderate user you
could probably stretch out the battery
life of the galaxy s7 to a solid 2 days
but there is still fast charging support
and the micro USB port on the bottom
provides that it does not have USB
type-c which might feel like a step back
from what's supposed to be the future of
Android but we do think that the reason
for this is so that the galaxy s7 can
still tap into VR platforms like the
gear VR but now we can talk about the
camera down to 12 megapixels from the 16
that was in the galaxy s6 in the note 5
after it's now 12 megapixels might seem
a little bit poultry these days but the
reason for it is actually quite sound
the pixels themselves are made bigger
1.4 microns to be exact and they will
provide better low-light performance but
before I talk about that we do have to
mention the front-facing camera it does
provide some really good quality selfies
so for those of you who want to take
self-portraits more often then the five
megapixel shooter up front will be able
to do the job but what I really like
about the front-facing camera is that it
can record 2k or quad HD video and that
will make it really good for any
vloggers out there or anyone that just
wants to take some videos of themselves
other modes include slow motion panorama
and a couple of other modes that you may
or may not use but the app itself is
pretty easy to use even if the controls
might get somewhat overwhelming at times
especially if you get into the pro mode
you do get shutter speed control and the
white balance is available in Kelvin
readings 4k video recording is available
but as is the case or has been the case
for the last year if you use 4k video
recording you won't be able to take
advantage of some
the enhancements like for example video
stabilization but oh is is able to help
a little bit with these videos and
overall they have come out quite nice
now the pictures of the galaxy s7 are
going to be smaller than that of the
galaxy s6 that's because of the 12
megapixels but you also lose some of the
detail from moving away from 16
megapixels now this doesn't mean that
the photos aren't necessarily sharp
especially if you take it for what it is
the photos look really great it's only
when you really zoom in that you can see
that not only are the writings a little
bit less sharp but there's also some
noise reduction trying to compensate for
that the sharpness is a little bit lower
because of noise reduction and I
actually found that the photos aren't
necessarily so oversaturated what I did
like is that the HDR mode requires you
to actually use it in HDR situations
it's not just going to add a bunch of
saturation and blob up the shadows of
every single photo instead you will see
a difference only when you're in high
contrast situations otherwise if you
have HDR Auto on then you'll be able to
just let the guess work be done by the
phone there are a couple of caveats with
this camera however if you go into more
lower life situations the phone on auto
mode does tend to go warmer with the
color temperature now that makes
everything have sort of a yellowish or
maybe even an orange hue on everything
so you just have to keep that in mind
when using the auto mode you can always
go into the pro mode and compensate for
that using the white balance slider of
course ultimately the camera of the
galaxy s7 is everything that you would
want only somewhat enhanced with the
lower megapixel count and the larger
pixels that makes for better low-light
performance but the issue with that is
that in broad daylight shots in those
situations when you're out and about and
the lighting is perfect you want to
losing a little bit of that sharpness
because you're losing detail going from
for less megapixels but considering just
how fast it is to use this camera by
just double tapping the home button and
then getting right into the camera it is
a very good companion to have on the
daily as a camera shooter now we can get
into software and I do have one thing to
mention before we get going the option
to turn off the app drawer in the galaxy
labs area of the settings is not found
in the Snapdragon 820 Verizon phone that
I was using for testing as well now we
don't know if this is going to be the
case for all of the Galaxy s7 or the s7
edges in the West but we wanted to make
sure that we mentioned it to you so you
can take it for what it is
now there aren't too many new additions
in the software other than a Games
launcher and tool essentially the games
launcher will allow for all of the games
that you have installed to be put into
one particular place and when playing in
your game you can have a games tool that
can lock the recent and back capacitive
keys and provide you easy access to a
few functions while within your game
multitasking is still pretty easy on
TouchWiz as well with the multi window
capability and also the pop-up view that
shrinks down most windows so you can
drag it around and have overlaid windows
on top of your workspace that said
however on a 5.1 inch screen there's not
really too much real estate to be able
to do all of that you are able to use it
if you really need to but ultimately the
larger 5.5 inch s7 edge is probably
better suited for that multitasking deal
the galaxy s7 is available now at all
ranger carriers and will come in at the
more premium price for flagships that
you would typically find either on a
contract or for about $700 or more for
an unlocked device and so there you have
it the samsung galaxy s7
in addressing the issues that came up in
the galaxy s6 last year they've been
able to create a smartphone that just
might be accessible to pretty much
anybody especially if you're a fan of
the galaxy s6 but you thought it was
missing a few features this just might
be the perfect smartphone for you but
there are some more implications behind
the galaxy s7 in the era of microUSB
Samsung just might have shown us what
the perfect smartphone could look like
and in doing so they've been able to
show us what might be the final
evolution of this era of smartphones
this is a turning point for smart phone
technology as we move into a world of
USB type-c and also modular designs and
hopefully more out-of-the-box thinking
but until all of that gets hashed out
you just might have one of the best
phones available right here in the
samsung galaxy s7
as always thank you guys very much for
watching and hope you enjoyed this
review of the Samsung Galaxy s7 it is an
incredible device and even if it's not
necessarily unique or different compared
to last year's phones it is still one of
the most reliable phones that you can
probably have on the daily stay tuned to
