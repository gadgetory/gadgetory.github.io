2015 we're here with android authority
i'm here with the gentleman who's the VP
of Product Development Canada McRae hi
okay very good sir with tilt and tilt
make some really great products pretty
new on the scene but if you're into
wireless charging you're gonna want to
know what they have to offer you bet we
are the wireless charging leader for
sure got it so what are we looking at
here today well we've got our you know
award-winning fantastic view line of
products without the view has been on
the market and is dominated the desktop
space and if you're a wireless charging
guy or person you know you need to
charge in the car and that's been the
holy grail space that nobody's you know
gone after so we went after that space
and this is the white view wireless
charger for the car it dropped the
wireless charger into the charger and it
starts charging just like and then
you've got a one button release that
allows you to take it out with one
button it's got a massive micro suction
cup that allow you to stick it to a
dashboard a windshield wiper it's a
three coil solution so you don't have to
worry about accurate placement and it
really just fills that gap of wireless
charging and accessories that has been
avoid absolutely and you're also saying
that the bottom plate is replaceable the
bottom plate just has a little slot we
have we shipped with two so increase the
other person who drives this car doesn't
have wireless charging they can plug
their phone in and they can you know go
ahead and charge they're nice and also
on the the adapter that goes into the
there's a cigarette lighter adapter that
will charge the three coils it is not
microUSB because you can't charge the
three coils we provide the right power
through but we have a USB port on that
cigarette lighter for the other person
or another device you may want to charge
this not wireless charging what else are
we looking at here you also know you got
the view solo the view solo is about a
single coil we have a proprietary
patented alignment a piece on the cable
so that you can put your phone down and
immediately know where your coil is it's
a lower price entry point but it's got
the great view colors then great deal
got a great a lot of great points on it
to give you an idea of where you can
drop the coil because again alignment on
a single coil is the biggest issue that
we hear from consume
totally so when our consumer is going to
be able to get these problems humor is
going to be able to get both of these
products in the next 30 to 45 days we've
got some you know got product in the
final stages of development and so you
know keep lookout for kickstarter looked
out for our own site and look out for
news on your site ok good stuff and the
pricing on both these guys so 7999 for
the car mount and 49 99 m for the view
Silla alright great well thank you very
much sir Cheers cool appreciate it darks
