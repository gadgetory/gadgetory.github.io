Authority now arms current leading
processor design is the cortex a 72 and
we find it in system on chips like the
quirian 952 q95 which we find in phones
like the Huawei mate 8 and the wildly p9
also called Karma using it in some of
their mid-range chips now today arm have
announced the cortex a7 t3 so what does
the a 73 bring to the table how is it
different to the cortex a7 t2 but let me
explain when you use your smartphone the
CPU is running and it produces heat and
the amount of heat it produces as a
function of the voltage and of the
frequency and of the chip design and
basically that heat is dissipated
through the phone itself now when you do
something like open an app or read a web
page the CPU usage will peak momentarily
just for a few seconds and then it will
drop down again as the app opens or as
the webpage is rendered and then while
you're reading the web page the CPU can
be running at a very low level and
that's absolutely normal and that's
absolutely fine and the amount of heat
it produces during that peak doesn't
really matter because only doing it for
a few seconds and the phone very easily
dissipates that heat through is chassis
and through the body of the phone now
when you start doing something
complicated with your phone that heat
starts to build up and the more it
builds up the more heat has to be
dissipated through the body of the phone
and you've says that yourself you might
be holding your phone you might feel
warm to the touch at the back and that's
the heat being dissipated because unlike
desktops a mobile phone or smartphone
doesn't have a heat sink and a cooler
and a big fan that's running on the back
of it it's all just passive heat
dissipation now basically what happens
is when you start running your phone at
a high workload for a long period of
time the heat is going out through the
phone gets to a saturation point and it
can't dissipate any more heat so
therefore if you keep adding heat the
phone will just get hotter and hotter
and hotter and in fact it will become
uncomfortable
in the Hang now when it gets at that
point the Linux kernel knows what's
going on and it will actually bring down
the amount of heat being produced by
your CPU and it does that using a thing
called throttling it will bring down the
frequency it may even bring down some
things like the voltages so that the
heat being produced by the CPU is less
and gives the chassis the body of the
photo chance to get rid of the heat that
it already has
and then if later on it finds it it
actually has a spare capacity more heat
can be produced it will ramp up the CP
usage again now this is really
interesting because what happens when
it's rotted when it brings down the heat
it actually brings down the performance
so when we run a benchmark them we all
run benchmark so I run them to test
phones as well but when we run a
benchmark we often do in the phone is
cold and it runs and it can produce a
peak level of performance for a short
amount of time and how long do these
benchmarks take to run a few seconds 30
seconds a minute and then that's it
they're over now of course what happens
if you're doing it that benchmark time
and time and time again or you're
playing a game for a long period of time
we were doing lots of calculations for a
long period of time the performance will
actually drop now here's the thing about
the cortex a 73 the amount of heat it
produces during its peak performance
level just those few seconds it using it
and the matter heater produces with a
sustained level of workload is almost
exactly the same and we've never seen
anything like this in a smartphone chip
before always there's been an overhead
where the CPU can hit a peak and produce
more heat just for a short amount of
time but when it comes to its sustained
level it has to be much lower but with
the Quartus a 73 they are the same thing
and that is really an amazing thing for
designers because first of all it means
that the amount of heat is going to be
produced by this CPU is constant and
that may give way to new designs and new
ways to make mobile phone make smart
phones the materials that are used where
the the CPU is placed on the circuit
boards on because now the CPU designer
knows that this level is always going to
be constant and it also means that when
we're playing games when we're using the
app of the apps that our CPU intensive
actually the performance won't drop it
will actually stay the same after the
first minute and after 30 minutes we
should be getting the same level of
performance and
that's something we haven't seen before
in a mobile system-on-a-chip
now before I go any further there are a
few caveats the cpu we're talking about
the CPU here is only one part on a
system on a chip the GPU is another
important part Nick produces a
significant amount of heat as well and
their other component as well let the
modems and the ISPs and the DSPs and the
memory controllers and they all produce
an amount of heat as well now if you've
got a very efficient CPU but the GPU is
producing lots of heat the CPU will end
up still being throttled because it's
the overall heat that is the issue here
so that's a caveat we are just talking
about the CPU here and not about the GPU
and other parts that go with it and
there are of course other other
technologies that can be used to bring
down the heat including big.little which
incorporates more power efficient CPU
cores with high-performance CPU cores
there's also things like the intelligent
power allocation algorithm that's now in
the mainstream Linux kernel which means
that if the CPU has is running and it's
not using all of its performers in some
of that heat allocation that thermal
budget can be given over to the GPU so
the overall temperature can rise to its
maximum now in terms of the actual
design of the cortex a 72 I won't go
into it too much here in this video
there are some interesting things like
it uses now a 64 K instruction cache
things like that you can go over and
read the article that I've written over
and wrote accom if those things are of
interest to you however what will be of
interest to you is what's called the
process note that each chip is made
using silicon using transistors and the
idea is the smaller the gap between the
transistors and the smaller the
transistors the more efficient the chip
can be now today's modern chips that we
find in the galaxy s7 both the Qualcomm
and the Samsung variants are built using
a 16 nanometer process and arm have
already announced that they are working
on a test chip at 10 nanometers and is
expected that the cortex a7 t3 will be
able to be built at 10 nanometers
however it can also be built at 60
nanometers in fact you could probably
also be built at 28 nanometers if that's
what silicon vendors warmth it so let me
throw some numbers at you if it's built
at 60 nanometers like the current pro
tips of today like the Kirin 950 in the
queuing 9/5 then the cortex a 73 is 10
to 15 percent faster than the cortex a
72 is a 10 percent performance boost but
yet a sustained level of performance
throughout the whole working life time
of a program it doesn't dip after a few
minutes now also it's built on the same
16 enemy to process it produces 20% less
heat now that means that components like
the GPU can be given a bit more of a
thermal budget so they can run faster
and they can produce more high
performance 3d graphics now when the
court is a team industry is built using
a 10 nanometer process and arm already
proved they can do that you'll find an
article over at the and rolls-royce comm
website which talks about a chip that
they've made with codename Artemis and
we now know that Artemis is in fact the
cortex a 73 on a 10 nanometer process
the a 73 is 30% faster than the a 72 and
it's 30% more efficient than the a 72 so
that means when we start to see the
system on our chips for VA 73 they're
going to be faster they're going to be
cooler and when you run them for a long
period of time their performance is not
going to drop because the heat output is
going to remain the same now those are
some pretty important things now when
will we see systems on a chips with the
cortex a 73 well of course arm is
already working with its partners you
can be get pretty much guaranteeing that
they were already working on system on a
chips that will have the 873 in it and
arm already made the test chip and that
test chip data will be sent on to its
partners so they can get really quick as
they can to getting chips out now there
is possibility that we may even see some
phones with the quarters a 73 in it by
the end of this year but if not the end
of this year certainly in 2017
personally I'm quite looking forward to
seeing the a 73 in action
good to bench market and to see its heat
output when those phones become
available now as I'm sure you know it's
very popular for CPUs to have eight
cores in them now some of those eight
core processors have four cortex a53
calls and then four cortex 857 or four
cores it's a 72 calls big door little
however there are a whole bunch of
mid-range phones that just use 8 cores
of the same type and that's normally the
cortex a53 and some of them might be
clock did they say 1.5 gigahertz and
some might be clocked at let's say 1
gigahertz so it's kind of a big dot
little arrangement but using the same
cortex core now what's really
interesting about the cortex a 72 is
that it's a high-performance core but
they've actually managed to make it
significantly smaller and it's now come
to the point where actually it would be
just about the same silicon area to
produce a hexa core processor with 4
cortex a53 cores and 2 cortex a seventy
three cores in the same system on which
it will take about the same space as an
octa-core a53 chip now why that's
important is because for these silicon
vendors the amount of silicon space is
where they make their money it cost
millions of dollars to produce the first
chip and then they have to produce
millions of them to get their money back
now a silicon cost money and for every
little square millimeter of silicon that
isn't included they can make some more
profit now if these manufacturers
actually get around to making hexa core
chips with 2 cords a 73's and 4 cortex
a53 they will actually see a 90% boost
in single thread performance so that
means doing certain activities like
scrolling on a webpage or even loading a
webpage will actually be significantly
faster because the single thread speed
is better and as for multi thread speed
that will actually be 30% better so
that's going to be an interesting
development for 2017
