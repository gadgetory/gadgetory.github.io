Android Authority and in a sea of budget
smartphones does ZTE s latest offering
have what it takes to stand out among
the rest well that's what we're here to
find out what the ZTE grand X Max Plus
in design the grand X Max Plus might not
appear to look like much and essentially
what you're getting is a very simple and
straightforward design that doesn't try
to be overly flashy the front and back
panels are made of glass which can be
very prone to fingerprints by the way
with the back panel featuring a carbon
fiber pattern to give the phone a little
bit of extra Flair along the sides is a
smooth plastic frame that holds it all
together with the top and bottom
portions of the phone being slightly
more rounded than the rest and in the
hand the phone does feel very well
constructed with a six inch screen on
the front this will be a phone that many
will consider a phablet and it certainly
isn't easy to use in one hand there's no
denying this is a large phone and the
thick side bezels sharp corners and
relatively flat profile all the way
around makes this phone feel pretty
unwieldy in the hand and the material
choices of smooth plastic and glass
don't exactly provide a lot of grip for
the phone either
while the sheer size of the phone and
the slippery materials haven't led to me
dropping the phone I did notice that I
was a lot more careful than usual
especially when I was trying to reach
the top of the display because in order
for me to do so I typically had to
loosen up my grip and that was when the
phone felt the least secure and most
prone to being dropped going around the
rest of the device the power button is
located on the right side making it
easily reachable with the micro sim and
SD card slot sitting right above the
volume rocker can be found on the
opposite side with the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack up top microUSB port on
the bottom and a notification LED it's
located next to the front-facing camera
along with the usual earpiece and sensor
like I mentioned earlier the display on
the front measures in at a hefty six
inches which is only fitting for a name
like Grand xmax plus the resolution is
fairly standard for a mid-range phone at
720p and with the resolution being
stretched across a six inch screen the
pixel density does take a pretty big hit
meaning pixels are noticeable if you
look closely enough regardless the
screen still looks quite good for
everyday tasks including watching videos
and playing
aimes especially on such a large screen
color saturation brightness outdoor
visibility and viewing angles are all
good with very little color shifting
making this a very enjoyable display all
around the performance is also pretty
standard and simply just gets the job
done
the processor is a Snapdragon 400 paired
with 2 gigabytes of RAM which is not all
too uncommon among budget devices and
for most tasks like navigating through
the OS opening up applications and
multitasking the grant xmax plus
performance reasonably fast most games
including first-person shooters and 3d
racing games like asphalt a also ran
smoothly without much of a hiccup so for
most users the performance will be more
than adequate and shouldn't bring many
complaints the grant X Max Plus
certainly isn't going to set any new
benchmark records but this mid-range
processor has proven itself many times
before in other devices and is proving
itself here once again with the rest of
the hardware the grand X Max Plus brings
LTE on the Cricket Network along with
all the other usual connectivity options
16 gigabytes of storage can be found on
board with the microSD card slot
allowing up to an additional 32
gigabytes of storage if the internal
storage simply isn't enough
the single speaker is located on the
back denoted by a tiny slit in the glass
and besides the poor speaker placement
that can easily be muffled by laying the
phone on a flat surface the speaker
volume is fairly low making it difficult
to hear in anything but the quietest of
environments
the camera on the grand xmax plus brings
a 13 megapixel shooter on the rear and a
5 megapixel wide-angle lens on the front
at 88 degrees which allows not only for
great-looking selfies but also the
ability to easily fit a lot of scenery
or a few of your friends into the frame
the camera UI packs three different
shooting modes to cater to a variety of
users for the regular everyday casual
picture taker the automatic mode keeps
things simple with modes like HDR and a
short list of general camera settings
available on the left side tapping on
the viewfinder will adjust the point of
focus but exposure is fixed based on the
scenery for the more advanced user the
pro mode will allow for manual controls
over white balance ISO and exposure and
introduces other elements onto the
screen like a horizon leveler and a
camera grid the third mode is what ZTE
likes to call the fun mode which brings
about several different options for
layering images together either on top
of one another or side by side to
achieve a certain effect the picture
quality however is what's going to
matter most and the camera has turned
out to be a decent shooter at best it
autofocuses fairly quickly and the
majority of the time photos will come
out clear and in focus but the biggest
weakness to this camera is its lack of
dynamic range as it tends to blow out
the highlights and crush the shadows
pretty much every single time
HDR certainly will help alleviate the
issue and I'd almost recommend shooting
an HDR at all times if it wasn't for the
long processing times between shots it's
also very aggressive in its color
saturation which I actually don't mind
but I know not everyone will love the
highly saturated look close-up shots are
also pretty difficult with this camera
as it struggles to grab focus and this
problem becomes even more apparent in
low-light speaking of low-light the
camera doesn't bode well in these
situations either not only is there a
lot of digital noise but they're also
very dark and muddy in appearance
however even with all these issues it's
one of the better cameras you can get on
a smartphone in this price range and the
images are still good enough for social
media battery life is probably one of
the better aspects of the grand xmax
plus inside is a very large 3200
milliamp hour battery keeping the phone
running and with basic usage like
texting reading up on social networks
and light web browsing this phone easily
lasted a good couple of days with five
plus hours of screen on time
battery life is also helped by the great
standby time as the grand xmax plus only
loses two to three percent overnight
with more heavier tasks like gaming and
a lot of picture-taking thrown into the
mix the grand xmax plus was still able
to easily make through a day with screen
on time still breaking the 4-hour mark
with the software the grand xmax plus is
currently on android 4.4 kitkat with a
custom overlay by ZTE unlike other
versions of ZTE skin or many other
Chinese om skins in general the grant X
Max Plus still features an app drawer
that falls more in line with a standard
Android experience the odd combination
of jelly beans holo blue Kit Kats white
and some green thrown into the mix
doesn't make it the prettiest of skins
out there and it's mostly just for
aesthetics the amount of features are
minimal to say the least but they
include things like customizable quick
launch shortcuts on the lockscreen and
what ZTE likes to call me pop that puts
virtual navigation keys on a floating
bubble for easier one-handed navigation
if you bloatware applications can be
found along with some cricket specific
apps but other than that the experience
is pretty tame and doesn't try to do too
much the ZTE grand X Max Plus is
available now on the Cricket Network
here in the States for $200 prepaid
making one of the more easily affordable
large screen smartphones out there for
the price of only $200 ZTE was able to
create a very formidable package the
design might not be too flashy but it
provides a great overall experience and
most importantly great battery life the
six inch screen size will make many
consider the grand X Max Plus to be a
phablet but if you're looking for a
large screen without paying a large
price then this is definitely a solid
option worth considering as always guys
