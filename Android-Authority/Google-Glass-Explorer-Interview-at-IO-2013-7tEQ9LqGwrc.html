everybody this is nate swanner with
android authority i'm here with my
friend Peter Schmitz as a glass Explorer
and has forgotten this is a developer's
conference little overdressed so Peter
why don't you tell us about what got you
into glass well yeah maybe you got you
interesting the program okay so I mean
obviously the excitement last year at
i/o is my third one so just seeing the
applications that they utilize last
shooting on very much the sports world
of diving out of a blimp you know doing
the BMX on top of the roof it's you know
I think that was something to very much
send up some some fireworks and create
that excitement around it so after that
you know we all rushed outside there's a
big long kind of booth over there of all
right if you're just in grass you know
obviously everyone is come over and
check it out and we basically had to
fill out these surveys so it asks you
kind of what industry you're in what
you're looking to develop glass on and
then based on those answers that said
thanks for your interest you know we'll
get in contact when you're ready or here
is your glass Explorer number we got
these glass laser inch kind of cubes and
then yeah basically we're told in the
next year we're going to be sending out
order forms it's going to be about
fifteen hundred dollars and we're
excited to have you you know there's
infant applications and I'm just as you
mentioned you know one of two thousand
explorers all with their own ideas all
with their own sets of dreams and hopes
and now I'm just you know I feel
privileged I feel very honored to be a
part of that program and included so but
what excites you about developing for
that
I think it's just the whole concept of
you know as Larry mentioned during his
keynote yesterday creating a place where
you can just start testing and off to
worry about boundaries I think glass has
obviously a lot of feedback right now
around it whether it's positive or
negative other people have used it or
not whether they're in the techni
industry are out and I think just being
able to be a part of such a supportive
community you know the glass people that
work here Sarah price Timothy Jordan
Steve Lee Isabella main designer I mean
they're all here to help us and and they
need our help in turn right well I mean
we're the ones making the apps besides
the major labels and you know the thing
I'm most excited to develop on is just
as with all applications that I'm
working on right now I'm just excited
for someone to have that lightbulb
moment when they use my app you know
being able to kind of see that smile
when they do just have to look up and
ask for an ingredient you know
transition or a change to else's two
cups or they look in their fridge and
they can just be looking at things
listing them off kind of peering around
and when they get those recipes like oh
I'd even think I could make that and
yeah I think just those aha moments with
any new platform is just going through
and and seeing people use your products
you know getting the feedback working
with them to to help them I mean that's
what apps are here to do right this is
the app on the phone get your finger not
what I've seen on gaas that is correct
this is also similar to the interface
that is their html5 portal online so it
has these cards it has them all laid out
so as you can see it has you know device
info where it lists your current version
your battery level etc etc as you scroll
down you have your device location
awesome feature you start scrolling
through your 10 contacts oh sorry about
that so you can pick 10 contacts that
you can initiate communications with you
can respond to anyone emailing your
calling you but to begin with for the
program you basically get a circle of 10
friends that you can I can hang out with
from the glass I can whatever it is Tom
so so yeah those are listed there as you
scroll down there are the different apps
that are available so the standard ones
of Google's offerings but just this
morning they launched ever know facebook
tumblr CNN el twitter
and then one of the local companies here
is ice breaker which is a pretty cool
app so if anyone's out there with glass
and you haven't seen that look them up
it's a way to meet other glass explorers
okay should understand what you're
seeing yeah so let me activate it again
so right now you're seeing the time the
standard card as I swipe through
backwards this whole part of the side of
the heads a touchscreen better not touch
me touch pad it works best when you tap
kind of near your temple in the middle
but again the whole thing is so right
now it's the weather you know I can
change where I am it's geo location or I
can look up one going again it lists
some of our my google now cards so let
me kind of get it in my view here so
again that this part of the glass is all
adjustable horizontally to kind of see
both edges of the screen and then you
adjust the nose pads for height we will
oh there you go so I'll turn guest mode
on and now as we get back to so swiping
down is basically the back button
forward and back scroll through cards a
double finger touch is instant google
search and then as you'll see when we
click on things that's basically like
the ok button or you're going want to go
to the next screen so we can kind of
scroll through different pictures we can
play a video right now you guys won't be
able to hear it as it's that bone turns
yeah I forget what's called on top my
head yeah bone conduction and then yeah
you can kind of see what a text message
looks like the times are always
displayed in that bottom right corner
and then again just any kind of Google
searches you guys are doing so yes
that's kind of where we can go from
there you can quickly on glass like kind
of scroll through and look at a bunch of
cards at once ok glass take a picture
you'll see this square instantly come
from the center outwards and we're so
used to interacting with technology
that's available right now like
viewfinders so the first go days altima
it's kind of embarrassing I kept every
time I take a picture like trying to
line it up like it's a new Finder and it
would kept taking all these pictures
down I was like ok so where do I put the
glass in relation do I want to do it I
pick like a 5-foot distance what's
interesting is so anytime you
want to take a picture glass will take a
picture from what you see it's really
meant to say ok glass take a picture and
for me to just look at you and not even
pay attention and then you go back
through later and you review those
pictures and again it's very much your
point of view what you're seeing what
you're working on and so yeah it's kind
of exciting thing to realize that now
it's shifting a very much built-in habit
of us from what exists right now to
where this is trying to take us ok glass
Google how do I say where is the library
in Chinese so this will actually list
the local language the phonetic
pronunciation then the English then what
type of Chinese is being displayed so
yeah I mean that's then itself so I
speak Thai and Italian and I've done a
lot of business over in Southeast Asia
and and just being able to because over
there is a new currency language people
culture food every more or less what
states are to us they're being able to
translate and eventually you know
probably translating on the fly such a
powerful powerful tool so would you mind
if we try to go at all I would be
offended if you didn't go for it so I do
have the feature that knows when it's on
ahead or not so I Zidane was holding in
his hands it was off saving battery
power and now that he has it on said
it'll activate and recognize that it's
being used beginning thoughtful picture
so if you want to look straight up and
then down through activate the screen
and then you can go from there ok well
thank you for meeting with us oh of
course my pleasure first impressions of
glass are it's actually pretty cool
didn't expect it to be this kind of cool
so
now the peter has effectively given me
his glass I think it's time to sign off
so thanks everywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
