Authority what's going on everybody and
here is your quick look at the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 and the Galaxy s4 design
wise we have a look into what could be
the future of Samsung's devices while
the galaxy s4 employs the glossy plastic
that people have been getting rather
tired of the note 3 marks a new
beginning in what Samsung is calling
their new design language a textured
plastic is now used in the note 3 and
not only does it very much minimize the
slipperiness of the original glossy
plastic it also solves the problem of
fingerprinting with the screen of five
point seven inches the note 3 is
obviously larger than the 5-inch galaxy
s4 but it manages to stay pretty light
at only about 30 grams heavier the note
3 of course comes with the s-pen nuzzled
in its slot in the lower corner but
otherwise we have the same general
layout all around with the s4 just
smaller and easier to handle in one hand
than the tablet form of the note 3 in
the display department we can pretty
much say that the galaxy s4 s great
Super AMOLED screen has been blown up to
the five-point inch screen of the note 3
it provides the same vibrancy and high
saturation that lends to great colors
and great display experience while the
s4 does have more pixel density at 441
PPI the 338 of the note 3 is still
plenty sharp due to its larger display
Super AMOLED proves to be a great
experience either way here so it's up to
you how large you want your display
experience to be while the galaxy s4
came with the Snapdragon 600 the note 3
is going to have the updated Snapdragon
800 that clocks in at over 2 gigahertz
the note 3 should also come with the
updated Adreno 330 and gets a boost with
3 gigabytes of ram instead of two all of
this helps with multitasking especially
with added s-pen functions all if not
most of the additions that the s4
introduced make it onto the note 3 as
well like air gestures and views but the
s-pen has always been the note trump
card and with the added Air commands
menu the note 3 helps you get to using
your S Pen pretty easily speed seems as
good as ever on the powerful note 3
definitely comparable to the s4 if not
better six hundred milliamps hours more
in the note 3's battery over the 2600
milliamp hour unit in the s4 should keep
you going at least as much as possible
as was what the s4 while we weren't able
to get any shots from the note 3 camera
we can say
it does get a boost to the same 13
megapixels that the s4 has with nearly
every photo feature built-in like drama
and eraser shot it's largely the same
camera either way and should yield
similar results TouchWiz gets an update
to Android 4.3 with the note 3 which
brings with it all of the updated
navigation options that ds4 originally
introduced hand gestures and smart
functions are now available here along
with additions to the s-pen
functionality like pen window small apps
and contextual action memos all are
which easily accessible by an air
command window there is also the my
magazine which is pretty much like a
second home screen when you swipe up
from the bottom and it consolidates the
social media information and news feeds
that you have in a Flipboard like
fashion editions in the note 3 are all
pretty welcome and center around the
s-pen which separates it from the s4 and
so there you have it a look at the two
biggest Samsung smartphone devices we'll
have more for you on the galaxy note 3
soon so stay tuned to android authority
as we have more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
