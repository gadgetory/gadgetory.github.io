authority what's going on everybody and
here is your quick look at the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 and the galaxy s4 design
wise we have a look into what could be
the future of Samsung's devices while
the galaxy s4 employs the glossy plastic
that people have been getting rather
tired of the note 3 marks a new
beginning in what Samsung is calling
their new design language a textured
plastic is now used in the note 3 and
not only does it very much minimize the
slipperiness of the original glossy
plastic it also solves the problem of
finger printing with the screen of 5.7
inches the note 3 is obviously larger
than the 5-inch Galaxy s4 but it manages
to stay pretty light at only about 30
grams heavier the note 3 of course comes
with the s-pen nuzzled in its slot in
the lower corner but otherwise we have
the same general layout all around with
the s4 just smaller and easier to handle
in one hand than the tablet form of the
note 3 in the display department we can
pretty much say that the galaxy s4 s
great Super AMOLED screen has been blown
up to the 5 point inch screen of the
note 3 it provides the same vibrancy and
high saturation that lends to great
colors and great display experience
while the s4 does have more pixel
density at 441 PPI
the 338 of the note 3 is still plenty
sharp due to its larger display Super
AMOLED proves to be a great experience
either way here so it's up to you how
large you want your display experience
to be while the galaxy s4 came with the
Snapdragon 600 the note 3 is going to
have the updated Snapdragon 800 that
clocks in at over 2 gigahertz the note 3
should also come with the updated Adreno
330 and gets a boost with 3 gigabytes of
RAM instead of 2 all of this helps with
multitasking especially with added s-pen
functions all if not most of the
additions that the s4 introduced make it
onto the note 3 as well like air
gestures and views but the s-pen has
always been the note trump card and with
the added air commands menu the note 3
helps you get to using your s-pen pretty
easily speed seems as good as ever on
the powerful note 3 definitely
comparable to the s4 if not better 600
milli amp hours more in the note 3's
battery over the 2600 milliamp hour unit
in the s4 should keep you going at least
as much as possible as was what the s4
while we weren't able to get any shots
from the note 3 camera we can say
it does get a boost to the same 13
megapixels that the s4 has with nearly
every photo feature built-in like drama
and eraser shot it's largely the same
camera either way and should yield
similar results TouchWiz gets an update
to Android 4.3 with the note 3 which
brings with it all of the updated
navigation options that the s4
originally introduced hand gestures and
smart functions are now available here
along with additions to the S Pen
functionality like pen windows small
apps and contextual action memos all are
which easily accessible by an air
command window there is also the my
magazine which is pretty much like a
second home screen when you swipe up
from the bottom and it consolidates the
social media information and news feeds
that you have in a Flipboard like
fashion editions in the note 3 are all
pretty welcomed and center around the
s-pen which separates it from the s4 and
so there you have it a look at the two
biggest Samsung smartphone devices we'll
have more for you on the Galaxy Note 3
soon so stay tuned to android authority
as we have more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
