five is available to pre-order now
launches in just a week and there's no
invite system so if you do manage to
snag one up how do you go about
protecting it
well oneplus has the answer it's not
from Android authority what's going on
everybody and these are the official
cases for the one plus five there's a
total of five cases to choose from in
two different styles the carbon case
comes in either a bumper or a shell
while the Rosewood
evany wood and sandstone are only
available as a shell case being an
official product all the cases offer
cutouts for the various ports including
the new dual camera the headphone jack
the USB C port and the speaker the shell
case has cutouts for the volume and the
power keys while the bumper case covers
them up but does have a marker so you
can easily locate them without looking
the shells themselves are a touch on the
flimsy side but they do provide some
additional grip while the carbon bumper
is thicker than the shell and does seem
to offer more protection against damage
for those with butterfingers with the
bumper case you lose the sequence of the
one plus five design which is arguably
more preserved with the shell the cases
themselves retail for between nineteen
ninety five and twenty four ninety five
in the US and available to purchase now
alongside your one plus five or
independently all the cases are rather
nice but my personal favorite is the
Rosewood case the show itself is nice
and easy to use it's easy to handle and
the finish is really cool and obviously
with being a show it keeps a lot of the
design features of the one plus five and
it's quite sleek to use as well would
you buy an official case or would you
wait for a third party case what do you
think of one class of cases who's your
favorite case maker and why let us know
