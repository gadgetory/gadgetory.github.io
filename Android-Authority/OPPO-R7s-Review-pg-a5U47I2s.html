released this year and really impressing
us the oppo r7s hold up to our
expectations well let's find out
I'm crystal Ora and this is our review
of the oppo r7s TripIt is simply the OU
bar 7s is a mix between the Oppo r7 and
the Oppo r7 plus in terms of design it's
right in the middle when it comes to
size with this 5.5 inch screen and the
capacitive buttons that were found on
the r7 have been removed just like the
r7 Plus which makes sense as it helps
keep the r7 s from being a gigantic
phone other than that you could say the
oppo r7s looks exactly like its last
generation except when you take a look
at this gorgeous new color it comes in
rose gold yes the opal lineup has always
had more mid-range smartphones but when
it comes to mid-range phones the oppo
r7s is one of the most beautifully
designed ones we've seen the r7 s
features a metal unibody design that
looks incredible especially with this
rose gold color it feels very smooth and
it's great to hold especially after not
using it for a while with that aluminum
body feeling cold in your hands for an
Android phone with a 5.5 inch screen we
have pretty familiar dimensions that
also keep this phone from feeling
awkward in your hand it's ever so
slightly thicker than last generations
r7 only by 0.7 millimeters but that
extra thickness goes a long way hitting
a much bigger 3070 milliamp hour battery
inside and still seven millimeters in
thickness is super thin and when you're
holding and looking at this phone all
day it feels and looks expensive it's
incredibly well built and feels very
solid Oppo seems to really care about
the design of their smartphones and even
paid attention to the smallest of
details with the power and volume
buttons they are not as its size which
keeps them from being too high or too
low from where your fingers are located
you can find the headphone jack on top
which is a little more comfortably with
this extra thickness and your micro USB
port and speaker are located on the
bottom the oppo r7s definitely competes
for most beautifully designed phone
compared to other flagships out there
and even has somebody come up to me
while testing the device and ask about
it you're going to have a great viewing
experience here on the OPR 7s with this
5.5 inch full HD AMOLED panel if the
Oppo r7 plus was a bit too big for you
at is 6 inches the r7 s maybe what you
were waiting for it's a great size for
watching videos and playing games making
for a more immersive experience while
we'll being able to slip into a pocket
and forget about it it is an AMOLED
panel which we already think puts it
over the top of most IPS LCD panels the
blacks are going to be much darker than
you would find on an LCD making certain
things appear to pop out of the screen
but comparing to other AMOLED panels
it's not the best this is still a
fantastic screen with nice colors even
if they're a bit toned down and
saturation compared to other AMOLED
displays Oppo said they tried making the
cooler colors warmer to deliver a more
visually pleasing experience to the user
and it really does look great
AMOLED panels aren't known for being the
brightest but this oppo r7s does
outperform most making it easier to see
in outdoors with all phones with white
fronts you will see a black border
surrounding the screen but you'll
quickly get used to ignoring it as it is
much smaller than last versions and of
course we still have gorilla glass
covering the display but you'll find the
newest and tougher fourth-generation
here I really can't find anything wrong
with the display even with the large
screen at 1080 by 1920 making a pixel
density of 401 you shouldn't have any
complaints with this AMOLED panel here
and with oboes color OS skin full of
dark skies and lots of colors it makes
for a very pleasant viewing experience
internally not much has changed besides
an extra gig of ram which is quite
surprising you still have a Snapdragon
615 with an Adreno 405 but yes we now
have 4 gigs of RAM which is interesting
to see matched with the mid-range
processor the oppo r7s comes to 32 gigs
of internal storage but users do have
access to a micro SD card tray up to 128
gigs although that tray also doubles as
a SIM card tray as well so you can
choose to have two SIM cards or one nano
SIM with an SD card I tested the oppo
r7s on AT&amp;amp;T here in New Jersey and had
great reception like usual with access
to 4G networks the majority of the time
now with that Snapdragon 615 the r7s ran
like we expected and then some geek
vents shows to our 7s with a 707 single
core score for combined 3196 multi-core
score that's a decent amount higher than
its predecessor the r7 and even n2 to
give it a superior rating by about 6,000
points in real-world usage the oppo r7s
is a fair job with Oppo continuously
improving software performance the r7 s
handles everyday tasks with a breeze
apps open fast and jumping into chrome
searching for site and scrolling through
it is quite smooth the majority of the
time but sometimes you will see stutters
and animations like when opening up the
recent apps screen
or scrolling through certain parts of
the phone but that's really as far as
performance issues go even gaming runs
very smoothly with barely any frame
drops creating a more than playable
experience overall the phone runs really
well and is also very reliable when it
comes to the battery with just an extra
point seven millimeters in thickness
ople managed to fit a much larger three
thousand seventeen million power battery
into the r7s which is much needed with
the r7 only sporting of two thousand
three hundred and twenty milliamp hour
battery now instead of having a battery
that barely reach the end of the day we
have a battery that should know that
lasted the entire day
even with some heavy usage on what I
consider to be a medium use day I could
stretch the r7s to about five hours of
screen on time
without touching any other battery
saving modes my location set to high
accuracy email set to push and with
brightness set to about 70 percent
that's really good for me now if you're
gonna have a more heavy usage day like
taking a lot of pictures and videos and
even gave me for a while I could still
get about four hours of screen on time
which is very impressive now if you do
kill the battery on the r7s you'll have
some comfort in knowing the oppo r7s is
capable of fast charging which can
charge this battery from dead to 90% in
only 50 minutes or 2 hours of talktime
in just five minutes of charging we were
wondering if Opel would include the
fingerprint scanner found on the plus
model but unfortunately you won't find
it here also NFC still isn't a part of
the o'Barr 7s but there are some extra
features to talk about here there first
being the little notification light that
quickly flashes on the top right and
also the speaker that's located on the
bottom left actually create some nice
sound it's not too muffled and although
it's nowhere near the louder speaker
I've heard on a smart phone it gets
plenty loud enough for watching videos
although try to stay away from the top
two settings as a lot of compression
will start to kick in the oppo r7s is
running a totally redone skin of android
called color OS 2.1 is based on android
5.1 which runs out of the box and really
like many chinese OEMs take on android
it's vastly different from stock I
really do love a stock Android
experience as you probably know by now
but still color OS maybe my favorite
totally rethought out skin of android
everything functions very much the same
as you would be familiar with just with
a different look from the recent apps
screens to even the volume interface
they're entirely redesigned but opal
really paid attention to detail here
with each redesign either having a
purpose or just looking really cool for
example in the settings menu when
sliding from tab to tab
we'll slide off the screen depending on
where your finger is on the screen and
when swiping the lock screen to get into
the home screen these animations all
have a unified feel and look making the
entire color OS feel very well thought
out although yes it's very obviously
inspired by much larger companies with
the X dismissing of the lock screen
notifications the wiggling of icons
being rearranged on the home screen the
entire interface design to the camera
and of course the emojis but they're
really fun and like I said the whole
softer experience evokes a certain
unified enjoyable feeling there are some
questionable decisions however like the
removal of an app drawer the back button
on the right which can not be changed to
the more traditional left placement and
what you would think would be the recent
apps button is actually more of a
universal settings interface that
changes depending on the app you're in
and most of the time you won't even do
anything like an Instagram but it does
act as a recent apps screen however you
will have to hold it and wait for good
two seconds before it opens up which can
kind of slow down your workflow in any
event color OS has tons of extra
features that really we don't have
enough time to address everyone so I'll
name a few and you can head on over to
our website for a more in-depth look we
have an eye protection display setting
that tends to screen to have a harsh
pink you depending on the level you set
it at which apparently helps on your
eyesight blue light in the visible
spectrum can be harmful to your eyes and
a lot of users like to install apps to
make it a little more easy to look at
but on here is built right into the
system there's a one-handed mode that's
always easily accessible by swiping from
a bottom corner to the middle there's
also suggests trees and motions within
settings like the drawing of symbols to
launch apps which you can actually
choose yourself adjusting volume with
two fingers double tapping the home
button to lock the screen and even a
changing lock screen that updates and
displays news and other images color OS
is not only beautiful and unique but
comes jam packed with a lot of funny
useful features the oppo r7s is 13
megapixel camera is more of the same
found on this predecessor with the
splash shot technology it can focus in
as little as point 1 seconds with
optimal lighting and launches very fast
that's pretty much the only thing that's
changed here opel claims the camera app
launch is 30% faster than before and
actually it is quite fast you won't find
any optical image stabilization however
but still you managed to get some really
great photos in outdoor areas sure that
can be said for most cameras these days
but colors actually look really great
without being too saturated
the camera actually picks up quite a lot
of detail too and it exposes quite
nicely the majority of the time but for
a few times it doesn't HDR is there and
can help bring down the brighter areas
or bring out the shadows even with it
looking a little unrealistic there will
be points in time that a little more
contrast wouldn't hurt but with such
little noise in these images you're
going to have a great time looking back
to your photos that you've taken when
you move into lower lighting the shutter
speed does take quite a dive sometimes
taking a full second to snap a photo
this creates less sharp images producing
some slightly blurred images that being
said though low-light photos definitely
aren't bad there's no purple color shift
in the shadows and there is some
processing going on to remove the
majority of the noise creating a more
soft image the front-facing 8 megapixel
camera looks very good with a great
amount of detail too for a selfie cam on
a mid-range smartphone I'm pretty
impressed with the quality here and
low-light you do get lots of noise and
the colors are much less vibrant but
still the image is nice and bright
enough of course
OPO dozen oversight it's camera features
either with tons of options like Beauty
modes filters slow shutters drift modes
and even an audio photo mode which as
little audio clips your pictures which I
actually really like the concept of even
if it's a little silly video looks
decent when shooting in full HD just
make sure you go into settings and set
it to 1080p at 720p is its default you
get very realistic and cool colors
unlike a lot of mid-range smartphones to
have that nasty orange hue over
everything without optical image
stabilization video can be quite shaky
when not held carefully overall it's not
the sharpest 1080p video that you'll
find in a phone but it's definitely not
bad and his focus is quite fast and
never really hunts for focus which is
nice slow-mo is also a feature as well
as time-lapse and even with not much
being upgraded here with our 7ss camera
sensor you still should have a very
pleasant camera experience packed the
fun features that in the end creates
photos with posting and sharing I wasn't
expecting to love the opah R 7s as much
as I did I wouldn't have thought such an
unfamiliar and heavily skinned version
of Android with mid-range hardware would
make for a very enjoyable experience for
me the attention to detail OPO took on
the outside of the r7s and even on the
inside when it comes to software really
is incredible of course the heavy reskin
won't be enjoyed by all and the lack of
NFC a fingerprint scanner
high-end specs will turn some users away
but for 399 dollar premium feeling
device you really do get a lot if you're
in the market for a premium feeling
phone that doesn't break the bank the
oppo r7s is definitely one of the best
well we reached the end of the review
