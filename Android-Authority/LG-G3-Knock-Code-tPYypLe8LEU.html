what's going on everybody and here we
are with the LG g3 this is LG's new
flagship very attractive has the brushed
design on the back even though this is
plastic but it's a very sturdy plastic
I'll tell you that much
but we are just going through with the
LG g3 my coverage is ongoing my full
review is coming soon but I wanted to
revisit a rather because we already
looked at this feature on the G pro 2
the not code now the NOC code is a nice
way of securing your device but it's
also a nice way of getting into it
especially from a standby position as
you can see here I'm just going to put
in the code that I have already and I'll
get right into the operating system it's
very nice and easy to use I'm going to
demonstrate how to set it up here so
we'll just go ahead and jump right in so
lockscreen right here under display and
the NOC code is already displayed so
I'll just input it since I'm looking to
remove it none there we go I will just
jump right back in hit the NOC code and
here we go create a code so you can make
something something simple
maybe three hits but you can also put up
to eight hits so in my case I just do
maybe something like this that's what
I've been using at least and there we go
jump right in and you can create a
backup pin in case you forget the code
for whatever reason so let's just put
something pretty generic and there you
go lock screens change and we are ready
to go so if I was to put the phone into
standby we'll be able to wake the phone
and you have this grid right here this
2x2 grid that will allow you to create
the code and then you should be able to
get into the operating system from there
but what I love about it is the fact
that you can use it from the standby
position just visualize the grid no
matter how large the grid might be you
should be able to get in or how little
it might be but when the grid is smaller
sometimes it's a little bit more
difficult to create the code and
successfully get into the operating
system reliably but the NOC code does
get in the way at least in one
particular instance that I have seen and
that is when you're using the shortcuts
on the back of the
using those buttons holding up to go to
the cue memo or holding down to go to
the camera now obviously when you use
those two particular apps you haven't
actually gotten past the lock screen so
if you want to get anywhere outside of
those you have to input the NOC code but
it gets a little bit annoying and I'm
going to demonstrate that for you right
now now here's a situation that came up
quite often especially when I was doing
the camera shoot either you can see on
the Android authority channel right now
the fact that I used the shortcut on the
back to get straight to the camera in an
easy way by holding the volume down
button plenty of times and there's the
vibration and Here I am in the camera so
if I were to get into the camera right
now I would be taking a bunch of shots
right now let's go in and take one right
now let's just do the laser guide focus
nice and quick and there you go and as
you can see up here it allows me to
preview the photo but when I click on
there I have to put in the NOC code but
what gets annoying is right there
because the orientation is generally in
a portrait mode it goes to there and I
don't have enough time to put in the
code so I have to reorient ate the phone
and finally put in the code just to get
to the photo that I wanted to preview
now I'll demonstrate that one more time
it's just a little bit annoying but it
happened a lot which is the reason why I
got a little bit more than just a bit
annoying so here I am I'm gonna take a
photo I'm gonna try to go a little bit
quicker now see if I can get the code in
there just in time but it changes in the
middle of me doing it it's just one of
the more annoying things that happens I
mean it is nice security tap the NOC
code on there and it does do its job but
that particular instance is a little bit
more annoying than I would like but all
in all the NOC code does its job it just
gets in the way in that particular
instance at least from my experience so
thus far but all in all I do like the
NOC code especially because it's an easy
way to get into the phone without having
to wake the phone first and then put in
your security protocol that does it for
this feature focus on the LG g3 as I
keep unlocking and locking my phone
using the NOC code and you can stay
tuned for all of the best coverage of
the LG g3 including my upcoming review
of the phone which is I'm actually going
to come up pretty soon I have been
enjoying my time with the LG g3 and it
looks like LG has really knocked it out
of the park with this particular phone
that has the 5.5 inch screen the high
resolution at 1440p and also quite a few
features underneath that really enhance
the experience of what is otherwise a
very good core Android experience so
keep it tuned to Android authority drop
