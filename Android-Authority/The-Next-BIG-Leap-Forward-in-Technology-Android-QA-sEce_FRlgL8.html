the internet to someone from many
generations ago um I'm not getting a
signal here but that's exactly what I
had the chance to do and not by using a
time machine but by going to prison for
real you see for five years I worked as
a correctional officer here at kingston
penitentiary which is now a museum and
most of my job was doing this escorting
inmates to the hospital for surgery and
treatment and I once escorted an inmate
who was a lifer he had been in the
institution for many decades and not
only had he never had a chance to touch
the Internet he never got his paws on
one of these I get it so after seeing my
partner watched the hockey game on his
laptop via the hospital Wi-Fi he asked
the inevitable question hey boss what is
the internet and how does it work so I
did my best to explain how computers and
servers connected together on our
original telephone line system to allow
for a near free and open media
communication where one person could
reach known to people for virtually
nothing and the more I talked the more
excited I got and his response huh you
see he had no frame of reference no
matter how much i simplified it it was
very difficult for him to grasp anything
that was not radio waves and broadcast
television in the end he was still
looking for the outlet that we plugged
into to get into internet which is why I
believe that many of us have not really
commented much on the next big leap
forward because we don't have much of a
frame of reference but just imagine for
a moment how much the internet has
dramatically changed the lives of
everyone on the planet directly or at
least indirectly it's mind-boggling so
what is the next big leap forward well
I've talked about in the past and here
are the hints that I gave in the past we
were hard this one was embedded in a
tablet to make it look like an app and
this one was embedded on a webpage to
make it look like an ad now of course
the biggest hint by far was last week
when I
talked about how the next big leap
forward would mean doing away with our
beloved phones all together you see when
the internet emerged more than 20 years
ago it was a miraculous thing you can
now connect to anyone anywhere anytime
for almost nothing but it was restricted
or bottlenecked through a desktop
computer but now we have mobile phones
and that same access is now in our
pocket but what if we could just do away
with all these devices and the internet
was everywhere on everything and that's
where we come to the next big leap
forward being the Internet of Things
when everything has its own IP address
everything can be tracked and
communicate with everything else sending
data to and fro we will then have oceans
of data infinitely more than we have now
and then we'll be able to build what
some call the DI KW pyramid you see at
the bottom of this pyramid you have
unprecedented data that must be
processed through to information than to
knowledge and ultimately to wisdom now
allow me to walk you through a day in
the life of the Internet of Things when
you wake up in the morning your home
automation will have already noticed the
drop in temperature and therefore raise
the heat up in your house and as you
rise out of bed in the morning coffee
will be less likely out of milk because
your refrigerator would have already
known that and ordered milk via your
amazon prime account you won't be caught
texting and driving either because oh
yeah your messages now shown safely on
your window shields HUD display and no
need to rush to me the ferry because
you've already been notified the ferry
will be five minutes late everything
from tracking our water main system to
prevent blockages to even tracking our
garbage and supply chains to better
reduce waste we are now growing a world
central nervous system that we can take
advantage of now Google is very bullish
on the Internet of Things but what does
that mean for our beloved android
android is now at the forefront of the
Internet of Things not just with Android
wear and Android auto and with nest but
Android runs a Linux kernel which is
better suited for this world of the
Internet of Things and has already
become a favorite among embedded
system developers who often build on
arm-based rather than intel chips now
for those of you who need further
convincing google was very explicit at
Google i/o about what role they want to
play in the internet of things we see a
world of sensors sensors can be small
and powerful and gather a lot of
information that can be useful to our
users we want to build the right AP is
for this world of sensors so let's talk
about the winners of this contest in at
the beginning I try to make it clear
that I was looking for people who
understand what kind of impact this
one's going to have in our lives so
here's two people I thought began to
grasp the impact of what this means the
runner up with a t-shirt is ESRI odd who
is one of the first people to give an
intelligent answer but the winner of the
fifty-dollar google play gift card has
got to beef is 135 who demonstrated an
understanding that the secret to the
next big leap forward is to free
ourselves from our devices all together
thanks for watching android army my name
is Jace love to connect with you here on
Google+ or Twitter please let me know in
the comments if you think I'm completely
full of it I would love to hear an
intelligent response if you think I'm
wrong explain why what else could be the
next big leap forward or is this not
something in the next five to 10 years
this is 30 years away could I be way off
let me know what you think I will be
reading those comments don't forget
about my brother's nandroid jaws
gentleman test ninja Kevin Lana and
Chris are working really hard to deliver
the best android content on the web see
you next week on a dry day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
