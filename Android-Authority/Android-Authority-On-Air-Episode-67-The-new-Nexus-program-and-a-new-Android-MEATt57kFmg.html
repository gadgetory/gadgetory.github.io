original android hangout show on google+
I'm dare across London Charlton and I'm
Johnathan Franklin this week we have all
sorts of fun stuff to talk about mainly
how why app rollouts suck and over the
past few weeks you if I experience that
we're also going to talk about a google
glass update we're going to talk about
the samsung galaxy s4 active which was
officially announced this past week and
then we're gonna have a little bit of
State of the Union discussion we're
going to talk about the new Nexus
program the Nexus user experience
program and how a keyboard being
released to the google play store is
much more significant than an actual
keyboard it's how Android is evolving
and how Android is changing all right so
so let's get started so I said app
rollout suck and you know it's an
awesome feature but we'll get to that in
a minute but ever since I Oh google has
been touting one of the latest and
greatest features of the Play Store and
that is to do a pro louts so if you've r
you know I got in the music update
calendar hangouts gmail yada yada yada
you've seen all your friends on you know
social networks posting hey I got the
new gmail you go and you check and oh I
don't have it yet now you check for
hours later oh I don't have it yet the
next day damn it I still don't have the
update where is my update you know you
know it's available all your cool all
your friends have it you're not the cool
kid with the update and you want it
makes you want it more it makes you mad
your friends get the new hangout the new
count a new music new gmail and you
don't have it where the hell is my
update so yeah they're bad they make you
wait but uh but they do have some good
to them Dan the so yr appt rollouts good
well they really do have some benefits
for developers people who are hosting
these apps on their own servers not
Google's servers can't necessarily take
the kind of pressure that you know tons
and tons of people trying to download it
all at once for you know an update or a
new app launch so it gives them the
ability to stage that and stagger the
load on their servers but when your
google load on your servers really ought
not be an issue and if that's really the
reason why they're using these staged
rollouts that's kind of embarrassing
because they ought to have better
service than that so let's say let's say
Dan so so Twitter for example which they
should have better service tube that's
the first app that came to mind say at a
recent update so let's say I don't think
they did staged updates but let's say so
Twitter's servers don't get hammered
with everyone saying well I want to see
what's new in going and downloading it
and testing out the new features yeah I
would understand why a smaller company
maybe Twitter wasn't the best example no
but for independent developers it's
definitely a benefit even for for you
know mid-level developing companies for
like just app companies you know like
one louder apps for example although I
think they're a bad example because they
have some authored larger parent company
but groups that are just add companies
not platforms like Twitter but you know
they they don't have that kind of
massive infrastructure for servers
because they don't need massive server
farms usually but they can't necessarily
handle that kind of load so it gives
them a way to you know offload it in
stage it over time but even wouldn't
that it gives you a way to put out your
app have people try it downloaded use it
and maybe come back and say hey there's
some glitch something you missed because
let's be realistic especially for
smaller developers it's easy to miss
thinks it's easy to overlook something
if you are going through some rigorous
quality control process and if you are
it's easy to miss a typo or some of your
bug on some weird device and so it gives
you the ability to call it back stop the
rollout fix whatever the problem is and
then redo it without having tons of
users experiencing whatever that problem
is you only have a very small population
does it vary developer friendly yeah
it's definitely good for developers it's
not really good for a huge company
is that ought to be able to take that
kind of pressure in those kind of fast
rollouts I think maybe maybe Google is
demonstrating disability showing
developers that hey look you can do it
and this is how it works cut dogfooding
you know to eat your dog food % sure you
comment John did you have a comment it
just if you release something like that
you know in terms of not just getting it
to the users but affecting your overall
reviews on the Play Store cuz you know
most the reviews on this update broke my
whatever fix it you know I mean you're
talking about because developers really
look at their average on the reviews and
wonder where they're at so that's one
big thing is that anything that's
believe that's the reason the beta
program doesn't affect you know
reviewers can't post on beta just
because of the same reasoning so okay
and and speaking of app data programs
let's talk about that that's a new
feature that once again launched at i/o
and over the past week or two has been
becoming more popular more and more app
developers are starting to take
advantage of beta app bait as the beta
program some of these are dashclock
widget Joe which I i love that I'm sure
a lot of you love it if you're on
Android 4.2 AOKP backup has a beta
community Falcon pro the very popular
Twitter client has a beta community
slide-out messaging as it and they're
really popular nova launcher has a beta
community i'm sure there's others these
are just ones that i found once i'm a
member of and the you know what if you
found another beta community for another
popular app go ahead and drop it in the
comments and let us know and we'll add
it to our list alright so so why are
these beta communities significant well
as jon was it was saying it allows
developers to test new features of an
app to get some feedback on it how does
it work does it work on XYZ device do
you like this new feature what do you
want to see but but also it really is is
actually really significant it actually
pushes google
Plus even more you see if you're going
to use the beta program as a developer
whenever you upload your new app and you
say you want to enter into this beta
program you have to select a Google+
community meaning that you have to have
it's a requirement to have a Google+
community for your app so that's making
developers use Google+ and it's making
appt fans you know us the consumers use
Google Plus and it's not making be an
active user because the developer is
going to say hey guys here's my
community and then all the all the
people that are a member of the beta
program are going to go to the community
and they're going to talk about things
they like things they don't like things
they want to see their say hey good job
thanks you know and they're going to
actively engage one other so baited the
beta program is great for us as Android
users but it's also great for Google+ as
a platform to keep pushing google+ and
so forth yeah I mean it's it's not just
so much the dog food in Google+ which
I'm sure is a a goal of Google's in that
front but it's also a value added for
developers right like they're giving
developers a free place hope free hosted
place to channel all their comments all
their questions all of their development
all of their forming all of their
everything into this free community that
we're going to host for you no charge
here you go right if app developers and
ROM developers start taking advantage of
that same sort of platform that's going
to the end of some major Android
communities like XDA and roots wiki and
even the android central forms right if
google pushes this hard enough and right
into the right people they could really
take over the android 40 market too
mm-hmm I could see that happening I in
some regard I know like paranoid android
you know there are official forums you
know it's just pretty much the Google+
community cyanogenmod has a massive
Google+ community now they also have
their for their forms still AOKP has you
know mass
of you know forum you know here so I
yeah I could see it happening a little
bit but but back to betas yeah it's a
very neat it requires Google+ use of
google plus and and i like it so once
again if you found any other ones
besides the ones I mentioned dashclock
widget AOKP backup Falcon pro slide-out
messaging nova launcher go ahead and let
us know in the comments and we'll go
ahead and check them out cuz u bettas
are fun I like Vegas definitely
everybody low status but how about some
devices that man watched actual okay so
let's talk about the the galaxy s4
active so it was it officially announced
this week and it came with an ip67
rating so what exactly does ip67 mean
well it's actually two ratings to two
numbers the six means it has complete
dust resistance so that means dust isn't
going to get inside it yeah that's good
all phones should be resistant to dust
you know you you would want that I would
assume the the seven is something more
than you know the average phone has the
seven mean it protects from between 15
centimeters and 11 meter for 30 minutes
in water so that means your device can
be up to a meter in water for up to 30
minutes and you can take it out and use
and it'll be fine so it's not you know
waterproof it's water-resistant so dust
resistant and water resist and that's
what 67 means so a lot of people are
calling it a a rugged device yeah I mean
if they called galaxy s4 active because
that's you know what it is it's a it's
not a rugged device a rugged device you
know would be a device that you dropped
and it didn't go splat you know a rugged
device would have a harder shell it
would have maybe some something more to
protect the screen it already comes a
gorilla glass 3 may we have some type of
screen protector or I don't know either
way it should be more robust than than
just dust than water than plastic yeah
um so besides the ip67 ray
what's different what actually looks a
little different um and some of the
specs are slightly different it's a
little heavier and a little thicker
maybe a four because the water
resistance has become the guy that's
padding in there to protect everything
yeah mate dust resistance yeah so it
also has an 8 megapixel camera the
standard the regular galaxy s4 has a 13
megapixel camera and the neat thing
about the camera is it it just it's
rated to take photos underwater so
that's maybe that's why it's an 8 mega
mega pixel camera arm the screens
actually different technology to the
regular version uses the Super AMOLED
screen that we've all come to know and
love from Samsung devices and the
regular I'm sorry the active version
uses a TFT LCD and some of people
speculate you know why they use a
different screen well you know an LCD is
better in direct sunlight and since it
is an active phone it's an outdoorsy
failure to be using it in more outdoors
I don't know that's why I'm thinking Dan
John any other reason why they may have
changed the screen I can't think of any
other good reason why they would not go
with there anyhow technology maybe money
I mean LCD screens are cheaper for them
to produce you know they do have their
own LCD division 2 so that's true yeah
it is a little cheaper to build the sld
lcds and it is the there a moment but
yeah it's probably mostly the light
though because annelids traditionally
don't do particularly well and drank
some light on the other hand they're
typically a lot more battery efficient
than call CDs so let's talk about you
know active devices rugged devices more
resistant devices real quick so galaxy
s4 came out but roughly two months ago
or so depending on your carrier month
ago you know pick up smokes here verizon
yeah so uh you bought your device you
love it you realize huh I want to like
my phone to be waterproof or water
resistant and dust resistant uh here
comes the active version in your pasture
15-day or 30
day return period you know you're kind
of screwed you have to buy a new device
so why are manufacturers putting out
devices with this rating from the get-go
or at least releasing the two of two
gekka the same at the get-go some of
them are the Sony Xperia Z has an ip67
rating and it's they didn't have to
release a rugged version or an active
version it's that version so some
manufacturers do do this some don't well
one thing to know with the Z is that
it's not really ruggedized either on the
outside and it's a glass outside but one
of the biggest usage cases of what they
say from people in Japan or they use
their phones so much that especially
women wanted to actually take their
phone in the shower with them which was
one of the motivating factors between
making a phone that you know was more
waterproof not just the rugged side but
you know making sure that it was
waterproof or water resistant was
because of so many people in Asia you
know with that usage case that they
wanted a the phones in the shower with
them so so so John so that's so so the
advertisement that Deutsche Telekom did
t-mobile did in Romania was that they
had they had a woman in a shower in a
mall talking on her phone and playing
with her phone so it wasn't just a sex
sells thing was an actual legitimate
people actually want to use their phone
in the shower he really dismal actually
used its case scenario at the mall yeah
definition or is it the mall well
everything you know it may look
apparently apparently you do that
alright so uh another device here um
glass yeah I still haven't gotten my
purchase link yet and that's a sad face
still crying about and I'm still crying
about we won't talk about anymore
fingers cross confidence high for next
week so if you are rocking glass right
now you if you're not it's actually good
it's a neat update uh XE which stands
for Explorer edition xe6 over-the-air
update came out this past week and it's
a major camera software update um it
whenever you take a picture with the new
camera software it takes three photos
sequentially
similar to how HDR works you know takes
one with low exposure average medium
exposure nor and then high high exposure
so similar to HDR and that's actually
what it is it alleviates the
overexposure when there's a lot of light
or the under exposure you know when
there isn't a lot of light and you know
google says you know it allows you to
not be afraid of the dark because
apparently with with glass previously on
the xe5 software revision if you took a
picture it was kind of dark you know
it's very very hard to see the person or
the object you took a picture of but and
similarly if you were outside and it was
a sunny day and you took a picture of a
scenic mountain or something he had some
sunlight in there it was very
overexposed up for the Sun was you know
it just wasn't wasn't as good as it
could be so they fixed this and you
should check out some of the photos that
they're gorgeous I mean they're in high
and low light they look normal and and
where the light is great we're light is
very good you actually get an HDR effect
and so it's pretty awesome um besides
better pictures the ex Aoife or xe6
update gave voice dictation to your
photos and your videos for captioning so
you take a picture you want to say hey
this is a picture of my buddy Dan
Charlton I don't have to type that in
later I can go ahead and voice dictate
my caption before I upload it and share
it so that's cool so besides glass I
think we had some Samsung tabs thanks to
computex over in Asia right John just uh
then else from this week and if you want
some good news um if you have a note
10.1 or a galaxy tab 2 you're not going
to be jealous at all some of these
tablets coming out because it's almost
exactly the same as the last one and the
one before that they'll launch both of
them is 8.1 a 10.1 both of them will be
launching with android 4.2 the answers
slightly eight-inch is going to have a
1.5 gigahertz it's an unknown they
didn't announce what type of dual core
we're assuming an arm dual core with a
gig and a half around the 10-inch is
going to be a 1.6 gigahertz dual-core
with hyper-threading Intel um it's an
atom z2560 clover trail and it has 1
gigabyte of RAM um they may give me the
8 inch is going to get a 5 megapixel
camera with no flash and 1.3 front 10
inches going to get a 3 megapixel camera
also with no flash and a 1.3 front
camera Intel is going to be supplying
the 3g and 4g radios for this as the xmm
6262 for gsm so if you're on t-mobile
you might have a chance to do this and
that's for hspa+ 21 only and the LTE
radio was straight up l 2 years and I'm
gonna have any cdma support whatsoever
I'll a tantalizing there spreads yeah no
verizon or sprint no Orihime
international carriers such as in Europe
ahead stadium cdma 8 inch 1280 x 800 TFT
LCD display which is 189 pixels per inch
so maybe you know about on par with the
nexus 7 in pixel density almost a
10-inch also has a 1280 x 800 TFT LCD
display which is the exact same as the
last galaxy tab and the one before that
and it comes in at 149 pixels per inch
but if you really want a reference
Samsung makes the displays for both of
the ipad 3 m 4 and the nexus 10 in which
the nexus 10 is still the highest
resolution tablet display at 2560 by
1600 so it effectively has double the
pixel density at 300 pixels per inch and
samsung makes this display so I mean to
me it just seems like Samsung doesn't
take their tablet seriously at all
because they produce better components
for you know their partnership with
Google but also for app and it's almost
like they throw it I mean to me it just
seems like a disappointment because
they're putting out so much effort in
phones and they're puttin nothin in
tablets and in a lot of ways Android
tablets even though they have the market
share feels almost like Android was when
it was on gingerbread where the market
share was there but it just wasn't quite
there yet yeah Who am is just more
putting the effort into it that's kind
of what the Android tablet market kind
of feels like to me right now because
the OEM is just aren't getting behind it
on the other hand you can get a nexus 7
yeah you can get an exorcism but you
know it's just sad to see the OEMs put
so little effort into trying to come up
with something groundbreaking on the
family front no I agree i think asus is
probably one of the better tablet
manufacturers right now if not the best
no um be a speaking a samsung they've
been having some issues with their xedos
processors lately there's rumors coming
out of various sources that they're
having some pretty significant supply
issues getting the x and o's chips
together which is probably why the s4
active in addition to being different in
a couple of other way or excuse me have
the s4 active the s4 mini is coming with
a Snapdragon 400 the note 3 is rumored
to have a Snapdragon 800 the galaxy tab
10.1 has an Intel processor none of
these are Samsung processors and they
make processors so there's a lot of
indications that things are not looking
good for the echoes platforms they're
facing supply problems they're facing
yield problems as well they've been
struggling to make 28-nanometer chips at
least to make them as efficiently as
they're like 32 nanometer chips and
there's also a lot of indications that
they get some hardware problems with the
Exynos 5 octa with the a core chip in
the International s4 in about thirty
percent of the s4's sold around the
world so it's not very popular chip even
from Samsung but this is really not good
for samsung in terms of their processor
developments these last year's chip the
sexiness for quad was not particularly
impressive in terms of innovation I'm
going to expect well and perform very
well the Exynos 5 octa still performs
very well I'm certainly not trying to
default some Samsung their their
performance Jews they definitely do
perform well the acta is not nearly as
power efficient as arm's big.little
architecture is supposed to be and I
mean that's this is a hardware problem
in the chip it's not something that they
can solve with just a new kernel this is
something where the hardware is
physically not working the only way to
fix it is to manufacture the chips which
obviously they can't do four units
they're already producing and selling
but they don't have enough time to
retool their entire production line in
order to meet the deadlines for the note
3 or the galaxy tab 10.1 or any of their
other upcoming devices so this is a big
problem and if it's mean Samsung
licenses their architecture from arm and
so there's a lot of indication that some
of these problems might be in the
underlying architecture and not just
with Samsung so this pose is a pretty
big ongoing problem for samsung where
Qualcomm is just eating up the
marketplace right now and they've got
nothing to compete with them right now
meanwhile Qualcomm does not license
their architecture from arm they design
their own and so they continue to
iterate on the crate architecture make
it better refine it improve it and they
can do so more or less at will whereas
Samsung is very hamstrung by what harm
does and on the timetable that arm
doesn't so one thing that Apple boughs
to exist levels own profit yep Apple has
with the a6 processor moved in the same
space Qualcomm this and they're
designing their own and not relying on
samsung to build them samsung still
building them they just start designing
them anymore so yeah it definitely gives
the designers a lot more flexibility in
terms of moving more rapidly than arms
architectural designs but even still
Samsung could do a lot to innovate
within the architectural constraints and
video with their 4+1 setup is you know
it
legitimately trying new things not just
taking arms designs printing them and
then selling so there's nothing room for
them to get better it's just question
whether or not they can get it together
and do it hmm all right we have a
question here from find it here we have
a question from Jabari Whitfield he says
why do you think or what do you guys
think about glass being banned in public
places personally he thinks it's silly
and how will these bands you know be
effect in the future only move forward
well I think it's silly to because you
know let's use let's use casinos as an
example because it's a public place per
se glass is banned in casinos or will be
banned casinos well you know what
cameras are also banned in casinos not
allow that you're not allowed to take
pictures in casinos go to a casino and
whip out your camera phone and start
taking pictures you're going to get in
trouble you're not allowed to do that
the same you know same goes for not see
what strip clubs made headlines you know
what you can't go to a strip club I've
heard in take pictures you know I these
are things you can't do with regular
camera phones and regular cameras and in
last comment I'll make is you know ten
years ago 12 years ago whenever camera
phones were starting to pop up
everywhere many places around the world
banned them public places banned them
municipalities tried to ban them courts
banned them they were abandoned you know
everywhere even the city of Chicago
tried to ban them yeah an entire city
many Chicago wasn't alone many places
tried to ban camera phones and to this
day some places still do have camera
phones band some places some places of
work where you show up and they have a
bin or a little Locker and say hand it
over so it's going to happen with glass
because not because it's glass not
because it's a head-mounted camera
because some places do not
allow cameras and I mean it's just how
it is yeah yeah another one is um right
now that's a big usage case of glass
because the category realize that hasn't
been defined yet you know it's good for
navigation it's good for but the biggest
cases people using glass to take
pictures and videos of their kids and
stuff like that so until the third party
ecosystem kind of catches up with glass
and they did find what the category is
going to do that's gonna be the big
focus of glass right now is that you
know the camera is probably the most
obviously used or about it so what in
case you didn't know at it and it'd be
Google was it the shareholder meeting is
that what it was that happened glass was
banned and that made headlines Google
bands glass from their own chair holder
meeting well camera phones are fucking
camera phones cameras they were banned
to you know media stop you're you're
trying to you know your bait and switch
you're trying to link bait you're trying
to draw clicks you're trying to say
things that aren't really what they are
you know glass was bamb you know cameras
were also banned to it was anything that
had a camera attached to it was banned
they didn't just say nope no glass we
don't trust her own product no they said
anything that has a camera it can't be
here so it's not just glass sup you know
people I really think sometimes people
just fish for things you know just
because why not they like controversy
and you know it draws attention to your
site once moving on to things that don't
make me upset um okay so let's talk
about the state of the union let's talk
about state of androids in excess
program so the past couple weeks have
been have been interesting we've had
Nexus user experience devices officially
announced and then speculated to be
announced first we had the samsung
galaxy s4 which will be available
play store here in a few weeks on the
twenty-sixth for 600 bucks and it'll be
stock Android similarly the HTC One will
be available in the Play Store for a
little bit cheaper five hundred fifty
dollars it'll come with with stocks yeah
it's 556 and 650 what if I say 600 yeah
yeah so I i had the fifty dollars right
below yeah okay so yeah so Derek was
wrong it was it's 650 for the sgs4 and
the one is just 600 my back so now
there's reports it son confirmed at this
time but now there's reports coming out
that there will be a sony xperia z nexus
experience edition which is great
because that will be a third Nexus
edition and the XP is the only one of
those three that has a company supported
AOSP project so yeah Sony's very
developer friendly they actually have a
whole entire program you know they've
uploaded source code to github where you
can actually download in run AOSP on
your current xperia z and you know they
have it they've had it for other so many
devices in the past so it makes sense
for sony to do this for all intensive
purposes the fact that they do that
makes the current Xperia Z a nexus
experience device this is just a matter
of slapping some branding on it doing
exactly what they're already doing and
letting Google sell some more well
that's probably just turned around and
did it really quick exactly like I had
the resources reduce experience thing
where you just have to build AOSP for
your device and release it oh wait you
mean this thing we're already doing
swimming but also but also Danny it's
for people that don't know how to do it
or don't want to do it I'll exactly I
get the why the consumers want that but
for sony it's a no-brainer they're
already doing because Sony's able is
able to do this and chant and it sounds
like it can actually you know it's
something that we said you know they're
already doing so chances are this this
rumor is most likely going to happen and
so that makes three your Nexus
experience devices and then we have
a fourth Nexus experience device because
it's the real Nexus device the Nexus
force that makes four now we have a
fifth device that has been officially
announced in recent times the Moto X
well it hasn't been called a nexus
experience device yet it hasn't you know
received that branding or that you know
marketing term but we do know for a fact
that it's that Motorola had said that
they are going to only put out phones
running stock Android so for all
intensive purposes motorola said they
were going to do it it's a nexus
experience device whether they're going
to officially brand that way or not we
don't know yet we also don't know if
it's going to be available on the Play
Store I highly doubt every carrier
version will be available in the Play
Store but that doesn't mean they're
going to put a version on the Play Store
that will work on AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile such
as the other devices that are going to
get slapped up there so there is a
definite possibility that we're going to
have five Nexus devices Nexus experience
devices stock Android devices on the
Play Store and if this sounds familiar
remember remember last summer when
there's all sorts of rumors about five
devices being launched with you know
five phones we're gonna have an X period
exes galaxy s Nexus and you know a razor
Nexus and all this other stuff and and
then the rumors were eventually debunked
but it's kind of funny that you
fast-forward less than a year later and
this is actually happening you know
we're actually going to have five Nexus
devices or five Nexus experience devices
it's and from there all from the major
manufacturers and they're all going to
be built except for LG but they're all
going to be built using devices art
exists building that manufacturers style
you know each device is styled to their
own manufacturer and that's really what
a lot of android fans Chancellor if
you're watching her listen to this
that's what you've wanted you know for
years you've wanted a
vice of your choice that you like and
you've wanted stock Android you know
they mean that people wanted that
forever android and futures have one
that forever so android is is really
changing and and and what I want to know
before we move on is so out of these
five devices you know we have the nexus
for the official nexus by LG then we
have the galaxy s4 nexus which I don't
want to call it that but for argument's
sake we will and the HTC One Nexus and
the Sony Xperia Z in a nexus and then
the Moto X which is basically a nexus so
out of all these Nexus experience
devices which ones would you guys choose
let me know in the comments which ones
if they were all available right now on
your carrier you know which one would
you choose and why you guys will let me
know Dan and John same question dan go
first which if you had a choice of those
five which one would you choose and why
assuming somebody else is paying for
them I would definitely choose the HTC
one I think it's an extremely well-made
device it's definitely top of the line
and I mean at this point we're we're not
even worried about the software on
devices it's just about device how it
does it feel in your hand how does it
look how much do you like the physical
aspects of advice and I've looked at all
three of these devices in held in my
hand and I definitely am most impressed
for the HTC I have a nexus 4 it's not
that I don't like it it's just that HTC
is nicer okay John how about you which
witch device would you rock if you your
money wasn't an option it was on your
carrier I would I would definitely be
curious to see what Motorola has to
bring to the table this year but I've
always liked motorola i can i have a
soft spot form but it just really
depends on the hardware they can get
into the device but if it was down to
the you know the z or the one or the s
florida i'd have to lean to the 12
because the z is a really nice phone the
display is kind of not quite as good as
the other two nigh feel like they're a
little bit behind on hardware and i just
prefer the one over this board
personally okay well i would say
motorola or HTC in a even tie
i will say that it's tough to pick the
Moto X because we don't know the specs
and we don't know anything about it
really but i'm very hopeful on a few you
know a few tidbits of information we do
know and just because in motorola we
know they make quality devices and I
don't know I think Google's first you
know major initiative to Motorola is
gonna I would assume it wouldn't be junk
so I'm going to say the motorola axe the
Moto X however since that device is not
available right now and we don't really
know much about it I would say the
Xperia Z Nexus experience because I got
to play the device at CES and it's a
gorgeous device no it's thin it's well
built it feels really solid shorts a
little older hardware at this point but
it's still in beautiful device um and
you know I can get dusty you know I can
hold it underwater for up to 30 minutes
take a shower with it and talked about
earlier um I think it's a gorgeous
device i would i would pick the xperia z
if the Moto X didn't excite me so I have
a more bad choice at home and you can't
go wrong with any of them no Tesco so
here's an interesting thought I had the
other day so now we have these five you
know Nexus devices and you know we know
that you know Google a lot of times is
criticized for various things with
Android you know how they can't keep you
know a device up-to-date fragmentation
yadda yadda yadda a lot of people
thought you know motorola was going to
be the savior google is going to be in
control all this crazy stuff right so
let's say that some of these people were
right and that's part of the reason why
motorola was acquired we know that
that's not entirely the whole reason but
anyways do you guys think that the whole
reason we're seeing multiple devices
running a nexus experience and neck nina
this new nexus experience program do you
think google started it just so they
could sell their own motorola x their
own motorola phones through the play
store because that would be favoritism
right if they
only sold their own device so do you
think that they they're doing this just
so they can sell their own or you think
is something that's been planned for a
while or no I don't think that's kind of
computer selling devices through the
Play Store I don't think that's a big
enough sales channel for them to be that
concerned about it motorola knows how to
sell devices they sell them through
verizon they saw them through carriers
they do very well at it well not very
well at it but they do well enough at it
right they know a lot more of us telling
advises that Google does obviously as
you know anybody's watched any other
Google Play Store release of late it's
been a disaster so I really don't think
that their concern is that much about we
need to get it into Google Play I think
if you look back at last fall when we
were hearing all these rumors about all
of these Nexus devices from multiple
manufacturers I think that this move
from google has been in the works for a
while and it's been a matter getting the
right devices getting manufacturers on
or getting the ducks in a row and called
you know heís dotted and t's crossed
etc and the licensing blah blah blah
blah blah working with all the companies
so I think this is something that I
pushing for for a while where the Nexus
program can more or less become a
licensing program you meet these terms
you build an AOSP your own version of
Android for your device you release the
source code publicly you put it out
we're happy to sell it for you through
the Play Store or you know you can sell
it yourself or don't even bother selling
device just put out the AOSP software
and we'll call it a nexus experience
eligible to blaze so I think if carrier
earth OEMs are willing to meet those
terms then we're gonna start seeing a
lot more of these I think it's a play to
get podiums back into the kind of get
the community back because of community
in the last couple years is kind of
stagnated on development because they've
had to work around so many things the
HTC and Samsung and Doug have really
tied into their own software's that and
something that should be done on a
kernel level or you know more of a you
know less tied into their own
independent on their software stack so
if you really kind of get the community
back excited about Android again then as
far as their in on Google's and it can
get people contributing the stuff that
actually matters not stuff like trying
to get GPS and Bluetooth going on a
device because you have nothing to go
off of you know for months in fighting
stuff like that when they can be
contributing to something useful and you
know it's kind of slowed down the AOSP
side of Android because you know aside
from the Nexus devices which really
aren't big sellers it gives some kind of
incentive for the OEMs to give you a
reference point so I think that's gonna
be it it's not so much what how many
sales they can get but if the homes do
decide even if it's just to sell a small
handful of devices it's going to
absolutely supercharge the communities
because they can start customizing and
doing things that matter and really
everything that has been merged in
Android over the last couple years you
know in the ice cream sandwich and stuff
for stuff that kind of was in custom
roms before that Google merged into
Android later and made it better yeah
okay all right so we actually had a
question from actually the same guys
before ajab Rory Whitfield he asked
about Google Wallet NFC you know we've
covered that before and it's a it's a
downhill argument so we're gonna ignore
that right now what we are going to do
is we're going to talk about also yeah
he asked what do you think about google
moving core android apps the Play Store
newest be the keyboard will this allow
Google to take some control back from
and then like a cut off i'm suing
control back from carriers control back
from from OEMs and and and so forth so
that actually is the next part of the
state of the union talk so leading into
that thank you for that question so
hopefully this answers your question for
you so a keyboard was recently released
the google keyboard and it's a keyboard
not too exciting right i mean not of us
already have it anyways either a Nexus
device or on
you know custom rom or it's a keyboard
so why is the p board so significant
well it shows that another core android
app another app that only was available
you know on a Nexus device device or
through AOSP is now available to anybody
and everybody through the Play Store and
this has been happening for a while now
that's been happening for you know years
you know initially gmail only was
available on Android and you couldn't go
i mean that's really not the right way
to say that i guess it was only
available on the on a google license
device and you know you couldn't go out
there and download it on the Play Store
unless you've added installed it's still
only available on a Google licensed
device because it's only available on
the Google Play Store which is only on a
Google licensed device the point is that
you can now download it and get updates
from for it through the Play Store it
used to be that you could only get your
update to gmail when the new version of
Android world out to your device in you
know 6 8 12 18 25 runs yeah exactly so
you had to wait for a new brand new
version so maps used to be the same way
maps used to be bundled you know with
android voicesearch google talk now
known as hangouts YouTube sound the
search in in calendar so all of these
apps used to be bundled with Android
where you would have to wait as Dan was
saying until your carrier or your OEM
put out a new version for you to get the
new version and you know Google let's
say they're putting out new operating
systems you know once a year twice a
year so that's only once or twice a year
for that app to get updated and you know
as well as I do these apps now get
updated more than then once or twice a
year so that's really really awesome
that they're breaking these core apps
out of Android allowing them to get
updated more often but more importantly
updated without carriers
and without oems say there you know and
we saw evidence of this at the plyo as
well how Google demonstrated that you
know they can take control of Android
without you you know without carriers
and muddying the waters or OEMs you know
that that it's still there are OS and
that's what I demonstrated will get that
in a second so there's still a handful
of apps that aren't available on the
Play Store that come you know baked into
Android that you have to wait for an
update or some of them actually aren't
even available on all devices there you
know Google you know proprietary such as
face on lock or at the mail client where
you can do activesync to connect an
exchange server that's Google license
it's google proprietary that's whether
that's why every different OEM has their
own implementation of it so i don't know
if due to licensing i don't know if that
those will ever get added most like not
but people you know the contacts app
people could get added to me right now
every seems like every om has their own
version of contacts you know it's not
just simple people I hate HTC's all the
web so absolute is worse yes am so is
worse so and also the stock camera stock
gallery app the stock messaging act app
the stock dialer there's a lot of stock
clock there's a lot of apps that still
could get the Play Store treatment to
where they can get updated as often as
need be without having to wait a year
for a new version of Android or never
getting a new version of Android even
worse so how good you want to say
something John didn't have a comment on
man okay yeah I mean Google's really
doing one of the things that I've been
saying cyanogenmod should be doing where
cyanogenmod hasn't been able to release
versions of their operating system very
quickly or at least not as quickly as
they used to be able to because they're
bringing so much time and effort and all
of the customized apps
doing what Google is doing is abstract
in the app development away from the
platform development the two ought not
depend on each other and so they're
separating them from each other in
development and in delivery and in every
way really that there is and that's
really the way that it ought to be
managed each of these applications
should be an independent project at silo
it doesn't necessarily depend on all of
these other pieces just in order to get
an update I mean this is why Santa John
much but least candidate for 10.1 came
what eight months after or point2 yeah
so so google is taking more control of
Android by breaking out the apps that we
know and love and updating them
separately and that's a good thing so
that's that's a very different version
of Android inning what existed you know
two years ago even a year ago in the
past year we've had you know talked with
that calendar we've had keyboard sound
search you know those have all been
added just from the past year for that
you know a while ago was music and gmail
and maps in YouTube anyway so moving on
one thing worth noting because a lot of
people ask why are my updates so slow
why you know why did the carriers have
to have so much of a involvement and why
does Apple do so good just clarifying
what Apple does is they get their
software ready and get the carrier
approval invisibly to the user as in
they get this stuff done at a time but
if it's never going to be solved by an
oem adopting stock Android ever because
the verizon galaxy nexus an original
droid can prove that to you as well as
the Sprint Galaxy Nexus but if don't the
real answer to that question is if you
want that from an OEM is the topic of
support is what Apple you know when it
when you call a carrier for service for
your iPhone or whatever then they're
going to direct you to Apple because
that was part of the agreement Apple has
to provide the support for the device so
that's the reason they can send software
updates through itunes is because
they're the ones that bear the
responsibility of handling
issues that come from it so if you want
a device from samsung or HTC google
motorola whomever they'll have to
actually create some kind of channel to
offer support and guarantee their
software to you and offload that burden
off of the carrier that's the only way
you're actually going to get carriers
out of the way is they're gonna have to
make those negotiations so this is why
Google has to do this because nobody has
done this no absolutely absolutely I
mean that the support is not a small
issue but people don't realize the
reason that verizon is able to justify
locking everything down is because they
need to guarantee that they can provide
a high quality blah blah blah blah blah
blah blah you don't care because you
just want to root your device the
problem is verizon is responsible for
writing all of that blah blah blah not
HTC not Samsung not LG not whoever major
advice right if you have a laptop that
has a verizon LTE chip embedded in it
and something goes wrong with it you
called dell or HP or lenovo or whoever
made your laptop you don't call verizon
yeah but if something happens to your
samsung galaxy s4 on verizon you call
verizon not samsung all right so anyway
so so back on topic here play store has
core android apps and that's awesome so
how else is android evolving and how
else is android changing oh actually
talked about it a few weeks ago on our
show recapping Google i/o we talked
about Google Play services where Google
demonstrated that they could update
Android basically without you knowing
and without actually putting on a new
version number it's a real quick recap
you know the Google Play services then
the new version brought games which you
know achievements leaderboards
multiplayer location-based API updates
in new API uses such as the fused
location provider geofencing and an
activity recognition which right now I
don't know if there's a whole lot of
apps that actually take advantage of
these I did see
one that was taking advantage of fencing
recently but I don't remember the name
and in last location I'm sorry um after
location api's you know Google Cloud
messaging was also demonstrated and
cross-platform single sign-on so these
are things that come to Android without
you having to get you know Android 4.3
which would always know when it's coming
out yet who knows what's coming out it
doesn't really matter your Android's
updated with new apps and with new api's
we have to do anything you have to stall
new app your care didn't have to do
anything and your manufacturer didn't
have to do anything and that and that's
cool you know that shows a lot it shows
how the platform is evolving not just
evolving but maturing right like when
you look at a desktop operating systems
particularly the mainstream ones that
people really know about Windows and OS
X you can version of Windows once every
what three to five years Apple releases
a little bit quicker but not that much
quicker and so people are used to having
a stable platform for the long term not
this every six months there's a new hole
version of the operating system so I
think this is definitely a good
direction for Android last and not least
for the evening we're going to cover
some pata news there's actually been
some pretty exciting news and patents
this week samsung won an import ban from
the ITC against apple products well that
sounds very exciting it's only for the
Apple iPhone 4 and blow and the ipad 2 I
don't think the one ever had cellular
connectivity or only appointed is also
been then so these are devices that I
think with the exception of the iphone 4
aren't even sold in the United States
anymore but if they were Apple would no
longer be allowed to import them you
know in a win is still when you know
because apples had some very you know
lowly wins as well so it's it's nice to
say you're winning something right
la the four people who are wondering the
thing that those devices have in common
and why not the newer devices the iphone
4s and newer and the ipad 3 and they
were all are using qualcomm radio
technology strangely i thought that the
four and below were using intel tech and
not samsung but i don't know how they
pulled that one off but go Spence um the
other big big news in patents this week
was the the White House putting out a
whole bunch proposals and executive
orders regarding patent litigation and
the whole patent troll issue probably
one of the biggest aspects of this is
the president coming right out and
calling patent trolls patent trolls no
mincing words no beating around the bush
no patent asserting entities or any
other fancy colorful bullshit to say
patent trolls they're despicable they're
horrible they're trolls they're bad for
the economy they're bad for innovation
they're bad for everything and so
definitely good for the president and
not mincing words on that one after that
he followed that up with a lot of
proposed legislation which if anybody
really follows politics I'm sure you'll
agree there's little hope any
legislation will get through Congress no
matter how good it might be but those
suggestions are really pushing for a lot
more Pat reviews by a program called the
CDM as well as increasing end user
protections and when I say and use your
protections I mean for example a
restaurant buys a Wi-Fi router and
provides Wi-Fi to its customers and the
some obscure patent troll sousou's them
because they have some patent on
something that's thrown up so vaguely
that it covers anything that uses Wi-Fi
so end users are people that aren't in
any way involved in technology and are
still being forced to defend themselves
in these litigations the other big
proposal was fees shifting fee shifting
is basically forcing patent trolls to
pay the legal fees of the other party
when the other party wins ironically the
leading judge the chief
for the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit which by the way created
software patents in the first place
penned an op-ed where he was basically
talking about fee shifting and how
important it is and how really this
doesn't need new legislation because
there's provision under current law that
could be enforced that ought to be
enforced that would allow phase shifting
to a car already so I guess we have to
ignore the irony of the fact that this
man sits on the main court for patents
in this country and has never tried to
apply this be shifting in practice
before work but if if Congress moves or
if this judge I guess puts his money
where his mouth is and starts doing the
same court we could see some improvement
on that end and then to top that all if
the president put out several executive
orders so instant action these things
are going to happen without any
congressional will one of those things
is more experts at patent and trade
office to study the problem of patent
trolls so your tax dollars wasted to
answer a question we already know the
answer but some more actually beneficial
executive orders are going to cause the
patent trade office to start lending a
lot more support to end users in filing
a request for information regarding
patents when they get sued by random
patent trolls also one of the other big
changes is going to be true ownership
disclosure one of the things that patent
trolls do is sue on behalf of other
companies where other companies are sort
of halfway licensing their patents away
to the troll so that they can sue for
them Microsoft does this a lot there's a
lot of other companies that do this a
lot so that way it's not Microsoft
versus it's some obscure nobody cares
about it versus going after all this
money but really it's all Microsoft so
this is going to force the actual patent
owners to file their name on the
applications and you file them every
year on their maintenance requests so
people are gonna be able to find out who
actually owns the material that I'm
getting sued over one of the other
really
really important executive orders is
restricting functional claims in patents
and what this consists of is better
training for the patent and trade
officers who issue the patents and
certify them restricting the functional
claims is going to draw down a lot on
the ridiculous crap that's getting
patented functional claims are things
like they're not the actual invention
they're the way to do whatever it is so
looking at the continent first patented
invention of the country the cotton gin
is a device that was actually patented
and is an actual thing the patent isn't
on a method to convert you know the
organic plant cotton into the refined
good of cotton it wasn't the abstract
extracting one substance from another
organic substance but that's the way
patents they are written so it's not
just on the cotton gin it's on the idea
of refining cut so nobody else whoever
invents any other device for refining
cotton and yes there are more
sophisticated and advanced devices
nowadays than the cotton gin but all of
those would then be infringing that
original path this really doesn't happen
as badly outside of software it's really
just a problem in software patents so
this is going to play a big role in
technology patents the kind of
outstanding question is patents that
have already been issued with ridiculous
functional things in them and in terms
of what's going to happen to those is
it's probably going to come down to
reviews of those patents which means
still other parties when they get sued
over those ridiculous patents are going
to have to push the patent and trade
office to review them before then
hopefully they'll start applying
stricter standards and actually you know
not granting patents on things that
never ought to have been patentable in
the first place the reason why
functional claims don't happen so much
outside of software is because they're
not allowed outside of software but
people take a functional play of and
attach on a computer and then are
magically allowed to get a patent on it
so this is really going to put an end to
that practice and hopefully clean up a
lot of things and maybe Congress will
come through and push through shifting
and user protections and really bring
things up even more but this is
definitely a huge and good first step
you know what Dan it's good that the
government notices these things because
