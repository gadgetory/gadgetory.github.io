Andhra Authority now one area of
computing that is improving the way we
use our smartphones and use the web is
machine learning
now sometimes machine learning in AI get
used interchangeably especially by big
brand companies that want to announce
their latest innovations
however machine learning and AI are
quite two distinct areas of computing
her of course they are connected and
today we're going to ask ourselves the
question what is machine learning the
goal of AI is to create a machine that
can mimic a human mind and do that of
course it needs learning capabilities
however it's more than just about
learning it's also about knowledge
representation reasoning and even things
that abstract thinking machine learning
on the other hand is solely focused on
writing software that can learn from
past experience one thing you might find
quite astounding is that in fact machine
learning is more closely related to data
mining and statistics than it is to AI
well why is that well first of all we
need to look at what we mean by machine
learning one of the standard definitions
of machine learning as given by Tom
Mitchell a professor at Carnegie Mellon
University is this a computer program is
said to learn from experience ie with
respect to some class of tasks T and
performance measure P if it's
performance at tasks in T as measured by
P improves with experience e ok well let
me try to put that more simply for you
if a computer program can improve how it
performs a certain task based on past
experience then you can say it has
learned this is quite different to a
program which can perform a task because
its programmers have already defined all
the parameters and data needed to
perform that task for example a computer
program can play tic-tac-toe maybe you
call it noughts and crosses because a
programmer wrote the code with a
built-in winning strategy however a
program that has no predefined strategy
an only a set of rules about the legal
moves will need to learn by repeatedly
playing the game until it is able to win
this doesn't only apply to games is also
true of
programs performed classification and
prediction classification is the process
whereby a machine can recognize and
categorize things from a data set
including from visual data and
measurement data prediction known as
regression in statistics is where a
machine can guess predict the value of
something based on previous values for
example given a set of characteristics
about a house how much is it worth
based on previous house sales and this
leads us to another definition of
machine learning it is the extraction of
knowledge from data you have a question
you are trying to answer and you think
the answer is in the data that is why
machine learning is related to
statistical analysis and data mining
machine learning can be split into three
categories supervised learning
unsupervised learning and reinforcement
learning let's have a look at what they
mean supervised learning is where you
teach train the machine using data which
is well labeled that means that the data
is already tagged with the correct
answer the correct outcome here is a
picture of the letter a this is a flag
for the United Kingdom it has three
colors one of them is red and so on
the greater the data set the more the
machine can learn about the subject
matter after the machine is trained it's
given new previously unseen data and the
learning algorithm then uses the past
experience to give you an outcome this
is the letter A that is the UK flag and
so on unsupervised learning is where the
machine is trained using a data set that
doesn't have any labels the learning
algorithm is never told what the data
represents here is a letter but no other
information about which letter it is
here are the characteristics of a
particular flag without naming that flag
unsupervised learning like listening to
a podcast in a foreign language which
you don't understand you don't have a
dictionary and you don't have a
supervisor or teacher to tell you what
you are listening to if you listen to
just one podcast it won't be much
benefit to you but if you listen to
hundreds of hours of those podcasts your
brain will start to form a model about
how the language works you will start to
recognize patterns and you will start to
expect certain sounds when you do get
hold of a dictionary or a tutor then you
will learn that language
much quicker reinforcement learning is
similar to unsupervised learning in that
the training data is unlabeled however
when asked a question about the data the
outcome will be graded a good example of
this is playing games if the machine
wins a game then the result is trickled
back down through the set of moves to
reinforce the validity of those moves
this isn't much due to the computer play
just one or two games but if it pays
thousands even millions of games then
the cumulative effect of the
reinforcement will create a winning
strategy there are many different
techniques for building machine learning
systems and many of these techniques are
related to data mining and to statistics
for example if I have a data set which
describes different types of coins based
on their weight and based on their
diameter I am able to use a technique
known as nearest neighbor to help
classify previously unseen coins with
nearest neighbor the new coin is
compared to the nearest neighbors around
it and see what classification they have
it's then given the same classification
as its nearest neighbors now you can
pick how many neighbors you want to
compare against and that number is often
referred to as K so therefore the full
title for this algorithm is K nearest
neighbors however there are lots of
other algorithms that try to do the same
thing but using different methods take a
look at this diagram the picture on the
top left is the data set the data is
classified into two categories red and
blue data is hypothetical however it
could represent almost anything coin
weights and their diameters the number
of petals on a plant and their width
clearly there are some definite
groupings here everything in the upper
left belongs to the red category and the
bottom right is blue however in the
middle there is some crossover if you
get a new previously unseen sample which
fits somewhere in the middle does it
belong to the red category or the blue
category the other images show different
algorithms and how they attempt to
categorize a new sample if the new
sample lands in a white area then it
means it can't be classified using that
method the number on the lower right
shows the class
occasion accuracy one of the buzz words
that we hear from companies like Google
and Facebook is neural net a neural net
is a machine learning technique modeled
on the way neurons work in the human
brain the idea is that given a number of
inputs the neuron will propagate a
signal depending on how it interprets
those inputs in machine learning terms
it is done by matrix multiplication
along with an activation function the
use of neural networks has increased
significantly in recent years and the
current trend is to use deep neural
networks with several layers of
interconnected neurons during Google i/o
2015 during the keynote it was explained
how much machine learning and deep
neural networks are helping Google
fulfill its core mission to organize the
world's information and make it
universally accessible and useful to
that end you can ask Google now things
like how do you say Kermit the Frog in
Spanish and because of neural networks
Google is able to do voice recognition
natural language processing and
translation currently Google is using 30
layer neural Nets which is quite
impressive as a result of using these
neural networks Google's error rate for
speech recognition has dropped from 23%
in 2013 to just 8% in 2015 so we know
that companies like Google and Facebook
use machine learning to help improve
their services so what can be achieved
with machine learning one interesting
area is picture annotation here the
machine is presented with a photograph
and asked to describe it here are some
examples of machine generated
annotations the first two are quite
accurate although I'm not sure there's a
sink in that first picture and the third
is interesting in that the computer
managed to detect the box of donuts but
it misinterpreted the other pastries as
a cup of coffee what is it it's a banana
isn't try again what is it it's a banana
no what is it
say it's an orange this is an orange of
course the algorithms can also get it
completely wrong look at this first
picture those men in hard hats seem to
be doing some work
however the computer thinks they're
lounging around in a couch and that
motor scooter doesn't look like a fire
hydrant to me and I don't think that
horse will be very happy as being
described as a surfboard traffic warden
another example is teaching machines how
to write Cleveland amore an American
author reporter and commentator once
wrote in my days a school taught two
things love of country and penmanship
now they don't teach either I wonder
what you think about this the above
handwriting sample was produced by a
recurrent neural network to train the
machine its creators are 221 different
writers to use a smart whiteboard and
copy out some text during the writing
the position of their pens was tracked
using infrared this resulted in a set of
X&amp;amp;Y coordinates which were used for
supervised training as you can see from
the results they're quite impressive
in fact the machine can actually write
in several different styles and at
different levels of untie deenis google
recently published a paper about using
neural networks as a way to model
conversations as part of the experiment
the researchers trained the machine
using 62 million sentences from movie
subtitles as you can imagine the results
are quite interesting at one point the
machine declares that it's not ashamed
of being a philosopher while later when
asked about discussing morality and
ethics it said and how I'm not in the
mood for a philosophy will debate so it
seems if you feed a machine a steady
diet of Hollywood movie scripts you get
a moody philosopher unlike many areas of
AI research machine learning isn't an
intangible target it is a reality that
it's already working to improve the
services we use in many ways it is the
unsung hero the uncelebrated star which
works in the background trotting through
all our data to try to find the answers
we are looking for and like deep thought
from douglas adams hit
it's guide to the galaxy sometimes it is
the question we need to understand first
before we can understand the arm sir my
