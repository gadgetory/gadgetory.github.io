the ftp by android authority Android or
DS podcast discussing topics in Android
every single week I am of course your
host Joshua Vergara and I'm joined by
our usual panel this week everyone from
nirav gondia to jonathan fires joe hindy
n andrew grush our usual 5 panel at this
point and we're able to finally record
at a time that in Arab will probably be
able to get onto the show pretty often
so that's pretty awesome but nonetheless
this particular episode we decided to
finally do what usually it's called a
mailbag episode or mailbox or something
like that but we are basically going to
call and ask us anything type deal every
week we usually put up a pole with a
bunch of different topics and we ask you
what you want us to talk about but this
time we had you just ask your questions
of us so we got quite a few and we went
through some pretty good ones here then
they took up quite a bit of time we have
another 90 minute podcast for you guys i
hope you guys enjoy nonetheless we did
talk about the that the future of
android as one of them we did talk about
cyanogen for a little bit also fitness
tracking via smartwatches and whatnot
and a couple of questions after that we
went on a bunch of different tangents
also so you're really just kind of
hearing us hanging out on this one and
some some portions of the podcast but
really we had a great time with this one
and we look forward to doing more of
these particular episodes in the future
so make sure you have your questions
ready we will sort of let's say put out
there the ask us anything is available
all the time when you go to our polls
every single week you can always ask us
questions whether it's on the YouTube
channel version of this podcast or on
Google+ while under our usual polls for
every week and you can ask those
questions and we'll try to save them
that way in the future when we do ask us
anything type podcasts will have a lot
of questions to be able to answer for
you guys and maybe we won't go on so
many tangents next time either but in
any case I hope you guys enjoy this we
do finally have a SoundCloud account and
you and for those of you who've wanted
soundcloud access to the podcast to the
ftp you can go to your soundcloud app
fine android authority search that in
soundcloud you should be able to find
the ftp pretty easily but of course you
are still able to go to all the
different podcasting programs from
podcast a dog catcher itunes stitcher
and beyond and be able to find it there
for those of you on the youtube version
make sure you click that card over in
the corner if you want to get links to
those particular ways of listening to
the ftp listening to it on a podcast
formats in any of those audio programs
is one of the best ways of listening to
the ftp without any further ado we're
going to jump right into this particular
episode episode number 17 of the fdp ask
us anything and I i wonder if we did use
the title that I said we were going to
use afternoon arrived so I've spotted
out a couple of nonsense words I have to
look back on the Edit before I edit this
podcast and find it and maybe that will
be the title of this week's podcast but
in any case thank you guys very much for
listening and hope you enjoy this
episode of the ftp oh here's the mail it
never fails it makes me wanna wag my
tail when it comes I want a whale we
forgot bag every oh boy yeah changing up
a little bit this week I mean we can
only have so many topics every single
week before we start repeating ourselves
a lot and who knows who knows how often
our audience wants to hear Joe rant
about Android even though this is an
Android podcast I just realized how that
went let's say lollipop in general but
we did talk about Android M last week
but nonetheless I was a how's everybody
doing right now man I'm like out of it
man I don't know what it is about like
Friday mid-afternoon I think it's cuz
it's warm outside and I have to turn off
my air conditioner to do the podcast so
it's like probably 90 degrees in here
right now so I just kind of want to like
a pi√±a colada and a nap pina coladas I
really wanted your favorite drinks do
anything with copious ok I concur with
ethanol that sipping on a pina colada
keep getting Austin delay all right
we're gonna have a sing-songy podcast
it's like our way then there you go guys
that's the hundredth episode idea
podcasts the musical upon my music good
news not ready
I think with us though it's not gonna
sound like a musical is just kind of
sound like that because I like that
episode of The Simpsons were like you
know where the boys do the boy band and
then like the thing that makes them
sound good dies so like they're just
singing and it sounds terrible today
buddy remember that episode aside from
me know yes i do i do like that's
exactly what we're gonna be like it's
what it's gonna sound like if we start
singing on the podcast together how
about uh yeah well how about an Arab
over there central shevington how are
things going on your your side of the
pond as a word we're all good it's a
friday evening so naturally podcasting
is totally the way forward and it's not
in the morning i'm really liking this
new arrangement yeah as a boy like sunny
where you are right now well yesterday
chucked it down with rain and then
typical English weather today was bright
humid and just like oh I've had to turn
off the air conditioning is shut the
windows so my office is complete oven at
the moment and I decided stupidly to
wear a hoodie at the same time because
you know it this is exactly how you do
things well we've had we've had just a
shitty is why they're here in LA because
it's well okay it I shouldn't say it's
really bad because we've been in a
drought for the longest time and then
all of a sudden this huge storm came in
or the last couple days so now all these
hippies can stop complaining but um the
thing is I've been needing to do like
camera shoot outs for these verses
videos i'm working on but i haven't been
able to go outside and do it so unless
i'm like oh yeah i got the camera shoot
out done but the phones died because
they got wet I really pop the fun twist
ending a little bit as i go here all the
pictures and now i can't do anything lr
not waterproof yeah you're right just
waiting for the sony so that we can find
get some water proofing back in our
phones but anyway how about you feisty
everything's gone you know you guys keep
talking about the weather's been a
beautiful week here and then perfect
today this is clouds is a little bit
rainy out there i'm like and be inside
today unless things are great
last time you had to get a nice big deep
breath after all that you know talking
about the weather it's always a dead end
conversation isn't it yes well you see
how that they will go because I still
don't sorry right what kind of sorry no
you go ahead just like that deeper you
kind of like sounded like you were like
sitting outside on the porch on them you
know the rocking swing watching the rain
falling aaah nice day on the topic of
weather do you have a specific phone
just for your weather app to I use
tasker on all the phones i don't
actually watch the weather but I've got
elements in my Tasker widgets that sorry
tasker and zooper widget and you know
there's a big ring around one for
example that turns red when the
weather's bad or turns blue when the
weather's cold yeah they should have an
app that like when you collect check
whether it says go outside you Nimrod do
they do have an app like that is it I
did it doesn't say go outside you you
free or more on but it'll say anything
like it it's freaking cold hurry yeah
sucks yeah its goal rain you don't like
the more sensitive ones that like you
should bring a sweater today well that's
a lg's long as I'm sure nough Rapkin can
attest to as well Oh small yeah the
smart notice things like it'll be clear
in the morning with some clouds later
today bring the sweater is like what
it's gonna rain I don't wanna know what
to do I think it's kind of nice and I go
live but the one that gets me is like um
hot and humid out today limit your
physical activity I'm like bitch did you
know who I mean really if it was red in
like the Hal voice from that one movie
that everybody likes by Stanley Kubrick
a clockwork orange new image space
doesn't one space 2001 yes that's right
2001 a space at they fought if LG did
all those things in the voice of Hal
from that movie
plastic Wow good morning job would be
fantastic it's going to be cloudy this
afternoon don't forget to bring a jacket
just wake up in a cold sweat off of that
alarm right limit your physical activity
I'm gonna exercise I'm afraid I can't
let you do that Josh all right and then
grouchy who might have to duck out again
on this podcast like last week yeah just
I don't like you guys have to take off
now um I'm doing pretty good it's rainy
and nasty um so that I have had no very
little motivation this morning I'm not
gonna lie the guy got him things done
anyway but I've had to force myself
through it because I don't know about
you guys but I get like sinus issues and
stuff and I just when it's raining
outside I just I don't want to do
anything I just want to go take a nap
for like you know the whole day all
right cool well things just sounds like
me on a normal day I get allergies don't
go anywhere isn't that it's a miracle we
get any work done guys I i chose the
group for no small part because it's
indoors yeah well and working from home
I mean it is kind of nice not gonna lie
yeah trust me I used to go to the office
a few weeks ago I much prefer just you
know rolling outta bed and just walk
crawling to the office and pretending to
work and then come back to bed again by
that I'm excited by that he means our
laptop is on the other side of the bed
he just rolls right over on his belly
starts oh oh that's right i'm gonna
close it out not my toad ually i
literally start my work day like five
minutes after opening my eyes I just
start checking emails I have a routine
every morning i love that you know where
it's at a traditional job you get up you
have to you know take a shower pressure
to you have to take a shower like this
when he starts everything take a shower
brush your teeth put on clothes uh she's
like I didn't idea that till I want to
damn it I do it alone yeah are you
trying to tell us you never do that
basically I
certainly in the same order i would if i
had a typical 925 crunchy showers loads
a week folks yeah one in here damn it he
doesn't old school cuz he lives out in
the Midwest he just kind of walks out to
the creek and takes a swim yep he's got
swing into a YouTube that's that tire
swing splash okay that's it see you next
year today I was waiting outside i just
had to step outside you know it's a car
wash where you can just drive around in
the rain exactly yeah just free soap
your vehicle start driving around yeah
just put put a few squirts of car wash
liquid on your day to be the person
driving by and seeing like somebody
outside in swimming trunks no shirt in
the middle of a storm ring dawn
dishwashing liquid a look for third i
crash into a stop sign because like what
really what i doing why oh man you know
i'm looking at i'm looking at our topic
or now or not our topic but at the so
grouchy put up the basically fdp team
asks that we're going to ask for people
to submit the questions to the G+ which
is funny we're calling this mailbag it's
not coming from emails its gene plus at
Google Google baggage II was bad a G+ be
fair I stole that name from another
podcast mmm mailbag cuz it sounds good
it wasn't supposed to be used in the
show it was just something I suggested
in the chats before no I just like a
mailbag thing where we get like maybe
we're like a totally mail bag and then
go I didn't realize that the phrase male
or the term mail bag was gonna make it
into podcast well I mean in any case
like I'm just looking at it one funny
thing that just realized the cover for a
Google+ page is still that bat random
sticker in New York that I found that
that's on a block the corner of a block
on a telephone like like one of those
call boxes in I think God where is it i
think it's like
the upper west side or lower west side
in New York and I remember just walking
on the way to B&amp;amp;H photo which this is
only like two blocks away from it i
found that sticker on the freaking thing
and it was really awesome but this past
like couple weeks a couple weeks ago
when i went to new york for the LG g4
lodge I went looking for it again with
Michael Fisher and sure enough New York
is good at cleaning their streets
everything was very clean there so no
more sticker oh yeah right I really
wanted like one more picture of it I'll
be really cool but if to our tour
listeners if you guys if you guys
haven't seen that picture you should go
to our Google+ page and see that sticker
was really cool that I just found it we
don't know who could have told who we
don't know who could have put that up
there something we give up these these
big stickers very often the only person
we know who's out in New York for the
most part is a our old buddy Chris look
so I don't know but he doesn't like
going into the city so who knows who put
that sticker up anyway we'll get into
our topic I don't know if you guys
picked any topics from our dozens of
responses I don't know grocery if you
had one in mind already from this this
spread there's a couple of them would
one be scary we want me to post what you
know you're the host I'm delegating
you're the HOS you go first now you can
first know she really hang up first you
have a producer our guest really the
director director yeah there we go
something like that damn you guys really
are lazy on Fridays stuff God well
one of my favorite ones is already this
one where someone's responding to an FD
be post and the first question and there
is this is John Matthews by the way
future of Android but then the second
question is Oh can someone tell me how
and where to get the ftp e yeah exactly
well i will go ahead and do the whole
spiel you can get the ftp on all those
the different networks we're even on
soundcloud now which is great and for
those of you who have been wanting the
soundcloud and what nod you can get a
soundcloud app and find us at android
authority podcast however you can search
for android thority and find us there
and then stitcher and then itunes and
because we're on iTunes run all the
other networks as well pocket
I'm sure you can find us on dog catcher
on all of the major programs that are on
that are armed Android and even iOS and
even from there you can go to our
YouTube page we have a version of it up
already I try to make the Youtube
version just a little bit different from
the audio version by adding like a
couple of pictures and clips at the
beginning just for fun but for the most
part it's the same thing except with a
with a couple of graphics and a link to
the actual show page itself on Android
or tea um I don't know where we would go
with this whole future of Android
question I mean we did talk about
Android item yeah we kind of already hit
on a little bit last week so I don't
know nah I've been like a dream how
about like a dream future or something
like that like like cure cancer no I'm
not really quite like what about a dream
Android product apart from phones and
tablets and wearables concept okay so
we're gonna concept car Android right
now now is your Android altered by the
way I don't know okay it's kind of it's
not bad the integration is really nice
if you're if you're used to I'm gonna be
filming all this stuff today tomorrow
anyway but if you're used to Google's
way of presenting things like maps and
all the media applications and whatnot
um then it will come off as really
really attractive to the user the main
home screen with the Google now s cards
which by the way you can't swipe away I
mean you're dealing with so many
different touch screens on these
navigation systems it's hard to you know
make them i'll do the same thing but the
front page if you searched for any
basically any location on google it'll
be like oh here it is and then you can
just tap it and it will tell you to go
there which is kind of nice also that
being said though it's kind of weird
having google maps there when i could
easily just press nav on the center
console and it does the exact same thing
and the whole point of android auto is
that it's supposed to quote unquote
replace the navigation systems that are
already found in cars but if your car
already has a pretty good navigation
system it's kind of moot so that's where
my hang-up is with it right now i don't
know if it's ultimately useful if the
car manufacturer themselves have spent
the last let's say decade creating gps
navigation
systems that are actually pretty good
for the cars that they create so that's
the thing in terms of media it the
Android auto performs media better than
any Bluetooth iteration in a car I have
to say because it's actually graphically
presented on to there so i will say that
part is a little bit better but the nav
not to sure still sorry i went on for a
while they're there to select no I can I
see probably see no need for it but it
sounds interesting anyway yeah oh and
then one big caveat is you have to have
a connected via USB it can't be
bluetoothed yeah I heard ball which why
like I don't get that part I don't know
that strange and the the biggest thing
I'm excited for Android auto is is the
ability for different people to jump in
on it kind of like the chromecast where
you know my music collection is
significantly different from my wife's
but when she wants to hop in the car she
doesn't want to hear my music so if she
can plug in her device with her tunes
you know that that's a great thing yeah
and I mean I suppose are a couple of a
couple of feet of reasons why a
connecting via USB would be better i
mean you could conserve battery but the
USB ports and cars are never powerful
enough to charge a phone like that's
just the truth and the other thing too
is it renders the phone completely
inoperable so let's say you want to look
something up on your phone that you have
saved on your phone can't do it through
android auto if you want to search for
something sure you could use the voice
actions i hit that button on the top
right and then and then you'll use the
cars microphone to do your google now
search but then otherwise if you turn on
your phone it just says in that lovely
Roboto font android auto you can't do
anything on your phone so that would be
really annoying I mean yes I realize if
you're driving you shouldn't be doing
anything else on your phone but what if
you're you know what if you have a
really cool playlist of songs and you're
the you know you're you know you're the
passenger like hey listen to my music if
you plug it in there well you're in the
other you should be able to use your
phones to hell well the hope is that
that person or even the driver or
whoever would be able to use the nav
system the Android
dr. Otto app go to the media button hit
google play music where hopefully your
music is showing up there use the menu
button and then go through the menus for
it but even then I don't think the menus
are that intuitive yet I use Spotify or
at least i am using Spotify for now and
like going through the menus that are
created and Android auto for Spotify
don't get youtube pretty much any of the
songs you have you have to have it in a
playlist already you select the playlist
and then you try to scroll through all
the songs when you hit songs but then
there's like a finite number i can't
load them all for some reason so google
play the google play music iteration is
a little bit better but the Spotify
integration definitely needs some work
which I'm sure hey guys I don't foresee
myself having a vehicle that has android
TV until probably like 10 years or now
anyway Andrew so yeah yeah engine auto
I'm sorry GPS this big ass white screen
in his back waiting for the girl I enjoy
TV like a half hour como que o Android
auto I don't foresee myself you know
having a vehicle for five or ten years
that have set anyway and I yes I know
they will make you know the ability to
aftermarket at it but I don't you know
it's still going to be expensive I don't
see it worth it's one thing and it comes
with the vehicle but to buy it for my
existing vehicle yeah I don't I don't
know to me I have an auxiliary port you
know that i plug in my phone and that's
good enough yeah i mean it's it's it's
implied it's not enough for my for you
know I'd I have you know my I have a
six-inch phone so it's big enough for
navigation as it is yeah you know it's
not a bad platform there's just all
these nuances it's like it's like
Android wear in the sense that um when
it first came out every was annoyed by a
lot of different things about it and
then they had to change it in future
future versions which always gonna be
the case here for example um it really
relies on voice actions I know we have
this rant last week about voice actions
and
but uh if you wanted to look for a
location to go to you got to put the car
in park to type into Android auto what
yeah that's that's that's why I noticed
uh so see makes that's like no logical
sense whatsoever yeah however silly
logic yeah right and the voice actions
while not too bad definitely aren't as
good as like let's say you had to you
just say you have to put in like some
sort of odd word like cafe Beaujolais
not gonna happen it's um I have to park
up put it in hope that it knows what the
hell you're doing and then go backwards
again well a lot of it a lot of it is
putting the car in park like setting it
up in the first place that freakin car
has to be in park the whole to the whole
damn time and then st and then the phone
will download all of the android auto
versions of the apps much like with
android wear and then finally it's like
you're ready to go I'm like freaking
finally so that says the thing there um
okay I hope that answered your question
John I'm scared well I'll jump in on his
question I like this one I want Google
to back up you know in 2012 they talked
about having android on your oven on
your fitness machine you know the
treadmill and stuff like that where is
that that's what I want I don't need
more futuristic stuff from Android right
now I need everything they've already
promoted and announced to actually come
to life I hope that answers your
question what the hell would Android
look like on a few I would I completely
agree with feisty that if they did that
though I would like them to finally
deliver like integration and i don't
mean google integration which to be
completely honest sucks across most
devices I mean Apple like integration
cuz I don't like the iPhone but i use a
mac and the only reason i do like the
iphone is that just integrate so down
well but within the mac and eat like
anything you run using iOS or
OS X or any other crap whatsoever like
Apple TV whatever it just works well as
the name of that again the this is
linnea notice the the sinking system
between macs and iphones oh hi cloud is
like Clark was a new of it this is it
although convergence one of continuity
time for go continuity there you go
there you go I wish I was a quite name
like feisty what feisty said makes sense
but it's got to be just seamless it
hasn't got to be oh here's another app
that we're going to preload and like if
you look at the new devices although
come with like Google folders and got
loads and loads of apps in them from
google I don't want like 60 Google Apps
pre-loaded like a separate app every
single damn thing they announced I just
want android to bake it into the OS and
make it seamless press a button control
my oven but have a control panel for
your life that's what Android could do
and that's my like two cents mmm control
panel for your life that is one hell of
a freaking marketing phrase isn't it
welcome the LG kitchen series the
control panel for your life when it
would be freaking cold to go up to my
oven which is already securely connected
to my phone well probably not only good
if you live alone or you don't have the
visit of people living with you and be
able to look at my just got depressing
quick well look at look at them look at
my recent call list and make a phone
call go so what was that recipe or look
at a recipe and have it might show up on
my oven turn me exactly what ours didn't
yeah I think I just need a robot in my
life and I'll be solid this technology
to meet smartphones are already making
us stupid enough why did we need it in
more places oh you didn't officially
becoming handicapped if the internet was
to go out for like even a week they're
probably people who would just kill
themselves but just off themselves right
there no internet for a week well
speaking for the younger generation the
good side of that most of those people
are probably on fortune Oh
we'd never know about it anyway I know
yeah is there one better than the other
really like i like speaking for the
younger generation and aggression when
your kids grow up you're going that
you're going to notice this i bet
because i know that i have done this as
the younger kid I remember when I would
be sitting in the living room or in the
kitchen my dad and my mom would come out
steamy there and they'd be like oh the
internet must be out yeah telltale sign
well you're you're what 25 yeah I guess
five years makes a big difference but
you know it does hmm you have it when I
was a kid yeah I'm 30 well I'm not yet
but I will be in June well I'm used to
being the younger one unless like unless
rum in a group of people and like I
think the only person who's younger than
me in the industry other than mkbhd
obviously is Marco Hannah from from
phoneDog yeah every time every time
we're all like hanging out at these
events Marcos like I'm the baby again
I'm like yeah you are I scum I didn't
get to say that or you older than me
well I'm I am older than you crushing I
thought you were by a little bit a few
years yes if I said that may then I'm
assuming nurov and Joe are similar aged
uh-huh Tony Joe yes I might know how old
you are you Joe any word yay for being
late 20s me I guess not well you guys
just looked about the same age and
here's the big here's the big bomb drop
for this podcast by sedo you have a few
years older like a couple weeks down the
road we're gonna get him on the podcast
drunk he's like guys I'm actually like
50 years old come on we go and lie about
my own monkey long days I feel it
there's no question I know I've been
talking about my kids but they're
actually 20 him shouting at his kid very
stop that for god sakes dad on 23
yeah no uh so I guess when I was a kid I
didn't have the internet not until I got
a little older you know there were some
of my friends who did but I we did not
until nineteen ninety nine so you know
we had a computer in 1994 but just you
know the internet was at Encarta
encyclopedia she just Papa in karda with
Microsoft's little encyclopedia software
and he just looked crap up that was that
was like the Internet to me as a kid
dude it was freakin minesweeper all day
on that good I naman gonna do then I
discovered emulators why was that I'd
like a lot of video games Red Alert
King's Quest stuff like that minesweeper
play a mean game I hurts I hard maybe I
go back on topic yeah this is a
combination of like Friday recording
time and then a mailbag episode or
rather and ask us anything episode if
you want to call that and what we won't
well we did say some of these posts will
last like a whole some of these
questions are entire coast so yeah I
think that because we're but not because
we're focusing on the question a missing
baby what the last an hour even
answering right now you guys are talking
about the Internet of Things and all
kinds of random like something
basically what we should have said is
we're just gonna talk for an hour and
hope your questions the apologies
network yeah right oh yeah sorry podcast
any of these any of these and some of
these topics will take will take up an
hour which is about 40 minutes was
 so I'm gonna take a minute see
this is what I need to throw it out to
you guys as I did anybody find another
question in this spread that would they
would want to i have one in particular
and i'd love to get to it in a little
bit but i want to hear what you guys
thought was a good question from here uh
we did have like three or four people
ask about cyanogenmod her signage in'
you guys are gonna have to if ya if we
do that way you should be dead donate
donate like 5-10 minutes to that because
i can sum up my entire thoughts about
cyanogenmod in like less than a minute
yeah if we were gonna get into it i was
hoping you guys would sort of carry that
one cuz to be honest I don't
I don't know the whole story and it
seems kind of convoluted it was the
whole story we have to like I have to be
like I Jed knows what the hell they're
doing they're just look at mcmaster say
something stupid you know that's yeah
that's their strategy at this point okay
I'll try to clear things up a little bit
I kind of sort of know what Scott what
they're trying to do is they're trying
to build an app ecosystem similar to
like Google or Amazon but not like they
get like an app store like integration
into the OS like Google now does with
like the cards with the various apps
like that but like easier for developers
and stuff like that and pulling away
from google doing their own app store
doing their own integration and and
system like that and um it's actually
fairly admirable that they're going to
try and then it's going to be somewhat
slightly kind of predictable when they
don't do that great at it um here the
way I look at it is like it because it's
at its it's a good idea I mean it's
something different and I applaud them
for trying it but it's kind of like it's
kind of running a charity event right
and you're like oh cool a charity event
I can get behind that and then the guy
who is actually running the charity
event is going outside going give me
donations we're going to punch you in
the face and that's Kirk McMaster so
you're like whoa dude like all right I'm
going to stay away from your charity
event now because you're insane and
probably violent so that's that's kind
of what cyanogen is right now my god
that was it basically just sum it up
what seijin is doing their strategy is
to do everything that they've been doing
and go the exact opposite
direction instead of going instead of
being an open thing they're trying to
lock down and yet saying that
Google lock down by creating their
own platform of apps and services that's
the way I look at it I i I'm
disappointed in the way they've been
going personally I I don't know I you
know I used to think that seijin was the
best rom and now I don't feel that way I
don't know about you guys but I don't
use it anymore what's that perception
right like even if they're trying ok
cyanogenmod is still is the same as it's
always been yeah this signage in his
signage I don't I don't
I have to connect them in my mind that
because of what the direction that the
parent company has been going I know
they're not connected technically but
because of it I just become
disinterested you know yeah well I i I'd
know a lot of well not a lot I know a
few maintain errs you know for smaller
devices who are you know even they're
like man what are they freaking doing
right now like yeah I still love the
line I still like the the community I'm
not trying to say anything bad about the
community it's just as a company I would
never buy a seijin device you know like
one that as it proved loaded I just not
my thing let me know there's a question
to those who like it that's fine i'm not
trying to Curtis you know I just I guess
I just feel like you know there's they
built themselves kind of on I don't like
the way that they've been attacking oh
and I'm not a complete google fanboy
necessarily I just feel like it's been
distasteful the way that they've done
pace yeah they should have just hired me
to do a podcast i'll do it for Joe does
it I'm adorable they won't take you
seriously so yes thanks yeah do you
think they're suffering kind of the same
thing that t-mobile is right now in the
US where you know when they were smaller
they could you know big talk and they
were doing cool things but now that
they're really growing and truly getting
into the industry and becoming one of
the old dogs they're realizing that they
can't keep up the old the old ways the
fun and new ways they got to do it you
know the way the industry has been
handling it over oh I see where you're
coming from with that but it's like two
completely different like like takes on
something on the one hand t-mobile is
actually offering something that plenty
of people have really benefited from and
then you're talking about like a rom
company where the vast majority of
people are never gonna know what
cyanogen is see I guess that's that's my
big thing is that I feel like man this
is just like I said personal opinion but
they're not really offering anything
better than what we already had in my
opinion yeah I'm saying it's different
and do I believe you know I I there was
a question about whether there's any
chance of succeeding in their vision
actually I think to some degree yes I
just don't necessarily agree with the
path they're going but didn't yes will
they ever put a bullet through Google's
head like wonderful McMasters
says that they're going to do no but
could they have you know continue to
have partnerships in to eat yes they
need to maybe do a better job with the
papers they do have and not you know the
whole 1 plus thing and how he handled
all that you know at what point do we
start calling him Darth mcmaster when he
was asked I was actually one of those
people who was excited when uh you know
by the idea of seijin being pre-loaded
but i guess i just don't like where we
where it's gone yeah um I think I think
we cut off in her ave earlier you wanted
a scotch is our I would I was just gonna
say like we believe you I don't know
when but to be let me kind of chime in
and go never I view signage on mod once
didn't overly like it would probably
still never use it even if cyanogen was
just cyanogenmod ur not the sole the
devil who told both someone who's sold
his soul to the devil as Darth master
whatever his name is but yeah my thought
was we had all these rumors about
Microsoft tryna buy cyanogen Microsoft's
going to invest in signage and they all
turned to complete royal crap but I
wouldn't a movie trailer together yeah
well like they were made it to buy and
they're never going to invest and all of
that stuff but could their strategy of
closing stuff down because it is a very
microsoft like move be the first step
towards selling up in the future kind of
enticing them to get on board and then
going give us your money you will sell
you are sold to another level and you
guys can fight over it well you may
already have some integration with
microsoft apps fruits now granted not
for a seijin mod that's just a clarify
that's just for you know the size NOS
but they already now have i'm not for
sure what apps do you guys remember what
apps was specifically they I think it's
being and being for search skype I think
office and a few other things will be
loaded with you slide gen os1 live here
yeah so they're already cut a head in
that direction and I think it's but as
far as Microsoft buying then i don't i
don't know if i buy that I i think that
i know i think that windows actually has
champs as far as being a big player no
but i think that windows tens vision
could actually see it
semi more successful than it is now
let's put it that way you know yeah I
thought I don't think Microsoft's gonna
necessarily just jump ship I think I'll
probably agree on the Windows 10 that
actually does have the potential just
like everything and but I'll probably
like cyanogen is so you've got only I
know you said you've got cyanogen you've
got cyanogenmod and just whom Martha Liz
how long before cyanogen big OS begins
to influence cyanogenmod and when that
happened is that the death of supportive
leads because it's they've done some
things to protect it so supposedly never
but we'll see yeah I mean they don't
even include Google Apps in signing God
you'll have to go download gaps and all
that jazz even though that cyanogenmod
the official rom for the you know the
one plus they are Google certified you
know their signage in mod roms you still
have to go and get the gaps separately
that's the part I get that that gets me
is like there's so many little lines in
the sand you know it's like oh yeah
guerre where we're trying not to be with
Google but then this this particular
iteration of it has to be certified blah
blah blah you know like it's it's my
stuff my favorite part is how google
doesn't let them put stuff on
cyanogenmod and then like forces them to
put stuff on cyanogenmod elsewhere like
you know oh it's on the oneplus one it's
going she going to all the Google
Apps have to be on it yeah oh you're
just developing a backhand nope no
google ads for you you can't put it in
there like really Google make up your
damn mind either we all have google apps
or none of us have google apps you can't
do this like ninety-eight percent growl
yeah well it's not worth it well it
remains to be seen where that's going to
end up going on did anybody else have a
little bit more to put on to the sand
engine side of things or nope no no I
hope said I some mine up in less than a
minute like promised alright cool well
um here's the question that I wanted to
focus on um not necessary focus on but
like to answer um let's find that's fine
and the one we really should have
written these down somewhere a guys i
have that you a bit of here well i just
scrolling down through it where are
these freakin questions was it doesn't
take that long I mean um the UH okay so
I'm gonna totally mess up the name so I
I apologize but de meet our panel Yadav
was asking the best SmartWatch plus
fitness tracker combined that we've used
a reviewed and he had some caveats like
is it waterproof and shadow prove is a
strap changeable the one that's
important to me at least that all focus
on is uh which one is most accurate in
detecting heart rate if I'm not okay
does everyone in this chat have a
fitness tracker at this point is I know
that we had this whole Fitbit craze
going on recently Europe yeah yep nice
um is its crushy still kicking all of
your guys's ass and no actually I've
become extraordinarily lazy so there's
that no no I'm coming over autumn now
yeah yeah I oh no I did everyone yet I
am forgetting the wear it and also it's
been rainy and honestly I just haven't
had the time that's what I put is that
how come you haven't been walking and
exercising ago she it's been rainy I
don't want to go outside when it's
raining well um I have been exercising
just not things Fitbit tracks you know i
i've recently got a olympic weight bench
and you know down in my basement and
I've been doing more of that kind of
stuff nice normal training I like it
that's my well that's my bread and
butter right there well I'm still
working on losing weight so I'm not
gaining muscle obviously but I'm trying
not to I don't had to never had much
muscle to begin with so I don't want to
lose the little bit that I have while
I've been losing weight so it's
important you know to get that in so
yeah I'll see ya um ok well i am not a
fit bitter as it were i'm using i see
the thing is after i got this particular
finished tracker I kind of never looked
back I haven't worn my pebble in a while
I haven't won the the one that I like
out of Android wear right now is the Zen
watch um I haven't borne that any of
them because you know if you want
fitness tracking on one of the many
smart watches that are available right
now I'm of the opinion that there none
of them are very accurate they're awful
like the Moto 360 has technically ice
cracking but it's nobody's accurate is
even the Fitbit let's be honest the
fitbit's not that accurate yeah
but four steps or heart rate or both for
all of you but yeah for all of it it's
not accurate it's easy to screw it up or
mess it up you know you can just be
tapping your hand to like some you walk
50 steps you know and so you know even
the Fitbit is more accurate than say
Android we're just at this point none of
them are that accurate yeah and funny
how many get maybe a curious they may be
accurate enough but if you're like
someone who's really into it and once
the exact it won't be but if you're like
you know you leave some room it's just
like anything else when it comes to like
fitness of weight loss like with calorie
counting it's impossible to be exact
with calorie counting there's there's a
margin of error and so I get to depends
on how much marriage in our area we're
going to put up with ya and I'm of the
mind that if you're gonna tell if you're
gonna calorie count um you know cuz
people don't really focus on the the
even just the word stress in terms of
losing weight and in terms of health um
you can be perfect in your diet in your
exercise but if you stress the hell out
every minute of the waking day then
you're probably not gonna see those
games you know I'm probably the only
person who will ever use the word games
on on our on our podcast by anyway you
probably be seeing those games um but
the thing is if your calorie counting
all the time then you probably stressed
the hell out because of it and I can
attest to that as a diabetic and that's
the reason why i love these these health
questions um is that you know I I live
this sort of thing I have to because I
have to keep my blood sugar low and I
have to keep my health in check um so as
far as fitness tracking goes dimitar
I'll say in that case you're probably
never going to find a SmartWatch that is
as good as fitness tracking as fitness
trackers are now that was a terrible
sense but I think you get my point the
closest one that we're probably going to
have in my opinion is the new pebble
that's coming out and the reason why is
not because fitness tracking is built
into the actual watch itself but it's
because those smart bands are going to
have things like pedometers and heart
rate monitors and stuff like that
built-in are they going to be completely
accurate probably
but if you can connect it to your
smartphone as the pebble obviously
should be connected to your smartphone
to begin with and you have an app like
say under armour or runkeeper or
endomondo any of the menu that are out
there then you can perform the tracking
that way and sleep tracking on the
pebble is actually really great because
you sleep as Android that at that great
app for sleeping is connected to the
pebble so you can get sleep tracking
that way that probably takes a lot of
the the box is there for you to meet our
but as far as heart rate monitors
there's they're never going to be any
optically used Harvey monitors that are
better than the polar ones or the ones
that you strap on to your your sternum
that's just the truth I they are
somewhat in the margin of error but if
you want real heart rate monitoring for
your workout so for daily usage you're
gonna have to strap a strap on that that
uh that that heart rate monitor to your
sternum that's just the way it's going
to be a little pro tip just from my
experience with the the Fitbit charge HR
the way of course the position on your
wrist where you wear it but how tight
you wear it makes a difference in the
heart rate sensor as well I find if it's
just a little bit too loose it reads way
up like my resting heart rate will read
like 120 but if I tighten it down just a
little bit of drops into the proper zone
I've noticed the same thing feisty on
mine and i also had it randomly i woke
up and my heartbeat was 150 I was like
didn't like a hard time right now yeah
right yeah it took me a Fitbit to
realize i was having hot water
technology folks the whole energy he
wakes up with tachycardia that's
terrible oh oh my god um well yeah but
but you know from that standpoint I mean
there are so many different heart rate
monitor at Harvey Mudd or its fitness
trackers out there and you know this
polar em for 100 which is a watch that I
use you know it's just it's just the tip
of the iceberg and then of course we
have the the Fitbit so I are you guys
happy with the fit I think rush you know
we're talking a little while ago like
he's ready to move on or
yeah I mean I that's part of the reason
why I lost motivation is it didn't seem
that accurate to me anyway it was easy
to screw it up or you know I wouldn't
mind something a little better i mean i
think for casual users it's great in the
competition side i mean i do love the
tools for they make it really easy to
motivate yourself through competition
but even that only lasts so long you
know and so cuz i've had it for a few
months talend I was real gung ho about
it and like I said part of its been that
I've been trying to focus on other
things you know other types of exercise
but well and that's just it with like
those kind of things it doesn't take
into account which is true of all you
know step you know pedometer type tool
you know doesn't take into account
packing I mean yeah it will register
it's very inaccurate so you know it
doesn't take into account other things
and so I don't know I guess I I would
like more you know what more robust
fitness tracking that's the thing you're
not gonna get robust fitness tracking
just from a wrist like no of course not
right I realized that yeah exactly you
can't have a wrist fit a wrist base
wearable just doesn't you have to have
more than that yeah like all of these
iterations of fitness tracking or even
health tracking there's always a margin
of error no matter what even for me as a
diabetic like I do that whole thing
where i pricked my finger and I check my
blood sugar on a meter and you can only
do that that only gives you a snapshot
of what your blood Sugar's like if you
want a real-time look at what your blood
Sugar's doing or where it is at any
given moment you have to put an implant
in your body yeah and you've got you put
it into your side and then it connects
via a wire you're always going to have
this thing sticking out of your body
where you connect a wire and then that
is what and then that the module is is
gonna look at your blood sugar that way
that's what I was the future of Android
if we suddenly had like you had your
Android wear and then you've got maybe a
thingy majiggy mabob that you strapped
to your leg and what you call it
strapped to your arm awesome like
elsewhere on your body and then it
collects all that information as you can
see people I'm till E like with the
words today thing given what's a face
you know what that's the name of my
podcast this week right there
thingamajiggy 1gb what's-his-face
haha i like that josh said implants i
mean that's what i said when we had the
the wearables pop podcast near the
beginning of the string of this show and
you know implants but i think really
will be the future we're certainly for
health stuff implants can be great it's
terrifying just howling yeah I I don't
just know that idea personally but I'm
scared shitless of the future I'm also
excited to see it you know it's a
combination of idiot he's gonna as the
futures dawning upon him he has a
baseball bat in his hand like I'm
excited and I'm ready to go but i'll
swing if i bring it on i
think so you can't deny that some of the
things that we're seeing aren't a little
bit scary yeah Oh everything we're
seeing is ray its Lancet technology
technology is naughty it's not
inherently good or evil it's it's the
people use it and its people that scare
the out of me to be totally honest
and you know technology allows them to
be you know more powerful than I that's
what scares me you know the government
already spies on us not to you know
putting on the tin foil hats you know
just the idea of giving you know the
access of all of our data from our body
and everything the government yeah
that's what basically yeah they know
exactly what you're doing I know what
your heart rate is about where you are I
don't know I think that would be I think
that would be one caveat I want for the
future like oh whatever whatever future
trackers or smartwatches get this
information please just leave it where
it is yeah oh wait well we're just
that's you know it's the whole like the
big data you know movement that we're
heading into we were basically
everything's connected and Internet of
Things I'm really excited for it but I'm
also kind of scared to see you know when
everything's connected a hacker or a
government that you know you know that
you know does what it shouldn't be doing
with your data they have a lot of power
there you know mmm yeah
alright cool well let's see what you say
we round this out with one more question
guys I'm not picking them oh I'm not
generally one day they already went that
long and do we have um 45 so damn I'd
hearing about I wouldn't mind hearing
you guys as a pity Anana other this is a
good question should more companies go
the motorola route and use stock android
for their phones and actually to connect
with that another question was kind of
stock Android voices versus skinned so
they kind of fit you know Han Han okay
um the thing that I was looking at that
one as well and the thing that I don't
think people understand about skinned
Android is that that's kind of sort of
where like a lot of the features of
stock Android came from over the years I
know it came out on a custom rom first
but TouchWiz Samsung's TouchWiz
gingerbread from my way back in
Gingerbread was the first one to have
the the drop-down notification toggles
and you know you see you've seen you
know that got integrated in android and
ICS and turned into quick settings and
what jelly bean right mm-hmm and you
know and so on and so forth and you know
i i'd have to go and actually do the
research but i know that there's far far
more examples where you know something
on skinned android was really cool or
really forward-thinking and then it
eventually got kind of integrated into
the stock android experience so it's
it's difficult to answer that question
because you have two answers it's either
you know stock android is pretty much as
good as it is right now and we trust
google to come up with brand-new awesome
features all on their own or skinned you
know skins are awesome and OEMs are
helping to contribute kind of as i say
not really satisfactory and i know that
but that's the way it is and yoga at
everyone's opinion what do you prefer
regardless of what's better what do you
prefer to use not say you won't use one
or the other but what do you prefer do
you prefer a stock or light Android
experience or do you like all the extras
Oh symbian all the way like
you go have your Friday symbian podcast
somewhere else I'll be like one person
tuning in oh yeah does the one guy way
in the back loop personally prefer i
prefer stock android but you know i like
I have this huawei the mate 7 i've been
using and you know it's yeah i've tried
to done my best to make it more stock
like as far as the launcher whatnot but
some of the extra stuff i actually use
even though they're gimmicky like the
whole you know taking the taking your
phone and lifting it to your year for it
to auto answer yeah it's a gimmick but I
kind of like it to be honest you know
and so I could kind of see both you know
I used to be more of a stock android guy
but I don't know I I can see the
usefulness of additions and so at this
point I like did I comes down to the
hardware and they you know presentation
I'm not necessarily going to go out of
my way necessarily to just get a nexus
or go out of my way to get a stock
experience it kind of depends on the
phone well let's let's let's put out one
caveat out there real quick like you
know even if you have a skin version of
Android available you know um then you
you are okay you were not going to be
changed the settings menus or anything
like that obviously but you can get the
Google now launcher and you can mate you
can basically create a look at it goes
yeah you know there's gonna be certain
things you know your notification shade
and like you're multitasking menu and
things like that but you know and but
more and more OEMs are making some of
that more in line with Google's anyway
and so yeah you can get pretty close to
stock at this point I think honestly to
me that that's what makes this year in
Android so awesome is that I've said on
all of the reviews so far for all the
flagships I've come out actually have
even said this for the alcatel one touch
idol 3 which is a mid-range / budget
device and Android despite you know
memory holes and everything like that
for for a daily driver Android
iterations this year skinned or not have
been really great in terms of speed and
reliability but if it came down to it
like I'm messing with my s6 edge right
now if it came down to it and I got sick
of how TouchWiz looks which I'm kind of
not I've never really had any things i
hate about it I have Google now launcher
install just in case and I'm just
clicking it right now and there you go i
have a stock looking
a front page yeah you know it's uh yeah
it's it's definitely come along with a
long way both skins and stock Android
have come a long way and you know cuz
stock Android let's be honest go back to
the gingerbread days and stock Android
was pretty not great oh you don't miss
the jet black settings menu with ice
cream over scroll down oh my god that
was like my favorite feature the auto
that were you shocked chasm because
members about gingerbread man like you
asked like any like normal tech nerd the
be like oh yeah the orange / scroll go
that was gingerbread right like what
else happened to gingerbread was
gingerbread even worthy of anything
because it wasn't until ICS they started
being like oh hey we should probably
like fix these performance issues that
we're having and no project butter and
jelly bean and all that jazz but nope
the gap between two and I've said this
before the gap between two point
whatever and four is huge I mean because
you look at even for and you know you
know you look at that Ice Cream Sandwich
and jelly bean and Kit Kat and all the
pub well basically yeah there's
definitely been progress but they still
have a lot of similarities where I've
been changes progress changes Bobby J
still but gingerbread and Froyo and all
that they don't even seem like the same
operating system as you know where as
you look at a lollipop phone and you
look at you know I ice cream sandwich
phone and you say okay yeah I can see
how these are related you know you can't
it to me gingerbread almost seems like a
different operating system yeah yeah no
you're definitely right do you guys have
a favorite skin archways I'll touch was
I hate to say but yeah just just kind of
going backwards one step if you don't
mind but one feature that stock Android
took years to bring was a battery
percentage monitor the most basic
feature in the world and it took him
like six generations to find everything
out yeah or something ridiculous yeah
how does who I am skins first to me it
hurt like I actually prefer i prefer
Motorola's approach where basically
everything looks like stock but there's
young
changes underneath that make it you know
the add extra features so I don't really
have a favorite skin um I think Sony
does a pretty good job uh I I haven't
used it enough though I don't know my
god I got something I got see something
very different from so many this URL so
I'm not gonna really be that not happy
with it hardware-wise with you on Tom
we're all over honestly I really don't
know I'm just thinking about what
basically looks like an ice cream
sandwich like operating system in my
head right now I've you know this that's
what that's what Sony's Xperia basically
looks like you know and then you
remember like it's based on their time
escape and that was one of their first
he was like an app that run yeah uh-huh
it was a custom UI that ran inside an
app that ran on their custom UI on their
android phones yeah if I don't I got
that right in my head at least yeah I
did it just I mean finally they got rid
of that stupid all-in-one whatever the
whole time escape place it was which is
crap and never worked but it's not I
mean it's nice but it's just not that
nice I mean I so my personal thing is I
go either sense and I go touch ways and
the only reason I went TouchWiz this
time is because josh you can verify this
the s6 edge is the fastest samsung phone
ever made by a country friggin mile yeah
absolutely the most unskinny or I mean
is heavily skinned but its most
optimized and finally it's actually for
me as fast as stock is once I've added
50000 apps to put on the little feature
that Samsung had and I can't name any of
top my head now but just like battery
percentage was one of them before or
monitoring this or doing this it's just
little features like Google makes
changes to the OS but it doesn't seem to
consider the little stuff but Google
making changes to the OS means that the
manufacturers can consider the little
stuff which is where I think skins come
in and I kind of agree with grouchy that
we've got Motorola's approach which is
always good so it's stock but improved
it's almost like Google should have kept
motorola and just made them in charge of
android does an OS kind of thing about
the same time without TouchWiz I I
honestly personally believe that Google
board material designing to prevent the
likes of TouchWiz and sent from
completely screwing up designed of
devices because they looked a bit crap
before lollipop yeah well yeah I could
see we're going from a bad how about um
about feisty over there I heard from you
in a little bit oh you woke me up no you
know nothing against you guys it's just
sleep mana no I'm glad that the nur I've
mentioned apps he's mentioned this a
couple times and it's specifically
looking at the motorola devices the
motorola route yes i like the way
they've gone where it's relatively stock
Android with few changes however the
apps that's my concern and my gripe i
got a google play edition moto g and you
know i jumped into the app store the app
store the google play store looking for
the moto apps that went with the Moto G
I could not install any of them they're
made for the phone but because the
software isn't Motorola's wrong it none
of it would work none of it would even
install whether or not it would work so
I'd love that's interesting yeah yeah
exactly so I mean there's always options
I like the idea of Android kind of being
the the canvas and then having all of
these other apps and stuff that that you
can install to bring in the modules and
you know the different ways of doing
things but then again how many apps do
you really won't have to install for you
know one app for a battery meter one app
for you know just the little things like
that so I mean it's nice half at all you
know you kind of hit the nail on the
head because the problem with apps is
obviously you go and download whatever
the hell you find on the Play Store I'm
sorry I mean Play Store might have
million door however many apps it does
but not all of them are great and some
of them like the irony for me was like
the reason I stopped using stock
completely was because a couple of times
I've tried battery monitor apps that
were false and maybe think my entire
phone was buggered and right there
you're like there's your problem like do
you use a nap do you had you know which
app is good and all of a sudden you I
know I'd rather just get something that
has it built in and for average consumer
stock is great if
I think stock appeals to the Android in
the tech enthusiast but average consumer
is not going to go and install stock
android roms or even search for a thing
you'll just go I think Carmen who picked
up not earlier but just will go that
hunts it looks the best yeah that's fine
i'll take that there are mean the
software is interesting but not as nice
as how the phone itself kind of looks i
would agree with that i think that stock
android has more appeal for those who
want a clean slate that they can
customize the crap out of but the
average consumer once you know to be
able to be satisfied with the outer box
sure they can customize it further if
they want to but they want to you know
there are people who probably just find
what the out of box experience of stock
android too but i would say that most
people who go with a Nexus device or go
with you know probably tinker I know I
did you know I don't just keep it
exactly how it was out of the box you
know I used to be that way I used to
heavily customized my phone I suppose
I've gotten out of the habit because I
mean can we transfer their phones
through quickly to I'm sure that's part
of it right oh yeah that's part of it
but also the whole fact that if I could
get a review unit like let's say review
unit in this case if i can get a review
unit and cater it with my the way that i
put together my android phones for
example let's say Google now launcher no
icons know which is no nothing I just
want a good background and all of my
apps are going to be in folders in the
duck that's how I am the thing is every
time I like I did that one time for a
review and then our big boss is up top
or like you have to show the phone in
its original and all that and I was like
okay that makes sense and because of
that I've gone out of the habit of even
doing customization on my phones so
that's a little sad but you know once
once the cycle of reviews and videos for
all these phones are out of the way I
can finally get back to doing that but
right now it's not the case the only
phone the last one that I did that for
was my one plus one so Josh I hate to
break it to you but you never can do
that i'll probably i don't think i'm
glad you talked about customizations I
remember when I first got my original
Nexus 7 my officemate picked up the the
samsung galaxy
yes to at that time and I was sitting
there playing with tasker and he was
interested he installed Tasker he was
playing with it as well but the Samsung
software in the background now he was it
was blocking things like Tasker was
unable to change system volume because
of some Samsung service in the
background it was scary I actually I
don't think we heard from uh from from
Joe about like with the aphid you have a
sub preferred skin or is it stock for
you um I bounced around um I really do I
get around get around I get around I'm
just I'm just an Android like you
can be skimpy can be unskinny think
about that skinny it can like the bee
gees it can hate the bee gees I don't
care um as long as its Android and it's
not Amazon's version of Android sorry
amazon fair enough um but it's never
bothered me cuz like people get so like
almost like people get with football
teams with the version of Android that
they prefer oh yeah we are samsung
warriors we are Nexus warriors we are
HTC one the few the far the you know the
occasional fan like people get so like
caught up in it and I don't understand
why because at the end of the day you
know if you want to start with the blank
slate and download a hundred apps you
can do that on literally every Android
phone no matter what it is you know if
you want the stock googly experience you
guys said get the google launcher and
then your stuff you know you start from
scratch again and just download the apps
you want to replace the stuff that
you're replacing and you know if you
have a stock Android experience and you
want something ridiculous like you know
like a full page news thing like HTC
blinkfeed there are you know RSS apps or
news apps out there that have four by
four widgets that take up your whole
screen at kind of sort of like like you
could recreate almost any experience on
any phone on any oatmeal on anyway
skin or stock Android if you just like
be patient with it and I think something
else that uh just gets under my skin is
that people have such old preconceived
notions of what these OEM skins are like
people like well you know I use
TouchWiz back when it was on the samsung
galaxy s2 and I'm never using TouchWiz
again like why the hell not that was
five years ago do you have any idea how
many things changed in the last half a
decade you freaking old bastard like I
just used that phone as a reference
thanks man sorry man but it was anything
with sense and even with stocking there
are people who are like man I'm never
going back to stock Android did you use
Eclair like yeah it was potty training
it was that long ago like it's just you
know people just they don't pay
attention to what's changing and what's
new and what's different from what was
from what things used to be and this
isn't anything new either they do is
with desktop operating systems windows
fans be all like enjoying that terminal
linux and linux fans be like her
enjoying that be sod windows as though
these two things are still somewhat
common in they're like not and it's like
oh my god like if you're not going to
use it either shut up about it or use it
and try it out for yourself before you
you know because things now we're not
the way things were a year ago or even
two years ago and they're certainly not
the way they were like three or four
years ago and I've used all of them in
the last except for LG's and Sony's I've
used HTC Samsung and stock Android in
the last year or so and I mean it's
nothing like when I use them back in the
day so I really people just need to like
calm the hell down and realize that you
know oh I lost my train of thought
because grow she's having problems in
life podcast I like what you're saying
and this is definitely one of the
downsides of having so many skins and
the OEM roms and stuff is you know we
get never mind the preconceived notions
based on old stuff but but there is so
much variance and it does open it up for
or the battles between the two so you
know this the different options in each
which is awesome but you get these fan
flame wars and stuff and that's not what
we want for you know we're all Android
here we want to move forward together
but but we're fighting each other on on
a skin level and yeah well you get
people who do have these preconceptions
just on phones oh yeah I use some crappy
little LG phone like 47 years old some
ridiculous amount of time ago I'd never
go back to him now or oh I used a sony
10 years ago and you loved it it's the
best thing in the world and yeah this
one's amazing because you've never tried
anything else it's just kind of like
what the hell man i'm thinking like
somebody who bought like a Walkman back
in the 1980s we're like Manson is
awesome i love that Walkman and then
they open up the Walkman app on Sony
phones like what the hell is this it's
my haribol I do I how I remember things
exactly doesn't like sort of set yeah
but um feisty has like the thing is back
in the day I actually there is a part of
me there's a small small part of me that
wishes iOS were still the the more
popular operating system because back
then all android users had this like you
know had this thing where it was like oh
you know I like TouchWiz over stock
Android you like soccer android /
TouchWiz but you know what guys screw
apple and that was like the mantra for
being an android fanboy back today it
was like you know hey you got an android
phone doesn't matter what kind it is but
you got an android phone screw apple and
then back then show blackberry because
they were still relevant and it's like
today is like i don't think there's an
android fanboy i think the concept of
the android fanboy is officially dead
because you have the google fanboys and
the samsung fanboys and the HTC fanboys
it's like one team that broke off into
many segments and it's like I don't give
up people like I'm an Android nerd cuz i
bought it nexus no you just bought a
Nexus you don't get a title with that I
can go to mcdonalds it doesn't make me
fat you know I rant a lot that doesn't
make me know a prime candidate for heart
disease like just because you do
something doesn't mean you own or
deserve a title for it yeah we have to
sell
well meaning on so many things these
days right because i think psychically i
think this is gonna open up a discussion
that i can't wait to have where we turn
the looking glass of our audience and
just be like so why do you hold grudges
over 00 s show he's like oh like well i
never understood that and i still don't
always me i mean if you just read
youtube comments on our videos so some
of it is a chest attention-getting like
you I've seen like you know you r you go
onto one website and you read the
article you got in the comments or like
well blah de blah covers it better well
then go the hell over there and leave me
alone like x I had tabled I've reviewed
an app once it was a couple of years ago
and they're like I liked it better when
you wrote for XDA I'm like well that's
not happening anymore to go back to XDA
later the hell alone I you know the
thing that and there this is a part this
is a very small part of a much larger
conversation where people have forgotten
that they have the ability to vote with
their time and with their like with
their time and with their cliques you
know because they go and they read all
of these things and they go to all these
places and then they start getting
uppity about it they're like oh well you
know I go to all four of the big Android
blogs but you know what I don't think
this blog deserves my by ad revenue so
I'm going to add block just this one
it's like first of all you're a piece of
 secondly you know if you don't like
one sites coverage just don't go to that
website you have the ability to show
them that you know it and this goes for
everything everything on the face of
this planet and this is something that
no one does anymore if you don't like a
phone don't buy it if you don't like a
website don't go to it you know and
people have forgotten that you know they
have the power to you know to change how
things are by abandoning the things they
don't like and what what they do instead
is that they figure out a way to weasel
in and get the things they like and that
fools that's you know the the company of
that thing or whatever into thinking
that that thing is awesome you know like
a yo-yo a movie gets stolen you know a
hundred million times so they go and
make a sequel and it does really
terrible in theaters no one bought the
movie the first time they just liked it
so they stole it you know like it's
I'm trying to think of it such a wide
tough Joe just has to come up with a rad
for everyone not just something fun oh
so now he's just working on it it's like
I don't know what is your back into the
same point is if you don't like
something don't use it but don't
talk other people who use it that's
pointless that's a waste of your energy
that's a waste of our time and that's a
waste of everybody's life like you know
you could be doing other things if you
learned one line of Java code for every
stupid comment like that you left in a
freaking article somewhere you'd be able
to code your own android apps by now
think about that it's like table
Wednesday you having people internet
trolls as explained by Joe Hindy basic
to paste basic ways to be is the name of
his memoir with a theme tonight all
right love in we weigh more jos√© rent I
want to pull in one more question the
semi sort of relates so we're talking
about you know all of the various
options and stuff if you were to have a
base skin and then just apps upon apps
that you can pull in there's another
question here by kwadwo sorry if I got
that wrong but he's asking what we think
about the OEMs building region specific
devices for different areas of world as
a reviewer I hit it that's a freaking
God a normal idea all around I can't
stand it cuz i think his kind of
question is one of the ones i was gonna
was planning to possibly talk about and
i personally think look apple also
shitload the phone because they don't
make that money now guys samsung
releases five million phones every
minute and that's in one country in some
random part of the world god knows what
they do globally but if they released
maybe five phones I mean for samsung 52
least five phones in a single year would
be just five would be like praying for
whatever really it's just it's not gonna
happen it's unheard of but if they did
that how friggin awesome with their
phones be if they put the same amount of
money that they put into building five
million phones five different million
different models and just make five or
10 or even 20 because they're big
and like whatever and just limited
themselves their phones would be even
more awesome and I mean let's be frank
if your HTC sony i love you guys but you
really shouldn't be doing anything more
than two phones ago seriously 3353 phone
0 and no here it is ready the handheld
one the 4.3 the five-point oh and the
5.7 yeah we own it the junior the mid
and the senior arat well I it's a
horrible thing I that was wrong i'm so
so i'm gonna shut up now guys ya know
the small ones i did it this moment
agree with you guys french see I
actually disagree really it worked for
McDonald's in the french fries didn't it
three sizes that's it more talking
regions around talking sizes of thumbs
that's the point well then we don't have
rice joke southern Louisiana fries it'll
have India fries they don't have UK
fries they have fries in three sizes and
that's it well we have British chance
food and phones are two very different
things Joe ever figure this out well as
he's Charlie knows he's chomping on his
nexus 6 right now here's something that
we it's an extra so by the time is is he
brings in the latest and greatest phone
but it's a korean version or a chinese
version yeah it doesn't have the support
for the local networks I understand
that's frustrate you that's my main
grind oh you don't want it but you know
if it doesn't work in the region then
what's the point of shipping it
worldwide well I mean like to I get the
whole region specific and I mean you
could when we say global when I say a
global flagship I mean okay they're
going to release gsm version with
support for every network and I mean
it's not that difficult I mean I think
the mate seven works in just about
ninety-eight percent of gsm networks
around the world or something ridiculous
it's got support for everything then the
release of cdma version fed like 25
people on Android five people on verizon
you want to buy that phone if they call
ever and then they'll release and we're
talking if it as a windows phone on that
on a verizon anyway and then you've got
a one version for China so the same
model but region-specific only for a
technical purpose because like if you
look at HTC in the one m9 and I wrote
god knows what how many words on this
who the hell in their right mind
releases
One m9 for global and then goes oh what
a bit crap wasn't it so let's go on for
Asia only and this little country in the
middle of we're gonna downgrade the
processor but you know what we're gonna
do we're gonna just throw in a massive
better display I mean like or the dudes
j butterfly ya mean there's no need for
that Roberts just put it all into one
phone i see i can i agree with you i
want real quick backing up near obvious
point or novice point sorry no someone i
change it on my own before i was told
there so i can point damn it but now
this is exactly what sale at office
exactly it says yes this is what Samsung
does though you know they have like you
know they have the Galaxy S line there
are several variants of it to you know
coincide with the various areas around
the world that they have to cover but
it's still the galaxy s series loan you
know it you know um yeah they pick Alec
c5 I blah de blah and the I blah de blah
and then the I blah de blah t for the
t-mobile version and the I blah-de-blah
vie for the verizon you know version and
but it's the same phone it's the same
shell it's more or less the same
internals the only thing that gets
changed is what needs to be changed for
it to work in that region and thus you
know like the operating system the
features that they baked into it work on
all of them and that's okay I think
that's the right way to do it that's Joe
that's definitely kinda not the point
though because if you look at they're
all identically the same phone but I
might be guessing here but based on what
I think quadro was asking was about was
alright region-specific flagships to
that best compete with a competition in
those mac markets that doesn't
necessarily mean the same phone in
different regions it means it's a
specific handset so like the one m9 plus
is designed just for Asia I don't know
i'll just that as an example that is
what i was sure i know what i was aj
what if i just for japan makes no sense
to not at least make those i mean some
devices you can understand but like the
one end run I hate sorry HTC I'm not
just picking on you but it's the only
example that comes to mind bring that
one m9 pass around the friggin world
make a gsm global version of it and sell
it
and you probably sell some phones
silence but i cannot get me to do a
chirp trip there what happened there
Mike rod ma you next time you do that
there's a sign sir just do this with the
microphone there you go this thing on
the side of a microphone dropping is
this thing on I I can comply I can
completely understand why region well I
guess the term is not region locked
phones but region region based phones
have to be a thing is because well I
mean these manufacturers they need
because if we if we had phones that
worked globally and it first came out in
one place you know in the release cycle
then of course everyone around the world
could buy that supposedly and then you
know you kind of kill the carrier's you
know and stuff like that um out to the
carriers and the phone manufacturers as
well might one have might want to
control that particular ecosystem it's
just yeah you're right as a reviewer I
just don't like not having the full
experience on a phone and then I have to
do a review on it well that's uh I I
really think you know I think novel was
saying this to I think the question here
was more not like not like the Regents
specific like having different bands and
stuff I think what they were really
asking is more like region specific
variants you know like the j butterfly
is a variant for japan probably the
galaxy s you know five plus whoever was
called with the qhd you know for south
korea and without better processor I
think that's me I'm talking for sure you
know as we round up on let's say and
that guy I understand that edit
frustrates me at the same time cuz like
I could understand if I bought one m9
and all of a sudden you know one of the
things was qhd they decide not to do
well here's the phone with the same
exact specs and as qhd why couldn't we r
coming up on let's say another 90 minute
podcast for you guys this week I i do
want to explore this a little bit
further as we come up to our last let's
say I think we're up to maybe like ten
more minutes on this for a 90 minute yes
there are different variants for phones
and they are released in particular
regions but how about just phones that
are only released in one place
and I'm looking at you Japan I'm gonna
get you Korea um the DJ once the last
time you guys had fun in V in terms of
like what's released in other countries
that we never get here either in the
States or in no rafts case in the Great
Britain's OGG phrase sitting in the
states were you know deprived of some of
the phones that definitely didn't used
to be the way it was well used to be the
phone I be used to be huge for me I
remember seeing all these Korean phones
from like any calls whore or AA riya to
remember the name of some other one
southbank in Japan you know like the
rotating screen and it's a flip phone
what the hell like of course i was in
canada up until a couple years ago and i
was watching the states with with that
same NV where's all the good stuff it's
just half hour south of me up across the
border but where is it well what's the
big what was the big example for you at
that point like it really was a really
one big phone that just didn't come out
in canada for you let me go way back
when I was a youngster movie who went to
the theater about a week and a half
before they came out in Canada but but
anyways a lot of the phones you know
there's no specific example here just
again usually just a delay on the
release even that I'll bring up the
7-inch tablet game that Nexus 7 if i
recall correctly it shipped in the US
before it shipped in canada and i had to
do a lot of crazy stuff that i didn't do
and i would never admit to to get a
google voice number and that's not a
phone thing but but answer your question
specifically you know the first question
not the second one what would I envied
before what I envy now is a lot of day
at the shell may phones mmm yeah
definitely old I've been awesome I mean
we can import them into UK or like they
a sharp sharp spawns too yeah i know you
know i mean manish I short out of FATA
there the phone I cos you're talking
about that aqua thing that was only on
sprint yeah cuz that phone was actually
really ugly and hideous and terrible and
ugly well of course I know what it's
like here's somebody
summary of like am I alone right now I
think we're running out of steam guys
maybe just a little bit i mean we had we
had a very spirited conversation on a
bunch of different topics i think this i
think that's the main thing is like we
we were on like what question number
four at this point you know what I'm
yeah um I still get a live in King good
the window that was it five if you
include the window yeah I I never I
never not wanted to have a podcast where
we don't like check in with each other
at the beginning you know I think that's
not always gonna say oh yeah I think
it's a plus you know like this is one of
the few times we even get to let's let's
say hear each other's voices in real
time let's say rather than just in the
slack chat you know um as far as the
whole phone anything goes like I I don't
really have too many examples now but
there are so some phones that I wish
would come out here just to see what
would happen like LG made those they
have those crazy cartoonish phones that
came out like super high highly colorful
on the screen is on like a like a
Bunny's face when you take it out of its
colorful casing or something like that I
don't remember how exactly one but
something like that um I remember that
yeah yeah something to that effect I
can't remember if there's anything out
in Europe oh okay I got one the freaking
panasonic phone before the hell is that
about the CM one yeah I want that so bad
I'm not had one but the same person is
trying to sell me 14 times and they're
probably listening so if you are you
know who you are if there's between the
same handset has gone round like this
for different people round in a circle
and I mean it's available but i would
never spend a hundred quid up front I
agree with camera I agree on that but
it's a phony if that if that if that
camera is as good as their point shoot
line I'm all in and hopefully there's
some sort of developers great the phone
itself is rubbish well as I was going to
say if there's some sort of development
team or development community for it um
I I would just probably rom it to get
the features that I want I mean I don't
think that'd be bad because if I'm not
mistaken it has at least last year's
high-end specs that should still be good
for the next
you're so hopefully and I I think so
yeah yeah so now wasn't it that step
yeah 800 in a one I don't remember if it
was one of two and think do you know any
a huge risk to buy one device that
satisfies the two things we're gonna get
a camera and you already know this Josh
you've got lots of nice cameras just get
a nice camera and then get a phone that
you know it's just a phone which is
truly like it like upgrade either at any
time what do we try to be true and I
agree with you there but it's been a bit
of a it's been a huge revelation for me
to be able to go out like let's say I
have lately it's been the g4 but the s6
has been my main example this your fun
of it um I go out I don't want to carry
around a camera with me like usually if
I have a camera with me it has to be in
a bag and the bag itself is a bit of a
chore to have around all these places if
I'm able to take out my phone and it
takes a great photo and let's say video
if I want to do some vlogging I that
that's amazing to me I think this year
we've really hit a renaissance in terms
of quality not only in camera band
software and performance these phones
are really great I agree with that yeah
I mean it even have some we even have
some budget phones coming out with the
cameras like that alcatel it really
wasn't bad really really right on that I
don't know if anybody gets on Twitter I
I put up a picture of Michael Fisher
drinking a beer with the sunset um
that's the alcatel that's not even the
g4 and we were talking about the g4 when
I took that picture but I was like no I
don't wanna use a g4 because it doesn't
connect to LTE little bastard so I took
out the alcatel and I took a picture of
Fisher with that and yeah like it's got
a good response on Twitter already and
yeah that's the alcatel that's a 2 150
dollar phone for God's sake well I mean
like people say the best camera is the
one you have on you and you're right
Josh this is the finally the year that
that's not so much of a trade-off or
kind of a compromise back to what we're
talking about phone and we've really
quickly the phone i want is like a phone
that has an aerial not because you could
use it in the UK because we gave up on
any form of analog TV years ago but
because you want to pull it out and
right you can pull out the aerial and
then it remind you using these really
old phones from like the 80s and then
or in the 90s in my case they had a big
a droid big aerials we like going back
old school with the smartphone just for
kicks mmm like Josh with is a sliding
keyboard there oh man blackberry
keyboard I you know what I I apologize
to all of our viewers that I have not
done the follow-up I do still have the
tmobile g1 and or rather HTC dream as it
was called and fun as it was to to work
on that just trying to get it up and
running with current android ecosystem
has been the biggest nightmare ever not
necessarily from a user standpoint but
just from a logistical standpoint I've
been so busy with all these other
flagships not so I just haven't been
able to devote time to the gene was that
being said I do want to do a follow-up
eventually on it use it for like a solid
two weeks I I can't I can't I can't deal
I can't even with the the physical
keyboard anymore I can't do it the only
keyboard that I can really find my see
myself enjoying a lot of blackberry
keyboards at this point because this one
right here it's too squishy I just
cannot type fast on that thing at all
what about what about modern version is
something like the desires said that had
the slide-out full qwerty keyboard I
mean yeah it was like 14 millimeters
thick so it really thick and 180 gram so
it's not too heavy was that the Z hinge
one yeah yeah that was a HTC Desire Z or
sidekick it was the desire Zed over
there it was um the HTC g2 here oh yeah
that they owe it to Z henchman it's
thingy the thing is like I had one of
those that was smaller now this didn't
happen z huge this look like it was just
a straight slider it wasn't it wasn't
hinged in any way it was literally just
just slid out the bottom with a keyboard
I'll put a link in two SEC's well the UH
the thing is um thank you lord if they
were degree created they it has to be
somewhat close to a blackberry iteration
where everything's really close together
everything has a different feel because
yeah that just canada that you want we
are at the point where we're digressing
way to
much we've had we've had a really good
conversation here but yeah I think it is
time for us to kind of wrap it up we
covered a lot of topics on this
particular podcast kind of changing it
up a bit we can only think of everything
for so long we have let's say what were
the questions that we had talked about
the future of Android where to get our
podcast I mean if you're listening to
our podcast right now you probably just
got it so um let's see what else do we
have or some of that what we'll do the
questions we had we remember it's been
such a long talk we've had Oh region
region specific phones skinned Android
versus stock Android and even stock
Android in generals dog andrea in
general and of course the fitness
tracking question so come on engine

this one so we we don't know when we're
going to do another ask us anything but
