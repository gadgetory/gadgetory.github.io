original android hangout show on google+
I'm Derek Ross and I am Scotty Henderson
thanks for joining us again this week
dan Charlton and Johnathan Franklin we
love having you guys here always nice to
be here alright so a lot of stuff
happened this week in the world of
Android we're gonna talk about some
Android ecosystem stuff from stats and
numbers a little bit of Google+ stats a
whole bunch of Google Apps got updated
this week we're going to talk about some
OEM news we're gonna give away in
another ingress code and we're going to
talk about some carrier news t-mobile
made some interesting announcements
today as well as a few other carriers so
let's get started to talk about a little
bit of Android ecosystem news the google
play store got a private channel a
private section for those of you that
are using google apps so this is
specifically for corporate users or
enterprise users in the past it was kind
of clunky you know you maybe had to have
an internal store or you had to have an
alternate method to get your maybe
custom design you know retail
application or whatever you're using for
your you know for your business you
would have to go have go and have a
roundabout way to install those so
Google being the amazing company that
they are today we're going to simplify
this for you we're going to go after
business customers and we're going to
give you a private channel so now Google
Apps users can install applications
directly from the Play Store for their
own business and said now that's that's
huge really it is it allows for Google
to step into the enterprise and the step
into the corporate world a little bit
more where they Android really hasn't
had the greatest footprint for
management in the past yeah I mean
Google Apps is still you know not
obviously as prevalent as Microsoft in
the business world yet they made a huge
huge dent in education or a lot of
schools have moved to Google Apps for
Education most because it's free yeah
but this is also there for four
those accounts and so for schools that
are on that Sutter system students have
Google Apps accounts and so this could
be awake for the universities to sort of
distribute university-sponsored
applications that are only available to
students at that university so besides
universities for the corporate world
where you have you know certain policies
that you need to have a place in for
security and you know and mobile device
security because yeah you know a lot of
enterprises are moving towards a bring
your own device model so if you couple
an easy way to install apps on your
device with the already existing Google
Apps device policy app that's out there
yeah that's a very powerful tool I i
would i'd like to see a lot of
businesses start to you know to move to
that i'm i'm excited to see where this
is gonna go yeah yeah yeah i think
they're gonna use it a lot just to
strictly limit certain apps and just say
hey you can install these because
they're pre-approved and they will you
know be okay with our network and we're
good to go yeah so smoothies almost me
car system news let's talk about what
Microsoft did to contribute to the
Android ecosystem this week it done this
before yeah well wyckoff this
microsoft's currently on a smear
campaign towards android and google uh
you know they did the scroogled thing
resource kugel yeah yeah so so so this
week Microsoft or more importantly
Windows Phone took to Twitter and said
do you have an Android malware Horror
Story reply with hashtagged roid rage
with your best / worst story we may have
a get-well present for you basically
saying tell us how Android Mauer has
ruined your life and we're gonna give
you a brand-new Windows Phones most
likely if your horror story wins so
immediately everybody said hey cattle uh
how you doing I'm on the pot because you
know for how many years as Microsoft has
windows been plagued with malware so
immediately
social network Twitter Google Plus you
know blew up with the hashtag you know
windows rings talking about you know all
the bad things that you know windows
does or George or replying with the
hashtag that Microsoft wanted roid rage
but saying things like you know hey I
downloaded this android app it must be
now where it was called I know
outlook.com from the play store it's the
worst looking app I've ever seen he then
like you know no telling how many bsod
blue screen of death oh yeah I was rage
tweets to work you know saying hey no I
was I was trying to download an app from
the from the Play Store you know I'm
like oh my computer but it rebooted you
know like what's this blue screen all
about yeah like well it is a simple
application and it installed 47 bars on
my browser and they're all search yeah
they're all search bars were they like
I've got like a 10 pixel amount of
screen real estate after my toolbar
showed up so clearly question about the
UH the dog in the background was at you
I John I guess so would you find that
dog and make it it's my neighbor's dog I
can shoot it if I shoot but don't kill
her don't don't shoot to kill yes you
shouldn't need just issued to scare it
away yeah just gonna her than me to be
like it so just a little Microsoft
completely backfired like I swear they
got one or two I'll get the benefit
doubt i'm sure they got a couple replies
maybe not i personally have never heard
of a android malware horror story I'm
sure one exists out there there was some
story I heard about of some lady whose
child apparently had downloaded
everything in the play store that had
hello kitty in the title and so it
wasn't so much that it was actually
malware it was that she didn't know was
going on because her home screen was
just filled with all this hello kitty
because it was set to automatically put
midgets on the home screen there there
have been a couple people i haven't seen
really a lot of malware complaints as
much as i've seen people would like the
no
education adds them a lot of people with
that Rhoda Skyrim guides almost every
Skyrim like tutorial application which
had the notification spam and try to use
a lot of ads this probably been the
biggest complaint but I would really
love that in with malware yeah people
tend to not realize that there's a
difference chain malware and add
application to just add a Google is it's
malicious and google has one after the
developer saying this is not a good
practice at all this is not something
now we're evolving on somebody I saw a
hashtag droid rage it made me laugh
somebody uh somebody said I put I tried
posting my new Android malware
application to the google play store and
it was automatically redirected by
bouncer droid rage like we just dodged
we had a little bit more depth on that
story um they continued to provide steps
or Android horror stories step one wait
for your android phone to get infected
with mad work Matt malware step to
recovery from SMS scam bill shock step 3
skip steps 1 &amp;amp; 2 by a windows phone and
connect with people you care about
instead of some hacker plotting in a
dank base basement now wait Windows
Phone said this on Twitter yes this was
actually this was the precursor before
George rage yeah I think that says a lot
uh just based upon not medicine smear
campaign so much but recover from SMS
scam bill shock okay if you as a user
click on an SMS link the prophet
propositions valuable deals you just
need to have common sense and not have a
small I'm sorry but you do not it's
that's not Android you can find this SMS
scams on any letter that you have MS
yeah but has taken you know more
priority in that and trying to prevent
that from people that just don't really
understand it and they're putting the
block up which is nice it's a warning
saying hey this might cost you something
um yeah the right directs that's
that's a big forgotten but in their
target North American market
approximately three percent of users had
never been affected by malware on
Android yeah it's three percent i think
they kick down to like here I think the
grin and again around there in total
here so that would be progress I think
it kicked on a grand tough like
40-something applications on like during
the entire year last year so it's really
compared to a market that has like seven
hundred thousand applications that's not
quite at all so continuing on with
android fandom here those of you that
want to go to Google i/o you'll be happy
to know that the official dates have
been confirmed May fifteenth through the
17th so here there in a few more months
the next Google IL oh just look viewers
and listeners know we do have an ingress
invite to give away later in the show so
stay tuned for that so it's a month
earlier this year compared to last year
was that it was no the end of June do
you want 27th yeah so it's what 4-6
weeks earlier this year that was last
year so so we know what are we gonna see
we will see you know some more from
Android at home since apparently that is
now making a comeback after two years of
being hiatus is it I guess you know see
the next version android announced you
may be android 5.0 or who cares about
the version number could be version 4.9
doesn't matter you know we'll see you
know most likely key lime pie announced
which was teased this week via a cartoon
graphic so yeah there's a lot of them
you know it's way too early to even
speculate at this point but it's
exciting to know that iOS coming up yeah
i'm sure we'll see new devices because
what else is engaged the question is
what are they going to be i mean i think
they'll probably come up with some kind
of replacement or upgrade the nexus
second cuz that's what they did last
year but then i think they're probably
going to push into something like other
areas not the obvious smartphone it out
how about then that rumored 11.6 inch
touchscreen
laptop things like that Wow or
Chromebook chrome look well look I
wouldn't call it a Chromebook yet so we
don't know that's good i don't want to
push out something that's not a
Chromebook or a android tablet or in
android phone however there is rumors
speculating that google is talking to
suppliers in looking into having their
own branded 11.6 inch tablet with a
touch are not tablet up no book with a
touchscreen what they have been
submitting a lot of commits as far as
trying to get touch interface on the
chrome OS and they were all real house
soon so you know we can see some type of
marriage between Android and Chrome OS
and the near future who knows but it
lost speculation a lot of time to hash
things out and try to figure out what
the hell is gonna happen well I mean
this if you really think about it there
is kind of a merge going on right now um
they're engaged because you know all the
contents the same and i mean you pretty
much have everything on your phone as
opposed to on your Chromebook pretty
much movie maybe from a google apps
standpoint NE pas negating any birds and
cut the rope but you know i know because
i think one of the occupations one of
the applications we're about to discuss
a little bit later is a key to that too
so alright so let's a move on here let's
uh talk about some usage statistics here
you know it said beginning of a new
month therefore we have new use of
statistics for android no surprise fifty
percent of the market is still
gingerbread that's unfortunate as
gingerbread is old years old but hey it
it's slowly getting eaten away by ice
cream sandwich which is now up to twenty
seven and a half percent and jelly bean
which is trucking right along it near
seven percent yeah that's impressive for
jelly bean consider yes oh IC s was
jelly bean is moving a lot faster yeah
definitely definitely alright so let's
talk a android related news that's a
let's talk about some google
the stats it was released the other day
Scott okay so Google+ stats 500 million
upgraded users now the definition of an
upgraded user is they have an account
correct well it's somebody that my
greater their YouTube account over
there's baby that's that's associated a
google plus there's somebody that plus
but somebody that Plus Ones an account
on the Google Play Store a perm try Plus
Ones a nap it's somebody that Plus Ones
a website you know they may have created
a google plus account when they turn
their phone or tab one for the first
time that doesn't mean they're actually
posting but that comes you know that
comes next in the next one of the stats
then we add they announce 235 million of
those 500 million upgraded users are
active across Google not Google+ just
Google yes and those are the people who
r plus running things relatively
consistently not just oh I did that once
and sort of accidentally stumbled upon
this google plus upgraded account but
people who are actively plus wanting and
reading reviews on Google Play now is
tied into Google+ so anything that sort
of Google+ authenticated like that
that's these people yeah and then of
those 235 million the 135 million of
those are active on google+ so I like
those numbers and I think that you know
it's definitely growing and they're
releasing a lot more features and things
that we'll talk about a little bit about
you know that tie them in better and
although we don't know what's neat about
that hundred thirty-five million active
users in the stream it is twitter has
140 million so for argument's sake you
can just say that Twitter is has the
same amount of active users that Google+
those five million nothing and you can
make the argument that ninety percent of
Twitter are BOTS literally just riata
post links yeah yeah and that's
considered an active user that just auto
goes things and you can't auto post on
Google+
yeah so attend that 135 is publicly
active so somebody is active but always
just privately posting that is not
counted which I know there's a lot of
people to do that there's a lot of ugly
share two circles I get people to at
least five million to put on parity with
Twitter actually two or three of you
that I know that are probably watching
this year stuff to me right now all the
time is in limited posts Trevor oh there
is my DNA thing which will talk about it
all right so uh getting back to some
motifs some more stats I'd so our
Google+ released Google+ communities um
I just was introduced to this um Derek
you want explain it a little bit better
all right so this is my very quick and
dirty thing I mean most likely if you're
if you're watching this now you've been
playing with communities the past hour
or so and you realize that there's four
hundred and seventeen billion Android
communities already available and and
that that'll eventually we'd itself out
and you know you'll find your niche and
everything but so in my opinion this is
a definitely an opinion here Google+
communities are circles to point oh I'm
calling that phrase right now so
initially circles you know Pete in the
very beginning people really didn't what
you know to use circles for so we were
categorizing people on google+ um you
know hey you know dan post a lot of
about Android I'm gonna put him in my
android circle or I know he loves
Android and put me on my android circle
so I have all these people that I know
that love Android know they post Android
software on my android circle and that's
great and that's how I organize people
but for reading circles aren't that good
because Dan posts a lot of pop you know
politics dan post thought of anything
dan wants to including android so if i
click on my android circle i see all of
you the post your android stuff but I
also see your caturday and your ginger
Thursday and your whatever the hell was
you know waterfall Wednesday I mean I I
see everything and it has nothing to do
with Android but besides the fact that
you're in my circle about android so
circles 2.0 or Google+ communities
allows you to go to that android
community where you know people were
only talking about android only sharing
android posts and so forth and so forth
and there's you know as granular as you
want inside that community i can have
you know it may be people talking about
custom roms are talking about routing
and you know it's a forum it really is
but it's it's like a circle because you
can share directly to it so i think it's
neat I think it's gonna it's going to
create an entire new feel for for
reading you know google plus you're
going to have to have your circles are
going to be organization but for reading
you really not so much in my opinion
anymore going read by circles you're
gonna read by community i could be wrong
on that i have a circles three-point Oh
it'll be deep in even deeper into
Google+ communities so let's say I have
let's I have in my android circle 200
people and of those people um a hundred
people are you know they post and read
stuff in the android community okay if
you went to the android community page
show only people in your circles and you
got your stream right there right yeah
yeah yeahs to what though mm-hmm be nice
yeah i mean that seems like it could
just be a filter toggle on and off look
at circle don't know and then if you
want to be interested introduced to new
people they're talking about android
then you turn it off yeah very simple
easy way you can discover all you want
and you can just kind of stayed your own
things if you all go to a good friend
ctrl print yeah very true now i guess
the next question is how soon as
communities going to make it to the
mobile applications now just yeah until
you can really make it legit when you
gonna call that yet personally i think
that they need to focus on other things
for the mobile app like bug fixes and
stupid stuff that's happening but uh one
earnest rather hold it off baby yeah i
mean the reagan progress but it's just
not there okay so we had a huge update
for google now voice search updates um
first of all it's a lot faster you guys
agree with that speed increase to be
honest with their all these new card
additions and
voice editions what uh what phone were
using on um I'm using it on my HTC DNA
as well as the nexus 7 okay so that
might be why my galaxy nexus it's got a
lot faster compared to where it was oh
yeah seamless always fast on my Nexus 4
I didn't get to see it on my Nexus 4 10
to the week ago but let's get into these
updates here Scott so we had a lot of
new cards on the integration with Google
now is increasing at a very rapid rate
Google Goggles is going to die very soon
and I'll get to that I events nearby so
let's say there's a vikings game coming
up verse the Bears that's one of the
events you click on it and like local
bands that are playing um Oh what else
was in there I see tons of sports that
are up to that an hour and a half you
know two hour drive away because while
having too many local teams but yeah so
I see them all over a cards so how many
shows things like that I'm seeing around
downtown it's very it's very cool yeah
um and then suggestions to help you with
your research this is like you're doing
some research projects for school or if
you're just interested in something and
want to do research on it um kind of a
cool feature although the links do not
open on your desktop which is kind of
annoying um but they'll fix that um now
Scott no now let's say so you're
searching on your desktop right so
you're searching about something and so
suggestions to help you with your
research pops up on google now when
you're looking at your phone later and
you're out and about you click on the
link it opens up in chrome then when you
get home you use the little uh you know
other devices in chrome and bring that
in from your phone onto your desktop
computer yeah but if you share that link
to your desktop doesn't work okay I
haven't tried that yet another um
boarding passes from gmail um United
only um basically that's with a QR code
yeah yeah I'm lying here in a we
I'm not a baby I'll be able to tell I
don't even know if it's see now to get
honest I don't have my boarding pass or
anyone know what flood implying I want
welcome back it is United I'll test it
out that is a direct competitor with
apples passbook so it's kind of
interesting that they're just saying hey
we'll put that in our app in you know
will compete with you yeah do that you
know we don't even need to make a new
application a little system or own we're
just going to proof make it happen yeah
we're just going to pull it from gmail
and put it in something that is relevant
and is location searched and you know
time where um and then we have searched
by camera you can actually search our
museum shops pretty much anything which
is google goggles yeah it literally is
and in Google gah in Google now you can
just I in the search say scam and it'll
pop it up and it works just fine it's
kind of cool um yeah google goggles is
going to be gone here within i say six
months to eight months mark i think you
still have to keep it around for people
that aren't all i see is or jelly bean
above yeah every room yeah okay but but
but it's definitely getting created
entry into an existing platform because
we don't know Oh yogurt you know the
knowledge graph everything in me that is
an existing platform yeah um whether at
upcoming travel destinations I like this
I'm not necessarily for travel but like
when I'm going to be going to a
different city I guess you can call
traveling but for like a meeting it's
nice to see that its location aware with
where I'm going out to see yes here in
another month and it knows I'm traveling
based upon the email and hotel and the
flight emails I have you know so it's
gonna know I'm gonna be traveling and it
pops up and says hey Derek out in Las
Vegas it's gonna be XYZ degrees that's
gonna be great yeah and then approximate
monthly summary of walking and biking
activity so the walking activity we did
see it was orange around Halloween I I
believe um and I know they're gonna do
the member first it actually biking was
already in there as well if you if you
bike tour if you walk dear the pedometer
how do you do
coming if you bike or walk well oh my
gosh gasps I'm gonna guess without your
vest Walker but the slope deal with GPS
tracking your speed and the
accelerometer I assume okay intersect
yeah I mean your phone has all sorts of
those gyros and accelerometers and it's
a little it'll let you know I'm Obama um
and then another nice integration but
it's not there yet is birthday
integration from Google Plus now yeah I
haven't seen it if I pull it up right
now I guarantee you I have four or five
people's birthdays right now I've got in
your contacts just google plus they are
one hundred percent just in Google+ yeah
and that's what I'm saying it would be
nice to have my contacts that are not on
Google+ pulled in there as well my
calendar contact calendar yeah for
birthdays be nice they pulled everything
um cuz there's actually people who
aren't using their platform agreed but
okay maybe they'll force people just use
that I'm surprised they don't back-end
that data point with calendar them and
not with yeah but to Derek's point they
do want more people on Google+ so that
makes a good point right but the Google+
birthdays are already populated on your
calendar making that a better data
source since it encompasses all that's
on google+ plus other stuff it'll be
interesting to see where this goes they
could definitely pull it from different
areas okay ah Voice Actions got some new
voice actions you can post to google+
say poised to post to google+ and then
you know say whatever you want um that's
kind of nice now you can also say post
to twitter and it works you can also say
post to facebook it does not work so
apparently these are unsupported on
document features that are coming in the
future that's probably why it doesn't
work or because someone commented
earlier that that's because the facebook
app doesn't work it has a bug or does
sharing to it doesn't work too well or
something like that but post to twitter
if you have the official twitter app
installed it 100% works cool um and also
what's this song you can say
to find the song you hear the problem I
see with this it did work for me and
Derrick I know it didn't work for you
correct yeah I'll read about that in a
second you get the problem that I see
about this is let's say listening to
music how is it going to get your voice
while the music going and you're gonna
search for it because it's going to be
in the track and they're gonna pull the
you know music from behind and it's
gonna get all mumble jumble so I did I
see a pan on how loud your music is
Scott yeah I feel just shout at the
phone to get down purchase list if
you're holding your phone up saying
what's all is this then yeah you
probably need to turn down your music
okay first of all it that'd be kind of
cool if you're like at a concert
improper it is really really really loud
ok but so so let me talk about that so
yeah this came out what yesterday
afternoon I was like yeah slightly gonna
test it out what song is this boom
google search force closes huh what kind
of sucks try it again what song is this
in that just a minute just recycles the
prompt okay just writing in English yeah
well no so i keep saying you know what
song is this and in every single time it
either force closed or it cycled back
you know like it didn't even hear me um
and I talked to a few other people that
had the HTC droid DNA and it seems that
it is a HTC Sense issue and it's not
entirely a sense issue like it sense is
bad and stopping it isn't the fact that
sensor the current version of sense
doesn't include files needed to do that
so I start thinking that's like well
it's using google ears it's using you
know the sound search widget basically
to be able to do that so I side-loaded
the Google ears APK onto my phone I said
what song is this and and it worked last
night interesting then and then at some
point after some of the people that I
had talked to they had been contacted
HTC and Google I don't know if it was
because of them contacting them or not
but Google server side patched it that
now the HTC droid DNA it doesn't do any
at all it says uh this feature is not
supported on this device so because I
mean it / worked one hundred percent
fine if you side loaded the APK but not
everybody knows how to do that nor
should they have to do that so Google
did the right thing so their app wasn't
appearing to be broken they disabled
that feature server-side so even if you
do have the APK side-loaded it's not
going to work until until google changes
and on the back end saying these devices
are allowed to but i don't see them
doing that until HTC decides to push out
an update to include the Google rears
APK yeah that also means even if you're
running a custom wrong yeah yes yeah so
I was talking about people buy this at
all let's find Eric just run a custom
wrong I'm like well it's probably
looking at my build prop to see what
hardware I'm running and as soon as
Google now or you'll search sees that
I'm using this device that isn't
supported no matter what I'm doing to
make it supported by having the right
stuff installed it's not going to work
yeah so so what am I gonna get the
build-up prop to say I have a Galaxy
Nexus or something just so I can use
that feature that's what you'd have to
do you'd have to as long as your device
for quartz itself as being a droid DNA
it's not gonna work yeah yeah so I would
assume eventually that's going to be
fixed but I mean that sucks that's a
cool feature but you know what as long
as I when I'm running android 4.2 I have
a lock screen widget that is the sound
search which is how I had it on the
Nexus 4 before I sold it that's that's
great you know I don't need to yell at
my phone what song is this I can just
flip to the widget hold the phone up and
good to go I mean the better solution
might have been to just push that APK as
a standalone app on the market that
actually is a great idea have it be an
installable app google ears a new google
apia and a fad if that can be done like
that and that would be great i think
that that's actually the easy solution
right there google bunny ears um ok
moving on google voice had an update it
fixed the delayed SMS notifications and
it fixed the inbox sinking in
duplicate notifications thank God it was
fixed it it was terrible for the last
time since I used I gotta know I get a
notification that have like a 180
something text messages from someone so
what we get from this is we know that
they get the bug reports and they get
the feedback so they're listening but
there is not implementing what we're
asking they're just fixing things so add
some other app updates uh you know I
said this this week was a google app
update not nothing uh nothing really
major besides what we talked about a
Google Authenticator had some but bug
fixes and UI improvements I didn't
notice anything boom you know um you'll
translate that's minor updates yeah no
minor updates you can now translate text
with your camera they took it before
then they got mom more languages ah I
think YouTube for Google TV had an
update no no updated changelogs we don't
really know exactly what but hey it's
probably bug fix my or improvement
whatever you know we like we like to
minor improvements that's fine Dropbox
you can move files and folders that's an
awesome update something that was
lacking on before also performance
improvements chameleon launcher Victor
des hommes put up a I think 25 they're
looking for 25 beta testers for their
phone application there and they already
have all them all the testers right now
um but I'm kind of excited to see well
they do this in future updates before we
get us think yeah it should be
interesting I mean I think they really
hadn't gotten the third party
involvement in the the widgets that they
really need and I think being tablet
only is limiting for that so hopefully
going to the phone little things move
along phones are definitely a bigger
pieces apply as far as getting adoption
so yeah and uh going back to google
voice eric hoffman doesn't make a good
point he says that they think he thinks
that they're in a fixed mode only
because they're working on their
consolidation of coming
gation apps into one which I really
really hope so Eric I really hope so I
think that's probably what you want to
see yeah I hope a lot of time and
development is going into that it's just
it's definitely a problem yeah uh gmail
you got a rather nice update for ice
cream sandwich and up you get autofit
messages to screen and you got message
zooming swipe messages to archive or
delete you can specify what you want to
do in settings and the general settings
I could attach photos and videos from
within gmail larger photo previews which
is nice because you can actually tell
tell what a photo looks like um and
gallery view for photo attachments just
like you would see in the gallery app it
looks exactly like that for the
attachments and then bug fixes
performance improvements for android to
not to and up I get new label API for AP
is for third-party app developers and
performance updates good update what you
guys think data I haven't found the
zooming toward the bench to zoom it only
works on html5 if it's an image then
you're not going to zoom in on it
because a lot of like a lot of my
verizon emails and stuff will actually
be a just a gigantic picture yeah you
can't zoom in on that okay so it's not
just me um wasn't that all it's an
update for beautiful widgets no jelly
bean compatible and lock screen widgets
yeah Tasker got on Tom so I not Tasker
tasks uh by the tasks team got updated
to allow 4.2 lock screen widgets as well
and that that's awesome i put them on my
Nexus 7 and it works well ya know
they're really nice job if you're not
familiar with this app I shared it uh
maybe even today when they updated the
app it dumb it's a very clean holo light
holo UI and it integrates 100% syncs
with google tasks and said it's very
clean very simple you
should check it out they have a free
version and another version to cost 99
cents enjoy developers featured them six
months ago or so I said Google made a
task app that's exactly what it would
look at before light because the money
so let's let's talk about some device in
OEM news here real quick so no surprise
the nexus 4 keeps selling out and LG
says because there's a huge demand
though their don't want to tell us how
much demand that is they're not good as
in this house yeah they do also mention
the fact that you know they have to
supply too many different brick and
mortar you know companies and you know
so the demand is spread but they said a
large portion of that is from the Play
Store and I can't you know I mean that
makes sense because it was a release
their first so well head it was cheaper
there than anywhere else kind of moron
goes in case four hundred dollars per
phone that you can get over there for
three hundred dollars very true problem
as you can't get it over there so it
worked out well for people selling it
for 400 yeah and then I Qualcomm is to
bring low low cost low power NFC chips
next year hopefully and if you're low
pile I'm confused about the low-power
NFC though so NFC now uses more power
than it's not something that's very low
power this next generation a chip is
shrunk down from 4228 nanometers so
right there you're saving a lot of power
oh we're talking about extremely low
power versus pretty much you could run
it off of rubbing a sock a pair of socks
together wait well with at me three
hydrogen next version of android
charging around rubbing sauce powered
gotcha static pass static electricity
powered versus battery-powered yeah yeah
I'm talking about dropping it down to
connect snuffing power which means that
you can have NFC base stations that are
just running on like a watch battery
yeah and really live that your checkout
counter and the big news really about
this is is the low cost
because a lot more phones not just the
the you know high-end phones but a lot
of the lower end phones will adopt this
because it won't cost that much to
implement it so Google's push for NSC I
like it and this will definitely open up
space saving is a big argument too
because you know even you take a phone
like the iphone 5 with are crammed in so
much stuff in there when do you put an
extra transceiver in there that's also
you know probably a reason why they
didn't put it in FC radio and they start
40 nanometers for it mmm so you strike
it down a bit a little bit it opens up
some flexibility or you can just you
know save space and decide you want to
put a bigger battery or whatever yeah I
mean that that argument doesn't carry as
much weight when they're making no I see
but with every other component you start
adding it up so let's get to a little
bit of LG news here and galaxy tab news
then we'll talk about the ingress invite
here um to last little bits of OEM news
device news this week we had some leaks
and who doesn't love them some leaks
Daniel talk a little bit about this s4
processor uh that was leaked to become
it with the LG so all we know is that
it's called the LG e960 for AT&amp;amp;T it's
got the same s4 pro that's in the
optimus G and Nexus 4 let's go scream
right and it's gonna have a lot of
Marvel collect an 80 screen which I
suspect is in the 5 inch range ah so
it's gonna be a little bigger than the
GAO msg or the Nexus but it all to be
1080 like the droid DNA so no idea when
that's coming out or you know anything
more than that really um and then the
galaxy tab 2 10.1 is finally getting
jellybean 4.1 point
one so only slightly behind but better
than the ICS had yesterday alright and
the last little bit of information here
the galaxy tab 2 10.1 is finally just
jelly oh ok so that was a pay attention
be honest with you is knows talk to my
wife you know I was telling her
goodnight ok so the moment you've all
been waiting for the ingress invite code
um we're just good we're just going to
do this and cause a whole a whole bit of
frenzy here so each week we do a little
bit differently give the ingress invite
code way this week is actually thank you
to Scott Anderson he's given he has an
extra code to give away so thank you
Scott so we're gonna do is if you're
watching on YouTube you're watching on
my reshare Dan Scott's whoever
somebody's reshare will give you a few
seconds here to go ahead and go to the
android authority post the original post
and while you're viewing that original
post you want to scroll down to the very
last comment because i'm going to post
the ingress code there wow you're going
ahead and finding the original post
those of you that are already there I
want you to pull out your Android phone
or tablet whatever you're going to use
or Jordan Dirk's or the HTC droid DNA
and open up your anger SAP and go ahead
and go to the enter passcode the enter
activation code screen and I'm going to
copy and paste this in there and you
guys can fight over it and uh congrats
to one of you lucky winners and I just
ask that you please let us know who you
are so we can congratulate you as well
so people can be people can be upset
with you that you want and they didn't
so the big question is is are you going
to join the resistance or are you going
to join the enlightened let us know
alright so I'm going to put the code in
there everybody should be everybody
should be waiting for it
and refresh your engines now start
mashing that f5 like you're buying the
nexus 4 or you're getting the new
communities on google+ so i'm assuming
right now you guys are frantically
typing that code in Y for f e kz6 g
congratulations to the lucky winner for
ingress let us know if you're a member
of the resistance if you think XM is bad
for Humanity and the shapers are bad or
if you are the enlightened than you
think that this is the evolution of
humanity then to death or if you will
you're one of those people that just
want to get invite because you want to
sit yea orsa oh yeah you just you just
want to invite so you can say you're
cool you know all right so uh just like
about some carry your news dan since
your rock and timo I want you to talk
about some some TmoNews for us yes so
they have been rolling out hspa+ on
their pcs their 1900 megahertz holdings
so updating basically from 2g to 3g
which you know sounds silly winner it is
moving to elderly but the the background
information on that is that they're
building the LTE support they just
haven't sort of turn it on and enabled
it yet they're now up to 18 markets that
they've pushed it pushed out hspa+ over
pcs so that's 18 markets that the iphone
will get high-speed hspa+ on t-mobile
instead of getting slow speed edge on
t-mobile ah and speaking of the iphone
t-mobile is apparently going to start
selling apple products in 2013 as well
because they want more market share and
they are losing the battle yeah yeah
yeah I'm not saying they wrong with that
you gotta do a float you know nominal
although the executives have also said
that this is a their deal with Apple is
a deal unlike what anybody sort of
expects it to be and since on a way to
sort of is hinting that they got a very
favorable deal so it sounds much more
like t-mobile is new t-mobile's been
planning under
in the spectrum reframe a lot of people
trying to pitch it is this is what
they're doing it just to get the iphone
but realistically they're doing it so
they don't have to carry a 2g network
around anymore because you know we're
all rolling out LTE who wants to be
dragging this edge network around I
think the apples partly not really in
this big of a piece of place of leverage
like they were when they only tried
negotiating with verizon and you look
exactly it's Sprint's been a ton of
money trying to get adoption and it
helped them a little bit but I don't
even know if they've recovered the
initial investment they won't until like
2015 and are planning to and t-mobile's
not ready to take that kind of a hit and
so they're I mean they're in a position
where they can say you know what we
already have a million iphone
subscribers that's two percent of all t
mobile subscribers are using unlocked
iphones they're upgrading the network
either way so you mean they can very
much you just go bulk buy iphones from
directly from apple like any other
consumer and then resell them and cost
as unlock devices so Apple really just
doesn't have the bargaining power
against t-mobile that they used to so
yeah they're getting the they're getting
the iphone but yeah it's it's sort of as
a fringe oh yeah we can now support the
iphone you know uh AT&amp;amp;T is planning to
roll out LTE uh and fans yeah 13 yeah so
I mean you see that article bumper Eisen
and there are speeds that they were
testing and theoretically with their
like 500 mega bits like that's
ridiculous oh yeah no LTE advanced is
substantially faster it's also worth
noting that's what t-mobile is planning
on rolling out like in the first place
okay so I time I'm freaking excited
about it oh yeah I just that means
people once they were all out there LTE
is they're going to have hspa+ 42 as
their backbone so not falling back to
cdma like you do on verizon or to a
teenage comparatively slow hspa+ or to
sprint cdma but falling back to 42
megabit
hspa+ and then on top of that you get
lte-advanced that already has built in
all of the support for transferring
voice calls handoff directly from voice
over LTE to hspa+ to gsm I really really
really hope this type of technology
shakes up the data costs um but I can
also see it as they them keeping it the
same and just taking advantage of a
businesses why do you use an expensive
landline now oh we have the same speeds
if not better and you can be mobile
while using it well I see that you know
them making a lot of money off
businesses in regards to that oh yeah I
mean you're still gonna have problems
because there's still you know very high
usage people that just can't afford to
drop down to a five megabyte gigabyte a
month like the limit that they can
afford really I use anywhere from one to
two hundred or even three or four
hundred gigabytes of traffic a month on
my computer I can't like I couldn't
possibly afford a verizon LTE plan that
do that I don't think verizon if you had
the people that do landlines I don't
think they have enough spectrum to
honestly support that like a landline
and not anywhere near that to be it
would be great for mobile businesses
that likes constitutive of the
construction science and places like
that would be continuous pretty cool and
pretty much kill your home I mean onto
your own business end process I haven't
have yeah and think of pushing that to
be in your battery couple minutes but
yeah um AT&amp;amp;T also added six more LT no
markets they're playing catch up very
slowly but slowly but surely I always
you know that and this is LTE towers
that they're running out rolling out dan
those can be upgraded to lte-advanced
pretty easily is it brand new hardware
yeah okay yeah they are building day and
Verizon both are building on release 8i
the first release that is considered
lte-advanced is
10 that's what team levels rolling out
sprint results using 8 I think I came
over with verizon or sprint that's been
some other things to take some parts of
the further up releases out of it um but
ya know they're all gonna have to do
actual physical hardware updates at all
of their sites ok it'll might be it
might be more or less a firmware update
but it means going to every tower and
physically making changes there at the
power so ultimate ultimate lemoore
investment for the upgrade as opposed to
a simple switch yeah ok so slower all
wrong yeah yeah where's Brent sprint
with their network vision has planned
ahead in a way that makes it very very
easy for them to make those kinds of
changes because they have a very modular
sort of structure to their network now
and t-mobile in contrast is just going
straight to the higher release so why
not US cellular is testing voice over
LTE yeah there's been a lot of
speculation that that's very bad for
battery life yeah I saw some studies
don't know it and it didn't look very
good no I mean it's not surprising using
LT your young builder I mean it's very
young so I mean yeah I mean it's not
surprising that voice over LTE is is
battery intensive because anything else
ever LTE is battery intensive currently
um are they when they're testing I
haven't looked a lot into it but are
they using a higher I'm sure they're
using a higher bandwidth with America's
one of the big marketing pushes for
voice over LTE is getting a clarity yeah
I'm all better clarity and over our
slider a typing side plate 256 kilobytes
ow that's nothing for an LTE network
yeah that's this so i would i would
imagine that in order to get the audio
quality up you don't need to push the
bitrate that much so it wouldn't really
be that much of a data intensive there
would be no reason to pull a can make a
bit or a one- you know bandwidth for a
you know voice line you know send a WAV
files over threat i mean you wouldn't
even video chat yeah that's true
on the dish is rumored to cell phones at
blockbuster yeah we heard rumor don't
understand that at all well dish is
continuing to try to get into the mobile
market I don't really know how they
expect to sell phones at blockbuster
though that's so strange more power to
them but I'm sing like one blockbuster
store and the last year yes I've singles
SQL than saying this because Italy
knowledged I think black monster is
gonna see its its end before the end of
2013 mark my words okay Dan eat your
time to rage you love raging so later I
do so there's been tons of articles in
the news but lately about this android
engagement problem how android users
don't use their browser because android
devices are just so complicated because
you know apparently using a browser is
hard to do it's difficult on android
because it's more android e unless
browser either than anywhere else I
don't know the bottom line with this is
well everybody is freaking out about how
oh man android has so much more market
share and so much less browser share
what's wrong why don't people use their
android devices what they're not
following up on that is android users
use more data so clearly they are using
the internet more they're just not using
the browser so if you're using your
facebook application for example and not
facebook com in the browser that would
be you using your device but not
browsing well that's another big problem
every every browser on iOS reports as
being iOS every browser on android does
not record as being android the stock
AOSP android browser does some OEM
replaced browsers will Chrome for
Android does not firefox for android
does not I don't know about dolphin and
opera I think opera actually just
reports generically as being WebKit
which then usually gets reported as
being Safari I mean they're in the
amount of browsers that there are four
android is ridiculously awesome because
people have so much choice and it's so
hard to compile all that data of so many
different types of have a lot of those a
lot of those Android browsers report as
being iOS and then a lot of them refers
being a desktop browsing client plus
Android browsers will let you actually
actively go in and change your browsing
clients you can switch between iOS
Android desktop and various others so
you know i would say probably half of
android devices aren't reporting as
being Android devices when they're
browsing I think another thing they're
taken to account of some of the
restrictions because apple doesn't allow
you to do things like it out purchases
so if you want to buy a kindle book you
have to log on amazon.com and go buy
your book and then open up your
application to sneak out whatever book
you just purchase and although it's just
like Amazon are forcing you to go
through the browser do it because
they're don't want to get Apple a kind
of the sale or you have to do certain
things if you want to share a news
article with an application that's not
baked into apples hard coding you have
to open in a web browser you have to
copy the link and you're going to home
and you open up app and make a post from
there she said I'm just hating a share
intent and so much stuff that you have
to do through the browser and iOS
because you can't just do it natively
yeah whereas an Android you can let one
application talk to another application
you don't have to go through the browser
that's a lot bigger usage scenario that
I think a lot of people take into
account because most most people just
you know most people on the phones are
there reading news articles they're
reading books or managing media or you
know shopping that's about the extent of
what the average user does yeah I think
about that that's really good really
good claim I well I think that about
does it for this week um I know that
last week we didn't have a SoundCloud
posted or audio posted apologize for
that we had some technical difficulties
um large part was Google was lying it
behind but
you know to get by that um so if you
guys want to not view us on YouTube you
can always download our podcast on
soundcloud which actually they just
updated their mobile app looks a lot
different so if you use soundcloud to
listen to our podcast it's pretty cool
