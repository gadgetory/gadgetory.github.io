handy the Android authority app guy do
you like watching TV and movies I know I
do and in this video we'll show you some
of the best TV and movie apps for
Android first on our list is Flixter
back in the day this used to be a movie
info application that provided info
about new movies and theater locations
it is since expanded to include
streaming movies there is a large
selection and it should work on most
devices getting it set up is the tricky
part you'll need an ultraviolet account
with the same credentials as your
Flixter account to get movies you must
buy them from ultraviolet and they'll be
made available for you on Flixter aside
from that annoying setup process this is
a solid way to watch some good movies
next up is HBO GO while most of the apps
on this list cover a wide range of
content HBO GO is dedicated to streaming
just content from HBO this is great if
you happen to have HBO on your cable or
satellite plan and you want to watch it
with your Android device if HBO didn't
have a bunch of great programming this
app would probably be a bust
however with the app you'll have access
to current hits like Game of Thrones as
well as other stuff like the latest
louis c.k stand-up and a host of movies
if you have HBO on your TV service this
is an app you cannot miss out on it
would be downright negligent of us not
to include the stock Google offering for
TVs and movies you can get TV and movie
streaming via the Play Store with the
Google Play movies &amp;amp; TV app you can rent
and purchase movies and TV shows off of
the Google Play Store and then watch
them with this at the selection is
pretty good and we didn't have any
problems getting movies to stream so we
consider this a fairly decent offering
you won't get the peace of mind and
finality of a pay per month service but
if there is something you have to watch
right now this is a great way to do it
also any movie you purchase or rent is
viewable with your YouTube account on
your computer obviously Netflix is going
to be on the list aside from being among
the most popular it's also among the
most highly rated streaming apps and by
far one of the most trusted people were
using Netflix long before it was
available on Android on their computers
their Xbox 360s
and other devices Netflix has a lot of
content pretty much anything you want to
watch really the newest stuff requires a
waiting period which is really one of
the few things that puts it behind the
competition while you wait there's
plenty of shows and movies from all
sorts of genres that you can watch our
last app on the list is called us TV and
radio it's a free streaming service that
offers United States television stations
and radio free
charge it doesn't have the professional
set up that many of these applications
have but it does work most of the time
there are pros and cons to this app
sometimes the feeds are offline and you
can't watch that station other times the
station may not exist because they
requested that they be taken off the
list for the rest though it works fairly
well and since it's free to use with an
optional paid upgrade the issues are
something most people are prepared to
deal with if you look at our leaderboard
you can see how these applications stack
up against one another as per the norm
these apps are rated by you the user and
not by us so there is no bias on our
part we do have a much longer list of
honorable mentions than usual they
include jet flicks Hulu Plus NHL
GameCenter YouTube Vudu and Miro TV
these apps aren't necessarily bad but
they are either too niche to be on the
list or have one or more big issues that
prevent them from being really good
YouTube is a special case because if the
mobile app had all the features of the
desktop website it would be on this
leaderboard because you can't view paid
movies and TV shows from the mobile app
though that means you can only really
use it for web specials and smaller
productions if we left out any good
streaming apps feel free to tell us
about them in the comments also a big
hat tip goes out to Android authority
feature writer Nate's huan'er who let me
borrow access to his Netflix and HBO ago
accounts so I could review them properly
