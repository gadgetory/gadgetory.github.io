from android authority what's going on
everybody and what we have here is the
samsung galaxy s4 and we're comparing it
to about as many phones as we possibly
can in a little time that we have on the
floor and right now you're seeing the
google nexus 4 as you can see right here
so the google nexus 4 at one time was
the most powerful device in the at least
certain of benchmark tests like the
antutu benchmark however as you're going
to see right about now as i open up NT
to benchmark you're gonna see some very
very different scores now so what you're
seeing is an in the samsung galaxy s4
you have an incredible twenty five
thousand nine hundred score with these
compared to the 17,000 that is on the
nexus 7 i'm nexus 4 rather and in antutu
benchmark what you saw in the past was
that and you can even see here on the
nexus 4 that it has been eclipsed before
it and the optimus G which is
essentially the same phone we're at the
top right near the 20,000 mark but now
the 20,000 mark has been broken so on
top of all that however you do have what
we found earlier using geekbench to on
here is that there does happen to be a
Qualcomm processor in clocks in at one
point nine gigahertz and it looks like
the ARM version seven compare that
however to the Snapdragon s4 pro
processor that's found in here and
you're going to see that it looks like
the processor in here is a much more
powerful package not just by the score
but by what we know of it so far it can
be different once the retail versions on
this phone or release but we're not too
sure about that but as you can see even
if this is not the processor that will
come in the end it's a very powerful one
indeed as far as the field goes the
nexus 4 does have the glass all around
and if you were worried that the samsung
galaxy s4 was going to have a very
plastic you feel like all of the
previous phones seem to have had they've
changed it up because now you have a
polycarbonate material that is found all
the way around the phone
and it is a very very nice feeling phone
indeed it kind of it almost kind of does
have that that plastic feel to it but it
does feel a sturdier it's like easier to
use and also it's at only 130 grams it
is one of the lightest and newest phones
that are going to find so you are also
seeing an accessory on here it was
called the S view cover it allows you to
see certain things through the flap
right here but also when you open it up
you know it wakes up the screen so
that's just a quick comparison of the
samsung galaxy s4 to the Nexus 4 by
Google by LG or Google that is so we're
here live at the launch event for the
samsung galaxy s4 and we are going to
continue bringing you all of the
possible coverage we can regarding this
new awesome phone so the structure magar
from android authority and remember to
stay tuned because we're your source for
all things andrew</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
