we're live on the ground in Eva Berlin
we're taking a first look at the galaxy
note 2 really really impressive device
beautiful thin profile just looking at
it and to to benchmark here out of the
box for having a score of 13513 really
impressive score for a non overclocked
device internally we have a 1.6
gigahertz quad-core exynos chipset SOC
is also packing two gigs ram it's going
to come in a 16 gigabyte 32 gigabyte and
64 gigabyte flavors it also has a large
3100 MLM battery obviously the hallmark
of the note is the fact that it's a very
portable device but it's also very large
really good for consuming content
they're focused a lot on the software
they spend a long time talking about the
different s-pen functionality and how
they're opening up their sdk to
developers for a lot of third-party app
integration but it seems to be extremely
responsive the initial issue that I had
with the original Galaxy Note was that
it actually kind of stuttered you know
it's got a 1280 x 800 resolution display
but it was only the dual core i'm sadly
just not powerful enough but it seems
like basically this is an enlarged
version of the s3 now then the actual s
pen itself is fatter if you take it away
too far from the device the actual
Galaxy Note 2 will let you know that it
is going away it has a rubberized tip on
the end yeah anyway this is just a first
look and get this inside doesn't matter
this is just a first look at the Galaxy
Note 2 from Samsung here and we're
really liking what we're seeing we're
obviously going to have one for review
we're given went away so enter our
contest and yeah any other points I mean
it's just a 5.5 inch panel it is a
little bit larger than the original
Galaxy Note not so much in terms of form
factor but the screen itself is more
substantial they've done a really good
job of minimizing the bezel
yeah a lot of good stuff going on here I
think that this will probably be likely
be one of the best selling Android
phones of 2012 and beyond anyway guys
this is a galaxy note 2 here my name is
Darcy with android authority just
reporting in for you guys yeah we're
gonna find out more about this soon so
thanks for checking in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
