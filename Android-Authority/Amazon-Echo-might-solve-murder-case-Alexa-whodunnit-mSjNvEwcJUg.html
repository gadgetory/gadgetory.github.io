echo right that's Amazon's answer to the
personal assistant for your home
well Amazon echo may help police solve a
murder case I don't know if that's cool
or scary Victor Collins lay there facing
down in James Bates hot tub strangled
and drowned what started off as a group
of friends watching a football game
turned into a brutal murder and there
may have been a female witness to the
scene in this case that female is Amazon
echoes Alexa according to authorities
Bates invited Collins and two other
friends to his house for a football game
Collins was found dead in the morning
strangled and Bates's hot tub and Bates
was consequently charged with
first-degree murder
Bates claimed that he had gone to bed
around 1:00 am leaving Collins with the
two other friends
Owen McDonald and Sean Henry but it was
later confirmed by McDonald and his wife
that McDonald had left Bates and Collins
around 12:30 a.m. okay now just get to
the part about Amazon echo well the
interesting part here is that Bates had
a few Internet of Things devices around
his house including the Amazon echo
police records showed that the Amazon
echo may have been used to control music
and that Alexa may be a key witness to
this crime
technically the Amazon echo has seven
microphones that are always listening
listening for your wake up command rock
music this means that police could use
the data to see whether it recorded
anything from the night of the murder
accordingly police have issued a warrant
to Amazon asking for the said data in
order to help prosecute Bates
but Amazon is reluctant oh yeah for sure
and Amazon said this quote we will not
release customer information without a
valid and binding legal demand properly
served on us Amazon objects too
overboard or otherwise inappropriate
demands as a matter of course however
the echo device has been seized by the
Bentonville Police and although it's
unclear whether Alexa will speak as to
what may have happened that night this
is just one example of how internet
connected devices around us
may one day become a key component in
solving crimes now I know some of you
are thinking this is a great opportunity
for Amazon echo to provide the
information necessary to prove this
man's guilt or innocence case closed
wonderful no not so much no my friends
it is a slippery slope and the history
of law enforcement has told us that if
law enforcement has the power to use
this type of data for this information
then they can and will use it for other
types of information that was not
originally intended when they made the
new law to adapt to new technology right
I mean RICO cases is a really good
example for those of you who are too
young to know years ago in the 80s the
FBI created something called the RICO
this was a new law that allowed FBI and
other law enforcement agencies in the
u.s. to charge one member of a criminal
organization a gang or mafia or whatever
and then immediately arrest and charge
the rest of the members of that gang
even if they didn't have evidence to a
specific crime being a member of that
game of that gang was crime enough and
they could be charged and put into jail
for a significant amount of time they
were called RICO cases case in point the
FBI and other law enforcement agencies
took the RICO law and used it for other
things that were not directly related to
organized crime
real big infringement on human rights on
our privacy and it's scary because if
these devices are everywhere picking up
information and law enforcement can tap
that that's a real big slippery slope
you will have no privacy not even in
your own bloody bedroom what do you
think about that are you worried about
it I think you should let me know what
you think in the comments below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
