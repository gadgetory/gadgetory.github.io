drone action and they even give it a
cool name project sky bender many of us
tend to take the internet for granted
but according to internet live stats
only about forty percent of the world
has a reliable internet connection we
all know that it is in Google's best
interest to have us all in a fast
reliable internet connection this was
the inspiration behind Project loon
which aims to bring internet to
underdeveloped areas through floating
balloons that would communicate to the
ground but Google is not stopping there
a new report from the Guardian swears
that the company has been working on a
new movement that goes by the name
project sky bender the idea is similar
to Project loon with the only main
difference being that this time they are
using self-flying solar drones and
millimeter wave technology it said that
this technology will power 5g networks
and it has the capability to transfer
gigabytes of data yes plural per second
beating current 4G speeds by about 40
times according to the report google has
rented Virgin Galactic's 15,000 square
foot hangar space for a thousand dollars
a day that's still a bargain located in
New Mexico near a town called get this
Truth or Consequences what a name for a
town this is where Google is holding all
of its tests sadly Google had promised
not to take any photos inside the
building so we won't be looking at any
of the goodies anytime soon now let's
take a look at the possible renders of
the s7 and s7 edge thanks to a new pair
of leaks by Evan Blass aka evleaks we
have possibly the first press renders of
the new devices now it's not without
some degree of skepticism for there's at
least one questionable detail in the
photo this picture here presents the
most plausible possibility of being
photoshopped note the presence of the
fingerprint sensor home button
especially on the Galaxy s7 left the
shape clearly looks too formed along the
bottom portion in addition the home
button on the Galaxy s7 edge on the
right looks to be tilted slightly
downwards it's also worth pointing out
that the front camera sensor on the
Galaxy s7 edge looks somewhat larger
than
a dozen the s7 now this picture here
which ironically looks to be captured by
an HTC device no less claims to be the
front display panel of the galaxy s7
despite the fact that it's encased in a
protective shell which Sam mobile has
referred to as a camouflage unit to
prevent leakage of the final design but
there's two points that are really
important here first the top bezel looks
to be quite tall almost unnecessarily so
and second the home button / fingerprint
sensor looks slightly misaligned and
seemingly much larger and rounded than
the thin rectangles which have been seen
in earlier leaks now again this is a
prototype assuming it's a genuine image
to begin with the final model may look
indeed quite different speaking above
bevels let's talk about a rumour device
that is almost bezel less the Xperia c6
a high quality render of Sony's
unannounced xperia c 6 smartphone has
been released by a reliable tech leaker
on leaks just like the c5 ultra the new
experience c6 is expected to have a near
bezel lyst display which would
definitely help this device stand out
from among the crowd on League says that
the image was constructed based on the
phones factory schematics not much else
is known about the experience c6 but
rumor has it that sony's upcoming device
will run an octa core MediaTek Helio p10
chips at under the hood clocked at a
cool 2 gigahertz there's another rumor
which says the experience e6 will have a
1080p resolution display while the
display size may be anywhere from five
to six inches thanks for watching and
droid army my name is Jace love to
connect with you right here on Twitter
you also don't forget about my brothers
and sister and Android who were working
super hard to be your source for all
things and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
