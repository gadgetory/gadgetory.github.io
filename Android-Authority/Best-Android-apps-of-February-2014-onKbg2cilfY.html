Hindy the android authority app guy its
nearing the end of february2014 so it's
time to step back and take a quick recap
of all the awesome applications that
were released this month even though
medical apps aren't all the rage we
found that we really liked the aad ii
diabetes goal tracker for those who are
new to the disease or if you just need a
place to organize your information this
is a good app to try out it focuses on
setting and keeping goals and if used
properly it has the capacity to really
help those struggling with the disease
the interface is a tad outdated but it
is still quite usable and it is free to
use blink is a new messaging application
that focuses on privacy and since
privacy is a big concern right now with
the whole NSA thing we thought this app
belonged here it has a more mainstream
design which sets it apart from most of
its competition it also has most of the
features of your standard messaging
services including privacy features like
off-the-record chatting and self
destructing messages it's free to use so
it's definitely worth a look if you
happen to own a chromecast then castaway
is an application you should definitely
check out our own Kevin nether put this
app head-to-head with coaches all cast
with some pretty surprising results this
app allows you to stream local content
to your chromecast from your Android
device it features a holo interface
surprisingly easy functionality aside
from the occasional hiccup a pretty
solid performance it's free to use in
the Google Play Store and if you want to
see Kevin's review we'll have it linked
here at the end of the video dormi is a
baby monitor turned into a smartphone
app the application is free to download
but there is a subscription service
charge to use it if you don't mind that
what you get is really the best
smartphone baby monitor app available
today it will adjust noise levels
automatically so you can hear what's
going on it's discreet when you're using
your phone and you can even check
notifications on the device you're using
as the actual baby monitor it's a great
tool for parents we reviewed everything
me launcher earlier this month and found
it to be a pretty good launcher its
claim to fame is its constant use of
context to bring you stuff you can
search for things use the smart folders
and use the prediction bar to get the
information and applications you want
when you want them it lacks
customization features and the ads are a
bit of a pain some
times but otherwise it's a pretty great
launcher if you're into having more
context in your life week 2 D is a
free-to-play scrolling shooter not
unlike the art k games up times past as
you can imagine there are boss fights
weapon upgrades more than a dozen levels
and you get to blow things up some
people have complained about the
repetition and gameplay but really they
knew what they were getting into when
they downloaded the game also there are
in app purchases should you choose to
buy them so don't go letting those catch
you off guard either leeky Shortz is one
of those fun games suitable for all ages
that is just enjoyable to play there are
over 80 levels in two game modes 170
disguises you can unlock by collecting
coins or you can race against the ghosts
to beat your fastest times there are
also a lot more features you can even
customize the controls if you want to
it's only a buck to get it and in our
opinion it's a dollar well spent so who
doesn't like fine arts our next
application knows dem feels and has
released an open-source live wallpaper
to bring you the classics to your
android home screen with this app you
can choose your favorite art pieces and
the app will cycle through them so that
your wallpaper is an ever-changing
slideshow of awesome classic art fun
fact the app's name is actually a
Russian transliteration of the word
Museum oh and it's free so that's pretty
good too please secure genes and space
is one of the most unique games that I
have ever seen so here's how it works
scientists are always analyzing cancer
data to try to find a cure some clever
game developers have found a way to turn
this tedious activity into an arcade
action space game where the concept has
you collecting a material called element
alpha as you play the game they download
your game data and it helps them analyze
the cancer data more quickly it's really
quite brilliant and it's free to play so
there's no reason to at least try it out
you know for science shortlands is a
gorgeous atmospheric 3d action puzzle
adventure game with 25 levels great
graphics and some pretty decent music
how it works is you swipe where you want
your character to go and then they go
there you then find secrets solve
puzzles and work your way through the
level to win it strikes all the right
chords and it's definitely worth a
playthrough and best of all it's free to
play slam dunk 2 is a fun little time
waster game where you must shoot the
ball into the basket repeatedly to beat
an opponent doing the same thing the
scoring is a little screwy and then
games are a bit dumb but the game itself
is rather enjoyable much like other time
waster games this really won't ring any
bells with the hardcore gamers but it's
still a good way to waste a few minutes
without committing to a longer game like
its predecessor the room 2 is a
beautifully done puzzle game that has
you searching for clues unlocking
secrets and figuring out puzzles in a
world of crisp and sharp graphics it
shows improvement in almost every area
from the first game in the series and
that includes length it's one of them
must have games of 2014 so far so you
should just go pick it up now it's worth
all three dollars the developers are
asking for it as we mentioned earlier
privacy is all the rage these days and
time pin is a particularly ingenious
application that helps keep your phone
secure the premise is very simple time
pin changes your lock screen pin based
on what time it is in other words it
changes every minute so people cannot
use the same old techniques to get into
your phone you can add extra stuff if
the time isn't good enough for you like
reversing the numbers or adding more
numbers it's very well done and a must
have app for privacy beans our next
application called type machine solves a
problem all of us have dealt with before
here's what it does it saves everything
you type in every single application so
if you accidentally close it out or lose
it or the app crashes or something you
can go back grab what you typed and
continue on where you left off I don't
really need to explain all the uses for
this because in your mind right now
you're thinking of that time you closed
out of your favorite social media app
after typing a 4 paragraph diatribe
about something important and then you
lost it all and had to start over again
it's two dollars and let's face facts
you've spent two dollars on things wait
less useful than this last up this month
is vh1's official application which has
finally made its way to Android with
this app you can log in with your cable
provider credentials and watch full TV
shows get sneak peeks video shorts and
more stuff from vh1 one of my favorite
features is the ability to use this as a
sort of companion app which made you get
additional content from the application
while you watch a vh1 show on your
television I wish more TV station apps
did things like this anyway it's free to
download so if you like their
programming it's worth checking out once
