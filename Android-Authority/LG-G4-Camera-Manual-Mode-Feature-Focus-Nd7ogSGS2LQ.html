Authority what's going on everybody and
I wanted to bring you a closer look at
the camera interface software of the LG
g4 now we are here at the launch event
at the top of a One World Trade Center
which gives us this beautiful view of
the New York skyline pretty much all of
Manhattan is sitting right in front of
us as we are in the south tip of
Manhattan and yeah this is a wonderful
view and this is my way of being able to
show you the manual mode on here now the
manual mode is going to be one of the
best parts of the camera experience
aside from the fact that the F 1.8
aperture and the OIS and even the laser
autofocus are now coupled with a color
spectrum sensor that will take a look at
all of the colors in your scene and
analyze them for even better white
balancing you can already see here that
looks pretty nice forward to laser into
that right there take that picture it's
pretty nice you still have the simple
mode where all you have to do is just
tap on the area that you want to take a
picture of and it will take the picture
already but the manual mode is where we
have some really fun settings to play
with much like on a regular camera what
we have here are white balances now this
isn't just going to be like incandescent
cloudy or daylight these are actually
Kelvin readings right here we have a
full gamut of white balance modes right
here and you can already see in the
viewfinder another great feature of the
LG g4 camera is the fact that everything
happens in real time so you're going to
see the super blue that happens here you
can even go all the way over here and
see how things get pretty yellow just
like in a real white balance meter and
there's also auto right here on the top
to make it easier manual focus is
available as well if I'm going to bring
it down it's going to change the focus
and F 1.9 especially you will be able to
get some nice depth of field shots the
general exposure slider is here as well
but the ISO meter also has a lot of
stops on it all the way up to 2700 which
is pretty impressive
we can head down and there are stops in
between every single one and you can
already see in the viewfinder that the
ISO is making even more light jump into
the frame right now we're at 50 because
it's a very bright day out we also have
the shutter speed now the shutter speed
can go from as fast as one six
thousandth of a second all the way to
even thirty Seconds which would be very
nice for let's say stargazing shots or
you can go to one two maybe five seconds
in order to get light trail shots also
so that was just a quick look out here
you can even see up here that we have a
histogram and it will show you the
different levels that you have for all
of the different colors in the in the
actual shot itself this is a very nice
camera already just because it's manual
mode is very robust and rivals that of
actual DSLR cameras and even to that
point if I press over there you saw that
it changed to raw and JPEG the reason
why that's a great big deal also is
because when you're taking your regular
photo perhaps the one that you're just
going to share on social media you can
also take the raw capture and put it on
your computer into a program like
Lightroom and be able to change all of
the settings on there because the raw
captured data will be there for you to
manipulate you can create an even better
version of your photo already taking a
look at the settings here I'm just going
to go ahead and bring it up to maybe
about a thousand the white balance is
already on auto and it should look quite
nice already the ISO is very low for
this bright day that we have here in New
York and I'll just go ahead and take
that picture right there and that was
your look at the camera on the LG g4
coming to you live from the launch event
here in New York City from the top of
One World Trade Center keep it tuned for
more about the LG g4 here at Android
