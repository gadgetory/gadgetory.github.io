handy the Android authority app guide so
the latest fad to hit the mean streets
of the Google Play Store is a game
called quiz up is this the game with
longevity or is it just flappy bird with
words in this video we're gonna find out
okay so if you've ever played a quiz
game in your lifetime you pretty much
know how quiz up is going to work it is
a competitive quiz game which means you
and another person or asked a number of
questions and the person who can answer
the most questions correctly the fastest
wins
before each match are paired with a real
person and the two of you go
head-to-head in a quiz there are a
number of categories ranging from pop
culture to history mathematics to
business and even video games and
Android one of the major draws of quiz
up is to engage in quizzes on topics
that you actually know as opposed to the
more classic set up where you just get
asked random questions therefore you can
stick to topics you know and it helps
you enjoy yourself a little bit more
they don't have topics on everything but
they do add new topics every single week
outside of the quiz aspect there are
other things you can do you can message
opponents start discussions follow
people challenge your friends earn
achievements and link your device to
both Facebook and Google+ once you get
into the game and start using all of
these features it offers a reasonably
rich experience there is also a Settings
menu where you can tinker with things
like notifications and sounds the design
for this application is surprisingly
good the app is bright and colorful but
also organized an ergonomic player
should have no trouble navigating the
application finding the topics they like
or engaging in gameplay during quizzes
the screen is appropriately designed
with minimal distractions all you can
see are the questions the score and the
answers along with each gamers name and
profile picture this really helps the
player immerse themselves into the game
the only real minor issue we had was
with navigation using the pop out menu
you can navigate to any part of the
application the only problem is that the
pop up menu is the only way to navigate
through the app half of the time for
example if you're checking messages and
you want to go to the topics you have to
open the menu and switch the extra
screen presses aren't bad per se but
they do eventually get tedious and that
gets a little bit annoying okay so
here's what we liked there are a lots of
quizzes to take in a lot of categories
it would have been easy to just do pop
culture or just history or just math or
something like
but quizup goes the whole nine yards
here and you can take quizzes on dozens
of subjects they add new quizzes weekly
so it takes much longer than normal for
the app to start to feel stale aside
from the navigation issue we talked
about earlier the app is incredibly well
designed it's easy to find your way
around the app and everything looks
colorful and modern the extra features
are a huge plus messaging opponents the
discussions the achievements challenging
your friends and connecting to Google+
and Facebook add some much-needed depth
to this game the quizzes start and end
very quickly most are done in about two
to two-and-a-half minutes if you want to
play longer you can simply start another
quiz but the short timeframe allows
people to play the game without getting
into too much of a commitment and here's
what we didn't like so much the
matchmaking system says that it's
looking for the quote best match for you
unquote in reality it's simply looking
for the next available player and that
is often not the best match for you so
prepare yourself to face people who have
been playing the same category for so
long that all of the questions are
repeats for them and then they get them
alright it doesn't happen very often but
some questions are either entirely wrong
poorly categorized or have multiple
correct answers
I was asked in the Android quiz which
OAM made an Android based smart watch
with two of the answers being Samsung
and Sony the problem is they both made
Android based smart watches and the
answer they wanted was Sony but guessing
Samsung still makes you wrong somehow in
the punk-rock quiz it asked me a
question where the answer was the band
ministry ministry plays industrial metal
not punk rock it has also been reported
that there are numerous grammar and
spelling mistakes we didn't run into any
but this still doesn't inspire any
confidence especially when you get a
question with words spelled wrong and
multiple right answers it is way too
easy for you to fake your win-loss
record the game doesn't count losing
connection as a win or a loss and I've
run into entirely too many players whose
connections just happen to go out when
I'm winning by like 70 points going into
the fifth question finally a lot of the
questions are insanely difficult for no
other reason other than for the sake of
being insanely difficult it's usually
stuff that no reasonable person should
know like the exact number of hit points
for a random Boston an RPG or the exact
weight of Leonard Nimoy's prosthetic
ears in Star Trek I was once asked the
address of the dentist office in Finding
Nemo who knows this stuff being
delightfully obscure can be a lot of fun
but being absurd ly obscure
can make you feel stupid and feeling
stupid is kind of the opposite of
enjoyable if I had to equate playing
quiz up to a real-life experience it
would be taking a glorious cross-country
road trip from New York to California
with four days of perfect weather and no
traffic only to be rear-ended by a drunk
driver one block from my destination the
game looks nice it plays well and there
are a metric ton of questions and
categories to test your smarts the
in-game social dynamics are truly
enjoyable and the frequent updates bring
new content which helps the game feel
fresh in these areas quizup
excels more than most games I've played
on Android however between the questions
with no right answers questions with
multiple right answers questions that
are impossible for normal people to
answer and consistently facing opponents
either 40 levels above or below you you
end up with experiences that are either
not challenging and therefore boring or
way too challenging and therefore
frustrating it's hard not to recommend
it because it is free and some people
have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it
just be aware that there are a few
issues that still need to be fixed once
