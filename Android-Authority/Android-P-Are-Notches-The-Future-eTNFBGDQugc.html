authority and the and Rapide developer
one preview was recently released a few
days ago and one of the biggest features
to Android P is its native support for
notches and this sort of raised a lot of
questions is Google doing this in
anticipation of a ton of Android phones
being released with notches are they
planning on releasing a phone with a
knotch themselves and our notch is going
to be the future of Android smartphones
so we've seen a lot of features become
trends in smartphones like dual cameras
fingerprint sensors bezel screens and if
the knotch
is the next big thing to gain popularity
it's gonna be one of these strangest
smartphone trends ever the essential
phone was one of the first mainstream
smartphones to feature a knotch
but it wasn't until the iPhone 10
featured a notch that it became a big
deal but both of these phones did it out
of necessity and not for stylistic or
aesthetic reasons the essential phone
needed a place to have the front-facing
camera and then the iPhone 10 obviously
needed a place to have all of the
necessary sensors for its base ID
technology now with everything that
Apple tends to do it doesn't take very
long for other OEMs to replicate it and
back at MWC a couple of weeks ago we saw
a ton of iPhone 10 clones most of them
were from lesser-known Chinese OEMs but
we also have some pretty big
announcements from companies like a soos
with the zenfone 5 Z which pretty much
looked completely identical to an iPhone
10 in every way we've also seen a lot of
recent leaks of the LG G 7 neo and in
many of the photos and videos the phone
appears to have a knotch so it even
looks like LG is on board of the knotch
train and it seems pretty inescapable at
this point then we're gonna be seeing a
ton of Android phones that feature a
knotch
and if it's done out of necessity I
think that's perfectly fine but if it's
done merely for aesthetic reasons I
think that's gonna give Android phones a
really bad look especially if it's
coming from bigger named OMS I think it
would be more beneficial and innovative
if more OEMs found different solutions
for incorporating all these different
sensors in our smartphones without
resorting to the knotch and some OEMs
already have the apex concept smartphone
from vivo that we saw at MWC has the
proximity sensor the
be a light sensor the fingerprint sensor
and even the front-facing camera all
very cleverly hidden away without
interrupting the display and the notch
is sort of like the modern-day moto 360
flat tire look and it's something that
you'll learn to live with if you have to
but if you had the choice you'd rather
not have it at all
but let's go back to Android PE and
think logically about it for a second
even with native knotch support we're
not gonna see a non pixel phone running
Android P until after the pixel 3 is
launched so it's hard to believe that
this update is meant for any Android
phone with a knotch that's being
released anytime soon and even if that
was the case it would be a long time
before these phones receive this update
if they even receive it at all it would
be much safer to assume that this update
implies that Google plans on
incorporating a notch into the pixel 3
and pixel 3 Excel and I certainly
wouldn't put it past Google to do
something like that because after all
they have emulated Apple before in the
past but I sort of hope that's not the
case because Google is supposed to be
the company that propels Android forward
and I feel like if they do mimic Apple
again this is going to be a big step
backwards so that pretty much wraps up
this video do you guys think notches are
the future of our smartphones and if
they are will you be happy with it let
us know down in the comment section
