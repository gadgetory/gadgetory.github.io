we're checking out the brand spankin new
iphone 5 vs the Galaxy Nexus what's
great about this particular comparison
is that we have the latest version of
operating system from android android
4.1 jelly bean with its lightning fast
operation google now and a whole lot
more baked in and we also have iphone 5
with the latest version of iOS iOS 6
which obviously is supposed to be their
latest and greatest operating system
what's interesting to see obviously is a
lot of the features that were present in
android for some time now obviously have
been baked in in some fashion in terms
of facebook integration other social
sharing and other little subtle
improvements but we still have no real
true customization on iphone but for
some people that's okay either way
platforms aside let's just take a look
at the specs so first let's start with
the size so for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
we have a five point three three inch
tall we have two point six seven inches
wide and we have a width of 0.35 inches
for the iphone 5 we have four point
eight seven inches of height we have a
two point three one inch of width and we
have a thinness of 0.3 inches so 0.3
inches thick or thin for the iphone 5
and 0.35 inches thick excuse me or the
Galaxy Nexus obviously the iPhone 5 is 0
point 0 5 inches thinner negligible some
but you know comparably speaking the
iphone 5 feels quite a bit thinner in
the hand in terms of the weight the
Galaxy Nexus is weighing in at 135 grams
making it a little bit heavier than the
112 grams of the iphone 5 now in terms
of the processor we have a TI OMAP 4460
dual-core 1.2 gigahertz in the Galaxy
Nexus thankfully do the inherent
architectural upgrades and just general
cleanup of the operating system with
jelly bean Android 4.1 things are 60
frames the second butter smooth project
butter has done wonders for the Galaxy
Nexus and if you've ever used a nexus
tab excuse me Nexus 7 or galaxy nexus 2
j.b you know how fast and
smooth it is for the iphone 5 they have
a 86 processor which they design
themselves is a dual core as well just
like the Galaxy Nexus but it's only
clock to 1000 mega hertz so 1200
megahertz dual-core with older
generation technology arm a9 versus a6
processor designed by Apple do a course
well but only 1000 mega Hertz
performance wise both are comparable
though it should be noted that this is
substantially more powerful likely to be
in the range of two dimes is powerful
thanks to the fact that they pretty much
built the SOC themselves with help from
arm borrowing some designs from arm
moving on to the RAM both devices
feature one gig of ram so they're on par
there now obviously the most important
thing about smartphones pretty much is
the display because it's what you look
at interact with and is how you see and
toy with the device or work with it
depending tie work just joking anyway we
have a 4.6 5 inch display on the Galaxy
Nexus with a resolution of 720 x 1280
pixels giving a ppi of 316 on the iphone
5 we have four inches diagonally with
1136 pixels which is very irregular
around you but it's 1136 high and it's
640 wide giving a ppi 326 so 326 ppi
pixels per inch on the iphone 5 and ppl
i have 316 on the Galaxy Nexus making
them very very close I'm considering
that you have a four point six five
verses for it's a fair trade-off and
quite frankly I would I would really
like to challenge anyone to you know be
able to tell the difference in terms of
seeing pixels because when you get over
300 pixels per inch on a mobile device
it's impossible to see so Samsung Galaxy
Nexus features 16 gigabyte and 32
gigabyte iterations for its internal
storage whereas the iPhone 5 has 16 32
and 64 gigabyte if money is no object
obviously you get the 64 gigabyte from
iphone and you can just fill it to the
brim through itunes now with this one of
course with the micro USB you're able to
just throw content on there no problem
obviously both a feature a lot of cloud
connectivity in terms of bringing
content on but not everyone has an
Limited 4g plan in fact I would I reckon
to say that very very few people have
unlimited brought mobile broadband so
sometimes it's nice to be able to have a
lot of mobile capacity on the go though
both don't have micro SD capability so
they are on equal playing ground there
as well the battery on the Galaxy Nexus
is going to be 1750 milliamp hours
making it a smaller battery compared to
some like the galaxy s3 with 2111
battery but still large enough now if
you are packing an LTE version of this
device it's not going to be enough to
get you through the day if you are a
mobile hound like most of us android
lovers are so it's still though at
seventeen fifty million of our for its
HSPA variant and 18 50ml half hours for
the LT very respectably still larger
than the 1400 milliamp hours present in
the iphone 5 though we have to we have
to subject more intensive testing to see
how it holds up but I would say that
they would be comparable due to the fact
that this has a four point six five inch
and this has a 4-inch and this battery
is roughly twenty-five percent larger so
anyway in terms of the rear camera this
is an older generation device and Google
and Samsung received a lot of flack but
it is a five megapixel camera whereas on
the iPhone 5 we have an eight megapixel
camera now both do feature 1080p video
recording so that's not a problem they
both have out of focus and they both
have LED flash either way I would have
to hand it to the iphone I do believe
that the camera will likely produce
better quality pictures than Samsung
Galaxy Nexus though if you live in the
states you can get the google galaxy
nexus for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus for
as low as 3 49 making it a very very
good price particularly considering that
it already has android 4.1 jelly bean
out-of-the-box so moving on to the front
facing camera for the Galaxy Nexus we
have a 1.3 megapixel 720p video and so
for the iPhone we have a 1 point 2
megapixel also capable of 720p video
now this one features NFC for Google
Wallet functionality and for other
things such as the ability to share
contact with other galaxy nexus and NFC
capable devices whereby you can just tap
in together and contacts are transmitted
and if c stands for north excuse me near
field communication it's similar to
bluetooth a lot more power efficient but
also shorter range other than that we
have LTE hsdpa HSPA capabilities for the
Galaxy Nexus depending on the iteration
obviously features why to a Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth 3.0 now this is an LTE capable
device also an HSPA capable device as
well it does have Wi-Fi and it does have
bluetooth 4.0 whereas this one only has
bluetooth 3.0 a small thing for some but
could be potentially a big thing
bluetooth 4.1 an architectural
improvement over Bluetooth 3 so if you
tend to stream music in the car a lot
you will have a higher bandwidth and
more power savings with the iphone 5 and
also better all audio transmission
quality due to the fact that there is
better data transmission with bluetooth
for so let's just take a look here ok
Google now which is the latest and
greatest yes sirree here
okay who is the smartest person because
you who is the smartest person that ever
lived
who is the smartest person that ever
lived well so we can see that Google now
has brought it up significantly faster
oh well we should do that simply a
little bit more intuitive will have an
independent versus of google now vs.
Siri they claim to have improved serious
substantially another thing to remark on
a see how brilliant and white the whites
are on the iPhone 5 that's inherent due
to the fact that this is an IPS LCD
which is capable of producing much
whiter whites whereas this is an AMOLED
HD AMOLED HD will produce richer colors
but white is not as strong suit in fact
it consumes the most power so if you're
a person that does web browsing a lot
maybe perhaps you will like an LCD based
device via the iphone or the HTC device
or an optimus 4x HD what else so bring
it down obviously we have a micro USB
the ability to throw any kind of content
you want on there and through google
play you can pretty much make this your
computer you can look at PDF so you can
flash gaming there's a ton of different
stuff you can do with android obviously
it's highly customizable but the fact
that you can just throw files on through
micro USB is very convenient obviously
we know iTunes itunes itunes other than
that we have MHL connectivity an image
cell sense for um um excuse me
mmm mobile high-definition link I might
mix that up I'm sorry but either way it
doesn't matter the point is is that this
is capable of connecting to an HDTV with
the small dongle making it down
potentially capable bring over to a
friend's house and you can just watch
movies just have them stream on an HDTV
you can do that too but it also requires
a very expensive dongle from Apple other
than that Galaxy Nexus hasn't been one
of the best-selling devices but you know
it didn't really have a strong marketing
campaign but it is a pure Google
Experience device and that's why we have
android 4.1 everyone's seen the
advantages of having sort of a
vertically controlled situation Apple
can push updates out to the devices
quickly so you're always going to have
the latest and greatest version of their
operating system and with Galaxy Nexus
devices or Nexus devices in general you
will have the latest and greatest
version of Android on there too moving
on to that we know the iPhone 5 has
considerable the man behind it and they
sold over 2 million devices and less
than 24 hours after launch making of one
of the best-selling devices in history
if not the best selling now let's just
go and check out something cool I've
cleared the cache on both devices load
of android authority calm to see what
loads faster so this is basically a
there we go and your authority the
little rootie
we go okay thank you okay all right here
we go guys 32
oops except the whole down one down then
I can assure you this is not easy okay
here we go three two one go all right
we're off to the races who's gonna win
developed it duh okay so it appears
Galaxy Nexus is in the lead I know it's
not know the iPhone 5 is winning and
that doesn't actually seem problematic
at all I mean the processor that's
contained within the iPhone 5 is about
200 to 250 percent more powerful than
the TI OMAP dual-core this is an
architectural leap ahead for the a6
processor brilliantly smooth project
butter akin to the iphone as we've seen
with other verses is that you've
probably looked at the iphone 5 takes
the cake when it comes to fluidity of
browser operation of pinch to zoom it is
a set the industry standard but with
android 4.1 jelly bean and all the
devices that are coming forward we're
seeing that the browsing is very
comfortable and very smooth on both in
fact the video camera that we're
recording the song is recording in 30
frames a second and it is not enough to
justify how smooth both of these devices
are really really remarkable in fact it
would be very very difficult to tell the
difference other than that you know
where we're just looking at two of the
hottest devices on the market there will
be a new Galaxy Nexus rumors are already
indicating the galaxy nexus 2 is in the
works to feature latest generation
processing technologies a high
resolution display better camera and the
latest version of Android on board and
that's when the real showdown will begin
for now we have the iphone 5 4 inch
profile nice and thin beautiful poly
beautiful metallic body the Galaxy Nexus
obviously a larger device but one of the
best on the market still and loved by
many so this is our first look and
verses of the Galaxy Nexus vs iphone 5
