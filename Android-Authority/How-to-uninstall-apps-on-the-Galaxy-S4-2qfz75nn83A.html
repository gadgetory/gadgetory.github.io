and woe be to you if you don't know how
to install and uninstall Android apps hi
I'm mark welcome to Android Authority
everything that you can do on your
galaxy s4 you can do because of apps
some of those apps come pre-installed on
your phone while others you install from
sources such as the Google Play Store
the usually can't remove pre-installed
apps but you can easily remove those
apps that you installed yourself in this
video I'll teach you five ways to
uninstall apps from your Galaxy s4 the
first way in fact the most common way to
uninstall apps is through the Google
Play Store app I might even say this is
also the easiest yet believe me some
people don't even know that they could
uninstall apps just open the Play Store
app tap on menu select my apps tap on
the name of the app to be removed and
tap this uninstall button right here one
downside to this method is that if you
install apps manually some of those apps
may not appear on your list of apps here
another way to remove apps is through
your Galaxy S 4 S built an application
manager you can access it by opening the
Settings app and going to the more tab
application manager lists your installed
apps and shows them in four tabs this
one's for your downloaded apps this
one's for apps installed in your phone
storage this one lists all apps that are
active or running in the background and
this one of course lists all of your
apps to remove an app just open the apps
info page by tapping on its name then
tap the uninstall button pre-installed
apps usually can't be installed so there
may not be an uninstalled button for
them if you prefer a hassle free way to
remove apps here's an uninstallation
method that doesn't take you beyond the
app drawer just open the app drawer on
your Galaxy S 4 tap the Menu button then
select edit you'll see the icon grid
shrink a bit like this which means
you're in editing mode simply hold down
the icon of the app you want to remove
then drag it to the trash icon at the
top
there's yet another method here in the
app drawer this one's more
straightforward just tap the menu button
then tap uninstall you'll see these
little red bars overlaid on the icons of
apps that you can uninstall to uninstall
an app just tap on the red bar overlaid
on its icon
yet another uninstallation method is
through the use of app managers task
managers or file manager apps many of
such apps also include a function for
uninstalling apps ES file explorer for
example has an app manager component
just tap the fast access button right
here then tap tools to expand the list
and tap app manager here for example
there's a list of apps installed on my
phone just long tap on an app until this
rub buttons appear at the bottom from
here just mark those apps that you want
to uninstall you can uninstall several
apps very quickly through this method
lastly there's the Android debug bridge
or ADB for those who are comfortable
with the command-line and with geeky
stuff for this method to work you'll
need to install ADB and the Android
software development kit on your
computer
ADB must be able to recognize your
Galaxy s4 when the phone is connected to
your computer via USB cable once
everything is properly set up all you
really need to do is enter this command
at the terminal replace this part with
the actual apps package name for example
if you want to uninstall the Firefox app
replace this with a Firefox apps package
name but what if you don't know the
package name to see a list of package
name of apps installed on your Galaxy s4
enter this command you should be able to
find Firefox on this list ah here it is
now you can uninstall the Firefox app
with this correct command there success
app and installation may be a trivial
task for those who have been in the
Android camp for quite some time yet it
is often a necessary maintenance task in
this video I showed you five different
ways to remove apps from your Samsung
Galaxy S 4 I hope you find the tutorial
