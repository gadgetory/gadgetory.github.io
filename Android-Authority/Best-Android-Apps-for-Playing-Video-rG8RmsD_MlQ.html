I've got the top 5 video players
available for download in the Android
Market so first off I'll start by saying
most of these are free in fact all of
these versions are free and then a lot
of them have paid versions that give you
extra perks anyways today I've got the
real player doubleTwist player M video
player Meridian player mobile player and
arc media player some of these are full
suites including picture viewing and
music playing but today we're just gonna
focus on their movie playing abilities
so without further ado let's start off
with real player as you can see we have
our playlist artists albums genres and
songs this is all for music and we've
got our photo viewer and we have our
videos viewer now the problem with real
player is that it does not view all file
types you have to have your file type
association with your phone so I just
have a 10 second video recorded with my
phone recorded excuse me that I'll play
as you can see here it's simply just a
video of me recording my Keurig coffee
maker
alright one thing I do like is you can
search through your entire library with
this key right here also when you go to
videos whoops go back you have the
option of opening a URL you can stream
video right from a URL so if your to
answer a YouTube channel or a YouTube
video you know or a Vimeo video anything
like that right into the URL you can
stream it from there your other settings
include resume music and customer
improvement mode basically this is just
a beta of Real Player there aren't too
many things going on
not too many settings you can fool with
that's fine by me this is just a
bare-bones player it's gonna get the job
done for you so we will go back home
check out our doubleTwist player now
this is one of the top downloaded ones
in the market because you can use this
to stream music directly from your
computer sort of as a VLC suite anyways
we have our music our videos and our
settings you can lock to portrait you
can change your device
named have our player settings air sink
is your wireless mac and pc sinking
there twist and airplay is the xbox ps3
Apple and TV streaming their podcasts we
can reset doubleTwist
some log files all this good stuff on
settings anyways we'll go to our videos
and view our 10-second video in this
will flip her over see most of these are
from the landscape viewing so far a lot
of portrait viewing anyways that's
basically the doubleTwist player as far
as movies go we will go back and check
out our m video player
we have our change log here bug fixes
fixed video list all sorts of stuff
there you can see we have an ad here
because this is the free version anyways
the M video player shows me videos
folders you can choose folders but this
is the only video I have on my phone
right now you can filter by different
things I'll bring up our settings menu
we can show our sidebar which is what we
just did but you can scroll right and do
that
I am BD search so you have the entire
internet movie database search available
at your fingertips
you've got your preferences this is your
change log you have more options here
such as subtitles so here I have a WMV
file and I have my keurig file but as
you can see the WMV file is not
supported so we will just play our
keurig and see how this looks
automatically to landscape and it seems
to play the video just fine we'll go
back so that's basically our M video
player you don't have any playlists your
videos we will go to meridian now here
is our Meridian video player so as you
see we have play Q which I'm sure is a
playlist setting we have our folders our
videos our music our history and our
toolkit we'll check out our toolkit
starting off we can clean videos so this
has a library cleaning function you can
go through your libraries and
basically sort out any videos that you
have duplicates of things like that you
can do the same thing for genres SD card
rescan resolve to duplicate musics
anyways we don't have anything in our
history we could go through our music
but I'm not gonna focus on that so we
will play our video in this and what I
like about this is automatically it does
not go to landscape mode even though I
could and not imagine it would put it
into full-screen which it actually
doesn't you can see we still have our
soft keys here and my Galaxy Nexus but
the video doesn't close when it's over
it just ends on the last frame and you
have the option of tapping the screen to
play it again so I like those controls
and once again we watch our movie nice
go back and it said exiting there we
continue to be in the landscape mode it
will show our folders so we can do
folder searches for all of our different
things around here and we don't have
anything in our play queue still so
going back onto our next one we will go
to the mobile player and the mobile
player is optimized for phones with
faster processors and if your phone does
not have a faster processor you can
download the correct codec to match your
performance your hardware performance so
this runs faster anyways we have our
instructions for player interface
sliding right right and left will adjust
the play time setting up and down will
adjust the brightness up and down will
adjust the volume that's left and right
and you can double click this screen to
pause and play press the Menu key to
activate the screen lock some files play
failed try long press on the files icon
that's nice go pass you can scan your SD
card use intelligent scanning or
directory browsing and I will scan SD
card
anyways I'll try our Windows Media video
and it's playing a little slowly this is
just a review I've done in the past for
a handy recorder
well I'm it's it is playing a little
slower so you can see the hand motions
and everything on the video are pretty
slow but this is probably a 500 megabyte
file so I'll try some of our gestures we
can reduce our brightness just base
rolling down on the screen just nice our
volume oh that's our volume pause and
play and I'll use my soft keys to get
back and we'll test out our egg video
whoops
an apprentice down for this
so these are some intuitive gestures
incorporated into this video player
whoops and I'll try a gesture support
for the whoops pure egg video once again
where you can jump to our different
frames just by scrolling across even
though this is only a ninety eight nine
second video mind you and our brightness
anyways we can go back check out our
settings for the mobile player looks
like my menu Keys not gonna bring it up
we can go back and it looks like it just
brings up this little dock bar so it's
here so we can go and I'm assuming this
is a file directory we can actually
assign our media directory ourselves
instead of having it scan and bring up
all those miscellaneous music files that
were needed here we have the option of
sorting by file pedophile name format
whoops
we can play which I imagine is just
going to bring us back to our video riku
the video actually that would be rescan
and then here are other settings we have
our background playlist settings
streaming helping and then just the
regular settings about media thumbnails
gesture sensitivity screen lock settings
volume key settings so you can choose to
play next video or song by just holding
the volume key a bunch of stuff like
that update frequency update when Wi-Fi
is enabled check for new version so that
was our mobile player we have our
different views like this and we have
some nice scrolling interface like that
very nice I will confirm acquit and we
will go to our final arc media player
we have an incompatible decoder this
device may not be compatible with the
arc media decoder freeze please visit
google play and download our media like
neon so that's important to know the
Galaxy Nexus and I'm assuming other
Nexus devices if this one might not be
supported but for the heck of it
I'm just gonna try and see if it plays
our videos this isn't the most beautiful
interface ever but it is loading our mp4
of the keurig and it looks like it is
playing it just fine it's got our audio
and everything it's not the most
beautiful interface we've kind of got
some squished icons right here for the
pause but you can just click replay and
it will replay obviously anyways let's
try and see if we have some settings for
this app we can keep our aspect ratio
that it was filmed in streaming
preference file browsing preference on
screen display enable subtitles media
restored preference haptic feedback
continuous playback auto down the system
bar and we can choose our path loaded
when the SD shortcut button is pressed
so anyways this is basically our
interface for the player here there's
not too much to look at it's not really
much of a looker we have a little bit of
a banner ad up here because this is the
lite version but anyways that was a good
player if you need something other than
stock you can check that one up out of
all our players we can just go over some
basic pros and cons about all of them
the mobile player had all video formats
available to play with different codecs
for all hardware our M video player had
no different formats so that was a con
but it was it was nice and had a nice uh
it had a nice user interface arc media
had streams from the web and it could
play all formats a real player played
videos music and pictures but it was
still in beta testing so it had a lot of
not really bugs but you just had to work
with it a little more our doubleTwist
player had PC sync as well as a full
suite media player with videos pictures
and music and our Meridian media player
only played mp4 videos and it did have a
nice interface well anyways guys thanks
