what's going on everybody and we have
some verses videos here for you as you
saw earlier we have the LG optimus g pro
right here the first 5.5 phone 5-inch
screen phone by LG and over here we have
the Oppo find 5 now it's no secret that
we are fans of the Apple fine 5 its
5-inch screen 1080p display and the
incredible specs that are underneath
however LG is really coming out of the
gate by having a phone with an even
larger screen so we're gonna take a look
at a few the aspects here you're seeing
the UI and both screens as you can see
are very vibrant very crisp the Oppo
comes in at a whopping 440 PPI while the
LG optimus g pro has 400 in its very
large 5.5 inch screen let's go ahead
let's head on over to the back obviously
these are both the white versions of the
phones and they both look really nice
over here you have the crystal
reflection display on the back of the LG
optimus g pro the the button layouts for
both are are different but essentially
mirrored you have the power button on
the side over here and the power button
is on the left of the Oppo however after
that you have the volume rockers on the
other sides capacitive buttons down here
and you have a menu button on the side
maybe button over here so things were
kind of mirrored there the optimus g pro
has the Snapdragon 600 processor which
is very very fast probably the fastest
processor out right now for a smartphone
while the Oppo find 5 has the Snapdragon
s4 pro originally made popular by the LG
optimus and cheap which is the
predecessor to this both have great
specs the adrenal 320 graphics processor
backs the CPU inside of the optimus g
pro that is also the same on the above
fine 51 really important thing about the
LG optimus g pro is that the back is
removable which obviously means that the
battery the 3140 milliamp hour monster
of a battery is removable and
replaceable and as we saw early as we
found out earlier in the box you get a
replacement battery along with the
cradle in order to charge both your
phone and the spare battery which is
really really awesome also underneath
you have the micro-sim slot along with
the micro SD slot so you have expandable
memory and a replaceable battery to
features that a lot of people look for
in their phones the outlook for she does
not
have either in the Apple fine five
however you have 16 gigabytes of
internal memory and two gigabytes of RAM
two gigabytes of RAM in the LG optimus g
pro but the Apple does not have anything
removable is a unibody design that does
not allow for any expandability that's
why we have a lot to really like in the
LG optimus g pro because of those two
features alone aside from everything
else this is going to be the year of the
5-inch phone as a 5-inch screen phones
as we're predicting however with LG
bringing out a 5.5 inch screen they're
really looking to shake things up a
little bit and we think that they're
doing a pretty good job so far so we're
going to have some more videos for you
of the optimus g pro vs with other
devices and you'll see more from android
authority calm because it is your source
