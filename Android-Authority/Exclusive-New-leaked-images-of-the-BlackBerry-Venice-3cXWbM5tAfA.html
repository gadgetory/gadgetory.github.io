brought to you by domain.com this being
our second exclusive in ten days I think
it merits a happy dance yes we have
reported on the BlackBerry Venice in the
past but these images are not only
exclusive to Android authority but they
are recent like in the past 12 hours now
we're getting a good look at the
Venice's display and slide-out keyboard
although we can't be entirely certain
about the display size previous rumors
have pointed to a 5.4 inch screen as for
the software experience this device
seems to stick very closely to vanilla
Android with some added blackberry
features thrown in for instance our
anonymous tipster tells us there will be
a keyboard shortcut available for
creating quick tasks and a few others as
you can see from the image here there
also looks to be some software shortcut
when swiping up from the home button
aside from the normal Google now
shortcut you'll also be able to perform
a quick local search and create a new
message with ease it should also be
noted that we don't have any images for
this our sources tell us that when the
phone boots up you'll see an image of a
bug droid holding up a shield this is
likely due to BlackBerry's focus on the
enterprise showing users that the Venice
is a secure device through and through
we also have a few photos of the new
application switcher and the shortcut
widget selection menu as you can see
from the first photo here blackberry is
making it easier for users to add
communication shortcuts for composing
new emails bbm messages texts and more
you'll also easily be able to add new
calendar events schedule meetings and
see the current day's agenda right from
your home screen as you can see here
we're getting a better look at the
recent apps menu the applications in
this menu will change size depending on
how often you use each app which is
certainly a nice touch
making our way to the back of the device
we're seeing the camera which happens to
come in at 18 megapixels unfortunately
we haven't got our hands on any camera
samples just yet two thoughts and the
first one you probably thought yourself
all those shortcut and widgets are great
on the BlackBerry device but those
features can be done on any Android
device right now if you employ a good
widget so how
blackberry do this any differently well
I don't think they will I think it comes
down to that tactile keyboard and maybe
they have enough brand juice to pull
those CrackBerry lovers back to
blackberry it used to be very very
popular part of me thinks maybe too
little too late and the second thought
is blackberry has to be very careful
with branding themselves as the secure
phone effectively putting an X on their
back taunting hackers to really come and
ruin their day what do you think well
one thing I think is that millions of
people never leave Facebook's walled
garden that's going off into the wilds
of the internet and there sure as heck
not going to go to your unknown crappy
web site with a dot info domain name get
a.com if you mean business why because
no domain name extension tells your
story with the same level of trust as
a.com or.net domain name dot-com and
dotnet domain name extensions and Jack
credibility into your online presence
