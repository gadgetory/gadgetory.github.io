bigger and with the new galaxy view
Samsung is aiming to take the biggest
leap yet
featuring an 18 point 4 inch display
galaxy view is the largest ever Android
device made but is it worth buy hey
what's up guys is Noah and I'm bringing
your first look at the larger-than-life
samsung galaxy view let's kick things
off with the 18 point 4 inch full HD
display which offers a paltry 119 pixels
per inch density
despite this low density however galaxy
view display is quite immersive and it's
definitely better in person than the
specs might otherwise suggest one thing
that is certain however is that the
display is large and when Samsung says
it's the largest Android device ever boy
do they certainly mean it running on
android lollipop the galaxy view comes
with the standard Android interface
coupled with a few new features designed
specifically for the large display by
far the most interesting of these is the
new visual video centric UI which brings
content from third-party service
providers directly to your fingertips
there are a few pre-loaded providers
with several more available to download
and at least from first glance there
really does seem to be something for
everyone under the hood the galaxy view
has an interesting set of specs
Samsung has thrown in a 1.8 6 gigahertz
octa-core CPU 32 gigabytes storage and
microSD card expansion along with
optional LTE connectivity one of the
biggest concerns you may have about such
a large device is the battery life and
Samsung says the battery will offer up
to 8.5 hours video playback of course
will need to test this further in the
upcoming review Samsung clearly believed
that there's a need for a large screen
device and while 18 point 4 inches may
seem unnecessarily large it's the ideal
size for someone who needs a media
device that can be carried but isn't
just one of these small tablet style
common plates on the market there's no
doubt that the galaxy view is a niche
product but depending on pricing which
hasn't been written yet it could yet
make its way onto several Christmas
shopping lists
if it was priced around 200 to $300 the
Gallic review would make a great device
to have in your home that's it perfect
for those times when you need a large
device that can be otherwise stowed away
when you're not using it it's worth
noting of course that pricing is yet to
be revealed so be sure to stay tuned to
Android Authority comm for the latest on
days there you have it a quick hands-on
with samsung's new larger-than-life
tablet what he fingered the galaxy view
