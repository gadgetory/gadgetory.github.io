hindi from android authority comm google
i/o is in full swing and that means a
new android p beta is available this one
looks like it's gonna be a lot of fun so
let's get started okay so let's start
with the stuff that didn't change all
that much from the first developer
preview this is mostly the under the
hood stuff and UI stuff from the first
preview the rounded colorful icons the
settings menu the app drawer and the
home page layout and design haven't
changed hardly at all from the first
preview in addition as we pointed out in
our previous android p video the
navigation of the UI doesn't change in
any substantial way from earlier
versions of android the home screen is
where it's supposed to be these settings
are where they're supposed to be any
quick settings are where they're
supposed to be there are actually quite
a few changes that we will discuss
momentarily however the overall look and
design hasn't changed from the first
android p dev preview if you want to see
all of that we'll have our hands on of
our first video linked up in the video
description below ok so let's get to the
new UI elements like we said there
weren't a whole ton of changes to the
looks but there were a few big features
that were added in the latest Android P
beta for starters the recent apps menu
is now a horizontal card view instead of
a vertical one you can swipe left and
right to see all of your open apps along
with the information that was on the
screen when you last left that app
additionally Android P now showed you
five suggested apps along the bottom
along with a Google search box you can
now close apps out of your recent by
swiping upwards and the recent apps menu
has also been renamed to the overview
screen these suggested apps in the
overview screen are the same as they are
in the app drawer but the app drawer did
get some new digs as well on top of
recommending applications the app drawer
now recommends actions based on the
stuff that you do David Burke showcased
this during the Google i/o keynote but
we imagine that we'll have to wait a
little bit longer for it to appear for
us these settings have had suggestions
for a few years now however the update
now puts them in clean white boxes
instead of the blue boxes from previous
versions it's a small thing but it
definitely makes them more noticeable
other than that aside from a few subtle
color changes and some new animations
like the one when you go back to the
home screen from an app the UI isn't all
that different and the changes are
mostly minor and shouldn't affect
usability at all oh and the Android pee
Easter Egg is still the same as well in
our first Android pee video this was the
shortest segment in this
it's gonna be the longest google
announced a ton of new android p
features during Google i/o this year and
we're gonna talk about as many of them
as we can the first and biggest change
is the new gesture controls you can
enable this yourself if you run Android
P by going into these settings going
into system and then gestures and then
enabling these swipe up on the home
option this enables the new UI on the
home screen all you see is the home
button however inside of applications
the back button makes its triumphant
return and using applications feels
exactly the same as it did with the
regular soft key setup we applauded
Google for changing things up but
leaving some things the same so as not
to cause confusion long pressing the
home button brings up Google assistant
as per the norm and short tapping the
home button will take you back to the
home screen as per the norm that much
hasn't changed you can do a half swipe
up to view the new recent apps menu also
known as the overview menu and a full
swipe upward will open the app drawer
you can also swipe up again from the
overview menu to access the app drawer
again and now finally we get to see why
the recent apps menu was redesigned you
can tap hold and move the home button to
the right this moves through your recent
apps much like a Rolodex when you let go
Android P opens the application you were
on when you stopped moving when you get
so far the recent apps will start to
scroll and once you're in this control
mode you can also move back to the left
to scroll in the opposite direction my
thoughts on this are a little bit mixed
swiping the home button to the right to
rolodex through your recent apps is
vastly faster than the old way however
I'm unsure about the half and full swipe
gestures for the overview page and the
app drawer respectively Android P did
seem to get it right most of the time
though so it's probably not a big deal
let's move on to some of the other
features a big premise that Google
pushed at i/o this year was digital well
being the forefront of that initiative
is the dashboard app this application
shows you things like your usage stats
what apps you use how often you use them
and a lot more from there you can limit
your own app usage by setting time
limits for all of your apps once the
time is up the OS will lock you out of
that app for a while so that you can go
do other stuff we were actually unable
to find this in the Android P beta so
we're not sure if this one is available
to people right now or not if you do
have access to it leave us a comment and
let us know other features follow this
same vein a new feature called wind down
automatically turns on do not disturb
mode and gray
out all of the colors on your screen to
indicate that it's time for bed
do not disturb mode was also improved to
completely eliminate notifications when
it switched on even from the
notification shade and the ambient
display you must turn do not disturb
mode off to view all of your
notifications finally it's easier than
ever to shut your phone up putting your
phone facedown automatically initializes
do not disturb mode and quickly pressing
the volume up and the power button
together put your phone on vibrate
quickly Google is calling that the new
shush feature the notification settings
also got a bit of an overhaul as well
there is a new manage notifications
button in the panel notifications you
can better adjust all of your settings
that are without digging into the actual
app settings
additionally Android P will remember
when you swipe away the same
notification over and over again and
start asking if you want to just silence
those particular notification channels
for good there are also additional
options for those who have apps assigned
as work apps and regular apps finally
there is a new screen shot annotation
feature after you take a screenshot
using the power menu you can tap the
edit button and edit the screenshot as
needed we take it that means the
screenshot feature in the power menu is
here to stay and we're still really
happy about it also before we forget the
rotate button introduced in the first
Android P beta is still there but the
icon has now moved to the other side of
the phone otherwise it does the exact
same thing as per the norm Google is
cooking up a bunch of under-the-hood
stuff that we didn't hear about in the
first developer preview of course all
the stuff from the first Developer
Preview is still true so again we
recommend you watch the first video we
did to get the complete picture here
we'll just talk about the new stuff from
Google IO to start with Google is
integrating machine learning into their
battery saving optimizations
it's called adaptive battery and
basically it uses machine learning to
determine which applications you use
infrequently it then limits their usage
to improve your battery life this is
something that we can't test yet because
it's been out for like a day but over
time this should pair well with doze
mode to save you a bunch of battery life
additionally Android people introduce
new tools to Android app developers they
include app actions and slices app
actions allows applications to bring up
pertinent parts of their application
inside of other apps such as Google
search slices is a subset of that
functionality that works almost solely
in Google Assistant Google search and
other apps
like that finally Google announced ml
kits an API that allows developers to
use machine learning in their
applications this could help in a
variety of ways however it's difficult
to say exactly how without knowledge of
how it'll be used inside of an app in
other words it'll be helpful in
different ways or different apps we also
believe that project trouble is finally
showing its power this particular
developer preview is available on all of
the pixel devices and then several non
Google devices as well
we'll have that list linked up in the
video description below if you want to
see it oh and before we forget Google is
applying their machine learning goodness
to the adaptive brightness as well the
adaptive brightness will take your input
into consideration when automatically
adjusting the brightness settings and
thus it will learn from how you like it
it's like the adaptive battery thing but
with brightness instead Android P is
shaping up to be a much larger update
than we originally thought the first
Developer Preview really was just a
preview and this one feels a lot more
like a complete product there are still
the occasional sluggish moments and
glitches but this also feels more
complete and usable than the first
preview Google is shipping this one out
through the Android P beta program on a
bunch of non Google devices so it's
probably safe to say that it's good
enough to run as a daily driver those
who want to try it out will need one of
the compatible devices and then from
there you just sign up for the Android P
beta on Google's website and an update
will be pushed to your device again it
will have that link in the video
description below if you want to try all
of this out for yourself and of course
we always want to know what you think
Android P is turning into one of the
biggest Android updates since the first
launch of material design this one
definitely no longer feels like just an
iterative updates tell us what you think
in the comments below and that about
does it for this one folks if you like
this video you know what to do and if
you didn't well you still know what to
do we have links all over the place in
the video description below if you want
to learn more as always thanks for
watching everybody and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
