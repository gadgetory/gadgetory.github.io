know about the Galaxy S nine well we
know more than we did two weeks ago the
Korea Herald has added to the
speculation of the galaxy s 9s improved
iris scanning technology with some new
details according to the website setting
a source familiar with the matter the
galaxy s 9 iris scanners lens will be
upgraded from 2 megapixels to 3
megapixels helping a better identify
users irises this will help the s nines
scanner in very bright or very dark
environments when users are wearing
glasses or when they're moving their
eyeballs around
additionally the Korea Herald reaffirmed
rumors that this iris scanner would
operate faster on the s9 compared to
previous iterations now let's talk about
a release date and many of you are going
to expect that it's at the Mobile World
Congress in late February or early March
and that still may happen but a report
from ventureBeat suggests that we may
see something as early as January
according to VentureBeat Samsung's
upcoming flagships are quote scheduled
to make their first public appearance at
CES in Las Vegas in early January but
the company is still expected to hold an
unpacked event in March where the two
handsets will be officially announced
it's also believed that the two devices
will come with the same curved displays
as the galaxy s 8 series this means that
we'll see a five-point 8 inch and 6.2
inch Super AMOLED panels with qhd+
resolution with an 1859 aspect ratio if
you remember the galaxy s 8 and s 8 plus
are identical except for screen and
battery sizes things may be different
when it comes to their successors though
the galaxy s 9 plus is said to have 2
gigabytes of RAM more than its smaller
brother 6 gigabytes vs. 4 gigabytes it
may also feature a dual camera setup
while the s 9 should only have a single
shooter on the back rumors also claim
that the camera could capture video at a
thousand frames per second for those
super slow-mo shots but there's no word
if this applies to both models and just
yet both devices are believed to be
powered by the same chipset they should
come with either an XO nose 98 10
or the unannounced Snapdragon 845
depending on the region in which you
live the report also mentions 64
gigabytes of storage a micro SD card
slot and a new location for the
fingerprint scanner but if you were
hoping for that fingerprint scanner to
be embedded in the display
maybe not the word on the street is that
it is just not ready for primetime yet
but they are gunning for the galaxy note
9
now what about design well we do expect
them to look very similar to their
predecessors with a few exceptions
Sam mobile reports the handsets will
have a smaller bezels below and above
the display the screen body ratio could
be as high as 90% which is roughly 6
percentage points more than the s8
series this will make the galaxy s 9 and
s 9 plus even more compact although the
difference won't be huge except for the
smaller bezels we don't expect anything
to change up front but on the back that
is different due to the fingerprint
scanners new location the backs of the
two smartphones won't also look
identical because of the s9 plusses dual
camera setup images of the two devices
haven't leaked yet but a fan-made render
based on the latest rumors gives us a
good idea what the Galaxy S 9 plus could
look like now let's talk about price and
it's going to be a lot the s8 and si
plus launched at 725 and 825 us making
them more expensive than their
predecessors even though the s 9 and s 9
plus likely won't offer a lot more than
the S 8 series rumors claim they will
come with higher price tags crazy world
we live in when a decent gaming laptop
is less than one of the major flagships
crazy world we live in what do you guys
think of those rumors and leaks remember
big pinch of salt with all this stuff
some of these rumors may be true Samsung
can change their mind some of them may
not be true at all but we have gotten
really good dang good at paring down
these rumors and really sharing the ones
with you that we believe are the most
credible we think let me know in the
comments below or on Twitter now my
audience is smart so smart that
sometimes you're inspired by a business
idea and then
try and get the name of that business in
a domain name and your next perspective
customer is searching your business name
and they assume you have the dot-com and
if you don't you're giving your business
away to the one who does that's the
power of a.com now why is that exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions and jet
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
