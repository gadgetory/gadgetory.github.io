with three cameras it was only a matter
of time until the company went even
bigger to make twenty hasn't even been
announced yet but the make 20 light has
just arrived with no less than four AI
cameras there's a 20 megapixel primary
sensor with F 1.8 aperture and the
secondary 2 megapixel sensor that's used
for depth information to create those
portrait mode bokeh effects but the real
action is on the front where a 24
megapixel camera with F 2.0 aperture is
supported by another 2 megapixel sensor
the selfie camera uses pixel binning to
combine light data from adjacent pixels
into what while way calls of fusion
pixel for better low-light selfies the
main 20 light is obviously targeted at
the selfie crowd the demographic that
used to be the sole domain of honor to
push the young and fun point even
further Huawei is introducing animated
cue mochi in the emui 8.0 software found
on the may 20 light because there's four
cameras you can also face unlock to mate
20 light from pretty much any angle the
six point three inch LTPS panel occupies
81% of the device's footprint it's full
HD plus with a 19 point 5 to 9 aspect
ratio and 2.5 D glass there's a notch
yes but it can be camouflaged in the
settings if it bothers you and you can
also enable the app drawer everything is
pretty much stock standard emui here so
you'll already know if you're going to
like a software experience on them 820
light or not it arrives with Android 8.1
Oreo onboard but we'll obviously be
updated to Android Pi in terms of design
the may 20 light is stylish if not
exactly or inspiring like some other
recent while way devices there's a new
keren 710 chipset backed up by 4 gig of
ram with 64 gig of internal storage
expandable to 256 gig with an SD card a
3750 milliamp hour battery is meant to
get average users over 2 days of usage
and heavy users a day and a half but
will wait for the full of you to pass
judgment on that hit that subscribe
button and ring the notification bell so
you're among the first to know when we
upload a new video if you're a mobile
gamer
GPU turbo and AI game suite will get you
a 60% GPU power increase with 30% power
consumption reduction it can also switch
from 4G LTE seamlessly so you'll never
miss a beat while gaming speaking of
beats plug a pair of headphones into the
3.5 ml headphone jack and you can enable
Huawei his'n 5.0 sound effects either
pick the preset you want or let them a
20 light work it out based on whatever
you're listening to in the wake of honor
encroaching on huawei territory with the
high spectacle
the make 20 light feels a lot like
huawei heading further in honors
direction given that the P series was
always treated as the photography range
in Huawei stable we can only imagine
what performance gains we can expect
from the mate 20 when it launches with
the current 980 chipset and then just
how many cameras we might end up with in
next year's P device may 20 light will
be available September 5 for 379 pounds
or 399 euros jumping into the same
competitive price bracket occupied by
devices with far more impressive specs
than the May 20 light but definitely
fewer cameras</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
