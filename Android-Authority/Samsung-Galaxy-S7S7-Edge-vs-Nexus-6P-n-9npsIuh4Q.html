Samsung Galaxy s7 and s7 edge vs. the
Nexus 6p these sones designs are vastly
different from one another the Nexus 6p
towers over the galaxy s7 edge and even
more so at the s7 the big reason for
this is due to the large top and bottom
bezels on the 6p it makes you're much
more tougher time with one-handed
operation all three devices are
beautiful offering aluminum frames
although this aluminum continues on to
the back of the Nexus 6p well on the s7
and s7 edge it ends to meet a Gorilla
Glass 4 backing it looks very nice with
the light reflecting off and this glass
curves near the frame to make for a
great feel in the hand although after a
while fingerprints will accumulate
ruining the phone's beauty and also
making it pretty slippery but Gorilla
Glass 4 is pretty strong and will hold
up against minor drops and scratches the
Nexus 6p is aluminum housing looks just
as beautiful in its own unique way it's
a very smooth texture but it's nowhere
near as slippery as a Galaxy phones on
the silver model here fingerprints never
show up which makes this phone always
nice to look at but it can scratch
pretty easily though now probably the
biggest story here is the curved display
on the s7 edge it does serve some useful
features but it's mostly there for
aesthetics and this design feature alone
is definitely going to turn a lot more
heads than the 6 pieces on the way this
curved glass reflects light and gives an
illusion of a bezel as display makes the
s7 edge in my opinion the best design
phone on the market even without the
curved display on the standard s7 the
thin bezels and minimal reflective
backing still has a 6p beat there's
going to be a perfect sized phone for
anyone here like I said the Nexus 6p
offers a large 5.7 inch screen while the
s7 edge sports a 5.5 inch one and the s7
is a smalls of the bunch at 5.1 inches
but that's really where the difference
is end both displays here are AMOLED
ones with quad HD resolutions
and in fact the Nexus 6p display was
supplied by Samsung last year so both
displays are going to look very similar
to each other the Nexus 6p display is
slightly warmer just barely but the main
difference is brightness where the
Galaxy phones outperformed the 60s by
miles but quality wise all three
displays are beautiful with very punchy
colors of course you have the curved
edges of the screen on the s7 edge which
creates this cool effect when moving
apps around or watching videos when
moving from an s7 edge to a Nexus 6p and
even a standard s7 I suddenly was aware
of how far away the display actually
sits beneath the glass all three
displays here are beautiful like I said
with the only big differences being the
actual sizes of the screen big movie
watchers or YouTube viewers are going to
love the larger displays on the 6p and
s7 edge while some may just prefer the
one-handed use of the s7 remember how I
was saying the Nexus 6 piece top and
bottom bezels are pretty large making
this a much bigger phone than your
typical 5.7 inch phone well there's a
big forgivable reason for this
front-facing speakers they are amazing
one of the best speakers on a phone at
the moment and they're aimed right
towards you which is ideal for any type
of media consumption they get very loud
- and are very clear the s7 phones
unfortunately are found on the bottom so
not only are they pointed away from you
when watching videos but they can be
very easily covered up and as for the
sound they're not very good either a lot
worse than last year's Galaxy phones but
with this unfortunate situation we
learned there is also a big forgivable
reason for this - behind the speaker is
a protective coating which creates that
muffled sound because the Galaxy s7 and
s7 edge are ip68 water-resistant
fingerprint scanners can be found on
both types of phones although the
placement is a lot better on the 6p
making for a lot less awkward unlocking
experiences as your finger is always
around the scanner while holding anyway
the speed of the scanner is also a
little faster on the 6p as well although
both are one of the fastest on the
market a big surprise this year is a
return to micro USB port on the Galaxy
phones the Nexus 6p came out a while
back now but still was able to support
the new USB type-c charging port
allowing for fast data speeds
is also reversible a very welcomed
addition with the s7 and s7 edge is the
addition of a microSD card slot that can
be accessed by pulling out the SIM card
tray when you pull out the SIM card tray
on the 6p it looks as though at one
point the 6p was going to be able to use
microSD cards but for some reason it
didn't make it to the market also is
worth noting that while you get
on-screen navigation buttons with the
Nexus 6p you have two capacitive buttons
on the galaxy's it's 2016
so obviously the newest Samsung
flagships are going to have a new batch
of specs over last year's Nexus 6p and
yes both the s7 and s7 edge have
identical processing power internally
the only difference between the s7 and
s7 edge is battery capacity the s7 edge
is to offer a larger battery thanks to
this extra thickness at a very large
3600 milliamps the six PS battery is
nothing to love it either though at
three thousand four hundred and fifty
milliamps although with the s7 being a
tad thicker than its curved sibling it's
still a much smaller phone having the
smallest battery of the group at only
three thousand milliamps battery life is
really good on each device but for me
and probably most users the Galaxy s7
edge will last the longest on average to
six people ask me all day with no
problems with four hours and 15 minutes
of screen on time the standard Galaxy s7
s battery has been greatly improved over
last year and although there are days
where it dies an hour before bedtime
there are more days where it has just
enough juice giving me close to
three-and-a-half to four hours of screen
on time all three folds are capable of
fast charging however even with a
different charging cables the galaxy s7
and s7 edge are capable of wireless
charging while the Nexus 6p is not
Geekbench gave the Galaxy devices a
higher score beating the 6p at around
5500 and t2 also has the Samsung devices
beating the 6p by a large margin at a
score of about 130 thousand which is
pretty crazy
although the Nexus 6p is running an
unaltered version of Android the s7 and
s7 edges faster processing package
allows for apps to open and load faster
than the six PS every time without
well another area where these phones
couldn't be any more different is their
software the Nexus lineups reason for
existence is to showcase Google's latest
version of Android without any skins or
tweaks it's a 100% stock Android
experience the way Google likes it and
with that on the Nexus 6p you'll get the
latest software updates immediately from
Google the day they are released however
with the Galaxy phones will have to wait
usually around a year for these updates
to be released but aside from this
though both phones are running Android
marshmallow however we have lots of
different design choices and features
the Nexus 6p offers a lot of material
design elements like the pulldown
notification shade where you swipe down
once to view notifications and again to
expand shortcuts the recent apps screens
are very similar to each other
although the galaxy s7 shows more of the
apps and offers a dual window mode but
later this year we Nexus 6p owners will
be able to do just the same the day
Android n is released at the moment the
Nexus 6p doesn't really bring any
special features when it comes to
software while the s7 edge is loaded
with them the main features here are the
edge panels thanks to the s7 edges
curved sides you can swipe across the
side to bring in edge panels which you
can customize to house your favorite
apps or even app actions like taking
selfies composing emails adding an alarm
and more people's edges here where you
can quickly access your favorite
contacts to color text and probably the
coolest panels to add are the widgets
like sports scores news weather and a
bunch of other cool things it's a nice
way to keep your phone organized without
having certain widgets or apps
cluttering your homescreen always on
display is another feature found in this
year's Galaxy phones or even when your
Galaxy s7 or s7 edges screen is off a
portion will stay on showing you the
time date or calendar although the Nexus
6p has ambient display which I actually
prefer a lot more because it actually
lights up the phone in a black and white
mode as the notifications come in which
allows you to see incoming notifications
without powering on your screen the
galaxy s7 and s7
edge does have a theme store though
which lets you customize the phones look
and feel and even sounds with a pretty
large selection software is very fast on
each TouchWiz is known for its lag enos
but this year it has been improved by a
decent amount once you disable certain
laggy apps or widgets like the briefing
screen you have a very solid software
experience and even though stock Android
isn't tinkered with it's not without his
freezes and crashes sometimes especially
when using certain apps and involve the
camera as of the time this video was
created the Samsung Galaxy s7 and the
Nexus 6p are kings within the camera
department this year Samsung lower the
megapixel count from 16 to 12 while
making the pixels themselves actually
larger which allows for more light to be
captured the Nexus 6p camera goes down
the same route opting for a lower
megapixel count with larger pixels and
in fact the pixels themselves are still
larger than the Galaxy phones the main
theme here is a galaxy s7 tends to take
really beautiful photos with a lot of
vibrancy however compared to the Nexus
6p you'll notice highlights blowing out
the Nexus 6p always does a much better
job exposing properly you'll see a lot
more detail within bright areas like
skies and clouds show up better and
overall you'll be able to see a lot more
detail in these areas but this does
sometimes make for a darker overall
image and even though you have more
detail in the highlights you'll lose
them in the shadows the s7 has more
post-processing trapping going on as
well which helps make for a crisper
image this vibrancy and sharpness really
are a great combination for a beautiful
image that at first glance sticks out to
you more so than the 6p but with greater
examination you'll see more information
with a 6p you'll also notice different
color shifts within these cameras with
the galaxy s7 being slightly warmer
you'll see these flowers are purple over
the six peas more bluish tone and if you
were wondering yeah the flowers are
actually purple the 6p will usually
change the colors of the image and sure
this looks nice but it's less realistic
the galaxy s7 does a full manual mode as
well where the 6p does not so adjusting
focal distance white balance ISO and
more is possible with the s7 and thanks
to the higher aperture on the s7
you get a really nice bokeh effect also
the focal distance is very short
allowing you to get crazy close to
objects while the 6p will really
struggle with that when it comes to
low-light photos though both cameras do
a great and similar job but once you
turn on HDR or HDR plus as it's called
in the 6p the Nexus 6p gets rid of all
the noise and boost colors for gorgeous
shots the 6p by far is the best camera
when it comes to low-light photography
the galaxy s7 is 5 megapixel
front-facing camera is fantastic due to
the wide-angle lens which really allows
you to capture the entire scene however
when you move into any area other than
outdoors you begin to lose a lot of
detail where the 6p still manages to
capture a ton of detail now with video
the galaxy s7 is hands-down a winner and
also the galaxy s7 has a fastest
focusing speeds on any smartphone
locking onto objects instantly where the
6p will take a long time and sometimes
just won't even bother trying to focus
but it's hard to say who's the actual
winner here in image detail and exposure
the 6p is a clear winner although when
it comes to image control and color
representation and video the galaxy s7
is a winner each camera has a strong
areas and weak areas and I guess it
really comes down to what you prefer and
now it's time to ask the question which
is the better phone this may be the
toughest comparison we have ever done
here at Android Authority according to
most people these two devices are the
best Android phones you can get at the
moment and they're both very similar on
the larger phones like the s7 edge and
6p you should expect all-day battery
life although a little longer with the
s7 edge extremely fast performance
although once again a small extra boost
with the s7 and beautiful designs but in
my opinion maybe a bit more beauty with
the s7 edge but more hardcore Android
lovers will definitely appreciate the
stock software of the Nexus 6p along
with its timely updates USB type-c is a
strong selling point for those users as
well but the lack of an SD card on the
6p is a pretty big downside I still
think the Nexus 6p takes a crown for
best smartphone picture quality but at
the same time it lacks manual controls
and is pretty mediocre at video while
the Nexus 6p seems to be perfect
in some areas it lacks and others and
while the galaxy s7 and s7 edge may not
be perfect in any areas there's not a
single area to be found there's anything
less than fantastic well thank you for
watching guys that is the end of our
comparison I want to know which phone
you like more so in the comments below
