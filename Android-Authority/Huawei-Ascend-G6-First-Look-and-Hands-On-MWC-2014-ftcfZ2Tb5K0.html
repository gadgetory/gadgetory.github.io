by bitdefender mobile security huawei is
new somewhat budget-minded smartphone is
really geared towards you selfie lovers
out there age Strasburg's are from
Andhra Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the huawei ascend
g600 we have here is a rather premium
looking device that continues with the
design language that while we launched
last year with the snp6
you do get the same clean lines without
any needless flourishes the same rounded
bottom and the same placement for the
buttons and ports the backplate of the
devices of a smooth plastic that doesn't
pick up a lot of fingerprints actually
and to the phone metal accents around
the camera and on the sides complement
the main material pretty nicely the
device is only seven point nine
millimeters thick very light and it
makes it easy to handle at all times
these are also in part two the rounded
plastic edges when it comes to the
display the ascend g600 LCD display of a
four point five inch size with a
resolution of 960 by 540 that means you
do get a resolution of 245 PPI which is
a bit of a ways of the density from the
flagships available but it's also not
that bad either given the price point of
this phone plenty of users will be
perfectly happy with the screen
especially with this easy handling and
it does provide decent levels of
brightness and nice lively colors at the
heart of the ascend g6 is a huawei made
quad core system on a chip that's
clocked in at 1.2 gigahertz we couldn't
really test it for too long of a time
during our testing but at least on this
pre-production units we felt that the
device was still quite responsive
there's one gigabyte of RAM and eight
gigabytes of storage which is pretty
much the standard these days for a
mid-range device another standard
feature that makes this appearance is
the micro SD card slot which is
incredibly welcome Huawei on the selfie
bandwagon really wanted to create a nice
camera that allowed you to take great
self-portraits so the front camera is a
wide-angle 5 megapixel shooter which is
a feature you don't see often on
affordable devices much less than plenty
of other ones even the more big
flagships the main shooter on the back
is an 8 megapixel shooter one feature
that we did get a look at was the ID was
the fact that when you tap on the
viewfinder in order to take a picture
using the front camera for a selfie it
will count down from 3 in order for you
to really get ready for your shot so you
don't have to fit all
with the camera shutter button in order
to get the pose that you really want and
powering everything is a rather small
2,000 milliamp hour battery but we're
not gonna write it often so we actually
know how thirsty the g6 is in real time
usage now the emotion UI on the g6 is
based on Android 4.3 with some extensive
modifications that while we made to
simplify them user experience while we
remove to the app drawer altogether so
all of the apps live on the app on the
home screen now coming from a different
UI you might find us a little bothersome
as without some organization it could
get really cluttered really fast one
thing we really did like however as you
can see in the video here is an even
simpler mode that was built into the
emotion UI that transforms the entire
interface into a set of brightly colored
tiles it does somewhat remind us of the
Windows Phone interface but in the end
it is Huawei's take on it and it's very
colourful very vibrant takes advantage
of the screen quite well and in all
honesty I actually quite liked the
simpler mode a little bit better at a
very affordable price point this phone
should be pretty accessible for all of
the general users out there and for
those of you who do like taking selfies
this might be one of the best tools to
have in your pockets once again this is

Huawei and we are reporting to you from
