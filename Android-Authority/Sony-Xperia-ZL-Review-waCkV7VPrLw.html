a previous review but did you know that
it has a smaller twin it may not have
all of the abilities of its finger
brother but the good news is it is still
a great little device tone hey Josh of
agar from Android authority what's going
on everybody and this is the Sony Xperia
Z L for the most part the Xperia Z L is
every bit the same phone as the Xperia Z
just a little smaller and missing a
couple of the flagship phones unique
features design is the first thing
you'll see with this phone it isn't the
completely glass encased body of the Z
though the front is still in keeping
with a rectangular shape with angular
corners the very same 5-inch display
makes a return here but the body around
it has been shrunken down and that's a
very good thing the front is completely
black with nothing but the sony logo and
the front-facing camera down on the
lower right corner but one that in a bit
the button layout is different here but
retains that large sturdy silver power
button it feels really nice and is a
good centerpiece for both of Sony's
flagship devices the volume rockers are
above the silver this time but there is
also the addition of a dedicated camera
button the sides are about the same as
found on the Z completely flat making
the grip on the sides just as easy
coming around the back the zeal does
away with the glass and instead has a
textured plastic there is a little give
if you really press down on the material
but it shouldn't really pose any
problems it looks nice and actually
helps the feel of the phone glass phones
sometimes slip about in the hand but
that is not an issue here at the bottom
is the only real eyesore in the form of
a small flappy cover it is important in
that it houses the micro sim and microSD
slots and while I don't really think
it's very particularly ugly it is held
by just one piece of elastic now you
shouldn't be opening it up too often
anyway but some care might still be
needed to ensure it doesn't break off as
far as the feel in the hand it is really
pretty brilliant 5-inch displays are
awesome as I have been convinced of
recently but as the phone's get bigger
they get harder to handle in one hand
Note 2 or Optimus G pro might not be
much bigger than the Xperia Z but it
still makes a difference and
honestly I'm just not used to it but to
take a five inch screen and make the
body as slim as possible benefits the
handling greatly the smaller the bezels
get the more attractive these larger
screens will be because they won't take
as long to get used to the Xperia Z L
and mind you the upcoming Samsung Galaxy
s4 is a great example of this I
personally think that it's a perfect
middle ground and is a strong suit for
this phone as I mentioned before you get
mostly the same bits with the Xperia Z L
as its slightly bigger brother this is
true for the screen you get the same TFT
capacitive screen that is five inches
large and displays 1080p resolution with
441 PPI the sharpness is still great
while the Bravia Engine built-in makes
this display look like a tiny Sony TV
but it does suffer from the same
problems as the Xperia Z all of that
glory is hindered by bad viewing angles
put the phone at an angle and the
display loses a lot of clarity and
fidelity the best way to view the screen
is dead-on and when you do so I'll admit
that it is still a great experience
performance should be the same in the Z
L as in the Z and that is pretty much
the story here the xperia z ll packs the
same 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon s4 pro
processor backed by the adrenal 320 GPU
and 2 gigabytes of RAM as far as
benchmarks go the scores are quite
literally the same with the zo also
scoring just over 20,000 nm - to
benchmark like the Z did the performance
is great as a result even if this
processor package is getting on a little
bit however the Xperia Z and ZL are
great examples of how the s4 pro is
still a great performance option and
should still stand the test of time as
was the case with the Xperia Z there are
a few different versions available that
are capable of LTE and then some that
are only for HSDPA networks take care
when ordering in your region so that you
don't get a version that won't work on
your network mine works just fine on the
t-mobile HSPA+ network now I was unhappy
with the speaker found on the Xperia Z
with its very tinny and shallow sound
profile but at least the now rear-facing
speaker is a little bit of an
improvement even if not by too much
battery life does have a small
difference in the ZL in that it has a 23
70 milliamp power unit inside 40
milliamp hours over that found in the
Xperia Z don't get your hopes up though
that minimal increase doesn't seem to
really increase the general lifespan
looping a video gave me the same five
and a half hours and if the reports on
the Xperia Z are any indication this
phone will have a good amount of
talktime otherwise and a lot of standby
time so it is still the same kind of
mixed bag that the battery in the Z was
there are power savings options like
stamina mode which turns off mobile data
when the screen is off so that can all
help you extend your time the Xperia UI
is a melting pot of design elements and
functionality but I think it works very
well
sony included the slightly outdated
jellybean 4.1.2 but opted for design
elements that look a lot like Ice Cream
Sandwich it is simple but elegant and
doesn't sacrifice features like Google
now and Sony's own Walkman application
which is a neat music player lastly
there are the small apps that overlay a
small application over what you're doing
for further multitasking the Xperia U I
impressed by being easy on the eyes but
is still very usable and finally there
are the cameras so that two megapixel
front-facing camera on the lower right
corner might seem a little weird but
apparently there is a reason for it when
video chatting sony found that people
tend to look lower on the screen well
below where typical front-facing cameras
are located so the camera placement will
make you seem like you're actually
looking at your caller and thus make
things feel a little bit more natural I
have yet to test it but let's be honest
do you ever really care where the other
person on the line is looking on the
other hand the rear camera is the same
13 megapixel Exmor RS shooter that
produces very nice shots picture quality
is more than adequate though the typical
issues with low light situations
continue here the flash diode does a
good job however of filling the scene
without blowing out the details
the app shows Sonia's experience with
cameras with the inclusion of superior
Auto which automatically sets the
appropriate scene for what is in the
frame after that you have the Full HD
video camera burst and sweeping panorama
modes for some extra fun and so there
you have it
it might set you back at least 700
American dollars unlocked but the Xperia
Z L takes the already pretty beloved
Xperia Z and puts it into a smaller more
accessible package which is in my
opinion its strongest suit sure you
might not have water resistance in this
different body but if that isn't a big
deal to you then you have a great
alternative to the slightly larger
Xperia Z it feels very nice in the hand
while being one of the fastest current
phones that brings the increasingly
popular 5-inch 1080p display viewing
angles aside which I in a number of
people honestly don't care as much about
there was a lot to love about the Xperia
Z and with the ZL I think I might have
found my favorite phone so far of 2013
