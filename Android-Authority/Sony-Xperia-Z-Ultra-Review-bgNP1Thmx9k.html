developed people complained about them
that they were getting too big
eventually this became the standard and
then about a year ago five-inch screen
devices started to come out and plenty
of people complained that they were
getting too big and now they've pretty
much become the standard well it looks
like smartphones are getting bigger and
bigger and Sony has come out with what
is arguably the biggest one is this
going to be the standard hey it's Josh
Arikara from Android thority what's
going on everybody and this is the Sony
Xperia Z ultra
sony has seemed to find its groove for
its Xperia phones as the general design
elements remain pretty similar putting
the size aside for now we see shades of
the Xperia Z in the rigid corners the
entire front is made of the screen and
the back simply has the Xperia neo pixel
camera in the top corner the button
layout is classic Xperia with the big
silver power button atop the volume
rockers that are all positioned right
where your right thumb would land and of
course because of the IP certification
we've come to expect from Sony phones
most every port is covered in a piece of
rubberized plastic I did see a problem
with the sim and microSD slot cover
because no matter how much I tried to
get it to feel secure it just didn't
until I tried much harder for the most
part you just have to make sure it's
completely flat and then you take a step
back and realize this is one of the most
attractive phones ever the black slide
design is in full force here even with
this white edition
at six point five millimeters thick and
two hundred and twelve grams light the
Ultra is like a featherweight of a phone
that feels simplistic despite not quite
being so in smartphone standards Sony
has always had a knack for making sleek
and somewhat futuristic looking devices
and this is a great example remember
what the House of the future was
supposed to have a big remote that
controls everything this basically looks
like that kind of like a proof of
concept but instead of controlling your
blinds it's a phone in the hand it's a
tablet there's really no other way
around it
this is simultaneously the biggest phone
and the smallest tablet as such working
with one hand is pretty much never ideal
though you could certainly try turning
the phone on its side and working in
landscape mode gives you a much more
natural feeling since the bezels at the
top and bottom are large enough for
thumbs ease of use in landscape mode
makes the Xperia Z ultra feel good and
make it quite like a personal assistant
in that regard as a phone this is far
from an easy thing to bring around while
thin enough to fit in most pockets it is
so tall that it will stick right out
then there's the fear that any awkward
tilts or bends will snap it in - it's
not that fragile by any means but you
can't help but feel that way with such a
tall and thin device attractive huge
practical one day fun another and then
just plain odd to handle yet
today there is really only one way to
describe this monster it's all together
the toy we dreamed of his kids but then
think of as overkill when we're adults
at 6.4 inches this is certainly one of
the largest phone displays you're
currently going to see though we might
be seeing displays that surpass that
1080p resolution the Xperia Z ultra
stuck to the tried and true capable of
1080p resolution and 344 PPI this
display is also backed by the triluminos
feature and the ex reality engine
thankfully sony has been improving on
their displays since the Xperia Z and
the Ultra is an example of this nice
evolution viewing angles are not only
now existent but are actually decent
well somewhat the enhancements bring a
good level of contrast among the colors
watching videos makes you feel like
you're holding a small sony bravia tv in
broad daylight however the brightness
does leave some to be desired
ultimately it's a screen made for mostly
indoor usage partially for its lack of
true brightness but also because of its
sheer size when it is done right however
this is a really fun screen to use the
other enhancement on this screen is its
ability to register touches from a
myriad of metal surfaces this is most
practical with say the back of a pen
perhaps the tip of a pencil here's a key
here's a headphone plug here's a quarter
here's the corner of my sunglasses
now here's where Sony didn't want to be
left behind with the Snapdragon 600 kind
of slipping past the s4 pearl found in
the original Xperia Z they were sure to
put in the current king the Snapdragon
800 in the ultra clocked in at a
whopping 2.2 gigahertz this package is
rounded out by the audrina 330 and 2
gigabytes of ram scores are incredibly
high in antutu benchmark and Epic
Citadel float about as beautifully as I
have ever seen it if this is the future
of smartphones then we're in for a good
ride performance and practice is as good
as it's ever been with all elements
flying by in multitasking with the small
apps remaining a breeze in hardware we
already know that the Z ultra has the
certifications for water and dust
resistance 16 gigabytes of onboard
memory is available even though there is
a micro SD card slot available for
expandability as far as sensors go the
ultra has actually fallen behind a bit
because it lacks an IR blaster so much
for controlling things with your blacks
light device in your home various
versions of the Xperia Z ultra are
available for various networks and LTE
connectivity so be sure of what you're
getting for your respective network a
3050 milliamp hour battery of incredibly
thin proportions powers the Xperia Z
ultra it's supposed to make an insanely
large phone like this work through an
entire day's work and play and it seems
to do so in my battery test I watched a
couple episodes of Top Gear that's 2
hours of some really high quality
programming and after those 2 hours I
got the battery down to about 70% that
would put the battery in straight media
consumption crack up to about maybe 7
hours in a full day's work the good
standby time and the power saving
features all helped the phone get
through that full day you might need if
you use it like a tablet with all that
continuous usage then you're probably
going to get tablet like longevity but
if you use it less intensively and more
like a phone than that standby time and
these power saving features will help
you get a lot more out of it
much like pretty much every tablet we've
seen the Xperia Z ultra camera does not
include a flash diode and that's usually
a hint to its quality in the app things
remain largely the same as in previous
experience you get the superior auto
that harkens back to cyber-shot days and
does a good job of getting the right
settings for your shots included are a
number of scenes for pinpointing those
best shot settings sweeping panorama
some picture effects other than that
it's more of what we've come to expect
from a smartphone camera picture quality
then is good enough for a device you
might not be taking many pictures with
without a flash unit you won't be taking
many low-light shots but luckily good
lighting helps make for pretty nice
pictures out of the HD ultra while this
one manages to be just small enough to
not look as weird as a tablet when
taking pictures it certainly does toe
the line and it's quality makes it a
camera backup rather than more of a
replacement shooter Sony's Xperia UI
hasn't changed a whole lot since the
Xperia Z but that isn't much of a
surprise
because the Z came out not too long ago
Sony keeps things pretty simplistic with
a UI that looks a little bit like Ice
Cream Sandwich while being fully jelly
bean 4.2.2 one notable addition I found
here is a built-in 1/8 of connecting
your ps3 controller to the phone so
that's really nice
otherwise you get pretty typical
elements in the much darker and less
colourful tones you get the different
Sony apps for media consumption like the
gallery and the Walkman and finally the
small apps small overlays that give you
quick access to little apps for
multitasking this is all on top of the
Google editions like Google now over all
the Sony Xperia UI is simplistically
elegant without really trying too hard
but that also might make it too
simplistic for some and for others maybe
it's just the right fit a price for the
stateside version of the Xperia Z ultra
hasn't really been put out yet but
currently it does sell on Amazon UK for
a whopping eight hundred quid in reality
though the American price should
actually be around 800 US the general
release info is still rather vague
however obviously for US tech people out
there the sony xperia z ultra is pretty
much just the next step it's not
necessarily surprising given what we
know about the smartphone market so with
that in mind it occurred to me to check
with my friends to see what the
reactions would be so here are a couple
of my friends reactions look yeah
this is what they bully you mother wait
oh wow Oh
something magical just happened so this
is first and foremost opponents on a
tablet yes it's a fun can't put this in
my program to be fair I would probably
be less likely to lose this I mean it's
hard to miss play something that's big
but it I like how thin it is yeah yeah
design wise one very heavy it looks I
like the rim maybe they'd read more
books and newspapers on here
I had reading a book on my iPhone the
other day in that kind of terrible
design bit is nice it was smaller than I
will get it if it was smaller I liked
the design very sleek got the dog no
what do you think shiny shiny tiny and
so there you have it if you've noticed
me going back and forth in this review
that's really just the nature of this
device at one point it's brilliantly fun
and the size is great for putting the
world at your fingertips in other
instances it's just not a very practical
device unless it's used primarily in
your office or home as you saw with my
friends this is certainly a surprising
phone to behold all at once this is a
phone that appeals to the toy driven kid
in all of us the speck hungry and the
part of us that is for all intents and
purposes just curious and when you
finally get your hands on the device you
will either find quite a bit to love
about it you'll probably hate the size
or perhaps you'll ponder that one day
this might become the standard
but at least for now it's not going to
be much for all of the best coverage and
