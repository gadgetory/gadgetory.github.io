manager at Google working on Google now
on tap
and this is a new feature coming and the
new release of android android m and we
have an early preview version that we
can show you so we can give you a sense
of how it works okay and so the goal of
this product is that Google and Google
now wants to help you wherever you are
on your phone whatever you're doing give
you some assistance right there in that
moment to make things easier for you and
so just I'll show a couple of different
examples of this because it works across
a variety of apps so let's say I'm in
inbox you know in any email application
and I get an email you know from a
friend asking me to go check out a movie
and I don't know much about this movie
you know I could go fumble my phone go
to some other app or go and do something
else but Google now on tap can help me
right here so I just you know tap and
hold and now Google is gonna take the
context of what I'm doing and help me
with a quick answer about what's what
I'm looking at here and so you notice
this card has come up here pretty
quickly and it's talking about this
movie if it's perfect - and the reason
we're able to do that is we're bringing
Google's knowledge graph which is
Google's information about all the
things in the world so we know about
people places things and this kind of
movie and so there's some ratings here
this coming from IMDB is love about
information about the movie I can go and
play the trailer on YouTube so I get
some quick information I can decide
whether I want to go see this movie with
my friend something that's really cool
and really important for developers here
is you notice these app icons here below
so there's IMDB Flixter Twitter and this
is coming from Google's work on app
indexing we have you know many many apps
which are participating app indexing
program and if those apps are installed
on my phone then they show up here this
is a great opportunity for developers to
get discovered by users right in context
right in a situation where the user
might find that useful so if I want to
go in IMDB check out more information
about this movie go on Flixter look at
the rotten tomato reviews go on Twitter
see what people are saying about this
movie I can do that right here right now
on tap really quickly okay so that's one
example you know with a movie so let me
show you another example here
maybe in another app so let's say I'm
having a conversation in viber which is
a chat app and page which is one of my
friends you know send me a message you
want to go to Coit Tower this weekend
she's never been so again like yeah I
could go for my my iPhone trying to
figure this out and try understand
whether I want to go there but I could
use now on tap again I just you know tap
on hold on the home button here and
Google uses the context of what we're
talking about here to show me some
relevant quick answer really quickly so
here it pulls up something different
last time was a movie now this is a
place so just from this quick answer
again from the knowledge graph I can see
okay this looks like some kind of tower
in San Francisco and then there's
different apps here I could try and
navigate there because Google is trying
to figure out the next action I might
want to take based on this information
and I want to check out some more
information about Yelp or might want to
go to no TripAdvisor and see some more
photos or see what people are saying so
just I'll click on that here and you see
I go right into the TripAdvisor app
right to the Coit Tower page deep link
there and that's really helpful to the
developer here obviously and then I can
browse around I didn't have to go
funneling around search in trying to
figure this out Google's trying to be
very helpful to me right away so another
way they can use now on tap is also by
voice so I'm going to show you example
of that so here I am in Spotify and you
know Spotify and all these other apps
don't have to do anything to enable this
functionality it's it comes right there
in Android and the next version of em
okay Google who's the lead singer
so another one here a friend of mine is
visiting Japan and he posted some
pictures so this looks like a show he
went to so I could say something like
like a long press obviously here and get
some information about this from now on
top so this looks like some venue there
other you know actions I can take there
I can press the microphone here show me
more pictures of this place so you see
Google when I said this place Google
knew that I was talking about this place
that I was looking at in the app yeah so
that's just show you some examples this
works across a variety of apps on is
coming in the next Android M release and
it's Google trying to be helpful to you
with Google now Google now on tap no
matter what you're doing on your screen
in that moment to give you assistance
give you actions and answers to help you
what you're doing Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
