J is your relatively slim and light
phone and this is the Google Nexus 4 by
LG where your Android thority with the
team we're representing in force here at
CES 2013 hello everyone my name is Joe
handy from Android Authority comm and
today we're going to be taking a look at
Sambi Highway I hope that you enjoyed
our coverage at the Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona Spain some really
really great functionality inside the
galaxy s4 that quite honestly the iPhone
5 is not able to match for some time now
HTC devices have generally been known
for excellent build quality
overall as you can see the app runs
quite smoothly no force closes no
nonsense like that to activate it you up
back down as LG has done some very
interesting things here this is for you
guys
300,000 everybody in Google Play weekly
we're going to be telling you about all
the best things that have happened in
the Google Play Store
over the last week oh sweet a plastic
encased version of their flagship
smartphone - one welcomed Android peeps
my name is Jason and today we answer
your submitted questions 500,000
subscribers the envelopes were pushed
and the app ecosystem will never be the
same again and stop our faces
okay we're about to run out of battery
right okay what the hell is new edition
hey well whoever they were Bobby Brown
wasn't it hey what is going on guys lon
here from Android authority so there you
have it guys this has been the Nokia X
and the future is colorful my shirt I
hope josh is terrible at this game
have you ever compellingly exemplified
proactive articulating and converged
data-driven establishments yes you're
going to be bled and bled bad but it's
not even really about the phone it's
about what the phone stands for
so I'm Gary Sims and this video is all
about me 1 million subscribers 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 million subscribers that is
absolutely fantastic you know we're
constantly trying to think of how we can
search better CES 2015 shaved into the
sides of his head which is freaking
amazing everybody and welcome to the
first episode of the Friday debate
podcast by Android Authority where we
are today is a very exciting place so
there it is the $35 Raspberry Pi 2
written by our own Joe Hindi please join
me in sending him the hashtag don't be
cute eat the fruit this is Bailey Stein
with Andrew Authority and this is my
full review of the blue selfie and in
this quick video we're going to take a
look at the Android M preview Oh Andy
this is for you oh so now I think we're
just gonna end up calling it the Andrew
thority podcasts so watch a long name oh
I know
a nexus 7 installed in the dash of my
truck just in time for my road trip on
Thursday hello everybody this is amazing
mx-5 I'm crystal it's nice to meet you
guys it's the end of Eva and they are
having a dance party over there and it
is nuts these drums are pretty much
gonna be our new little homes for the
next few months so it's important to
make them feel like home being able to
create a product that is a
representation of you is something you
can't put a price on the 5x isn't ly
best bang for your buck smartphone is it
perfect of course not but it's a lot
closer than lollipop was it is missing
NFC however which is a bit unfortunate
considering that the original zenfone 2
headed this chatter proof display is not
an excuse to treat your phone like it
has no feelings from all of us here at
under authority wishing you a very Merry
Christmas and a Happy New Year
but when it comes to the appearance of
the phone there is the price to pay with
phones that have removable back knees
this is why I switched to the iPhone and
then right back again
more enemies
hey what's up guys this is Bailey Stein
with Android authority hey guys John
Velasco here with Android authority now
that's going to take some time getting
used to because we thought we would get
together and just discuss them and this
will be what we call your triple threat
versus that's what I'm gonna go listen
guys later
