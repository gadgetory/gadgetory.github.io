brought to you by domain.com alright so
today I'm on a mission to debunk five
myths surrounding your device's battery
life it's not so much as a complete myth
per se as it is partial truths that can
get you into trouble just like when your
woman asks you do I still look good in
this draft yeah you look fantastic
ten years ago so when relationships
partial truths may help things along but
in tech not so much so let's debunk myth
number one and that is that you
shouldn't charge your device overnight
now modern devices today are able to
protect themselves from overcharging or
overheating for the most part but here
is the grain of truth to this myth
ideally if you want to extend the life
of your battery to the maximum you don't
want to charge the device to 100% nor
drain the device's battery to 0% this is
because doing so will shorten the life
of your battery now do I do it no I have
a life I just charge it and I don't
worry about it it's really not that big
of a deal unless you really want to use
this battery or the device for you know
three years or something like that
otherwise you shouldn't have a problem
number two don't use your device while
it's charging now this myth has really
been perpetuated by reports of phones
blowing up in someone's hand or face
while they were using it and charging it
at the same time now although this can
happen it is by far the exception and
not the rule and it's almost certainly
not going to happen because you're just
simply charging it and talking with it
and the third myth is that you shouldn't
use third-party chargers well you should
know there's some great quality than
reliable third-party charges out there
but it is generally accepted that
third-party chargers will not charge as
well or fast as proprietary chargers
directly from the phones of manufacturer
you also want to be careful to ensure
that the charging capacity of the
charger is consistent with the needs of
your phone sometimes it can be a
mismatch there and that could
two problems the other issue with some
third-party chargers is quality issues
you could have a wire that's frayed or
frays very easily and now you have a
whole fire hazard so you want to be
careful of that just do your basic due
diligence check on reviews do your
research and you can find a very good
quality third-party charger out there
number four and it's hard to believe
this is a myth at all but the myth is
that it won't hurt to leave your device
in the car or exposed to the elements
hmm all right seems painfully obvious
but clearly it's an issue for some
people you do not want to leave your
device in the car exposed to extreme
temperatures whether extreme cold or
extreme hot and obviously you don't want
any rain or even condensation to get in
the device because over time that may
short out the electronics in the phone
and you want to be careful with that at
least if you're going to keep your
device in the car and a very very hot
and sunny day keep it under the seat or
in a cupboard where it's not going to be
exposed the Sun it will not survive it
and the fifth myth and it's a big one
you have to let your battery drain to 0%
before you charge it again now this myth
comes from rechargeable batteries you
know the ones you would get for your
electronics those double a's and triple
a's well those did have to be fully
drained before you could recharge them
again doing otherwise would lessen the
capacity of that batteries charged
but batteries have evolved that is not
an issue anymore you most certainly do
not need to drain your battery to 0%
before you charge it again on the
contrary you want to avoid draining to
0% as much as reasonably possible now I
know that some of you geeks out there
have dreams dreams of running your own
YouTube channel or website or business
or whatever it is and one of the first
steps is to secure the domain name lock
that down so no one else can get it and
with all the new domain name extensions
that have been released the
possibilities are endless because it's
not just about ComNet or guinea more you
now have the opportunity to name your
site and build your brand's and ways
never before possible choose from a
growing list of 200 plus domain name
extensions like ninja NYC expert or
