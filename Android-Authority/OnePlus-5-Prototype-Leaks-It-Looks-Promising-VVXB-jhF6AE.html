and the one plus three T to one plus
five so what happened to one plus four
well the number four in Chinese has the
same pronunciation as death so it would
be like calling your phone one plus
death which wouldn't be a good name
unless you're a geek and you're thinking
could be good design sketches of the one
plus five have appeared on Weibo but
according to our sources they show a
prototype model rather than the final
design of the one plus five nevertheless
we can assume some of the features will
make its way into the final product
including the hotly anticipated dual
camera and the popular alert slider but
other features only serve to reinforce
the likelihood of the sketches being a
prototype only the sketches also show a
ceramic half shell on top of metal glass
I'm talking about the antenna bands to
indicate a metal build while this would
make for better reception
it would also add significant additional
material cost to the already inflated
camera bill we've predicted the one plus
five might cost even more than the one
plus three T but this would be a little
too much for a mainstream model as a
quick refresher the ceramic version of
the oneplus X costs an additional
hundred dollars over the regular onyx
version and had a yield rate of just 20%
this is a cost-benefit ratio one plus
would be unlikely to go with on a
primary flagship even if the ceramic
panel is smaller if anything we'd only
expect to see ceramic used in a special
edition run of the one plus five moving
on to less contentious features is the
USB type-c port speaker grille a 3.5
millimeter headphone port and a pinhole
mic appear on the bottom edge of the
sketch we don't get a look at the chin
of the device but we presume that this
is where a fingerprint scanner will be
located and not under the display glass
although who knows feel free to
speculate the two inset diagrams on the
camera appear to show both dual lens and
single lens options which could be
interpreted as a sandstone finish around
the camera glass and that single lens
inset also has as puzzled as it seems to
show a laser autofocus module like the
one they used on the oneplus 2 before
they switch to PDAs on the oneplus three
it looks like the camera bump might be
set for a return to so you know where to
place right now where people the
comments I know will be super excited
that there is a headphone jack
that's where we're at right now most of
the smart phones in the industry are all
very much the same they're copying Apple
or Samsung they're all chasing the
leaders and that's just where we're at
not too many people want to try
something crazy and new look what
happened with the LG g5 the whole
modular option it was cool for geeks but
it didn't really take off in the
mainstream my question is why is it that
geeks like you are not equally as
excited about new categories like you
know the connected speakers or of the
wearable devices or that kind of stuff
is it because they're just not a new
product out there that really excites
you I would say it's partly because most
of those products are not so personal
there's no emotional attachment like
there is to a phone where your whole
life is wrapped up into the phone you
connect to the whole world through the
phone right so what category could be
around the corner in the next 18 months
to three years that really could take
over that spot for you let me know in
the comments below
meet Jeremy shoemaker otherwise known as
shoe money and he became famous for this
photo where he showed off a cheque that
he made from Google Adsense and he's
become so good at making online
businesses that he made an announcement
that he does not start a new business
unless he can secure the business's name
in a dot-com now why is that exactly
well no domain name extension tells your
story with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions and jet
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
don't forget you get 15% off when you
