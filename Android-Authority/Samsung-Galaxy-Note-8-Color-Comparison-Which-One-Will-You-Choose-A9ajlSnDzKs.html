thority and I don't know about you but
the color of my smartphone makes all the
difference in the world and if you're
purchasing a brand new Galaxy Note 8
you're probably curious what the options
are and what they look like so let's
take a look at all the available colors
for the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 so this
year's Galaxy Note 8 is going to be
available in four colors you have
midnight black orchid grey maple gold
and a brand new color that Samsung is
introducing called deep sea blue what I
love about all these colors is that no
matter which one you pick the front on
all of them are black the same way it
was on the galaxy s 8 which to me looks
a lot cleaner and ties in nicely with
the blacked out camera modules on the
back midnight black will most likely be
one of the more popular color choices
because after all you can't really go
wrong with black it's completely blacked
out giving you a super stealthy look and
one of the safer choices if you prefer a
more neutral looking color the only
downside to the black version is it'll
most likely show fingerprints much more
easily than the rest of the colors next
up is orchid grey or as I like to call
it the robocop edition orchid grey was
one of the more unique colors that was
introduced with a galaxy si and it's
made its way over to the note 8 it's
somewhat of a difficult color to
describe because it doesn't always look
grey depending on the lighting
conditions that can sometimes with blue
and other times have hints of purple
which is why this particular color is so
unique this chameleon-like paint job is
really beautiful to look at and
something you have to see in person to
truly appreciate and I'm glad Samsung
has chosen to continue using this color
my personal favorite out of the bunch is
the maple Gold aka the gold Ranger I
haven't been much of a fan of other gold
phones released by other OEMs simply
because they usually come with white
fronts but we finally have a gold phone
with a black front I've been a huge fan
of the black and gold color combo for a
very long time so the maple Gold easily
was the first one out of all the colors
to grab my attention it's clean it's
sexy and as a color that would
definitely stand out if that's what
you're looking for finally we have the
newest color that Samsung has added to
the mix called deep sea blue this is a
very different shade of blue from all
the Blues that Samsung has used in the
past and as the name suggests it's a
very deep shade of blue it's another
code that complements the black front
and camera module extremely well if
you're looking for a color that is
pretty eye-catching but it's nowhere
near as flashy as the Mae
Gold DC blue is going to be your safest
bet if you're in the u.s. you're
probably wondering how many of these
colors will be coming to us carriers and
just like previous Samsung releases the
answer is not all of them midnight black
and orchid gray will be coming to the US
while my favorite color maple gold and
the brand new deep sea blue color
unfortunately will not so you want to
get your hands on those colors you'll
most likely have to import it or buy
unlocked
unless Samsung decides to change their
minds later on so that wraps up all the
colors of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 they
all look fantastic let us know down in
