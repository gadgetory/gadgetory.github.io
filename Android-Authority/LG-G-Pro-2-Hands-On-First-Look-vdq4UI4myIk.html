by bitdefender mobile security LG might
have announced the blown-up version of
their flagship device ahead of the
Mobile World Congress but that didn't
stop us from being excited to get our
hands on it hey it's Josh regard from
Android hey what's going on everybody
and here is your first look at the LG G
pro
2 LG continues its good design language
with the G pro 2 it is a large device to
be sure with a big bold and very
beautiful 1080p display up front at five
point nine inches this is definitely a
beast of a device with a large footprint
but it also stands among the best
offerings in the Android space the G pro
2 incorporates what a lot of people
loved about the g2 with its knock-on
features it so is camera that has been
enhanced and a very thin bezel leading
to a high screen to display size ratio
and of course the button placement on
the back however it does do away with
the glossy plastic that was originally
on the g2 and opts for a more matted
design on the back coming back to that
display we will say again that is a 5.9
inch 1080p display and even though that
does make the phone quite huge it is
still manageable because LG continues
its penchant for ultra thin bezels and
it has an industry-leading screen to
frame ratio here on the G pro to the
still industry-leading
Snapdragon 800 coupled with the audrina
330 GPU is found in the G pro 2 and
really packs a wallop under the hood
putting this phone still near the top of
the performance pack and our time with
it we experienced not much of a stutter
at all in the optimist UI even despite
all that it tries to be quite in your
face about and LG was also very keen to
elaborate with us the huge strides
they've made when it comes to the
software sides of things especially in
regards to the camera which now has an
updated version of oh is called oh is
plus and their image post-processing is
supposed to make the images pop even
better stay tuned to Android authority
as we will be comparing the camera on
the G pro 2 to that of the g2 and
comparing the different versions of all
is especially considering this one
enhanced with a little bit more software
behind the hardware that was already
well received in the g2 as far as the
other hardware bits underneath we are
please to see three gigabytes of RAM in
here and a very good size 3200 milliamp
hour battery that should keep you
entertained for hours as far as internal
storage goes we have a 16 gigabyte or 32
gigabyte variety available along with
microSD expansion which means you won't
run out of space to store the 4k videos
that you can take with that oh is plus
camera the G pro 2 does feature Android
4.4 KitKat an updated version that is
still nestled under the Optimus UI which
remains very familiar to us and also the
Optimus UI does have a bit of a
polarizing effect especially considering
the people who do love all of the
features that it brings to the table as
you may have known from the original
Optimus G all the way to the g2 now
however some do admit that it is in need
of a refresh as its elements are quite
in your face especially when you take a
look at the notification drop-down where
all the real estate is taken up by the
power of widgets however there are some
enhancements added into the Optimus UI
this time around and we're told that
these enhancements are going to make it
to all G devices in the coming months to
make handling such a large device easier
for example you are allowed to have some
one-handed operation enhancements and a
new feature called mini view is
available that allows you to adjust the
display area from 3.4 inches to 4.7
inches to make one-handed operation
easier the one that we really enjoyed
using was the NOC code an evolved
version of the knock-on where you can
double tap the screen to turn it on
however this time you can create a
pattern along a 2x2 square grid in order
to make unlocking the device even easier
all in all we are still excited to see
LG move forward especially with their
larger device offerings the already well
received optimus G pro has been updated
and its inspiration takes from the g2
even though the device might be a little
bit bigger for some people's taste it
still packs a wallop inside in both
hardware and in software and it should
be a nice offering for all of those who
do look for a larger display device so
keep it tuned to Android Authority for
all of the best coverage and for our
continued coverage of not just the LG G
pro 2 but also of the Mobile World
Congress here in Barcelona Spain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
