authority and we're taking a look at
sony's new xperia x line here at Mobile
World Congress 2016 so there are three
devices here we have the xperia x
performance xperia x and the xperia x a
instead of the glass and metal designs
of previous Sony phones the bodies of
the new X line is constructed entirely
of metal and it looks and feels quite
nice but the overall design with the
rectangular and somewhat boxy look is
still very reminiscent of other Sony
phones that we've seen in the past
the Xperia X performance is the highest
end model of the bunch it comes with the
latest snapdragon 820 processor three
gigs of ram a 1080p display on the front
waterproofing capabilities and a
fingerprint sensor embedded into the
side mounted power key which we weren't
able to test out because the demo units
were pre-production but we assume it
probably works just the same as the z5
premium there's a 13 megapixel camera on
the front for all of yourself portraits
and along the rear is a new 23 megapixel
lens and it's a pretty familiar sony
camera experience the one new feature
that sony was touting was the hybrid
autofocus which is supposed to do a
really good job of tracking moving
objects to prevent motion blur when
snapping a photo but this is something
we're going to have to test out later
when we're not dealing with a prototype
with unfinished hardware and software
the Xperia X is identical to the X
performance in a lot of ways but there
are a few key differences it doesn't
have the same brushed metal backing or
waterproofing capabilities and you're
getting a Qualcomm Snapdragon 650
processor instead but otherwise the
majority of the specs like the 1080p
display cameras and fingerprint sensor
are pretty much all the same the Xperia
XA is the mid-range model out of the
bunch but it's probably the most
eye-catching the 5-inch display on the
front is only 720p but it runs edge to
edge which really makes the phone stand
out and the glass ever so slightly
curves along the sides the rest of the
specs are also fairly run-of-the-mill
instead of a Snapdragon processor you're
dealing with a media tech chipset 2 gigs
of RAM
16 gigs of internal storage microSD card
expansion a 2,300 milliamp hour battery
in 8 megapixel camera on the front and a
13 megapixel camera on the rear they're
all running on Android marshmallow with
Sony's Xperia ion top which should be a
familiar experience for any hardcore
Sony user but one big change that you'll
notice is it's a lot cleaner with
flatter and more simplistic looking
icons over the 3d ish looking ones of
previous versions and overall it just
blends in a lot better with the material
design aspect of Android the Xperia X
line will be available sometime this
summer and that's about as specific as
Sony is willing to get right now but
we'll definitely keep you up-to-date on
Android or 30.com this has been a quick
first look and hands-on of the Xperia X
line by Sony here at Mobile World
Congress 2016 stay tuned for the rest of
our coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
