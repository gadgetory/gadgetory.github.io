name is Kevin the tech ninja and today
we are reviewing another Lenovo product
this is the yoga 2 tablet now I know
before you guys go ahead and scream and
rage quit and leave comments down below
this is a different version of it this
is Lenovo yoga tablet 2 8 inch it has
the exact same specs but the performance
is different why is that well let's find
out just like it's tennis brother the
yoga 2 8 inch is a sleek tablet mostly
silver in color with a variety of design
materials you go from a smooth kickstand
to a gritty back and then back to a
smooth bezel it would be hard to find a
person to say this isn't a uniquely
designed tablet because it is looking
head-on you can see the silver trim
you're also greeted with generously
sized bezels holding in landscape the
front-facing camera is on the side bezel
at the bottom or side depending on your
orientation the front facing large
chamber studio speakers are visible
following the curve around we will see
the front of the stand to access the
stand I use my thumb to slide the stand
out The Stand sports for different
angles or as Lenovo calls them modes
these modes are called stand hold tilt
and hang on the right flank of a stand
is the 8 megapixel camera continuing our
journey rightward to the bezel the
volume rocker micro USB port and also
power button is found all sporting that
attractive brush aluminum style the top
is completely bare and the opposite side
bezel is the headphone jack right now
I'm going to say a statement that you
will hear several times throughout this
review just like the 10-inch yoga 2
these two devices are the same under the
hood the 8 inch IPS LCD display is full
1080p resolution the pixel density is
283 which gives it text that pops off
the screen
this includes images to the color
reduplication and saturation looks great
the high shine and the shadows gives you
a sense of depth the blacks are also
rich in color IPS LCD s in general just
look great and the yoga too does a great
job at using it the processor that I
uses sounds like something you'd expect
in a computer or a tablet running
Windows not Android typically we see the
Snapdragon powering most of Android
devices lenovo decided to go with intel
intel was a leader in computer
processing lenovo opted to go with the
Intel Atom 1.3 gigahertz 2 gigabytes of
ddr3 for memory intensive apps and also
16 gigabytes of on-board with an
optional SD card slot that expands up to
64 gigabytes the two large front-facing
speakers that I mentioned in the design
section aren't just there for looks
it has Dolby audio built into it and
also Wolfson Master HiFi the chassis is
built from plastic now I hate to say
this but I did attempt to bend it just
because I felt some flex when carrying
at one time the yoga 2 does flex a bit
and I'm not sure if it's because it's
doing yoga or the plastics and internals
aren't able to withstand a large amount
of pressure I can't say that it will
bend or not but I'll let you be the
judge of it this isn't exactly the specs
you'd expect from an android tablet but
how well it performs is most important
right the yoga 2 8 inch makes me scratch
my head since it's the same device as
the 10-inch one would assume that it
runs the exact same way I did mention at
the end of my review on the 10 inch
device that I think the performance
issues are software based not a hardware
issue
well when using the 8 inch almost all
the performance lag that I had with the
10 inch is gone opening applications
flipping between screens multitasking
and multi window applications all felt
smooth I won't say it runs as smooth as
a nexus 7 but it's still pretty good
one thing that you will continue to
notice is that transition
are not as smooth it just feels a bit
choppy but that does not take away from
the speed this device absolutely flies
when gaming that's when the yoga flexes
its muscle as expected all games ran
smooth from dead trigger to Riptide to
cross erodes all ran with the consistent
high frames per second and also great
responsiveness as I do with the written
reviews all the benchmark scores are
linked down below in the written
companion piece the yoga comes out of
the box with Android 4.4.2 kitkat it's
also running lenovo's own UI skin on top
of Android some would say is very iOS
like and I would mostly agree there
isn't an app drawer and the quick
settings are located at the bottom via a
menu Lenovo calls bottom switch the
bottom switch gives you tacos like Wi-Fi
autorotation airplane mode GPS and a few
other things it also has a brightness
control camera lockscreen screenshot and
Lenovo smart switch Lenovo package is a
good amount of applications on the
device most of the applications they
supply are applications that would
either have came with stock Android or
there's a better alternative in the Play
Store one application that sticks out
for the bunch is security HD which scans
your permissions for applications has an
app manager ad blocker and also the
speed up utility which I didn't use much
beyond that most of the applications are
forgettable and quickly become
background annoyances the camera is a
yoga tablet are okay at best the
location of the rear 8 megapixel camera
is in an interesting one while holding
your device in landscape and you launch
the camera instantly you need to adjust
your hand your hand naturally rests over
the camera once you take only a few
shots you can quickly see what the
camera has to offer
images let color grain is evident even
in decent lighting and the shutter is
pretty slow if you rapidly tap the
shutter button the camera cannot keep up
even in good lighting using studio
lighting I was able to get better shots
but that was after adjusting a lot of
settings prior to the shot Lenovo does a
great job at supplying you with manual
adjustments for the camera
white-balance brightness/contrast and
other controls to get a decent shot
these settings need to become your best
friend for video the camera is able to
shoot at full HD 1080p and the issues I
had with the pictures translate to the
video mode the microphone is decent and
it picks up your voice pretty well and
that's about it now some people may
argue that a camera on a tablet isn't
important but if you actually look at
the statistics and you walk around and
see people are using a camera on any
device they have and a lot of people a
tablet is their number one device and
it's something they use for photography
especially older people since the screen
is a lot bigger for them to use so the
manufacturers have to provide tools for
the way that people are using their
devices so that's why tablet photography
is turning into a real thing and a lot
of companies are actually putting money
and putting technology into tablet
cameras so this is a trend that is going
upwards and you're going to see a lot
more devices coming with cameras on them
and you're also going to see a lot more
enhanced features on the tablets even
versus the phone and that was my review
of the yoga 2 tablet now of course this
tablet isn't the fastest tablet in the
world or it actually isn't the smoothest
tablet but for $250 to get a nice
multimedia tablet that has a pretty
decent processor in there and it's
really good for games and also
exceptional battery life you really
can't go wrong lenovo has made a lot of
strides with this tablet versus the 10
inch Edition not sure if it's software
or what it is but it actually is a
decent tablet that I don't mind picking
up and using as always guys my name is
