Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly
let's get right into those headlines her
stones next year's expansion dubbed the
grand tournament will be getting
released in the next few days on August
twenty-fourth this is a huge update that
will help freshen up things quite a bit
and will include all kinds of new
features are stone players rejoice as
promised at e3 Square Enix has in fact
released final fantasy 7 for mobile
unfortunately it's only available in iOS
right now but if history repeats itself
that means it's coming to Android
sometime in the next couple of months
and we definitely can't wait for that if
all out shelter continues to turn heads
as it quickly becomes one of the most
popular android games of the year and
maybe one day of all time bethesda
released an infographic to show the game
success with some very surprising stats
including over 1 billion sessions played
to date the latest pc and android humble
bundle is out now and includes several
awesome games including three that are
brand new to android you can pick up all
six games plus whatever is coming soon
as long as you beat the average which is
just under three dollars right now and
it's also a great way to give to charity
earlier this week android six-pointed
sufficient aim and with that to the
final Developer Preview along with that
google also announced that the Play
Store will begin accepting applications
that are marshmallow ready which is very
exciting because we're about to see a
ton of Android 6.8 scumming very soon
for even more Android apps and games

below to check it out and don't forget
to subscribe okay folks let's take a
look at the apps and games that made a
big splash this week as usual if you
want to check any of these applications
out you can find the links in the video
description below vincy is a new video
streaming application that showcases a
bunch of independently made short films
out of asia it's a little niche but it's
free to use and some of the films are
actually really good every video has
English subtitles so you can read along
if you don't understand the language and
the application will promote videos for
you to check out every single week
there's also a queuing system and
downloading for offline use it's
actually fairly decent if you like Asian
films pac-man 256 is a new spin on the
classic arcade game and this one instead
of navigating mazes until you eat all of
the pellets you're instead doomed to
follow one endless maze forever which
technically makes this one an infinite
runner kind of game however most of the
game mechanics remain intact and it's
essentially a standard game of pac-man
that never ever ends it's free to play
and comes from the developers who also
did Crossy Road move loot is a new
application that's kind of like the
craigslist of furniture using it you can
buy and sell furniture of all shapes and
sizes for whatever price that you want
it's well-designed and easy to use but
there are a few issues it's only
available in a select number of cities
and there are some release date bugs
that still need iron doubts keep an eye
on this one though it's not amazing yet
but it has a ton of potential Mozilla
has been busy lately and they released a
new application called webmaker as the
name implies you can use this along with
a cursory knowledge of CSS and HTML to
create web pages right on your phone
there are some release date bugs but
otherwise the application seems to be
pretty decent it's not like an advanced
tool or anything but it can be fun for
beginners or those looking to have just
a good time it's also totally free and
open source square enix released final
fantasy 7 but they also released the
final fantasy portal application this
app is kind of like a news application
that gives you news about all things
Final Fantasy including game releases
and announcements and information about
books music games and merchandise what
makes it interesting is that the
application also has the triple triad
card game from Final Fantasy 8 which you
can actually play and collect cards for
it's a must-have for Final Fantasy fans
