Andrew authority now one of the most
important core designs for 2016 and
beyond is the cortex a 72 and it's the
core that's used inside the new Kirin
950 system on a chip so today and then
we're looking at the performance of the
cortex a 72 and the Mali t8 80 GPU that
are inside the quirian 950 so if you're
ready let's go the arm analysis is
called it's a 72 back in 2015 and this
design has three main goals first of all
they wanted to bump the performance up
to the next generation of 64-bit
computing second they wanted to decrease
the power usage increase the efficiency
of the processor and thirdly they wanted
to shrink its physical size on the die
which of course helps manufacturing cost
as well as several other things and now
we have to cure it 950 our protists are
built by high silicon which is a
subsidiary of Huawei and we find it
inside the main 8 and the cuing 950 is
an octa-core processor it uses four
cortex a53 calls now we're used for the
court is 853 we've seen them in lots of
phones last year but he said of court
it's a 57 cause we now have cortex a 72
cause there are four court it's a 72
cores running at 2.3 gigahertz and then
accompanying the CPU is the Mali t8 80
now I've taken the mate 8 and I've run
lots of different benchmarks on it
including some of the popular ones from
the Play Store including antutu and
3dmark and so on and I've also used
three of my own in-house developed
benchmark which I wrote myself but can
we can double check that the scores
we're seeing on the external benchmarks
are true to form so if you're ready
let's start look at some of these
results of course the first is Iran was
and - - now I'm using an - - version six
which has changed little bit from the
previous version the numbers have
changed how it does the calculations are
a bit different however this particular
device scored in ninety one thousand and
eighty seven and that's the highest
score I've ever seen from and - - now of
course we need some context what does
that mean where are other phones so I've
also ran these tests on the Galaxy Note
5 and the Sony z5 compact
the galaxy note5 has of course the
external seven protists are in it and of
course the sony has the Snapdragon 810
so that will give us an idea of where
the how the performance has increased
with this next generation of CPU so the
scores for the Exynos 7420 in and - -
version six were seventy seven thousand
nine hundred and eighty nine and for the
Sony
it was seventy-six thousand four hundred
and ninety-seven so obviously the 91
thousand and eighty seven of the Kirin
950 in the may take it quite a
significant jump the next is Iran was
CPU prime benchmark as you can guess
from the name this program calculates
prime numbers lots and lots of them and
sees how long it takes and then gives
out a score so the ki-rin 950 scored
thirty one thousand one hundred eight
compared to twenty two thousand eight
hundred and sixty two from the note five
and twenty thousand seven hundred
seventy one from the Snapdragon 810
inside of the Sony is eight five Compaq
and of course no CPU benchmarking would
be complete without running Geekbench
now Geekbench gives us two scores one
which is the single core score which
tells us how fast just a single core
runs as amer with an eight core or quad
core a ten core processor how fast is
one individual core and of course then
there is the multi-core score which
tries to run all the core at the same
time to see what scores it can achieve
so let's have a look at those results
for the single core test the keyring 950
scored 1772 and that compares to 1504
and 1385 by the X naught and the
Snapdragon respectively so obviously
that's quite a significant increase in
CPU performance and for the multi-core
we have 6089 by the queuing 950 5258 by
the external seven and four thousand two
hundred and ninety-five by the
Snapdragon 810 so again now we see the
multi-core score go up over six thousand
so clearly the CPU in the Curie 950 is
far faster than the
pee-yew in the Snapdragon 810 and in the
Exynos 7420 before we go on to look at
the GPUs course doesn't remind you that
all these numbers can be found over at
the annual authority comm website
there's a written companion that goes
along with this video and there you'll
see various tables in charge where you
can see all the different scores for all
the different benchmarks I've run
against the m88 now it's a for the GPU
first of all epics it's built the mate 8
is able to run epic to deal an ultra
high quality mode at 59 frames per
second well that's near perfection if
we're talking about 60 frames per second
being the maximum speed that these
displays can handle and that compares to
forty nine point two frames per second
that's on the note five and fifty eight
point five frames per second as on the
contact Zed 5 of course we must remember
the screen resolutions are different
across all three phones for example the
mate 8 is a full HD the resolution on
the samsung galaxy note 5 is much much
greater and of course it's much much
lower on the 75 come back to just 720p I
then ran 3dmark first of all I ran the
slingshot demo and the scores are quite
interesting the Huawei mate 8 scored 902
23 which actually is worse than the note
5 which called 1278 and worse than the
Snapdragon 810 which scored 1168 so
certainly it looked here as if there is
some performance issues with the GPU in
the kilian 950 is it software is it a
bad implementation I don't know at this
moment however I was expecting slightly
higher scores than this so I then I ran
the another test inside 3dmark this time
the ice storm extreme which also include
some off-screen rendering which
hopefully levels the playing field when
it comes to the different screen
resolutions so let's have a look at
those results the huawei mate s core
1926 and again that slower lower then
the note 5 which called 25,000 and
seventy three and the Snapdragon 810 in
the z5 compact we've scored twenty seven
thousand one hundred and sixty so again
half of those three phones the GPU part
of the curium 950 seems to be a little
on the weak side and then get me wrong
it's still a very
good score it's a very very powerful
implementation of this Molly T 880 GPU
however I was expecting higher schools
benchmarks are great however something
closer to real life may be more
interesting now normally we would run
some tests for maybe game startup times
for multitasking and so on however there
are other things that affect those
results including the speed of the flash
memory and how much RAM there is inside
of the device
now I'm not testing the mate
specifically I'm trying to get at the
speed of its system on a chip
so therefore if it's hard to run a
couple of JavaScript tests now
JavaScript is important of course klitz
the engine that's in the web browser and
web browsing activities we're always
using javascript so in real they use
we're always seeing how fast this
javascript is and how it affects our web
browsing experience now there are two
benchmarks one by Mozilla which is
called cracker and one by Google she
could octane and I ran both of them to
see what performance they get out of
this particular system on a chip I'm
using Chrome from the Play Store across
all three devices the same version of
Chrome so hopefully this will give us a
good idea about some real-world
performance numbers so here they are
with Kraken the lower the score the
better and the ki-rin 950 scores 3524
which compares to the 3753 of the
external 7 and the 4253 of the
Snapdragon 810 now with Google octane it
is the higher scores are better and the
qe9 50s cost ten thousand eight hundred
and sixty eight while the external seven
scores nine thousand one hundred and
seventy four and the Snapdragon 810 nine
thousand one hundred so we can see again
when it come back to CPU uses that
clearly the court is a seventy two
inside of the keyring nine fifty is a
really really good CPU as I said earlier
I've written my own in-house benchmarks
so that I can verify the results that
we're getting from these external
benchmarks I've got three benchmarks the
first one just does some calculations it
calculates primes he does some hashing
he does some bubble thoughts and then it
gives me a number which tells me how
long it took to run all those tests so
the lower the number the better the
score I then have a 3d water simulation
test which puts in drops of water into
bucket there's some physics motion
calculations that need to go on and
basically one drop of water is putting
every frame now at 60 frames per second
the maximum number of water droplets
that can go in is 5,400 and we'll have
to see what the results are but I think
you'll be quite surprised and then I've
also got a 3d benchmark that I wrote in
unity 3d it flies around a landscape and
then tells me how many frames a second
it scored so let's have a look at my
results topher hashes bubble sort and
prime numbers occur in 950 scored 19,000
and 74 really really low compared to the
external seven which called thirty
thousand three hundred and seventy and
the Snapdragon 810 which scored twenty
two thousand nine hundred and thirty
seven so according to my benchmark again
the court it's a 72 is an absolutely
fantastic CPU core design now moving on
to the water simulation as I said before
5400 is the maximum score you can get
now I'll tell you the scores first of
all for the note 5 and for the z5
compact the note 5 scored five thousand
three hundred and forty nine and the was
a five compacts worth 5222
so didn't see the note fire was all most
areas about 51 frames that it dropped in
the whole series of that test now here's
the amazing news the Huawei may test the
curing 915 the huawei mate s scored a
perfect score of 5,400 it dropped no
frames during my water simulation now
that's absolutely brilliant but it also
means I've got to write a new benchmark
now because this one is not going to be
any good this year because all the
phones are probably going to break that
5,400 barrier so what's this space for
the next iteration of my benchmark now
finally I use my unity3d benchmark that
I wrote and that gives me frames per
second so here are the results the
huawei mate s managed to do three
thousand five hundred and forty three
total frames during the simulation which
gave us a frame rate of 22 point eight
three frames per second now the note 5
scored three thousand four hundred and
thirty two total frames during the
exercise which was a frame of twenty one
point four eight frames per second and
then the z5 compact had four thousand
eight hundred total frames and a FPS of
forty-two point two two
and as we can see the Sonia's a five
comma had the best score in this test
and that's mainly due to its 720p
display although the mate 8 actually ran
faster than the note 5 in this
particular test me to remember that the
mate hate has a full HD display where's
the display on the note 5 is much much
greater and I'm sure if they both have
the same displays we would find that
their keyring 950 was actually
underperforming when compared to the
Exynos 7420
and so what does all this mean well
basically the court is a 72 is basically
the fastest core design that I have seen
in a hand royde phone so far now of
course there's lots of competition
coming down the pipeline we've got the
Snapdragon 820 we've got the new
processors from Samsung so we're gonna
have to see how this chip compares with
some of the others later on in the year
when they become available
however today this is the fastest CPU
that I have seen on an Android device
also the Mali 880 GPU doesn't seem to be
performing quite as well in the quirian
950 that might need some further
investigation however is still a very
powerful GPU well my name is Gary sim
from Andrew Authority and I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please do
give it a thumbs up also please use the
comments below tell me what you think
about the cortex a7 - design what do you
think about the keyring 950 what do you
think about the huawei mate s I'd be
really interested to hear your opinions
also don't forget to subscribe to handle
authorities YouTube channel and as for
me I'm there see you in my next video
you might think making videos is easy
well you know about the old red lorry
yellow lorry red lorry yellow lorry
we'll try saying cortex a53 quarters
1872 called as a fifty three quarters a
72 quarters a fifty three quarters
eighty seventy two court it's a fifty
seven quarters a fifty three quarters a
seventy two not that easy you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
