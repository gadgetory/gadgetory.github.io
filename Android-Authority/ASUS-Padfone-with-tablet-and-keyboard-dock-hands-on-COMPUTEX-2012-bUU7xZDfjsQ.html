Android Authority my name is Darcy
lacunae we're just here at the Aces
booth taking another close look at the
Asus Padfone now this already has hit
the market in Taiwan we're looking at a
price of 21 7000 NT which is roughly 900
US dollars
powered by of 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon
s4 it's a just a beautiful beautiful
device to begin with actually it's a
AMOLED qHD 960 by 540 display and here
let's just try and figure this out as
you can see the internals of it but this
is the brain and this is the shell let's
just put it in like so and you can see
the response time is actually quite good
guitars right up just like that Android
Ice Cream Sandwich right out of the box
so the battery life in the phone itself
is going to be quite good we're looking
at a fifteen hundred and twenty milliamp
battery now in in the tablet itself
we're going to be looking at a six
thousand this excuse me
eight thousand six hundred no and
battery so we're gonna be getting
roughly eleven to twelve hours of
battery life altogether now we have an
eight megapixel camera on the rear here
we can't unfortunately close it because
of the security mechanisms they have on
it but it is comparable in terms of
weight and size to roughly every tablet
that we seem so far here at Computex CES
and other tech events around the world
so we're looking at at 1280 by 800
resolution display I mean yeah now
another thing that consumers often ask
and want to know about is the keyboard
dock
now unfortunately asus has made it so
that all the keyboard docks for each one
of their products are unique so we're
not going to be able to use a keyboard
dock from the 700 series over the 300
series but it just locks in just like so
you can see a click and then we have
access to a really a great keyboard
actually it's very responsive just go
back home of course with Android Ice
Cream Sandwich we can see that the 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon the power
is it just beautifully really really
smooth
yeah this is just a closer look at the
the PadFone so the whole thing together
is only $900 pretty heavy but for all
you're getting all tired by one sim it
eliminates the need to you know from
multiple seams for multiple contracts
for multiple data connections they have
told us also that they are speaking to
AT&amp;amp;T and auntie UT has expressed serious
interest in acquiring the pad phone has
a subsidized device call you North
Americans yeah so other than that it's
just a closer look at the Asus Padfone
again really good response time powered
right up right away and the AMOLED
screen and just beautiful
yeah that's what if this guy's Asus
Padfone here my name is Darla cuvette
