especially the ones that we're seeing
most recently with the gear VR and stuff
like that they're really cool but after
the demonstration that I went through I
am now a believer in VRA it's Joshua
government or authority what's going on
everybody and this it's just my reaction
to the demo of the HTC vive now
obviously I'm not going to be able to
show you what it was that I was able to
see inside of our demo but I can't show
you the unit itself this is only a part
of all of the components that will put
together the entire steam VR experience
that you might end up enjoying in the
coming year nonetheless what we have is
the full head on unit that actually fits
glasses actually what we will do is just
put this on real quick and you'll see
you put on I'll look a little silly for
now but this is essentially what it is
they told me if you go snorkeling this
is kind of what it's the same sort of
movement to get this on it's a very
large unit that will immerse you into a
particular world you have headphones on
in order to hear what is going on around
you and two controllers that will allow
you to interact with the world around
you but two laser units will be put on
particular parts in your room in order
to create what is effectively the room
that you will be in creating this space
that you will actually walk around it
and that is the crux of the HTC vive you
will actually be able to walk around the
environment that is created for you
using the world in steam VR and inside
of the demo I got to go through five
different places in order to really
experience this for myself now immersion
obviously is what is important about the
HTC vive and that's exactly what you
have to do you kind of have to let go
and be a part of the world that is
around you the first demo was of a
shipwreck and I was walking around and
before you get into the the actual
world's themselves you're in a
particular just like a very valve very
steam like grid it's just white
everywhere but as you come up to the
boundary that the lasers create for you
you see a mesh agree
front of you and that is the boundary it
kind of ingrained into your mind that
you something bad will happen if you hit
that if you go past it you might fall
you know because of the sensory
deprivation that way that immerses you
into the world that you're about to
experience is really what makes you feel
like okay I better not go outside of
these boundaries and that is when the
demo truly began you go into a shipwreck
and there are there are rails on in your
underwater there are rails all over the
place that you get to walk up to and
look over and see the rocks below a huge
whale appeared in front of me and I got
absolutely terrified of it and you could
reach out and try to touch you but of
course you're in a virtual reality world
after that was a cooking demonstration
very much like the simulators that you
might find on steam if you know that
fellow gamers out there and you can pick
up parts of the world using the
controllers or triggers and you can
actually hit buttons on there that
interact with the world I tried to chop
up some vegetables I made a soup picked
up a plate threw it at the wall and it
exploded in my face and it was a it was
just a really good experience but what
really would really blows people away
who do this particular demo is the final
demo which was an aperture world now I
said aperture and all of you guys out
there who know about portal and maybe
even half life 1 to the hope for three
those are the things that really us
people really want to see in these VR
platform steam VR with all of the games
that steam has if we are able to be
immersed into that world that is what it
is I was trying to repair a robot from
the aperture world and I couldn't figure
it out I think they've set you up to
fail because you can't find the part
that you have to repair and as you're
trying to rotate everything around
trying to open up this robot you're
walking around trying to find the tools
that you need it's it's an incredible
experience and it's just something that
I wanted to share even though
technically I can't really share it in
the rich way that
I want to but nonetheless this is the
HTC vive this is the unit itself and
really it's it's an incredible
experience and there are so many
components are going to go into it i'm
told that they're all going to be
Wireless even though obviously in these
in these demo editions they are tethered
because that this is going this is going
to be a developer edition that will be
sent out to the to the people who are
going to develop for it and they need to
have all of the variables kind of put
into place but the final units are going
to be Wireless there are endless
possibilities for this I was thinking
about a simulation type of deal where
let's say you wanted to teach your kid
how to drive well you can put them in a
car and actually see all the components
that will happen and really see what
it's going to happen or maybe even a
couple years down the line may be a
heart surgeon is going to be able to see
a body in front of him and be able to
see all the parts that when he is
actually at the table he will be able to
know exactly what he's looking for not
necessarily have to perform in the
virtual world but at least be able to
see what's going on and then of course
movies video games of course that
aperture world is still blowing my mind
because you saw everything happening and
when GLaDOS came in and reprimanded me
for how bad my work was I was terrified
because there was GLaDOS right in front
of me I hope you gamers out there or
with me right now because you're the
ones who will understand what I'm saying
and you what happened just is blown away
in this demo as much as I was but in any
case I really am looking forward to it
HTC is of course a big part of the
Android family and we wanted to see what
they were up to with valve with their
HTC vive this isn't necessarily an
Android device but it's coming from a
manufacturer that has android pedigree
in its blood and we wanted to see what
they were going to do outside of the
Android world and this it really does
look like at least to me a really good
place for them to go so keep it tuned to
Android 30 for all of the best coverage
including perhaps a future review of the
HTC vive we're not too sure what is
going to happen once we get our hands on
review unit I will give you my thoughts
perhaps in one way or another but until
then keep it tuned to android authority
Mobile World Congress is slowly coming
to its end and we are now here at the
final couple days so keep it tuned here
and remember that we are your source for
all things HTC
