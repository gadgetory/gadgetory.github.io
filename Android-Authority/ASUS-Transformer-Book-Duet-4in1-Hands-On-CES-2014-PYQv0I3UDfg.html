by Toyota so you might have heard about
the two and one tablet or two in one
notebook or the all-in-one but masseuse
is going for the all Holy Grail for in
one because using Windows and Android
they have created a device that not only
brings you a laptop experience but a
tablet experience in four different
flavors this is the transformer book do
it all right and this is the Asus
Transformer book do web this is the
brand new device from masseuse that
allows you to have a Windows laptop or a
Windows tablet all in one experience and
as you can see here it is Android
through-and-through with a Seuss's own
UI on top and we're just going through
the Android space here and you can see
it's all really familiar however what
happens here is that once you have a
docked inside of the station here there
is a button right over on the top right
that allows you to change from Android
to Windows 8 change into Windows right
now and it's a four second change and
here we are we are in a full of Windows
8 environments it's a very very great
way of just getting all your work and
play done because you have two different
platforms to be able to do so so if you
happen to be a bit of a Windows user
because some software works on that and
it's not necessary available on Android
you are able to on this device go to
Windows and use what you need and then
when you want to get let's say some
other tasks done like some simple word
processing or even some Android gaming
you can jump right over to the Android
space like I did right here the
processor inside of the station is an
Intel Core it could be an i3 in i5 or i7
processor which were fine which will
provide a lot of power for the window
side of this device after that as always
we have already been saying that it is a
dual OS Windows 8 and Android but what
makes it unique is that you can use both
of them whether you're in a tablet or in
a laptop setting that allows you for two
settings in the laptop two settings in
the tablet portion that allows for this
four and one device to come about the
dual storage on here does have storage
built into the tablet itself at 64 or
128 gigabytes or in the docking station
you can have anywhere
three hundred twenty two one terabytes
in a hard drive the display here is a
13.3 inch IPS display at 1080p
resolution which means that it pretty
much rivals a lot of the smaller laptops
out there today and is pretty much
sizable next to them however of course
like we keep saying it has a little bit
of a trump card underneath and that it
can be a docking station a tablet or a
full laptop all in one as far as the
weight goes it is 1.9 kilograms and
actually if you ask me it's really not
all that bad once you close it up it
does look very nice with this nice
brushed finish right here it is plastic
all around and really the weight doesn't
really detract from the handling at all
this is something that is really ultra
portable and of course when you have
just a tablet in your hands you can do
even more with it as a portable device
so that is the Asus Transformer book
duet this is the four in one tablet and
laptop solution that is available you
can switch between Windows and Android
pretty much seamlessly it's like a four
second delay in between and it allows
you to get a lot of stuff done on the
fly when you really needed to so stay
tuned to our channel for all of the best
CES 2014 coverage once again this is
Josh freghar from Android Authority and
once again thank you to Toyota for
sponsoring our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
