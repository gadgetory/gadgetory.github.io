Authority what's going on everybody and
today we're going to be taking a look at
two of the hottest phones in the market
right now both of which are
coincidentally made by LG the Nexus 4
which just came out no more than maybe a
week or so ago right here we have the lg
optimus G and this is a version that is
found on Sprint which is also the
international version not quite the one
that is on 18 T but we'll get into that
a little bit later and I've been
spending some time with the Nexus 4 and
I've spent quite a bit of time with the
next with the lg optimus G together and
I want to give you sort of my thoughts
on these two powerhouse LG phones so
let's go ahead and get started
the interesting part about this
comparison is that these two phones are
really fraternal twins LG has really
come out of the gate with two powerhouse
phones that actually have a lot of in
common the lg optimus G comes with an
awesome quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro
processor that packs the zero gap
technology on its four point seven inch
screen on the other hand the Nexus 4
packs a quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro
processor with zero gap technology in
its four point seven inch screen so you
can see where the dilemma is I swear
there are some differences between these
phones for starters the Nexus 4 takes a
much more rounded shape that is a lot
like the Samsung Galaxy Nexus the
rounded corners make it seem smaller
than the Optimus G but really it's
pretty much the same size I've said in
my previous review that I love the look
of the optimus G it has a black slate
look with a flat front that just looks
incredible the two Torx screws on the
bottom are a nice touch and the back
sports that really nice crystal
reflection effect the Nexus 4 on the
other hand doesn't have that black slate
look and it looks a lot like the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus it is a very clean look
though and the Galaxy Nexus proved that
this is a tried-and-true design the
screen does look great and those
trademark LG torque screws are found on
the bottom to the Nexus on the back is
surrounded by you guessed it a crystal
reflection design as well honestly it
really does come down to your personal
preference while I really love the
industrious look of the lg optimus G the
Nexus design just feels familiar and it
really helps its appeal both phones feel
great in the hand too so I can't really
give the edge to either phone in this
maybe we'll find something in the
screens both phones have a true HD IPS
display that has zero gap technology
that means the corning gorilla glass
layer is the only thing between you and
the display it really helps of the
responsiveness of the screen and it
really is nice in practice both screens
are pleasing to the eyes and after I
even brought both phones running the
same game closer to my eyes I found no
true differences between these sharp and
crisp screens in reality all I really
got were dry eyes and a headache so I
guess it's a tie on this one to
performance is great on both these
phones because both of them have
quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro CPUs and
Adreno 320 graphics processors the lg
optimus G is listed among the top
Android devices and benchmark ratings
and when it comes to the Nexus 4 and as
you can see both of them are running
this test right now the Nexus 4 pretty
much ranks right beside it the
experiences on both phones are buttery
smooth fast responsive and with 2
gigabytes of RAM multitasking was no
problem at all you're pretty much
getting a great experience either way on
both these phones and I'm starting to
realize that there's a trend in this
comparison let's take a look at the
cameras I mentioned in my Optimus G
review that I was excited at how it's
camera shows the potential for
smartphone cameras I actually found that
with some good tools it was pretty much
possible to get a good picture or some
good video out of this phone and 13
megapixels is quite a number and LG
packs a bunch of other nice features
into his camera to time-lapse shot for
example is a useful tool that gets a
bunch of shots during your shutter press
so you can pick the best one and being
able to take a picture using just your
voices honestly pretty cool too now
while the Nexus 4's camera has less
megapixels at 8 it does come with the
new jelly bean 4.2 camera app and it has
a really nice interface now instead of
traditional menus you can press and you
are in the viewfinder and then swipe
around to the appropriate area for
changing your settings aside from that
it does come with the photosphere for
360 degrees Street View like photos in
this comparison even though I found that
that Optimus G came with some cool extra
features I also found that it didn't
really render color it's quite like the
Nexus 4 pictures from the Nexus 4 were
just a little more pleasing to my eye at
least in my opinion the way that the
Optimus G floods life
washes out some of the detail in the
color nonetheless both are capable
cameras and if you want the sheer power
and extra features you can go the
optimus G but in this case I just found
the image quality of the Nexus 4 to be a
little bit better now here's where
things do start to look a little
different the Optimus G does compact
with the dated version of Android and
Ice Cream Sandwich see the reason for it
not being with the time so to speak is
because LG has to put together its own
Optimus UI to put over Android operating
systems and it does take time to put all
of those things into the stock Android
operating system so the devices can
sometimes get left behind by official
Google devices that are always updated
and are on the cutting edge LG however
did put some good thought into their UI
as the Optimus G comes with one of the
most customizable stock interfaces
around it already does look nice and
professional but as you can see here a
lot of the things are customisable like
the theme and in this case the
lockscreen the Nexus 4 on the other hand
comes with the latest and greatest that
Google has to offer a jelly bean 4.2
this brings with it features like Google
now which is a nice search and
information center widgets for the
lockscreen
and updated camera that you saw earlier
and an expanded drop down that shows
most of you used settings behind your
usual notices now having Google in your
corner is definitely a nice thing to
have as the Nexus line will always get
the most updated operating systems
before all other phones the Optimus G is
a couple versions behind in the Android
game by now and though it will get the
jellybean update soon it is only a
matter of time before Google releases
yet the next version of Android and then
all the other phones will have dated
software again as an Android nut and a
bit of a purist and I know there are a
lot of you out there having the Nexus 4
means that you have the most updated
software and that's really enticing for
a lot of people and I have to say that's
the same for me as well so in this
department I have to give it to the
Nexus 4 as well a final point of
contention we'll use in this comparison
is the connectivity one of the most
publicized features missing in the Nexus
4 is its lack of connectivity to 4G LTE
instead the phone is natively able to
run on HSPA+ networks which is not quite
as fast as LTE but it has been reported
that speeds are definitely adequate
enough for a majority of different tasks
if 4G LTE is really important to you you
might not get the speeds you want from
the Nexus 4 so that would leave the
Optimus G since it is able to do 4G LTE
on top in this department however I do
have to reiterate a point I made in my
in-depth review of the Optimus G that
Sprint coverage is not that widespread
across the United States yet there is a
definite lack of LTE in a long list of
areas and if you don't live in a spot
getting for Sprint's coverage then
you're out of luck on speed 18 T does
carry the Optimus G and has more
coverage so you might be able to find it
there
and so there you have it the lg optimus
G and the Google Nexus 4 by LG it's
really tough to lean in one direction
over the other especially with these two
devices because they share so many
similarities in reality it really does
come down to your personal preferences
and what carrier you happen to be on if
I truly had to pick one device however I
do think that I would have to go with
the Nexus 4 with the latest Android OS a
familiar feeling to its design and the
promise of first dibs on all future
updates
it really is deserving of the Nexus name
still though the lg optimus G is
seriously a great phone I love it's
black slate design and overall it's one
of my favorite looking phones ever with
the same performance as the Nexus 4
however I really feel like the dated OS
is the only thing that holds it back as
you can tell in this comparison it was
really hard for me to come to that
decision so for my full written
comparison and my in-depth review of the
Nexus 4 coming soon head on over to
