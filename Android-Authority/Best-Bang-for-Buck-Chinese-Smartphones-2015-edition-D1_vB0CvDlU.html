hey what is going on guys this is Bailey
with Android authority and these are the
best Chinese smartphones that you can
buy for under $160 just to be clear
Waller list does include tried and
tested smartphones please do keep in
mind that there are also many other
exceptional offerings available in both
the Chinese and other worldwide markets
as always be sure to do your own
research to determine which device best
fits your needs and include support for
your carrier before making a purchase
for full resolution camera samples and
benchmark scores please check out the
written post by using the link in the
description with that said our first
recommendation is the recently released
meizu m2 note although it falls just
within our price bracket at $159 we feel
that it stands out the most and
subsequently offers the best bang for
the buck the strongest aspect of the m2
note is undoubtedly the 5.5 inch 1080p
sharp IGZO display which looks like it
would belong on a phone costing more
than twice as much as the m2 note in
addition to the exceptional display the
m2 note offers a commendable design
surprisingly solid build quality and
great battery life the camera is also
capable of producing some nice-looking
images although your results may vary
based on what you choose to focus on due
to an overly sensitive spot metering
mode unfortunately it's not the fastest
performer on our list with a 1.3
gigahertz mtk 675 3 processor but that's
not terribly noticeable unless you're
playing graphically intensive games or
comparing it with faster devices the
speaker while fairly loud does sound
distorted at full volume and the flammie
software is a sharp departure from stock
Android to say the least
I initially did have some trouble
installing Google services on my unit
and you may run into similar issues if
you purchase a Chinese variant even with
those flaws though the meizu m2 note is
an excellent choice for those who use
their phones most for media consumption
because of the excellent display the
pre-installed music app even provides
legal unlimited music streaming and the
option to download music for no
additional charge for
best experience though you'll want to
pick up a pair of headphones to avoid
the built-in speakers noticeable
distortion coming in at a very close
second is the Lenovo k3 note priced at
$153 it's a noteworthy alternative to
the m2 note and it's also stronger in a
few key areas most notably in
performance with a 1.7 gigahertz mtk 675
to processor it's noticeably faster when
opening apps or playing graphically
intensive games compared to the m2 note
you may have thought that the mt6752
performance than the mt6752 but that's
actually not the case the k3 note isn't
just strong in performance either as
that as a good display clear speaker
output and great battery life the camera
also takes some impressive images and I
think it has a slight edge over the m2
note in certain conditions while the K 3
notes display is good it's still far
from the quality of the m2 notes display
sunlight readability is just mediocre
and while the speaker doesn't have
nearly as much distortion as on the m2
note it's also too quiet for some
environments the battery life is on par
with the m2 note and you do have the
option with the k3 note to swap out the
battery if needed on the downside the K
3 notes boxy design may not be
everyone's favorite and the software
experience will vary based on reseller
some units may ship without Google
services while others may have lots of
bloatware if you purchase the right
model from the right reseller or flash a
custom ROM like CyanogenMod however you
won't have these software related issues
if you're into gaming or just want the
best performance possible for the price
the k3 note is the phone to get for
under $160 elephone maybe a smaller
manufacturer but the p6000 pro is
perhaps one of the best bargains
starting at $120 while we're using an
original p6000 here the differences made
in the p6000 pro are minimal but
certainly welcome changes the p6000 pro
is powered by the same mtk 675 free
processor used in the m2 note except
that it's clocked at a slightly faster
1.5 gigahertz this is a very small
change from the original mtk 6 7 3 2
used in the p6000 proper
performance should remain about the same
there isn't a single standout feature on
the P 6000 pro but it does have quite a
few positives it ships with a nearly
stock build of android 5.1 lollipop as a
three gigabyte ram option for $20 more
and provides good battery life the
performance is also good for the price
but the camera does fall behind the m2
note and k3 note quite a bit in terms of
overall quality the 5 inch 720p display
provides a smaller form factor and the
pro model is advertised to have a better
brighter display this time sourced from
LG the speaker is fairly loud but it
does sound very tinny and distorted also
it's unlikely that we'll see an Android
M update for the P 6000 or P 6000 probe
given the prices of each phone the P
6000 Pro is a great buy for those who
are on a tight budget or just want a
smaller 5 inch form factor well it
doesn't match the m2 note or k3 note in
battery life or camera quality it does
offer a more stock software experience
and similar performance overall it's a
good alternative if you can't afford the
other two options if you're interested
