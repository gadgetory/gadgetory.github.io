welcome back to Google Play weekly let's
get your weekend started off the right
way with some awesome app news this week
we're going to talk about some Play
Store improvements a new band on the
word flappy and BBM voice last week we
reported the extremely good news that
flappy bird is dead and gone forever and
if Google Play and iTunes have anything
to say about it it's going to remain
that way over the last week developers
who did flappy bird ripoffs started
noticing their applications are being
pulled from their respective app
downloading repositories without being
told why indeed the few who did get
answers were given links to the spam
section of the Terms of Service which is
actually quite hilarious some developers
have been lashing out saying that clones
of Castle Wolfenstein are allowed to
exist but not flappy bird clones I think
he missed the part where Wolfenstein is
a masterpiece worthy of replication
while flappy bird really isn't there's
been no word on whether or not current
flappy titles will be taken down but we
do know that putting up an appt with
flappy in the title will get your app
taken down even if it has nothing to do
with 5e bird so if you are a developer
and you are about to publish an
application and it does have the word
flappy in it we highly recommend you
change the word flappy a little while
back the mobile version of the Google
Play Store started showing people when
applications had in app purchases and
now the desktop site does as well the
update has rolled out to most major
markets so chances are if you're
watching this the website has already
been updated for you so the next time
you run into an application on the
actual website that has in-app purchases
you will know about it it's located
under the download button right next to
the device compatibility message of
course with this new update the question
arises as to whether or not Google could
be doing it better as you can see here
Apple goes the extra mile and shows you
the popular in-app purchases so you know
what people are spending money on inside
of the app well it would be nice to see
a list of in-app purchases I think
they're being a notification there is
definitely enough of course I could be
wrong it's been known to happen so if
you feel strongly one way or the other
let me know about it in the comments
Oprah Max is a new beta application from
the makers of you guessed it opera
browser that helps you lower your data
consumption and guess what it's
available to everyone so here's how the
app works on unencrypted apps which are
most applications you can view how much
data is being can
sumed then opera max routes all of the
data going to those apps through their
servers compresses it and then continues
to send it to your application this
means you get the same content out of
these apps but it uses far less data the
app can be downloaded in the Google Play
Store and we'll have a link to that in
the written companion which is in the
video description as you can imagine it
is a beta which means there are some
issues and that's reflected in the
google play store rating and the user
reviews there's no timetable for a
stable release yet so if you're
interested give the beta a try and see
if it works for you so vh1 joined the
21st century this last week as they
released their official Android
application spoiler it's not terrible
while there is no denying that vh1
programming has been slowly on the
decline it's great news that the
official application is out with the app
you can view full length shows and
movies from vh1 along with some music
videos sneak peeks and some other stuff
the only caveat is you must login with
your cable provider credentials to
access everything supported cable
providers or AT&amp;amp;T u-verse Time Warner
Cable directv Verizon and others I
actually wanted to talk about this app
for a moment because it had a feature
that I really liked when you watch TV on
vh1 you can use the application is sort
of a companion app to get additional
content related to whatever it is that
you're watching I thought this was cool
because it lets you engage more with the
show and I know some channels do this
but i'd like to see this become a
standard i don't know that's just me our
last bit of news actually took place
late last week and it involves BBM BBM
was talking about releasing BBM voice
and bbm channels in the early part of
2014 and now that update is rolling out
to everyone this is a bigger update than
it appears on the surface it seems like
BBM just added the ability to call other
BBM users over data connections however
when you step back and look at the big
picture bbm is on par with pretty much
every messaging alternative out there
with the exception of services that
allow video chatting like hangouts and
skype of course the other things that
came with the update include bbm
channels which is essentially a
remastered version of AOL Instant
Messenger random chat room services new
emojis location sharing and BBM group
sizes have been increased to 50 it's
true that hangouts and Skype are still
better options for now but it should be
noted that bbm is improving and that's
that's pretty super
who's a who wants to see some new and
trending applications as usual if you
want to check any of these applications
out you can find the links in the
written companion which is in the video
description dormi has the potential to
be a really helpful application if
you're a parent this application is
essentially a baby monitor for
smartphones here's how it works you put
a phone in a room where the baby is and
then when it cries the app will amplify
the sound and send it to your smartphone
it has a few other nifty features like
stats and it'll even notify you
discreetly if you're on the phone and
the baby starts to cry by vibrating your
phone and giving you a little beat it's
a nice a poor parents and it's free
glove is a very interesting application
that helps you figure out if your
current mobile service is right for you
what you do is download the application
and then activate it and for three days
the app will take usage statistics and
location statistics and then based on
your locations and usage it will suggest
mobile plans from various carriers it's
only available to San Francisco and New
York residents for right now but do keep
an eye out on this application because
it can be really helpful once it's
available in your area meg 2d is a new
game out of hero craft and chances are
you've played a game like this before
essentially this is your classic
top-down scrolling shooter view control
an airplane and blow things up it's free
to play and it hasn't app purchases but
you shouldn't need to buy anything to
enjoy the title it's a fun little game
if you enjoy this kind of stuff and a
great way to kill a little bit of time
the NSA spying thing is still quite a
big worry for a lot of people and the
popular iOS app blink has made its way
to Android to help with that it's a
messaging service that puts privacy
first by self destructing your messages
after a period of time and it allows
people to talk off the record this is
great if you want to keep your
conversations private and it looks
better than most of the competition
there are some bugs and compatibility
issues but it's also a new app so that's
kind of normal last up this week is the
room to the first game in this series
was spectacular even if it was a little
bit short and so far we get the same
kind of vibe about the room too for
those new to the series this is a puzzle
game where you must search for clues
unlock secrets and figure out what's
going on it has a wicked high rating of
4.9 in the Google Play Store and it's
among the best releases in the month of
March it's three bucks but we consider
that three dollars well spent well that
