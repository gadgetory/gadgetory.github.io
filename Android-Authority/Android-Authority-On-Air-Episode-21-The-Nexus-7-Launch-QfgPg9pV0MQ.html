authority on air the original android
hangout show on google+ I'm dare cross
I'm Scott Anderson this week we are
joined by two special guests returning
guest dan Charlton of TM it wrong and
Colonels and fellow android enthusiasts
Derek more welcome guys so it's not what
we talked about the this week well this
week we got some devices new Nexus 7
came out for me going over impressions
of that we are we talking about some
carrier news also some app updates get
some abilities for jellybean also some
device news and then talk about some
patents and that's what we're going to
be talking about this week first let's
start off with AT&amp;amp;T news they basically
announced that they have new mobile
shared plans on the new mobile share
blends are going to be implemented
towards the end of August now this is
kind of following in verizon's footsteps
with share data plans on the difference
really is the fact that AT&amp;amp;T allows you
to keep your unlimited data plan or use
the new shared plants so it's not
necessarily taking away your limited
whereas on verizon if you were to start
a new contract you would be in the
shared data plans no matter what so
that's kind of a nice different
differentiator for AT&amp;amp;T but price-wise
if you use a lot of data you're kind of
and you have a lot of smartphones or
devices they're kind of going to get
screwed out of price um but it is nice
for people that don't use a whole bunch
of data and don't have a whole bunch of
devices um I can think of people that
you know don't use all the data or older
people I may think that might benefit
from these plans um yeah so it's an
interesting have more choice and
definitely helps up users and yeah so
let's talk about verizon as well rising
is implementing more markets in their 4g
LTE networks and today they
expanded and released into 33 new
markets and basically by the end of the
year they want to have 400 markets but
right now they are at about 337 so
they're definitely on track to have
foreign markets and hopefully they hit
that but basically they are blanket
blanketing the United States with LTE
which is awesome and you know there was
a 337 markets they have out of 400 does
not include my hometown where I'm
sitting at right now but i'll tell you
what they keep surrounded me though here
in central Pennsylvania they lit up a
whole it's a slew of places as the but
yesterday and today and you know I
didn't see I didn't see Huntington
listed I'm uh I'm getting kind of sad I
want my LTE at home that way I have a
choice between my wife I you know and in
my LTE if ill tell us actually oh I'm
sure you know I'm sure the rural areas
good eventually you know I have it at
work I have it if i drive 30 miles in
every direction except for right you
know smack in the middle here where I'm
at but I can't wait to get into the oil
and if your house what's that you just
need like an one power right at your
house oh you know it's only about ever
on mountains you know you put up a tower
in a mountain in it blankets the whole
valley well what they got like Du Bois
and clearfield which are pretty you know
I don't want to say small tablet yeah
they're small towns and in Central Park
so you know oh my god they got a
groundhog once a year that does
something you know you know I mean we
have a lake you know no there's a big
tourist attraction here okay all right
but verizon you're doing a bang-up job
just bring it to my area yeah they're
dominating all of the other carriers
Spencer their goal is to to cover
everything and then they don't need to
keep broadcasting a cdma network yeah
mr. course upgrade everybody and say you
got two more years get a new phone
within two years what you're done yeah
they're gonna want it and they just
don't wanna die casting entire network
like I start testing voice over LTE
more if you make them test ERT are
testing it now they're gonna start
deploying it in 2013 yeah that'll be
interesting when that happens but they
don't I they don't have hand off but for
voice calls between LTE and CDMA yet
though now still working oh yes they do
qualcomm it a concept on that I want to
see at CES yeah well it's going to sue
my jellybean app updates um basically
swiftkey 3 i've got some support for
jelly bean and also had some bug fixes
which is nice and all that's a very
popular app very popular keyboard
replacement also google play music is
got a very big update allows for queuing
and reordering current playlist music
and also new UI for navigation with
transport controls in the action bar
also new large albums so bigger pictures
are always nice and the playlist art is
also constructed from albums in the song
playlist which is also nice and they
also do have a now playing widget has
album art and support for thumbs up
which is also awesome so let's talk
about some devices there well those of
you to think you need tons and tons of
storage on your mobile devices upwards
of 64 gigabytes will be happy to know
that Samsung with the galaxy s3 has you
covered they plan on releasing an s3
with 64 gig later this year so I guess
the real question is is do you really
need 64 gig on the mobile phone with you
know phone storing so much in the cloud
nowadays you know I personally don't but
I know there are some people out there
that especially people in friends with
actually to think that they need to
store as many movies games music
whenever they can just in case they
happen to need it offline so i guess i
mean i don't need it uh you know how
about the dan 64
but also so we're clear this is upwards
128 gigabytes of storage because you can
still put in a 64 gigabyte SD card yeah
so I mean and but then you got to figure
out the devices that don't have SD cards
and 64 gig is nice local storage but
it's I think it's over tilt personally
it would be nice to go on a trip with
all you know your movies and all of your
music and not have to cash it from
google music or something like that more
storage and more options are nice and I
think this will definitely be I think
the public will react in purchasing you
know they'll figure out if it's
something that is needed and probably in
the future with different devices if it
doesn't sell well then they probably
will stick with the 32 and 16 and eight
so I mean it's all to a competition
thing right you can get the iphone in 16
32 or 64 yeah exactly yeah I guess I
didn't look at it that way but as we'll
talk about later in the show samsung is
not copying Apple that's I don't know if
it is it kind it is their data on how
the various iphone models or selling in
terms of storage I know Apple wow this
is some stats but I haven't seen I don't
know if they released stats about the
particular storage space yeah I I was
room looked EQ is the top seller I mean
in terms of stuff like Google Music
automatically caches and and does a
pretty good job managing cash so it's
never it's never been an issue for me
and I don't really want to watch video
on my phone so I mean it is a four-point
really big inch screen but still I you
know I guess if I'm if it was born your
friend with like I really don't mean
yeah the games I mean can you really
store that many games on your phone yeah
oh wait also work out to play those they
don't need tons and tons of space for
all of these other game so they don't
really play well no but also lie mean
they are coming out with more graphic
intensive games that
are taking up a lot of stores now
whether it's you just download the app
that's the actual downloader of
third-party you know packages or add-ons
I think that it is nice to have a bunch
of storage just because it will actually
push developers to you know have
third-party in add-ons and more options
that developers can often offer their
customers which i think is an
interesting way to look at it maybe yeah
I've actually noticed less games having
the add-on stuff since Google up they
pee K sides already how that they can
package it all in just one file I gotta
take advantage of that yeah and what's
that limit free games I think yeah I
think it's three or four gigabytes now
okay yeah so I mean like the type of
megabytes yeah so for the time being you
know whether it's an add-on or whether
it's you know just in a BK installation
they're getting bigger they're getting
more graphic intensive bit more you know
storylines and videos and are they are
but I think that as technology
progresses i think it'll bill we get
there all right so let's talk about some
root and rom news it happened this week
well cm9 hit RC 2 and also when rc2 is
released we had some additional devices
show up with the Arctic RC to release
candidates the status you had me galaxy
s3 i9300 the samsung galaxy tab 2 10.1
as well as the sky rocket which is the
variant of the sgs2 is one handy on AT&amp;amp;T
and the t-mobile version of the sgs2 the
burka leaves as well is now RC 2 and
last but not least the samsung galaxy
note so a whole bunch of Samsung devices
got rc2 status with cm9 now you might be
thinking well you know cm9 you know with
jelly bean out there I'll really care
well thankfully the CM teen has us
covered in this week they tease the hell
out of us with a whole mess of different
devices
posting all over the interwebs from
YouTube to Twitter to Google+ we saw all
sorts of different pictures screenshots
and so forth of a lot of different
devices running cm10 just to let us know
that that you know they're there were
actively working on it so we saw the
optimus 4x we saw the HTC One S oh my
you know oh and HTC two bites know a lot
of people excited about that the
soldiers are in here it's perfect we saw
the Nexus 7 you know no surprise but
it's a Nexus device we sell the
International sgs3 I witness as well as
the 18 t-birds and the t-mobile version
sprint version oddly enough we didn't
see the verizon version because the
whole lotta new voting thing we saw the
HTC Sensation the galaxy s the original
one we saw the skyrocket the epic touch
the galaxy tab 10.1 as well as the Toro
in Morocco are all running extreme
alphas right now preview teasers
whatever you want to call so CM team is
definitely working very hard on version
10 of jelly jelly bean so well I'm sure
in the next coming weeks you know we'll
start seeing some night least so far
they have a bunch of features that are
merged into the cm10 jelly bean release
we have the power menu with screenshot
capabilities working profiles is working
lockscreen calendar and lock screen
whether notification like customization
battery light customization the selector
notification toggle and a few few other
support settings which basically brings
the feature set very close to what is
available in cm9 so that they're getting
very very close very exciting yeah I
think that we'll see cm10 night leads
for a bunch of devices most likely in a
very near future so let's move on to
some patent related stuff um the you
guys remember last week when Judge
calling bris her burst he ruled samsung
galaxy tab is not as cool as the iPad
and I'm not
infringing on apples design because
remember that good and bad i remember
that let the world know that that ipad
was cooler but that had some
consequences didn't it yeah basically it
turns out that some of the major like
the insult that came from Apple is the
judge is actually saying that Apple has
to publicly announce that the galaxy tab
did not copy the ipad um and basically
saying that publicly is I think
reinvigorating there um tarnished
reputation through what happened and I
think it is a good decision um for that
the judge made but apples argument was
well it's just free publicity and you
know we didn't really tarnished you know
their brand that much and well yea this
free publicity so that's awesome yeah
the judge ruled they're gonna have to
put it up on their website for six
months yep been getting coffee on and
and also as well as major British news
news magazine or companies magazines or
newspapers put in run run articles in
there so they want the word if the judge
wants the word out there that Apple did
I'm sorry samsung did not copy Apple all
night I think that's pretty damn cool
yeah I can't wait to go to apple's
website and screenshot that article Oh
apples out co dot u K well yeah exactly
but it's you know that that's good
enough for me oh yeah and we and we
don't know how prominent it has to be on
the website or blog and the footer you
know you're heading heading size sticks
in the footer down below yeah I mean
that's a big tent welcome to British law
Apple cuz they take each a lot more
seriously than they do in the US I mean
you can't go around trashing people and
saying they're doing all these illegal
things if they're not you get in trouble
for that they're here yeah you can get
away with it but not they're also in
patent news though
a German judge ruled that the motorola
xoom was not confronting on the ipad
design so that was two wins yeah but the
horse continue on this time it's a win
for the Android side I like it I can't
wait to see what percussions well the
the the Samsung Apple trial in the u.s.
is coming up the end of the month and
that's going to be very interesting to
see but how that that goes yeah and will
with with regards to Motorola the import
am is effective so the import ban I
don't know how they're going to deal
with that but I think that they just
imported all bunch of products before
the actual import ban and have released
a large stock or have a large stock to
compensate or maybe and and and their
most of the devices that that that was
because of just to be clear for
listeners I was because of Microsoft
ActiveSync patents not nothing to do
with Apple in this case but it was
mostly for really old devices like the
click and the backflip and just stuff
that isn't even on the market anymore
mean the only thing I think they have
that they still sell as you know the
zoom and maybe the x2 yeah I'll slip to
know and that's that's really what
Microsoft has been pushing running
around getting all the android oems to
to patent licensing fees as these
activesync these exchange related
patents well the majority of them are
already do right yeah yeah yeah in fact
google pays a fee you'll do package it
into android i can't remember what
version they started packaging with but
it will be able to do that can't google
just pay a fee for the OS well i think
that's why it's just these old devices
okay cuz ones running newer OS is sort
of get grandfathered in okay so let's
hit the meat of the show and just in
time we were just joined by John curling
he was it wasn't able to make it on
toilet he made perfectly
in time for nexus 7 information so
earlier this week Marlene last week
depending on which part of story won't
start talking about further in in recent
times the nexus 7 became readily
available to the masses were like many
many many many did it started showing up
on Tuesday oh and John has three of them
as he sustained so let's not mother
shipping world there's my hat you know a
lot of people were upset that there was
no shipment notification from google and
retailers all over the US were selling
so basically a lot of people were upset
because they paid money for shipping to
pre-order it and people are going to a
walmart sam's club that's fine you know
whatever staples in picking these things
up so a lot of people were upset um
Google eventually who eventually let's
shed some light on the subject stating
that basically wow these things are
selling like hotcakes you know as the
saying goes there they had an incredible
demand for them and bigger than they'd
expected I guess so have a little bit of
a shipping debacle but they let
everybody know that they shipped every
seven gigabyte I'm sorry every eight
gigabyte version that was ordered prior
to the 13th those order stand alone so
if you order like a case or a nexus q
with it as well that didn't ship uh for
a few days later and then the 16
gigabyte version stand alone once again
not with an extra charger or you know a
queue or something our case those are
actually shipping by the end of the day
tomorrow so some people if you got the
big guy 16 gig version you still might
not get it for another two days maybe
don't assume that the 16 gig was the one
that was in the highest of demand oh you
know what because I don't know I've been
where even I would guess say they're
pretty even because
people want something cheap and then a
lot of people want more space so
guessing is probably pretty even but you
know we won't know until wherever if
we're ever told any type of number but
either way it looks like create you know
if that's the case 16 gig version people
won't start getting them you know for
the next you know a couple days people
will still be getting them I've changed
it to overnight on the shipping instead
of two day too oh yeah yeah that was the
house mice and people to do that
huh so that i'm sure i made a lot of
people happy oh you're being overly
generous oh it's just a shipping error
you know they had so much demand demand
is irrelevant these are pre orders they
knew exactly how many of them there were
it's not like oh god more people showed
up at the store today to ask for them we
freaking signed up weeks in advance oh
how many of them people were expecting
the day they went on sale in a box of
 they never said when it was going
to ship it said shipping in two to three
weeks it did but you know as well as I
do if you're going to release a product
the people who pre-order good at the
same day goes on sale in the stores I
assume that's how pre-order works I even
about every other company the extruder
means happened and launches you know
that's why you do it but that didn't
happen for whatever the reason in you
know what I was upset at first but I
realized this and you know the grand
scale of things the tablets pretty
awesome so I don't care I eventually got
it yet my shattered for two days but but
you know what I'm extremely happy with
it so I'm not that upset anymore I'm not
I mean I I don't care I didn't it was a
large miss stuff for google and i had i
think acknowledging that definitely
makes them realize that a next time we
release a product um this is how we need
to operate and this is what we don't
need to do again oh and look at it this
way this is a based on a little bit of
fact a little bit of you what's been
happening um in the past couple days so
you you buy one from google you
pre-order and everyone's complaining
well why did I spend you know fourteen
dollars for shift
or whatever you paid for shipping what I
could just went to sams club there some
pic tit off without paying extra few
bucks well said a lot of people are
speculating this and comparing it to
creat previous product launches as well
as you know issues they've been having
the past few days is that when you
ordered from google the one that's going
to handle the product replacement so if
you need to have it replaced you know
for what a warranty issue or something
there they're going to send you a new
one and then you can ship back the one
you have is defective they're into an
advanced product replacement where most
places don't do that you have to send
them the defective one once they receive
it they'll send you back so if you
wanted to go to a store that might you
might not walk out of there because
they're sold out you might not walk out
of there with a new one and people were
that have hair getting defective next 27
this week are shipping them back after
they get a new one so it's a little
added bonus mean yeah you might you had
to wait two days but you get that extra
you know Google a little bit of
satisfaction yeah but when you sit down
your coworker or is it the next day and
they get it before you do and you order
neat before the keynote it kind of
throws a little like what the heck I
understand and I I ordered it before the
keynote to you and I were at the same
time yeah I I was kind of you know
saddened but I got over it you know I
think that's okay yeah i mean it's it's
not gonna make me not by another google
product but it is a huge misstep and I
heard those people you want to go out of
your way for not people you want to
leave out you know hanging out to dry I
think they could have let people know
about the shipping situation a couple
days far but they tried to make it right
by your story started selling them now
my didn't get charged for mine so I'm
not gonna complain and there's also yeah
there's also rumors that saying that you
know stores sold them early to they
should have waited for Google's you know
go ahead that was getting pushed back
another day or two that's exploring my
head they sold it anyway istics problem
greatly
yours aren't unaccustomed to we get this
product we keep it in storage for 48
hours and then it goes on sale Google
doesn't really have a lot of experience
with you know yeah well product red
cells Oh hallelujah this is should have
done is they should have said it okay
pre-orders once we get all of the
initial pre-orders out then then we
actually bother buying the legs and then
retailers you've been themself I mean I
think that would have been the wise
decision all they needed to do was say
leap and then they're good but that
didn't happen and hopefully they learn
from this mistake yeah right so let's
talk about a little bit more doom and
gloom before we get on the good stuff so
some people are reporting some dead
pixels well you know what when you're
gonna push out 600,000 devices you're
gonna have some that have bad pixels
every every major device out there these
happen so this ought to tear you from
from buying you know this device
everything you know we make something a
mask one is you're going to get
something that's that's you know a
little defective it sucks that you
you're the one that got it but you can't
make everything a hundred percent
perfect when you're making this many
devices it I don't think that's an issue
that's my personal opinion you guys are
great and my first evo 3d had multiple
dead pixels and I had to take it back
and I mean the nice thing was something
that you get in a store you can take it
back and they hand you a new one and you
walk out the door and done where's this
you got to you know all some phone
number or send an email to who knows how
oh my god in the wait time is horrendous
for a google play store oh I've heard
people saying that they were on hold for
a while or nap wow you know that's
that's a shame three calls so there
there's some screen lifting issues now
all of us that have them here uh does
anybody any of you have any spree
lifting issues not at all and I actually
do on my asus transformer prime but yeah
I did have that issue on my prominent
but no you know what so the client had
it and we didn't hear about it the
transformer how to do the other thing I
i think that the nexus 7's built quality
is much better than the prime
I agree oh it's even though it's like
half the cost which I find it surprised
the hell out of me ya know it's an
extremely well device so people are
noticing this more because it's a more
popular device it or is it just because
it's you know hey it's Google's first
tablet we're gonna scrutinize it to hell
I mean it could be at picking it could
be just that they're amina asus hasn't
perfected their IPS technology and just
isn't doing it well enough and so more
people are seeing because it's more
popular but the transformer prime is a
pretty popular tablet people were fast
to jump over ridiculous nonsense like
GPS problems in a Wi-Fi only device now
this is not even how I don't know that I
checked its Wi-Fi only yeah we've talked
about that the show now the screen
acting issue once again if you bought it
from google you can go ahead and call
them up and say you get and make a case
saying how bad your screen is lifting up
and i'll send you a new one right away
there's many reports all over the
interwebs about that so if you're really
if you're having that it's that big of a
deal with some people reporting it being
a millimeter or two lifting up I mind
fine so it's in everybody else in here
looks like I haven't it's time so if
you're nitpicking that much and you want
something to be perfect then you know go
ahead and go through the right channels
I there were reports of people actually
taking it apart and tightening some of
the screws I guess the screws along the
left side we're only about seventy
eighty percent tighten to tighten
another one or two turns um that fixed
it for most people it seems for a day or
so but then it's if the screen started
lifting again so it must be the adhesive
tape or what however it attaches it is a
little bit Leafs on that side but like I
said if you can't fix it yourself or you
don't want to call Google me there
they're gonna they're gonna replace it
for it so now I said that other tablets
you know or have a little bit
effectiveness you're dead pixels
whatever not everything everything has
that let's talk about you know the
latest iPad the new
ipad the ipad 3 whatever you want to
call ipad HD yeah whatever floats your
boat you know a lot of people complained
about that device you know it's not
really a hardware thing but if people
complain about the price you know it
real pretty expensive uh but but related
to hardware people complained a lot a
lot about Wi-Fi connectivity issues with
the new iPad Thomas update for it too
yeah exactly exactly so not upset even
you know magical Apple has these
problems to every chain everybody has
these a lot of people complain about the
new I've had being extremely hot and
overheating you know and heat graphs
show that it is hot and that also might
be because as LTE and it's mostly
battery okay it's it's really hot um no
just basing a quad-core GPU into
outdated in facturing process you know
and people complain about the battery
not charging not to a hundred percent
full when it says it's full it's really
not a hundred percent people complain
that the battery on the iPad was
extremely slow to charge yeah so I mean
really slow is just freaking massive
yeah i think the common thread there is
people complain yeah yeah if someone has
a problem about something I'm oh look
like leave it on the internet and I
complain I mean the Nexus 7 is a very
popular device and a handful of people
probably got some defective units and
then you know being very are very
outspoken about it you can't engage
every one of us you really can't and if
you do really have something wrong with
it you can get sick you know okay so
let's move on to the good they have the
device what's good about the device
unlocking that boot letter will get that
nice let me talk about the price here
yeah before we talk about everything so
this thing cost 200 bucks if you got the
eight gig version right now I mean the
16 gig was 16 gig was 250 now you can
actually knock that down almost a
hundred dollars if you talk about with
all the content comes with so it comes
with a ten-dollar google wallet credit
yeah yeah that's right you can look like
a bozo holding up a 7-inch tablet up to
a NFC
appliance and make a purchase you know
what it's ten bucks don't do it it also
cuts on your account though right like
you don't know music with this no now
it's justified might not know that I was
incorrect up earlier this week I powered
all my nexus 7 i saw i had ten dollars
was it to jing i looked on my phone I
doesn't have ten bucks I found out that
it's per device only it's not count why
do you have ten bucks so go to use it
give it gas the way you can't make a
Google Wallet account a universal
account for all your devices I'm calling
up money network come on find out I said
I'm betting with the prepaid ten dollars
you know that they give you know but
because what I do put for me hooked you
can put an amount into a year her soul
once i have three devices i can put a
hundred dollars and it will be available
on all those three times but does the
devices have different card numbers so
you gotta you gotta somehow merge them
together maybe i'm now but there are two
different numbers it because i guess
when and if google adds support for
every credit card out there will be a
lot better um but right now I guess it's
it's the vice down for for prepaid least
I mean I would just like such a full
holding up my you know a tablet yo that
a gas station to the to the pump to try
to pay for gas oh you ought to do it yet
regale gas well I at McDonald's playing
angry birds waiting in line took my
order tap go and just moved on got the
weirdest looks but it's like using an
iPad to take photos you know alright so
you get ten bucks right now and
everybody knows you get $25 play store
credit because people want you to use
the delights they're giving you twenty
five bucks to go out there and buy more
specifically don't you use the device to
buy stuff from google now know that $25
is is account-wide so you could actually
buy something for your phone but but
either way it's $25 of play store credit
um so that's thirty-five dollars now if
you add the $58 a free content that
actually comes in the device remember it
comes with the movie Transformers Dark
Side of the Moon or dark of the moon
our it comes with five magazines comes
the book if you're into reading come
with I get it comes it yeah I look like
a squire officer other food network
remember the ball it comes with 20
different songs if you add up the price
of everything that's another fifty eight
bucks right there so all the freak on
now I think this free content that
they're giving out is using as a hook
and basically the hook is into their
ecosystem which is a very wise decision
for them to give up free stuff because
ultimately it says hey you can use is
this money but it will be used in our
ecosystem and therefore you will have
content and apps and information on our
ecosystem it will be harder for you to
move it and it will be you know it can t
move so I think it was a good wise
decision dr. Laurie frito absolutely I
mean they're working a very small margin
there their goal is to sell more contact
yep so the device you can knock almost a
hundred dollars off if you add all those
up it's $93 that that's pretty awesome
you know for 200 or tablet you're
talking you know just a look like 100
bucks $107 you know if you don't count
tax and shipping or whatever but still
it 110 bucks or something uh let's talk
about Dan you go first what what do you
think of the nexus 7 you got one you can
use it for a couple days now well can we
stay on like a per specific thanks like
the size like we can just think about
the size I like the size a lot it's a
lot more convenient to hold in a single
hand than a 10 inch tablet like the
transformer prime so if you're reading
or especially if you're laying down or
trying to you know like recline or relax
it's a lot easier to hold in just one
hand okay yeah I will agree with that I
have a 10 inch tablet that when I was
laying in bed I would change positions
constantly yeah I'm holding it up above
my head
I rested on my chest I put it on its
side I wrote I lay on my side trying to
find the other perfect way to watch to
watch listen use whatever I'm doing and
it is it's extremely hard to use you get
tired of using it one way or another so
you know what with a 7-inch tablet I
don't get tired is dan said you can hold
a 7-inch tablet the nexus 7 in your hand
and it you don't have to sit your swap
hands it fits in your hand perfectly and
it it's great the size is exactly
perfect I love it so how about the
weight of the device is the weight too
heavy to constantly keep you know
holding there or is it you know no
notice it very light it's if you've ever
had like one of the e ink Kendall's it's
much closer to that than any of the
other old Android tablets you barely
notice it is it too low no I could have
this in my head like a note with no
issues man they need to make this into a
phone roubaix p it can be a fun yeah but
I need a headset now I'm gonna hold it
to my ear oh yeah maybe that guy
actually with a headset of even better
yeah you're already that guy uses as a
wallet I mean it's been insanely hot and
you know where I live lately I so I've
just been throwing it you know like
cargo short pockets and you know you
don't even notice it's there whereas you
know with a 10 inch tablet you've got to
try to like tuck it under your arm when
you're like running out the door to go
to work and you're always afraid of
dropping it I think the size is just
it's really great for for obviously for
some tasks it's not appropriate but but
for you know just / portability wise
it's fantastic so you're saying size
does matter i'm here i mean really yes
didn't do it it's using the right size
device for the right purpose yeah i'm a
small going into my dress pants I mean
it's portable just go I made a dozen-odd
I put them in my khakis today when I I
needed to go use it for a reading device
in certain rooms of the office no it
my pockets yep though the four-factor
the seven times for factor is it what is
it not ideal for that a 10 inch tablet
does better typing I I would destroy
whole this thing and type of my two
thumbs here just as fast as I can if not
faster better than a 10 inch tablet yeah
but with a faster on my transformer
Prime's keyboard or or or even something
you know you or if you put when you put
it in landscape mode it's easier to type
on but because the screen is so narrow
you lose a whole bunch whole bunch of
screens a lot easier on a 10 inch in
landscape to type on glass if you're
typing on glass me I have a transformer
prime but I don't always create a
keyboard with me and some websites don't
render right when it's in portrait mode
it's just it's it's too narrow and and
then when you put it in landscape mode
then you know you just can't see enough
of it so for it for some things the 10
inches is a little bit better having an
11 inch laptop I mean I'm in that gap
where 10 inches is why bring it i have
my laptop 7 inches is right there so
it's got its own little niche market
yeah definitely it definitely does have
that I mean that they said I it's
extremely portable and I'm going just
just because it's light and it's small
in the form factor i think is perfect
i'm going to use it so much more than I
have my existing tablet I'm not going to
have a honeymoon phase where a couple
weeks I'm going to you know stop using
it I want to use it every day okay so so
a big feature of this tablet is the
price and for factor and jelly bean so
speed wise is it buttery smooth yeah
I'll tell you what did you guys use it
before you got the 4.11 update connect
an hour I turned it on and I start you
know immediately saw my play library I
swiped left and right that's uh look at
lag because mg Siegler put out a big
article a few days prior
praising the nexus 7 how good it was
except for the lag now I was like
whatever it doesn't like in a fanboy
they love you know but uh I saw like and
I was kind of like wow really I'm gonna
have to delete these widgets from the
home screens because it lacked and then
you know five minutes later I get the
4.11 off date and then boom no lie so
the preview version that came with no
one was given a vaio just 4.1 there was
left 4.11 boom no performance issues
whatsoever it's amazing now did you
attach your google account to it when
you ordered it i did not however it did
say welcome Derek when I first turned it
on he probably did it was automatically
checked okay so if you didn't uncheck it
than yesterday I did not uncheck
anything I I ordered that thing before
the link was live order quick like I
first turn it on it was really slow for
about the first mm probably about 15
minutes well it was downloading all of
my all of my gmail account all of my 800
plus contacts all of my google plus my
google books yeah it's always slow on
any device oh yeah so the first 15 to 25
minutes were chugging slow and then it
finally finished syncing everything and
then I applied the update it's been
buttery smooth since then it's I mean
it's obviously has a whore's then my my
galaxy nexus does but it is so fast it
really I haven't seen any issues but
it's interesting to compare it to the
Asus Transformer Prime which has a
higher end Tegra 3 I mean there's
there's different models in the Tegra 3
and the one in the the seven is a little
bit lower end model but with jellybean
it's much more responsive than the Prime
now that the Prime has always seemed a
little slow for some things well the
Tegra 3 Carl this in the prime is kind
of part of the problem yeah it's just a
26 out of date Colonel it's it's point
6.39 which is a weird version to be
using in the first place
and current for linux is 3.4 lay back
boarding a lot of step and in with ICS
android supposed default was three point
x so like it's always been a little bit
hamstrung by that whereas the the Nexus
7 is on a three point one point I don't
remember what Carly 10 I think three
points a lot of the Tegra based ICS
devices got stuck on a 26 kernel for yep
whatever reason but a lot of things you
know it released three point 0 source
and nobody other than nvidia had the
skills to and it looks like they finally
have that worked out now with with the
seven so I'm hoping that yeah oh yeah
yeah okay Prime and this is a woman wit
not transition to others so Google is
assuming that people are going to use
this as a contents of consumption device
um now content on the Nexus 7 is a good
house video playback is audio quality
good audios nice audios nice I hear what
my galaxy nexus oh that's different
story it onions it is a lot hotter than
the Galaxy Nexus it's pretty loud I mean
for turkey term use a tiny little
speaker strip yeah I'm I mean it'll fill
a room you turn a video up it's loud I I
did yeah I like it and the screens
gorgeous oh yeah it's that the IPS
display it's got great viewing angles
the colors are great it's it's it's
hands-down the best display on a tablet
that I have right now and I've got half
a dozen tablets right now so the free
movie that you guys have played without
a hiccup it was yeah watch much ruby
mine it was on I have a dream you know
720p or 1080p content from YouTube with
no problems no drop frames no hiccupping
yeah it's very nice I'm come I guess I
got completely content with the conflict
um now some people were complaining
about because we're talking about the
screen here some people are talking
about what a little bit of imaging you
know bleeding over and so forth I
haven't seen any that I've actually
tested it I I don't see any image
bleeding over or anything like that huh
I also don't see any lightly which is
impressive because that's usually one of
the downsides with IPS I've seen a
little bit of ghosting here and there
but nothing major although I did have
one strange screen related issue where
last night and early this morning it
wouldn't turn on but it seemed to was it
was quite as soon as I called the google
number the screen came on it was almost
like Google knew what I was doing that
might not be a strain issue that might
be cool now yeah I think that would yeah
I think there was something else but it
was you know you're hitting their mash
on the power button and Bo nothing about
people now so on a cap on the Nexus 7
tablet is only Wi-Fi only it so you're
using google now when you're at home
here at work coffee shop in a restaurant
hotel whatever meal anywhere you have a
hotspot or mobile hotspot for kettering
your phone so is google now as useful i
say yes now I haven't I haven't used it
on the Nexus 7 at all yet I've used it a
little bit but I find that like I'll
leave my house or my work and get to
wherever I'm going and I'll glance at it
and i'll have like eight cards of random
traffic to random places that i've been
over the last like six months yeah well
I don't experience with people now is
the man yes yeah so anything you've ever
checked into on latitude or any place
you've been for extended period of time
that law 10 example my parents house it
gives me a hit directions to my parents
house now obviously I've never checked
in there just have gps location yeah I
mean I don't have to give you a traffic
information to it I mean like I get
random traffic information to ikea i'm
not going to ikea yeah i know interested
anything at ikea at the moment I had a
very misinformation it's just taking up
my time to dismiss it yeah I had a very
similar experience i was in new york
city over the weekend and i've got jelly
bean on my Nexus and was checking into
you coffee shops or whatnot and then you
know two days later it was saying oh
yeah that random coffee shop you were I
to the east village on Friday do you
want do you want to go there again
here's your subway directions here no no
I'm a hundred and sixty blocks away from
that why are you trying to get me to go
way downtown now no yeah I was not found
google now terribly useful it's I was
really psyched about it early on but at
least initially I think that the
learning phase is a bit too high I was
hoping that if I actually took it with
me on on vacation that it could start
suggesting things but but you know it
wouldn't suggest restaurants in the
neighborhood where I was it would
suggest things you know on the
completely other side of the city it did
that GPS you did did it have oh yeah it
knew where it was I mean I was outside I
had clear view of the sky but it well
look let's uh we talked about you know
all the benefits of stock you know nexus
7 jelly bean stock now a little touchy
subject is routing and robbing your your
brand new device you know I I personally
I'm going to hold off as long as
possible to root my tablet because I
don't know of any benefits now to do it
I mean I'm a hardcore ruder Rama flasher
crack flashing whatever mean I last
night I wiped my galaxy nexus 4
different time to put on four different
rom so yeah I I do this you know
practically for a living I've been
reading phones you might know for 10
tablets every single Android device I've
ever owned I've done that too so why am
i different this time well i think
android has reached a point in its you i
worked extremely polished that you don't
need to do it for speed or enhancements
but also I can't think of any reasons
why I needed on a tablet that is
basically based on content consumption
it's all streams in the cloud I just I
don't have any apps and I need root
access for on this tablet how about you
guys I haven't rooted mine yet I haven't
even unlocked it yet actually but there
are a couple of things that i think i
would like to be able to change well I
can't change without root for example
I'd like to have the battery percentage
reported in the notification bar I can't
change it from a battery icon now most
ABS install a widget that now now
remember be and that's coming from a
phone where phones you know last day
with this thing is supposed to have 10
hours of screen on time so are you that
really that concerned about battery life
on something that's the last this long
anything I'd like to know what it's at
yeah okay i unlock my bootloader that
was the first thing i did the first
thing out of the box but i haven't
rooted it i haven't installed clock work
on it yet i did that just so i can later
if I need to get out wiping yeah I mean
maybe if I needed to you know run you
know titanium backup or something on it
at some point it's nice to do it's nice
to have the flexibility but super user
yeah I mean realistically I when if I do
unlock it and boot it I'll probably do
it to sort of accomplish a few specific
things that I want to change and then
never really think about it again use
root for really much of anything I guess
I mean I didn't even lock my healer with
my galaxy nexus I before I even turn it
on i plugged it into a USB cable went
into the bootloader fastboot OEM unlock
his very first time and booted off and
booted up on lock you know rooted like
it that's just what I did but I I don't
see every I mean I don't see your
reasons to do it yet and yes maybe if
comes down the road cm10 comes out with
some God feature you know but oh my god
I need to have that done you no idea
maybe I should have mocked and I'm gonna
wipe all my stuff but you know what who
cares I everything i'm going to use this
look for is located in the cloud I don't
gain
I'm not gonna lose in level 97 of angry
birds or you know I only play dead
trigger a couple times because it's cool
to try it out you know maybe one that
that tour game comes out but yeah but I
just don't gain that much anyone so
that's not it okay I don't store
anything on the tablet so if it comes
off but for now I'm not reading it I'm
gonna go as long as humanly possible to
not to not read it I don't see a benefit
yet yet yes but on the off chance you
did find a benefit I mean it was better
to unlock the bootloader coming out of
the box just in case why go through the
hassle free putting everything back on
their weight and personnel old back it
all up download it all for you and
restore most of the settings yeah but
you gotta wait at the gas content
exactly so what I'm gonna have to sign
into what what you know got to sign into
a nap on inside don't I use this thing
to browse the web I use it to read you
know content from your current use
Google+ um definitely watch movies feel
you up I don't have any real type of app
dated you see maybe my case is different
because of what i use the tablet for at
least right now you know don't get me
wrong on my phone I have you know five
or six you know we only acts you know
but I don't know if I'm gonna need that
type of functionality yet it's also
perspective thing right like like you
said you're flashing roms all the time
and I you know do the same thing pretty
frequently and so the idea of losing all
of my data and installing everything all
over again just isn't oh yeah I last
night I guess oh my god Nexus I thought
I had everything working on the Rome I
was running the one I was testing found
out it wasn't wide already reinstalling
all my hat damn it simple wipe it
reloaded try different wrong my
everything was working the way I wanted
to note wasn't went back the one that I
was currently running and he said I wipe
data three or four times yeah then phase
me I'm so used to doing it it's not a
big deal to lose and redo though so
Scott how about you if you had the Nexus
look what would you do I leave a
completely stock and and that's what I
would do and I gave my perspective on
having a stock device a couple weeks ago
and I'm gonna stick to it and it just
kind of gives me a better perspective of
what the average user can and can't do
with their phone or tablet and it gives
me a better perspective of how light can
communicate what Android offers as
opposed to oh hey you got this wrong and
it completely changes everything how it
looks then when they get their device
you can't say well yours won't have this
here's one of this you have to do this
and this and this and it complicates
everything and I can understand how they
would be like whoa that's way too much I
you got to walk me through this and I
don't want to walk them through it so um
like stock is just a better perspective
on funny it's going to be hard trust me
the first time I see some type of you
know new functionality some root someone
wrong has out there like I guarantee you
and see them ten you know comes out and
this is just a guess I could be
completely wrong you know but when you
flick up for google now there's other
icons located there enough for different
things or for some feature on even know
about yet that comes out for it and I'm
just like wow you know I never go to
kiddie candy store and get everything
I'm telling you right now I said the
same thing when I got see Nexus when I
got it because however I did to unlock
and read it right away I didn't go
custom rom a month because I came from a
world from me you I wear every week I
was flashing a new update a lot of times
I was wiping and I wanted to be
completely stopped completely stable for
as long as possible so I convinced
myself to only be running his route for
a month the very first month of my
godson nexus is life and low mijo came
january fifteenth my buddy showed me the
wrong he was running how's it yet i need
all those features done do it went home
and did that night so get a couple
leaves no one of you guys hold up your
tablet and show me what it's doing i'm
doing it but damn it I'm not doing it
I choked it's just a matter of time but
I'm going to twist my own arm to stay
stock and experience it the way that
Google intended it for now one of the
popular route only tweaks is changing
the DPI dropping it from the 213 that it
sat down to 160 gives you like the full
10 inch tablet interface I I don't hate
the phone UI I don't hate it either I'm
not sure that that necessarily means one
isn't better than the other I mean I'm
surprised that i like it i dislike that
it doesn't have a landscape launcher
that's really well you see i mean you
can cheat you know you can change it
there's a software button to make acne
landscape apps yes the home screen is
never landscape so breaking news what
I'd like to give us update on what's new
in the app John you got tablet support
new feature events with party mode
visual refresh and improved navigation
improved circle management and bug fixes
circle management yeah okay I'm going to
check it out later but sorry about that
does breaking news i'm sure all you can
go download that while we're talking
about I think it's been really
interesting to look at how developers
both native app developers and web
developers are trying to they're all
trying to figure out what do we do with
this 7-inch tablet if it's small tablet
is it a big phone is it something else
because you know it's so many people
have been caught up in this binary
thinking of either you know a phone or a
tablet and tablets or 10 inches because
that's kind of what you know apples
product line looks like and that kind of
dominates PS thinking and you know I
like what Google did with with the UI
where they took some aspects of the
phone UI and some aspects with their
tablet UI and they made something that
works right for this size it's you know
I've actually had a bunch of apps that I
can't install on this yeah I've actually
like trying to find a twitter app that i
could had stalls actually I you know
kind of a pain it's like i normally use
Boyd Boyd would install tweet Lance
Woodman so I had to go back to seesmic
why wouldn't install here there
are some things if that would only apps
yeah markets are not compatible yep like
Bank of America's tablet app won't
install but Bank m ahrens bone app will
install yeah which is annoying because
the tablet app is fantastic in the phone
app is kind of crappy HBO Go won't
install like if you go to the new york
new york times website on the on the
seven you get the desktop version but if
you go to Twitter's website you get the
phone version it's just you know kind of
amusing to see how they're you know
doing their user agent sniffing and what
kind of branching they're doing
ultimately I think we need to stop
thinking about things in terms of phone
versus tablet and you know making
assumptions about screen sizes but it's
like I just put so that I at dinner I I
you put something out on google+ looking
so there's a new firefox beta al for
android that finally brings tablet
support in it so I am I wonder what
they're going to do on the seven it's
the phone version it which I just think
it's hysterical that you know this thing
is unambiguously a tablet but they're
using the phone UI on it and and I'm not
saying that that's right or wrong I just
think it's you know interesting and I
what I don't know if they did it
intentionally or if they're if it's just
some sort of you know glitch in their
you know device detection code but it's
not the interesting area to watch for
the next couple weeks as things shake
out yeah these things get more and more
popular developers will start embracing
the different form factor I seen you
before we haven't seen a whole lot of
you know use in this space and we had to
Kindle Fire you had the galaxy tab the
original one the galaxy tab 7.0 plus
which still has honeycomb but Allah Oh
others you know so yeah we'll start to
see I think different differences coming
in the very near future I think it'll be
a good thing for a lot of bigger screen
phones to me most most big phones are
still stuck in the four-by-four home
screen sort of paradigm that this device
even though it's set up more looking
like a phone breaks I think it's it's
set up to be more than
four by four yeah you're right it is
it's it which is something no I got a
note I pretty boy yeah like the Galaxy
Note being for icons by four icons as a
joke I don't want an icon taking up that
much of that big of a screen was just an
EVO doesn't the ipad you know with their
20,000 by whatever God number that is do
that is not what we're supposed to be
doing let's stop at the ipad you get
more was it five icons now I here oh my
god I phone I got on there using yeah
it'sit's numerically it's more icons but
even on their retina display ipad it's
they just scaled up the pixel cam yeah
there's totally wasting it on toast bad
yep okay oh do we have any questions
here about the nexus 7 or anything else
we talked about here I know we had
people talk we had a few users talking
about did the Nicholas Pike said that
his screen was lifting up on his nexus 7
that he got actually today and they they
ordered from google so he said he's
looking to look for a replacement so
yeah once again if you do have that
issue me Google's going to back their
problem they're good companies to go
ahead and go ahead and give them a call
and try to get that replaced I me a
little bit of type of three questions to
take its technical trick question post
take her two questions tiger three
questions so so yeah actually real quick
so sedan as a developer would you
develop oil Tegra 3 i've had a
transformer prime since january i still
haven't touched the colonel llama okay
well there you have it doesn't want any
doesn't want the headache it sounds like
this is so do I share linus torvalds
sentiments towards nvidia then uh no i
mean you know the colonel is fully open
sourced and in ways that some call comms
code is not which I like but the the
Tegra line just test minutes it had a
lot of issues nvidia is very much the
late comer to this game
and they're playing catch-up and the
Tegra 2 is not stellar I mean it was who
they were the first dual core market but
they weren't outperforming single core
chips that were on the market at the
time so it wasn't particularly
impressive the tanker 3 is leaps and
bounds better than the tiger too but it
has had some significant glitches in it
I mean they're from the HTC One X the
international one the transformers that
have it all of them just had a lot of a
lot of stuttering I like a lot of little
issues and I'm hoping that a real three
point X Colonel will help clean up that
