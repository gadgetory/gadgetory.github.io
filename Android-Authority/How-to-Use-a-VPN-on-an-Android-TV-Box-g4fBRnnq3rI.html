can be something of a dilemma deciding
on what software to get it out with is
often the next big challenge that's
because the Google Play Store is just
teeming with content with apps to help
you to get the most out of your
streaming device in this video we're
going to talk about an app that can open
up a ton of content and possibilities a
VPN so for those of you who aren't
familiar with the concept a VPN is
basically a service that allows you to
route to your traffic via a server
located elsewhere giving you a new IP
address in the process and when you
choose a VPN server that's located in a
different country this will give you a
foreign IP address and that can make all
the difference when it comes to
streaming services that are restricted
by region such as Netflix or such as the
BBC suddenly you can watch movies and
shows that you wouldn't otherwise be
able to and of course VPNs bring a ton
of other benefits too in particular
security benefits so I'm going to show
you how to get that set up and get
started and for the purposes of this
demonstration I'm gonna be using our top
rated VPN expressvpn and the setup for
this one couldn't be simpler
installing expressvpn on your android TV
box is just like installing any other
type of app all you have to do is head
over to the Google Play Store search for
expressvpn when you see that option come
up in the list choose it click install
and then it'll install the app for you
then double tap on the icon to launch it
and make sure to accept the permissions
it asks for so that it can work its
magic once in the app we can decide if
you want to use the free trial or sign
up for a full membership the free trial
is good for one week and I'll only work
on your Android TV box if you go for the
full membership you can of course use it
for as long as you like and at the same
time you'll be able to use it across a
whole host of different devices whether
that means a fire TV box whether it
means your Android phone whether it
means your Windows PC etc so enter your
email address and your password and this
will activate the app then click OK in
order to configure the app you'll then
be asked for a connection request click
OK again this is a permission that any
VPN app is going to have to ask for
finally the app will ask if you want to
share your anonymous data with the folks
over at expressvpn this is used to make
the service better it's up to you
whether you want to opt in or not
I say jog on and with that you're now in
the app and ready
you'll see a big button right in the
center and can click that to connect to
a remote server right away this will
automatically connect you to a server
that's located somewhere near you for
optimum browsing speeds however if your
reason for using a VPN is so that you
can fake your location then of course
you're going to need to choose a server
that's based in the location that you
want to pretend you're from so click
choose location and then pick from the
list to find the location that you want
once you're back on the main screen you
can just click that big button in order
to connect and it'll go green once it's
done that successfully as you can see
it's a really simple process and the
great thing is keeping your data safer
whilst also allowing you to access
content from around the world and from
there you're good to go you can exit
that app you can open up your favorite
streaming service and you should be able
to access content from the location that
you chose I hope you found really useful
and interesting if you did then please
leave like please share it around that
helps us out immensely feel free to

you think and if you want to give
expressvpn a go then head over to
