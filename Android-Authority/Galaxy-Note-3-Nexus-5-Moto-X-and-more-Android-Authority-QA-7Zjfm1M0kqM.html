on everybody and it's time to cue some
a's Kusum is a a some cues and said
still sounds wrong it anyway it's
android authority Q&amp;amp;A for August seventh
2013 the aptly named Android user asks
will Android 4.3 come for the galaxy s3
now we don't know for sure but a pretty
strong rumor does point to this being
the case a Korean source reported that
not only is Samsung already working on
updates to Android 4.3 for its current
flagships it is also going to skip
Android 4.2 point2 altogether on last
year's flagships so the galaxy s3 and
the note 2 should be getting the new
version of android of course we don't
know if this speculation or rumor is
true and even if it is we still don't
know when it may happen but it does make
a little bit of sense because the galaxy
s3 is still one of the most widely used
phones out there will we see a nexus 5
and when now the Nexus 5 is probably one
of the most anticipated devices of
probably the entire year however while
we all think it is inevitable that the
nexus 4 will soon be upgraded we still
don't have that much concrete
information since last year's Nexus 4
was based on the Optimus G by LG rumors
and speculation have been pointed to
LG's next G phone to be what the Nexus 5
will be based on we've seen other rumors
stating that LG has already come forth
with a prototype and has shown it to
Google but with LG officially announcing
their flagship phone today the g2 we
could be seeing more news on the Nexus 5
very soon speaking of the LG g2
announcement stay tuned for all of the
news and coverage from that event being
covered by Chris as the reason why I'm
here today may you asks when will then
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 be released and
what are its features will it have a
bigger screen may you I can tell you
this much Aoife at Berlin is just around
the corner at the beginning of September
and it is at that convention that
Samsung plans on officially announcing
and releasing all information on the
samsung galaxy note 3 but with that
being said here's what we've covered so
as far as the release goes since Aoife
is happening in September the full
release should be sometime after that
but definitely in time for the holiday
season a few leak sketches from the
manual suggests that the note 3 will
sport a 5.7 inch screen which is a
slight increase from the 5.5 inch of the
note 2 with a Snapdragon 800 processor
it will get a big boost in performance
and the supposed 13 megapixel camera may
be a big focus because the sketches
suggest the existence of a dedicated
camera button don't worry once all of
the information is out in the
announcement has been made at Aoife
android authority will be there covering
it all you know I'm gonna be there
Fredrik wants to know if the moto x is
available internationally currently moto
is definitely focusing on the US market
but international releases are
definitely in the works we already know
that it's coming to rogers in canada due
to that leaked video but apparently
teaser websites for Motorola's new
flagship have popped up in Brazil and
Argentina we've been on the lookout for
other teaser sites for additional
countries but they haven't shown up just
yet maybe Motorola is looking to take
care of this side of the world first and
then look to branch out but nonetheless
with a high-profile films such as this
the Moto X being in multiple markets is
not only a possibility it should damn
near be an inevitability Salman Khan
wants to know how to connect a ps3
controller to his future sony xperia z
ultra pairing these Sony devices makes a
lot of sense but this can actually be
done on pretty much any device now the
app you need to check out is called 6
axis controller it's a paid app that
allows for your ps3 controller to
connect like a general gamepad for
control using an OTG USB cable pictured
here you don't have to root your device
however for wireless bluetooth gaming
routing is actually a must I've had
plenty of success in the past with an
OTG USB cable and thus have played a
bunch of games android games or even
emulator games using my ps3 controller
if you really need that wireless
connectivity though then you will have
to root your device if you don't know
where to start I would definitely
suggest heading over to the XDA
developers website and forum they'll
give you all the information you need to
get started and they should be able to
help you get your Xperia Z ultra routed
once those tools are available once
that's all finished you can
the sixaxis controller app get yourself
connected and it will guide you through
the rest happy gaming salmon our final
question for today comes from Stephanie
cool art who is looking to get the
lte-capable version of the Sony Xperia Z
and wants to know what networks will
support it now this is a great question
because when I review the Xperia Z a
little while ago I unfortunately have
the same problem the version of the
Xperia Z that I got did not get LTE now
that being said the c6603 version
supports these LTE band frequencies in
band listings for US carriers the band
you're looking for is banned for capable
of 1700 and 2100 frequencies currently
the only carriers that fully support
these are 18 team and t-mobile these two
carriers have prepaid plans that were
recently opened up to LTE connectivity
so you can definitely go that route
Verizon does have plans to open up to
band for but as is the case with it and
sprint usually only phones that are
created for and branded as verizon or
sprint will work on their networks so
unfortunately unless an official version
of the Xperia Z comes out for verizon
hand or sprint you're probably gonna
have to stick with 18 t or t mobile as
always a written companion for this
