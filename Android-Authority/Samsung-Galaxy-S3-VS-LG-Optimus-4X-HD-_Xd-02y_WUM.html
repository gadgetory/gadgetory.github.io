is Clayton over to Android Authority
calm today we've got a head-to-head
comparison of the Samsung Galaxy s3 and
the lg optimus 4x HD now a lot of people
may know that these are two of the
hottest quad-core smartphones available
right now so we're just gonna pick them
head-to-head show their hardware
software and some native apps that
conflict anyways the Samsung Galaxy s3
is the GSM unlocked version and the LG
Optimus is hailing from the UK and it
does not have a release date for the US
yet but we're still gonna compare these
two and show you which one might come
out on top so let us go over some of the
hardware right now as far as the lg
optimus 4x HD we've got a 4.7 inch true
HD IPS LCD screen now the liquid
crystalline display is arranged in a way
that provides an optimal viewing angle
and that's what the IPS means that
stands for in plane switching and the
guest Samsung Galaxy s3 is running a
Super AMOLED display of 4.8 inches now
the resolution is the same on both of
these it's 720 by 1280 and we've got
Corning Gorilla Glass 1 on the lg
optimus and then we've got the Corning
Gorilla Glass 2 on the Samsung Galaxy s3
the Samsung Galaxy s3 has 306 pixels per
inch and the LG has 312 pixels per inch
so we're up 6 pixels in favor of the LG
there anyways we've got a 8 megapixel
camera on the lg optimus 4x HD and we
also do on the samsung galaxy s3 you can
see here on the back they each have an
LED flash and the speaker on the new
Samsung Galaxy s3 is right here speakers
here on the LG now we've also got
front-facing cameras on each of these
the LG is a 1.3 megapixel front-facing
with 700 720p excuse me resolution and
the Samsung Galaxy s3 is a 1.9 megapixel
camera with 720p do capabilities as well
now as far as internals go we're running
an Nvidia tegra3 quad-core processor in
the LG now the quad core in the Tegra 3
also has a fifth core which is a more of
a stable core to run your smaller
not really graphic intensive it's clock
at 500 megahertz just gives you some
battery saving and then in the Samsung
Galaxy s3 we have our quad-core 1.4
gigahertz cortex a9 so we have 1 point 5
mega Hertz versus 1.4 we're gonna do a
benchmark and just show you which one
actually is faster anyways we've got a
20 150 milli amp battery inside of the
lg optimus and we've got a 2100 milliamp
battery inside of the samsung galaxy s3
so we have about 50 more milliamps on
the LG not really gonna make a
difference but you know if you're a
number cruncher that might make a
difference to you so if we take a look
at both devices we can basically see
that they're just about as thick as each
other they're not you know one's not
much bigger than the other we do have
our 4.8 inch screen for 0.7 but the lg
optimus is about 8.9 millimeters thick
and the samsung galaxy s3 is 8.6
millimeter so anyways on the bottom of
both of these devices we have our micro
USB we've got our power button on the
right side of the samsung galaxy s3 and
our power button is on the top of the lg
optimus 4x HD our volume toggle is on
the left side of both with an up and
down rocker and then the galaxy s3 has a
physical home screen button as well as
two capacitive four menu and back now
the lg optimus has a capacitive touch
screen on the bottom for home menu and
back as well and then our reasons are
accessed by holding home as well as on
the Samsung Galaxy s3 now anyways we'll
just peel the back off both of these
because I want to give you guys a good
comparison of how strong they actually
are now when you take the back off of
the lg optimus 4x HD let's remove it
from the bottom and we have our device
face down this is a pretty strong
backing it's it's really not flimsy at
all you know it's kind of hard to bend
it's very strong add some weight to the
device makes you feel if the device is
pretty stable and will remove the back
from the samsung galaxy s3 which is a
little more difficult and to be honest
is a little more flimsy once you get it
off as you can see here this is just
some bendy plastic you know it's really
shiny it's some flimsy plastic but you
know it's it doesn't make much of a
difference as you can see here we have
our internals both of these have
expandable storage
two SIM card slots and they both weigh
basically the exact same so let's get
into some of the software as you can see
each of these phones has their own
intuitive lock screen the Samsung Galaxy
s3 having the natural lock screen the
water drips and we can just unlock it by
swiping it and then the lg optimus has a
lock screen that you can basically touch
anywhere and then open so once each
device is open we can see here that on
the lg optimus we're running our Optimus
version 3 user interface which is the
skin that LG puts over the Ice Cream
Sandwich operating system and then we're
running our TouchWiz 4.0 interface on
the samsung galaxy s3 which is the skin
that Samsung puts over the operating
system of Ice Cream Sandwich anyways
we'll just go into our settings on both
show you which our version of Android
we're running we go down to our about
phone and we see on the lg we're running
Android 4.0.3 and then on the Samsung
Galaxy s3 we're running Android 4.0.4
okay so if we go into our app tray on
each of these devices we see that we
have some pre-loaded apps both from LG
and then from Samsung and some of them
serve the same functionality now some of
the Samsung has the v LG doesn't and
some of the LG has the Samsung doesn't
we'll just go over that here in a minute
now we have our Samsung go on the
samsung galaxy s3 and that compares to
the LG smart world on the LG now
basically these are both app suites that
can suggest apps based upon your
preferences and your demographics now I
had to enter my age and my is a few a
bit more information on the gums Samsung
Galaxy s3 in order to use the Samsung
ago and then I had to register an
account on the LG smart world anyways
we'll go over here and we can see that
which have different memo applications
on the lg optimus 4x HD we have a memo
available in the toggle up here of
course we do have our toggles on both of
these devices but up here we have our
quick memo app which when we select it
we can draw anywhere on the screen at
any time just draw draw draw make a
member to your buddies but on the
Samsung Galaxy s3 I have a widget set up
and we have our S Memo now our S Memo is
available to use within the app
and it doesn't necessarily allow you to
use it at any point and so that's where
the advantage goes to LG now we can
bring down and also use it in their own
respective in-app applications anyways
stylus proves handy in these situations
and the LG is very responsive to a
stylus and so is the Samsung Galaxy s3
okay so as many of you know these
Samsung Galaxy s3 does have the s voice
app and that the LG is lacking such an
app anyways we can demo the S voice skip
all that look up the lg optimus 4x HD
and we'll see that analyzed and you know
it missed a few of the words but it did
search along the general lines of what I
was waiting for it to do anyways the LG
is lacking that functionality so it is
still advantage Samsung um on our LG we
have our and FC functionality and we do
on the Samsung Galaxy s3 but there's no
native app for you'll need to download
one from a Play Store we have our LG tab
on the LG with our pre-loaded NFC tags
that come in the box so both of these do
have Android Beam though mind you and we
can beam info from one phone to another
via NFC chips now we'll just compare
some of the hardware such as the Cam
Ranh each they both are rocking the
eight megapixel camera and they both
take pretty good pictures as you can see
here we're just kind of filming our
white surface so you can't really get a
good test but as far as camera speed it
seems like the galaxy s3 is a little
faster the galaxy s3 is a little faster
but we basically have the same settings
for each we have our flash brightness
focus settings the focus on the lg
optimus is less customizable than it is
on the sampson okay now I know a lot of
people want to know which phone is
faster so we're gonna be doing a
quadrant test right now to show the
speeds of each of these phones now for
the sake of the quadrant test we're
going to
all the other running apps so make sure
we do it efficiently as possible and
that we don't have anything creating a
lag so we'll go to our quadrants
standard on each device we'll actually
see which one performs a benchmark
faster and then we'll see which one has
the better scores so here we go
each of these are very fast devices and
they make it through the tests extremely
fast faster than the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus and you know up to par with the
HTC One series looks like they're both
on memory and they're both on Io
looks like the Samsung Galaxy s3 is
behind a little bit already got our LG
running at 57 59 frames per second and
60 there so we've got about the same FPS
on each device in the LG is this a
little bit ahead still got our planets
at 61 frames per second on the LG and
the Samsung Galaxy s3 does look a little
more rich in this application the colors
look a little better on the Super AMOLED
screen we will send our benchmark
results and we got five thousand and
nineteen on the lg optimus and we got
five thousand six hundred twenty six on
the samsung galaxy s3 so it looks like
they both beat out the HTC One X but the
Samsung Galaxy s3 is the victor now we
won by about six hundred points and that
is you know somewhat of a sizable margin
but they're both very very fast phones
is our CPU on the galaxy s3 scored
thirteen thousand three hundred ninety
five and our CPU on the lg optimus
scored twelve thousand six hundred and
two those are very big scores these are
these phones are just quad-core John few
of the other things to keep in mind is
that the Samsung Galaxy s3 already has
aftermarket accessories it's got uh some
batteries out it's got a lot of cases
there's already a root method in fact
there's some custom roms out for this
already stay tuned for those on our
Channel but the lg optimus is lacking
those as
now now both of these come in different
colors we've got the pebble blue version
of the Samsung Galaxy s3 available and
we've got the black version of the lg
optimus 4x so stay tuned for some more
hardware reviews of these phones some
more software overviews and some more
head-to-head comparisons including both
of these phones so check in next time
guys have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
