from LG claims that LG's next phone will
have its competitors quote
slapping themselves in the forehead
wondering why they hadn't thought of it
first marketing hyperbole you say or is
there a nugget of truth now you probably
already saw my lg g5 rumor roundup but I
didn't talk about this particular nugget
because we weren't able to verify it
well now we've tried to verify it and
here's what we have removable batteries
or lack thereof we're a contentious
subject in 2015 and LG has apparently
found an interesting solution to the
problem by using a modular design rather
than popping off the back cover the
whole bottom portion of the smartphone
below the display can be disassembled
allowing you to simply slip in a new
battery this implies that the USB port
speakers and possibly the headphone jack
can be disconnected and reconnected to
the main board also LG has apparently
been testing out a few potential
solutions including a draw like design
our source didn't directly address
whether or not the rumor of a modular
design is accurate the the source did
state that LG's quote next phone is
gonna have a lot of competitors slapping
their foreheads wondering why they
hadn't thought of this idea first or
maybe they have but no one has been able
to make it work like LG has now of
course that is no confirmation so we
have to be cautious but come on think
about it if true other than the Galaxy
s6 edge this will be the greatest design
innovation we've seen in years next up
is Xiaomi who's made a massive battery
that happens to have a smartphone
attached that's one way of looking at
the xiaomi redmi 3 a ridiculously cheap
phone with a massive 4100 milliamp hour
battery that extends the talktime of its
predecessor by 80% xiaomi is known for
its low cost strategy but this is
impressive even by xiaomi standards
nearly doubling the battery capacity of
the redmi 2 the redmi 3 isn't just a
phone with a big battery either it also
packs a 5-inch HD display octa-core
snapdragon 616 system-on-a-chip 2
gigabytes of ram 16 gigabytes of
internal storage
backed up with microSD expansion all
housed in a full metal chassis the redmi
3 is also equipped with dual sims of the
one slot doubles as an SD card tray on
the camera front the redmi 3 comes with
a 13 megapixel primary camera on the
front is a 5-megapixel selfie camera the
redmi 3 is also available in three
colors black silver and gold the redmi 3
was already released in china just last
week via tamal and me calm and there are
no details just yet about a global
launch but the price tag is a hundred
and five dollars u.s. the redmi 3 may
not be available outside china just yet
but for a full metal phone with a
battery that big you can bet the world
is taking notice for those of you who
are focused on your phone's camera
capabilities you'll want to learn about

January 21st alright I wanted to clear
something up before I go that arose in
the comments from one of last week's
shows on the lg g5 rumor
where I talked about how geeks will be
happy that the LG g5 may have a
removable battery and someone in the
comments said and it was liked and
thumbs up a whole bunch of times that
hey why you calling me a geek just
because I want a removable battery and
he seemed to be taking offence at the
word geek first of all it's not the 80s
where geek was a bad word being a geek
or a nerd is a good thing it means
you're smart it means you're focused and
passion and care about one particular
thing and try and find out everything
you can about it I'm a geek about dogs
phones knives and musical theater yeah
you believe it or not there's a huge
youtube community out there who review
and talk about knives
that's it I'm part of that community so
that's a good thing
but let me tell you the truth we are a
bubble you watch youtube videos on
mobile operating systems brother you're
a geek certified you got your card it's
okay
the vast majority like 95% of the
smartphone population do not care about
a removable battery they just don't they
don't use it they don't use their SD
card they don't they don't they want to
know does the phone work is it
affordable and then the other major
contributing factor to deciding which
phone you buy is it's a status symbol
most people buy iPhones because they
want to be included you're a geek it's
okay
embrace your geekiness and don't forget
about my brothers and sister and Android
we're working super hard to be your
leader in Android geekdom talk to you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
