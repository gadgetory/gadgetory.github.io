here from Android Authority many of our
viewers are aware of the fact that
androids made a strong push towards
html5 based video content Adobe Flash
Player is no longer available for
download on the Google Play Store now
that doesn't mean you can't get the
Adobe Flash Player on your brand new
Galaxy s4 or other smartphone if you
want it sit tight and I'll show you how
so our first step in installing the
flash player on our Galaxy s4 will be to
either follow the link in the
description of this video or search on
your phone Adobe Flash Player archives
from there we'll actually click the
archives and then we're going to want to
scroll down until we find the Android
4.0 archives there's a fairly long list
and you'll find it about halfway through
the page when you do find it you're
going to want to click the very first
result which will be the latest version
that Adobe still updates and the
download will begin
next we're going to want to go into our
settings tab and then we're going to
click the more tab than security we're
going to want to enable unknown sources
because that means we can install apps
that don't come from the Play Store
after that we'll simply go to our
download and click it and it will
install a Flash Player we simply have to
click install and it does all the work
for us and we just wait for the Flash
Player to be finished after that we can
open it up and we're going to want to
use a special browser now we neither
need broke browser firefox or a few
others but chrome and the stock internet
browser will not support flash any ways
to setup flash on the boat browser or
firefox we're going to want to click the
browser we can use just once or always
and we can disregard the page that comes
up in favor of clicking the Settings tab
some settings we're going to want to
click the other settings gear and then
we'll click page content settings we're
going to want to enable the flash
plugins and click always-on or click
your preference from there we can
actually search and test out a flash
based video player we can go to youtube
and check out our android authority
videos and it will bring it up in the
desktop fashion where we can zoom in and
we can even fullscreen the video as well
as perform other commands that are only
available on desktop PCs that's it folks
thanks for watching this is clayton
