flagship smartphone but when the box
arrived I noticed it's not that much
smaller than all of the other ones but
still when we take the lid off of it
we're going to see just how small this
powerful phone is so it's Josh regard
from Android thority what's going on
everybody and this is the unboxing and
first impressions on the Sony Xperia z1
compact ok tape is off alright here we
go
so there we are we looks like we have
the black version of the Xperia z1
compact as you can see the box is
actually not that big but it still only
takes up about a third of the box so
we'll go ahead and take that out I will
go ahead and do the ceremonial plastic
removal in a little bit let's put that
on the side and it comes with screen
protectors that's one of the nice things
about Sony they give you screen
protectors if that is your bag that you
want to protect the screen with piece
I'm going to put those on the side and
here we go take off this flap and here
are your extras we have of course the
micro USB cord or right over here along
with a plug adapter so we have those and
it looks like we have a extra bit here
this looks like an extender for the
micro USB cord just slightly and it's
not that long so the reason I'm saying
that and then of course some earbuds
right here it's nice to see that they
include your buds it's not something you
always get to see when it comes to these
unboxings for flagship smartphones and
the instruction manuals right here
alright and here we are taking a look at
the phone itself oh 4.3 inches in that
screen makes this one of these smallest
phones that I have had to use in the
past even six months this is definitely
not a size you very typically get to see
on a flagship device but that is exactly
what we're working with here so the
ceremonial plastic removal and of course
there you go wonderful
alright and there we go I don't believe
there's any on the sides but there is
your full unboxing right there to be
honest I actually love that I'm dealing
with devices of just two completely
different spectrums - end of the
spectrum when it comes to size we had
the very large tablet in the other video
that I did today and then we have this
the 4.3 inch Sony Xperia z1 compact now
compact is definitely the operative word
when it comes to the size of this phone
I mean I'm it's so pocketable and so
easy to fit into your palm that it's
just it's almost refreshing whenever I
look at mini quote-unquote mini devices
it's a very it's very nice time for me
because I like going back to one we used
to just have phones that just basically
worked and often those mini devices have
run the risk of being just very mid-tier
when it comes to or even lower - when it
comes to their specifications but that
is not the case here and that's why it's
so exciting now we do have the
Snapdragon 800 in here all the same bits
and pieces that were in the Sony Xperia
z1 slightly enhanced especially the
camera which is what I'm looking forward
to and also from what I remember the
viewing angles on the z1 compact are
actually better when compared to the
other devices in the Sony's flagship
space so I'm just really just flipping
this phone around you already see some
of my finger prints there but I'm just
having a lot of fun being able to use
this phone in one hand so easily as I am
of course we do have the waterproofing
and the dust proofing that is on here so
that means that we have the port covers
that are right here very characteristic
of Sony smartphones the IP certification
is what you get with this so this phone
can definitely take a tumble you can
take a splash and it's going to come
right back wanting more so we have the
same button layout on the side with that
signature Sony silver power button the
big silver power button which I'm going
to go ahead and press right now to get
into the UI we have the boot up I
thought their vibration and here comes
the sony logo
down there and there we go we are in the
Xperia UI this is you can see how easily
my thumb just travels from one side to
the other and it makes this probably one
of the most accessible sized phones
for anybody out there who really doesn't
like large phones and especially ones
like the Galaxy Note 3 which just might
be a little bit too big for a number of
you users out there this is a premium
phone in a small casing that allows you
to have a very nimble handling
experience and that is honestly one of
the most refreshing things about this
phone and it's something that I'm very
excited to put through its paces with
