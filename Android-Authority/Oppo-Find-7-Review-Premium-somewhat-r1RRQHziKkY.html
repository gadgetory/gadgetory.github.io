one of the first phones to have come out
into the market with a quad HD display
we were fortunate to be there at the
launch in Beijing China a few months ago
but unfortunately for a while after that
we only had our hands on the opal find
7a which is the not so premium version
that only comes with a full HD display
of course we wanted to get our hands on
the full quad HD display experience and
we did finally get to a little while ago
and I've been using it ever since so I
do have some thoughts on it I will say
now that it is very similar to the elbow
find 7a so remember to check out that
full review but I do have some thoughts
here on this version of opos great
flagship smartphone so it's Josh regard
from Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this is a quick review of
the Oppo find 7 as far as the aesthetics
ago we will start with the design of the
Oppo find 7 and it is largely the same
as the 7a the body is pretty much the
same there's really no size difference
at all it's still got the same 5.5 inch
screen though this time it is quad HD
and as far as the body goes the flat
sides and the very subtle curve on the
back does allow it to be pretty useful
in one hand even though it's just
outside the realm of comforts but the
thing that I was really excited about in
the fine 7 was its backing because aside
from the plastic backings of the spine 7
a we have the carbon fiber backing on
the back of the fine 7 but unfortunately
there was one real problem with it and
it came just days after I got this
version of the phone the carbon fiber
backing despite looking very attractive
at least in my book was already smudged
up and scratched after just a couple
days of usage it slid around a little
bit on one of my tables and on the top
right corner if there's just this
marking on there that I cannot get out
and there's a small version of it over
on the left side as well so
unfortunately while I will say that the
black lines with the silver trim and the
carbon fiber backing make this a very
attractive phone it is easy to get
smudged up at least as was my experience
and unfortunately have to give it a
couple of minus points because that is
just a blemish that I cannot get off the
phone
but of course among a couple other
enhancements we do have the quad HD
display and that is really the main
story here on the Oppo find 7 this is
still one of the most photogenic screens
that I've ever had the pleasure of
recording but at the same time it's very
easy on the eyes because that pixel
density help
make sharpness about as high as it could
get so when you're looking at text or
even just the elements in the color OS
it is really easy to look at and it's
very pleasant to use all in all you're
going to get an enjoyable experience but
to be honest the Oppo find 7 with this
screen really only comes with this as
the main difference between it and it's
and non premium counterparts unless you
really need the extra resolution which
to be fair may not necessarily be taken
advantage of because most media is still
in 1080p resolution well maybe the find
7a is a little bit of a better choice
for you because everything underneath
the surface is pretty much the same when
we are talking about what's underneath
the service we do have a little bit of a
change when it comes to the processing
package the find 7a does come with the
snapdragon 800 but the find 7 does get a
boost with the Snapdragon 801 now that
does put this just a little bit above
the spine 7a but for the general user
out there you may not be noticing that
much of a difference perhaps it's better
to say that the Snapdragon 801 sort of
makes up for what kind of processing
power you need with a quad HD display
but all in all the speed is more or less
comparable and you really aren't going
to be seeing that much of a difference
when you're using one over the other if
you do end up getting the fine 7 you are
going to be on the bleeding edge but the
Snapdragon 800 of the find 7a is really
not all that far behind at all either
when it comes to the hard word you do
also get that little bit of a boost when
it comes to the find seven after all
they have to compensate for the quad HD
display like I keep saying so the
battery does get a bit of a boost to
3000 milliamp hours and it does for the
most part do its job but this is the
thing I have to say about the battery
while the find 7a already had a bit of a
just above average battery performance
the same goes for the find seven in a
sense you do get the same type of
performance with either phone and one of
the things about the find 7a and the
find 7 is that with that sort of low
battery life you are going to have to
plug in the phone more often than not
compared to other phones in the same
space but that is where the ace in the
hole comes for the Oppo find a line
especially the find 7 and find 7a
because it has that vogue fashion now
this is still in my opinion one of the
best trump cards when it comes to these
flagship devices by Oppo because being
able to charge from zero to 100 in about
an hour is still one of the best and
most useful feature
of this phone it's something that I use
all the time but one of the better
things about this phone and either
version is the fact that the back cover
is removable and it allows you access
not only to the micro SD card slot but
you are able to replace the battery if
you need to so bring a couple of spares
with you perhaps and you'll be able to
get all the power that you need and when
you really need it you can bring that
charger and be able to charge on the fly
in a very fast way quick note about the
sound quality we do get this one speaker
on the back of the Oppo find 7 which
does come with it the typical problems
if you lay this phone flat on the
surface you will be blocking some of the
sound that is trying to come out of that
speaker as far as the quality goes
though I actually do like what I hear
from the okhla find seven it's not tinny
which is definitely not the word I'm
going to use in order to describe the
sound there's actually a richness to the
sound the only real issue that I have
with it is that it doesn't get very loud
at all now as we jump into the camera we
do find the same exact camera on here as
we did in the find 7a and that's a 13
megapixel performer that does have quite
a few modes and features built in that
enhance the experience for the most part
though you're going to be having the
same type of performance when it comes
to this and the find 7a of which I
already did a camera shootout which you
can check out by checking the link at
the end of this video and in the
description below but all in all the
camera experience is about what you
would expect on a phone like this a
flagship it may not be the best but it's
also not the worst and is still quite
usable especially for your general users
out there who may get your hands on
either version of the opah and finally
in software I did just want to say a
couple of things here the version of
collar oh s that comes on here is by and
large the same one that you get on the
Oppo find 7 a which was a bit of a
bummer for me because I really wanted to
have color OS 2.0 available even if it
was the beta already installed on here
the procedure to get the color OS beta
2.0 installed on here is a little bit
involved it's not something I wanted to
get into right away primarily because
you have to go through the routing and
all of the flashing on the phone and it
just wasn't something that I was willing
to do until an official version of the
beta 2.0 came out for this version of
the Opel fine 7 what we're missing in
that sense is one of the features at
least that I was really excited to use
on
a premium version of the Oppo find 7
which was the sky gestures as you'll see
in this clip from back during the launch
you hold the volume button down and you
are able to just move the phone around
in a number of different ways in order
to trigger some shortcuts unfortunately
we're not getting that in this version
of color OS it is largely the same but
it's still a useful operating system at
least in my opinion because it comes
with quite a few thoughtful features
that you can take advantage of as long
as you take the time to set them up
there are media pages as you're seeing
here that allow you quick access to a
camera and also a nice-looking music
player if you have built-in music not
necessary music that's in the cloud and
if the screen is off you are able to
double tap to turn on the screen or
you're able to put in a number of
programmable gestures in order to either
get into the camera or turn on the torch
which are always useful they are able to
be triggered even in your pocket from
time to time if you have that issue it
might be better to just turn off those
particular gestures but I haven't had
that issue too often when it came to the
Oppo find 7 or even hits non-premium
counterparts
unfortunately that is really all that
you can say about color OS it is still
one of the more fringe operating systems
out there one that you'll probably have
on Chinese phones like this and it's not
one that you'll find anywhere else
really which does make it a little bit
unique but in the end it has a number of
good features that do differentiate it
and if you do get the Oppo find 7 you
may enjoy color OS but if you don't it
does come with its own recovery still so
you can always go to the Oppo forums and
they have official roms for phones like
this that you can change out in order to
get the experience that you really want
and that's something I've always loved
about open so the Oppo find 7 does come
in at a premium price point compared to
the find 7a and that makes a lot of
sense because after all you are getting
the quad HD display if you so needed but
there are slight bumps in the
performance and in the hardware that
might entice you as well if you really
want to be on the bleeding edge the Oppo
find 7 is where you want to go and I do
think it is still a great performing
phone the only thing that I questioned
on it is the fact that with that quad HD
display and only slight bumps on the
parts within if it's really really worth
the price above the find 7a which we
already said was a fine phone in its own
right if you really don't think that
quad HD is something that you primarily
need the find 7a is still a great choice
at 1080p resolution in its
and I really think that in either case
you're going to get a great phone in
just a matter of whether or not you want
to pay extra for what little you may be
getting in this version of the phone and
so there you have it I hope you enjoyed
this review of the Oppo find 7
I just wanted to riff and give you kind
of a quick review of it my thoughts on
this one one compared to the Oppo find 7
a which we already have a extensive
review on in the video you can see right
over on the side along with the camera
shootout if you really want to see some
examples of the camera quality keep it
