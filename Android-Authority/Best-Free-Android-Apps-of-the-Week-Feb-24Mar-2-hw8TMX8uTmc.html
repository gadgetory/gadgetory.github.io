joe hindy from android authority calm
and today we'll be taking a look at some
of the best free apps for the week of
february2014 the first off we'll be
taking a look at is a new keyboard
called snap keys while other keyboards
are focusing on making typing and
swiping the best they can be snap peas
is taking typing in a whole new
direction instead of having a keyboard
you have four tiles each with three
letters when you type a word you press
the corresponding tile where the letter
is if the letter you're looking for
isn't in one of the tiles you tap the
center then on the right the keyboard
shows you all the words it could be
based on your character input it
definitely takes some getting used to
because this is nothing like the QWERTY
setup we all know and love the backspace
key is on the left the space key is on
the right and if you long press either
of those you can find additional menus
and access the symbols keyboard if you
press both backspace and space at the
same time you can move the keyboard
anywhere you want on the screen if
you're looking for something a little
more unconventional to type on this
could be right up your alley we gave
snap peas a 4.5 out of 5 star rating
because it's something fresh new a hand
for free are you a fan of Temple Run do
you enjoy the gameplay a temple run but
are just tired of replaying the same
levels over and over then pyramid run to
maybe for you and pyramid run to you are
in constant forward motion you swipe
left and right to turn swipe down to
duck and swipe up to jump just like in
Temple Run you can be R to the left and
right to collect coins and other items
eventually you can use those coins to
buy additional lives and power-ups we
see no reason why fans of this genre
won't enjoy pyramid run to of course if
you're a fan of Temple Run and you're a
little burned out on this type of
gameplay then pyramid run to probably
won't be what you're looking for overall
we gave it 4 out of 5 stars the gameplay
is still fun and addicting but the
originality leaves a lot to be desired
there are a lot of applications out
there that will monitor your system
usually they come in apps and widgets
that take up a lot of space on your home
screen and negatively affect your
battery life there is a better way
though like device info live wallpaper
it's a system monitoring widget that's
been made into a live wallpaper instead
of having widgets take up space you just
set this live wallpaper and you can view
your system stats anytime device info
will measure a variety of stats
including CPU load
temperature raymond storage and even
your compass and tilt it even shows time
and date so if you have a widget that
does that you can actually remove it and
save some home screen space there is a
free and a paid version as with most
live wallpapers the free version gives
the core functions while the paid
version offers a little extra we gave it
a 4.5 out of 5 star rating because it's
simple it works and it looks good if
you've ever sat in an office cubicle
thinking about turning your everyday
office supplies into weapons then save a
shooter may be up your alley in this
simple puzzle game you must shoot
pencils with a bow at your co-workers
the idea isn't to kill them but to save
them from hanging today yep you heard
that right in a delightfully morbid
twist all your coworkers have hung
themselves and you have to shoot them
down before they die this is
accomplished by shooting the noose
they're hanging from if you miss you'll
very often just hit them also there is a
time limit so if you let them sit for
too long they'll still die it's not the
most exciting game out there but with
limited time and ammo it's certainly
challenging also the twisted among us
might get a little chuckle out of
shooting coworkers in the head with a
pencil overall we gave save a shooter a
4 out of 5 star rating once again I'm
