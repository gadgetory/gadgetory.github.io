authority and LG's latest smartphone
brings military specifications and a
secondary display could this be the next
smartphone to grace your pocket well
that's what we're about to find out in
this quick hands-on of the LG v10 so
with so many manufacturers switching up
the build materials of their smartphones
to either metal or glass designs LG was
sort of an outlier among Samsung HTC
Apple and even Motorola but they're
looking to change that with the v10 the
v10 still has many design elements that
makes it pretty clear that this is still
an LG device through and through like
these super thin side bezels around the
display and rear-mounted power and
volume keys the keys are shaped a little
bit differently than the g-force keys
but they're nice and large which makes
them very easy to press and find by feel
and another reason for the revamped keys
is because the power button now doubles
as a fingerprint sensor and it's a touch
and hold type like you would find on the
galaxy s6 or even the iPhone so it's
very easy to use very easy to set up and
also very quick at unlocking the phone
instead of an all plastic build like
we're typically used to from most LG
phones the v10 actually features 316l
stainless steel metal rails along the
sides and dura skin on the top bottom
and back panel the phone which is not
only very soft comfortable and grippy
but it also makes the phone more
resilient against Nicks and scratches
this improved build quality and change
in materials makes the v10 a much more
premium feeling phone over other LG
devices but also helps the v10 meet
military standards for improved
durability against drops it's not
exactly a ruggedized smartphone but this
should be great for anyone who is
completely butterfingers with their
smartphones or just needs a smartphone
that can withstand a lot more punishment
over your average phone despite all
these changes the v10 still retains a
removal back which gives access to the
SIM card micro SD card slot for extra
storage and most importantly the
removable battery a feature that is
slowly going the way of the dinosaurs
now despite having some really thin
bezels and a small top and bottom chin
the v10 is still a rather
large phone not only does it feel really
wide but it's also a very tall phone and
a lot of it has to do with the display
it's a 5.7 inch IPS LCD with a
resolution of 2560 by 1440 or quad HD
and LG has a pretty good track record
with making some great-looking displays
for their smartphones and the screen on
the v10 is no exception it's extremely
sharp and so far everything else about
it looks as good as you would expect
from a display on a high-end flagship
smartphone it's got great viewing angles
seems to get fairly bright and has
excellent and accurate looking color
reproduction the most interesting and
unique part about this display though is
the secondary screen that extends above
the main display and if you measure from
the secondary screen to the main display
the screen actually measures in at five
point nine inches it works as a ticker
of sorts showing you any notifications
you might have along with the time
whenever the main display is asleep and
if you swipe over to the left you can
quickly toggle through audio profiles
Wi-Fi turn on the flash or open up the
camera when the main display is awake
the secondary screen will act as a hub
for up to five app shortcuts from
multitasking which you can easily
customize to any apps of your choice it
can also show you many other things like
recently opened applications music
player controls upcoming events in your
calendar and for a little bit of extra
personalization you can even add a
custom message or phrase to be displayed
on the secondary screen having this
secondary display sounds like a really
nice idea but right now it seems rather
questionable how useful it can actually
be in day-to-day use especially
considering it's inconvenient placement
at the top which makes it very hard to
reach with one hand inside the v10 is
being powered by the same Snapdragon 808
processor that powered the g4 but the
v10 comes with four gigs of RAM over the
three that was in the g4 and if the g4
was any indication then performance on
the v10 shouldn't be much of a problem
especially with an extra gig of ram
onboard for storage the v10 comes with
64 gigs of internal storage and like I
mentioned earlier you have a microSD
card slot for up to an additional 200
gigabytes if you need more the battery
inside is a 3000 milliamp hour cell
which should be enough to get the v10
through a full day at the least we'll
have to wait and see how much of an
impact that secondary screen has on the
battery life the V
10 also has support for hi-fi audio
which can up sample 16-bit 44.1
kilohertz audio to 32-bit 384 kilohertz
audio to give you the best audio
experience possible the camera on the
v10 is pretty much the same as the one
on the g4 it's a 16 megapixel sensor F
1.8 with optical image stabilization and
the camera software basically continues
over from the g4 so you still have that
same DSLR like controls for pictures but
now on the v10 you also have that same
exact control for videos so you can
control the focus the shutter speed the
white balance the ISO all these same
controls that you had with photos you
now have that with videos which is
really great especially if you want to
be able to take some very cinematic
looking videos on your smartphone and be
able to have that full control the most
interesting part about the camera on the
v10 though is actually on the front
instead of one front-facing camera you
actually have two front-facing cameras
both of which are 5 megapixels and what
this allows you to do is switch between
a narrower field of view and a much
wider field of view on the fly so a
narrower field of view will be great if
it's just you in the frame but if you
need to take a group fee or a selfie
with a bunch of other people you can
switch to the wider field of view to
easily fit your friends or your family
into the frame for the software it's
running on android 5.1.1 lollipop with
LG's GUI on top so it's bringing a lot
of same features that you've come to
know from LG like knock on and knock
code and split screen multitasking and
LG says that the v10 will be updated to
marshmallow either before the end of
this year or early next year you can
expect the v10 to be available in early
to mid November in the US market and LG
wouldn't give us an exact price but they
said it's going to be priced above the
g4 so expect a very premium price tag
with the v10 but this has been a quick
look of the LG v10 make sure to keep it
tuned here to Android 34 more because we
are your source for all things Android
