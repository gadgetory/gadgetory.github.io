this is a new show we're doing here on
Android Authority where we discuss a new
phone and it's camera capabilities and
we're gonna be talking about the app its
features and of course the image quality
and what better phone to use for this
episode than the Huawei p30 Pro because
of course this is a phone that is about
the camera first so let's dig into it
now on the back of this phone you've got
three cameras you've got a 16 megapixel
wide-angle camera with an aperture of
f-22 and optical image stabilization
you've got that 14 megapixel main camera
with an F 1.6 aperture and in the Huawei
P 30 Pro you have got an 8 megapixel 5x
optical telephoto zoom camera with an
aperture of F 3.4 now this 5x optical
zoom lens is very special because it's
using this prism mechanism called a
periscope to actually bend the light
about 90 degrees and get a true lossless
5x zoom which is really really unique to
the Huawei p30 pro there's also a time
of flight sensor on the back of the
phone that helps for things like depth
sensing in portrait mode which we'll
probably get into later
now if you've used other Huawei phones
like the webby p20 Pro or maybe the May
20 pro you're gonna feel right at home
with the p30 pro's camera app all the
main features you're probably gonna use
on a daily basis are on a carousel on
the bottom here like aperture night mode
portrait mode photo mode video mode and
pro mode and the more sections gonna
give you even more options like panorama
modes underwater modes or even lake
painting overall I'd say the app for the
p30 pro is really easy to use it's got
all the features that you want to use on
a daily basis right on that carousel
down at the bottom the shutter button is
right front and center but if you want
to go into a little bit of more of a pro
setting there's a settings menu that
allows you to add things like grid bars
and a whole lot more features so check
that out in the article down below now
in daylight conditions the p30 pro
performs pretty well and you're gonna
find a ton of detail in areas that are
normally gonna get blurred out by other
phones if you look at these photos of a
donkey and a chicken you're gonna see a
huge amount of detail on both the fur
and the feathers and at 5x and 10x ooh
moans you've also got a ton of
which is really nice to see the 5x is
obstacle but the 10x mode is actually
filling it in with a I processing
dynamic range is better than something
like the galaxy s 10 but it does make
the colors look a little bit washed out
now if that being said it's really nice
to see detail in areas that are normally
blown out or too dark especially in
things like group photos now low-light
is where the p30 Pro really really
shines I'm not sure what software magic
while he's using here but low-light Auto
mode captures even more light than
Google's long exposure night sight mode
on the pixel now night mode captures a
little bit more detail but has trouble
getting proper white balance versus the
regular auto mode if you want a phone
that does really amazing low-light
you're gonna have to get the p30 Pro I
don't think that I've seen any other
phone that's able to do low-light photos
like this phone can and it's just
amazing portrait mode does a pretty good
job of subject separation thanks at a
time of flight center but these skin
smoothing and over saturation look a bit
artificial aperture mode actually does a
much better job for portraits and does a
great job balancing detail in color for
a nice image that pretty much wraps up
this episode of camera 360 with the
Huawei P 30 Pro make sure you head over
to Android every calm for a ton of more
information a lot more detail about this
because we actually did a dedicated
camera review specifically for the p30
pro and we have the full review over
there as well as well as a bunch of full
resolution images if you want a pixel
beep yourself so head over there watch
our review and I will catch you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
