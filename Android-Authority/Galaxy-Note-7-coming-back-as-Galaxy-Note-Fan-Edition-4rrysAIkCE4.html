the guise of the Galaxy Note fan edition
because they had to fan out the flames
yeah I'm going to go with that one the
Galaxy Note fan edition will be priced
at $699,000 us when it goes on sale this
Friday the news arrived by the Korea
Herald and the image above via Sam Kim
Asia which also noted that Samsung Bisby
functionality has been added to the
refurbished phones now were you thinking
what I'm thinking because I'm thinking
that Sammy wants to burn us twice once
with the burn your host down phone and
second with the $600 u.s. price tag for
a refurbished phone that bites a little
bit after months of speculation and
jokes the Galaxy Note sevens fan Edition
has finally been confirmed by a
promotional poster now on display in
South Korea
the Galaxy Note fan Edition is expected
to be announced and select countries on
July 7th starting in South Korea now in
case you thought that Samsung might be
trying to downplay the number 7 in the
relaunch of this device no no no they
will be launching this refurbished
device on July 7th 2017 that 7-7 17 we
are talking about the note 7 debacle
from last year which caused the Samsung
shares to tank like a Led Zeppelin
Goddard myth Sammy that took some stones
Samsung has as expected recovered
perfectly well from a global recall of
the galaxy note 7 last year and now has
a much more stringent safety testing
procedure in place let's just take a
moment and talk about the risk that
Samsung has taken on by relaunching this
particular device in this particular way
should a single Galaxy Note fan edition
have a battery issue it will go public
in an instant and resurrect the whole
fiasco from last year producing far
worse PR returns then the company will
make financially by reselling
refurbished devices and the cynical tech
reporter and me suggest that Apple and
other Samsung competitors will be ready
waiting to pounce
if there is one iota of a safety issue
with
refurbished device now there are a lot
of hardcore galaxy note fans out there
and I want to know what you think about
this will you get this is it just too
expensive than launching it too close to
the Galaxy Note 8 what do you think let
me know in the comments below
