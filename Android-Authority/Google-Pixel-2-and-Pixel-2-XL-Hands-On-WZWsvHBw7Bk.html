Google assistant all you have to do is
give these phones a little squeeze but
there's so much more that these new
Google phones offer it's Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody and this is
our first look at the Google pixel 2 and
the pixel 2 XL brought to you by audible
now there are two sizes of the Google
pixel - there's a pixel - and the pixel
2 XL which is the one that I have in my
hand right now the pixel 2 XL is
actually pretty easy to handle still and
especially with these squeezing
capability it's still easy to do that
and get right into Google assistants
without any problems at all one of the
workflows that were probably gonna end
up seeing a lot is when you take the
phone out of your pocket you just take
it out and even with the screen off you
could just squeeze the device and it
will turn right back on and give you a
Google assistant the smaller pixel 2
comes with 5 inches in its screen and
it's a Full HD OLED screen the Google
pixel to excel will have a 6 inch quad
HD OLED display that also rocks a 18 by
9 aspect ratio now the pixel 2 has the
smaller screen and thus is a little bit
easier to handle which is expected but
the pixel 2 XL does a little bit of a
better job this time around with that 18
by 9 aspect ratio the screen is a little
bit taller than it is wide like a lot of
18 by 9 aspect ratio phones that we're
seeing this year and thus it is a little
bit easier to handle than its
counterpart from last year now there's
one thing that I was really surprised by
it was the dual front facing speaker now
what we have our stereo speakers on the
front to make it so that you're able to
blast music or whatever you're watching
at yourself and I will admit it's a
little bit too loud in this area for me
to actually test the speakers but I will
say this when I played a youtube video I
was actually able to hear it even in
this environment now that's not the best
test but we're going to do that testing
even more later on with our 40
speaking of audio probably one of the
big points of contention for people is
going to be the lack of a headphone jack
unfortunately there is no headphone jack
on these devices which means are going
to be using either a USB C adapted pair
of headphones or you're going to be
using the pixel buds or any other
wireless bluetooth headphones in order
to enjoy music and audio out of these
new pixel phones underneath the hood you
get the snapdragon 835 with the audrina
540 and 4 gigabytes of ram and in both
phones you can get 64 or 128 gigabytes
of on-board storage with no microSD card
slot the batteries are also relative to
which device you get as the pixel
has a 2700 milliamp hour battery and the
pixel to excel gets 835 20 milliamp hour
unit and both phones have ip67 water and
dust resistance there are a number of
colors of the pixel - including a blue
version that you're seeing in this video
and of the pixel to XO we have two
colors and I'm holding the black one in
this segment right now but the one that
I really want to get my hands on is that
panda color with that coral power button
on the side that gives it a really
lovely accent but now we can talk about
the cameras and the rear cameras on both
of these devices have a 12 megapixel
sensor with 1.4 micron pixel sizes at F
1.8 aperture but behind all of that is a
data algorithm by Google that uses its
machine learning in order to give you
all of the best data to get the best
possible shot out of these cameras
Google is also going for the more
data-driven photography experience using
machine learning as much as it possibly
can in order to cater the shot to the
best possible quality but this portrait
mode is also available for the
front-facing camera which is an 8
megapixel shooter and as you can see I'm
in the stranger things little demo area
where they're showing off the AR
capability is putting stranger things
monsters and characters right beside me
here on this couch it's actually a
pretty great feature of the camera
pretty low latency and I'm able to
interact with those creatures and
characters live on the camera
application it's just one capability on
these cameras that actually got one of
the highest if not the highest DXL mark
ratings that we've seen on any
smartphone so far and yet another
capability of the camera is google lense
which is now a part of google assistant
that you can access by hitting the icon
when you open up the assistant it allows
you to scan pretty much anything in your
environment and you will be able to use
Google's own search engines in order to
figure out exactly what you're looking
at and of course with the software we
have the stock Android experience with
Android 8.0 Oreo at the helm now what
you get is the latest version of Android
so if you are an Android purist of
course you're going to be looking at the
pixel as the best experience for
Google's operating system if you're a
veteran of stock Android then you know
what to expect here the interface looks
incredibly familiar but the search bar
has been moved to the bottom so that you
are able to use it no matter what screen
you're on and then of course you're able
to get to Google assistant in a number
of different ways including now
squeezing the phone
and there's one thing that's incredibly
clear about these pixel phones and about
Google's product line for this year it's
that Google assistant is definitely at
the helm and is the focus of all of
their products will be giving you our
full review once you get our hands on a
unit and I'm really hoping I get the
pixel to excel in that panda color
because that's the one that I definitely
want to rock so as always thank you guys
