earlier this year but the phone has just
landed in Europe under the name Dianna
ate crow what matters here though is
what you're getting regardless of what
it's called and what you're getting is a
flagship package at less than flagship
prices I'm Chris Carlin with Android
authority and this is your first look at
the honor eight Pro generate pro pack
small flagship specs than some flag
ships and it looks every bit as good as
phones that cost a couple of hundred
dollars more admittedly there's a bit of
a resemblance to the iPhone 7 plus here
but the honoré Pro very much follows in
the design footprints of last year's on
a v8 and this year's Huawei p10 there's
Jul 12 megapixel cameras on the back
maaan monochrome and one RGB and a matte
metal finish in three different colors I
picked up a navy blue unit but there's
also a midnight black and a platinum
gold option the fingerprint scanner is
nice and fast and can also be used for
highways navigation gestures as well as
to lock down sensitive apps and files up
front there's a massive 5.7 inch screen
covered by Gorilla Glass 3 that has now
been bumped up to qHD resolution on the
bottom there's a single speaker along
with USB type-c and the now endangered
3.5 ml headphone port up top there's an
IR blaster and on the right hand side
lives a textured power button and the
volume rocker all this is encased in a
chassis that's less than 7 millimeters
thick
the honoré pro is running android new
go with emui 5.1 on top and it feels
exactly the same on the software front
as the LA way mate 9np 10 there's not
much point going into too much detail on
the software if you've seen any other
recent Huawei or on a review but suffice
it to say that it's clean fluid and very
well equipped we've got a comprehensive
rundown of everything new in emu i-5
I'll link in the description if you want
more info but the main thing to know is
that there's now an option for an app
drawer and you'll also get Google
Assistant part of the honoré Pro
software fluidity comes down to its spec
sheet it's powered by the keren 960 the
chips are found in both the mate 9 and
p10 series 2 or flyways top tier devices
right now that's backed up by 6
gigabytes of RAM and 64 gig of storage
with microSD expansion in a hybrid SIM
card tray
well that is kept running by a 4000
milliamp hour battery with support for
quick charge of course we'll let you
know how those claims stack up in the
full review and we'll also be keeping an
eye on the machine learning algorithm
that is designed to learn your usage
habits and open your favorite apps
faster one of the coolest parts of the
honor 8 Pro unboxing experience will be
when you realize there's a cardboard VR
viewer included as part of the packaging
take your honor a pro out of the box
remove the charging ephemera and
paperwork and you'll find two lenses for
the viewer that sits in the bottom part
of the box assemble it yourself and dive
right into the VR experience with the
joint VR app that's preloaded on the
phone get another good reason for that
bump up to qHD resolution on the display
moving on to the camera you'll get twin
12 megapixel shooters one for color and
another for detail just like on the
highway p10 there's no like a branding
here though but as we found with other
non like a while way cameras recently
the image processing is similar
nonetheless what this means is an
excellent camera on a more affordable
smartphone there's a wide aperture mode
that lets you fake that fancy bokeh
background dslr's are capable of and
while it's not perfect it can produce
some pretty impressive results on
occasion photos taken in wide aperture
mode can also have their focal point
changed after the fact again fun it's
not entirely useful the honoré pro
shoots video in 4k but you'll only be
able to enjoy the benefit of image
stabilization and video at full HD
resolution at 30 frames per second wide
aperture mode also works in video mode
though so you can shoot video with
shallow depth of field the honoré pro
is up for pre-order now with general
availability in the UK and europe on or
around April 24 475 pounds or 549 euros
the honoré pro most likely won't be
making it to the US but if history is
any indication beyond a 9 will be
sometime in the middle of the year and
it'll have essentially the same specs as
the honoré pro just with a smaller
display and the addition of like a
branding on the camera as always thank
