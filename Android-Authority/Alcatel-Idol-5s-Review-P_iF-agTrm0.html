think about success in phones they're
usually supposed to be better faster
stronger and then there's the Alcatel
Idol 5s so the phone the idol 5s comes a
year after its predecessor last year's
Idol 4s which featured a
gorgeous-looking quad HD screen
it was also be are capable and it did
come with a VR headset but this year's
model with the idol 5s you're going to
see some reductions in terms of the
specs but before we get into that let's
talk about the design of the idol 5s and
I got to say it's a stunning looking
phone it's gorgeous it looks like a
flagship handset because it's glass and
metal construction just like last year's
model and this time it's slightly
smaller so it's easier to hold one hand
the glass dough is a fingerprint magnet
and it is kind of slippery but then
again you're not paying for the flagship
cost going back to the specs the first
thing you're going to find something
strange going on with the phone is with
the display it's a 5.2 inch 1080p IPS
LCD display that's both smaller in size
and lower in resolution versus last
year's model so you might be wondering
about detail performance it's still good
enough here for most people looking at
it from the normal distance you're not
going to notice a whole lot difference
one area you're going to notice
difference though is probably the VR
aspect because with that lower
resolution screen it does show a little
bit more pixelation because those pixels
aren't as densely packed the phone
features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chip
with three gigabytes of RAM now that's
not a huge overall versus lasher's model
but say at least it suffice is for basic
stuff so if you're going to be doing
your usual texting sending email surfing
the web no problems with this chipset
although the one area you're going to
have some big issues is going to be with
gaming because the GPU is definitely
going to be tested here for the price of
the phone you're getting some extra
goodies one of them is of course the
fingerprint sensor on the back of the
phone you also have a USB type-c port it
has a dual front firing speakers which I
gotta say are amazing because they
deliver some really crisp tones and
pretty powerful
- so you're going to be blown away by
the quality and yes it does have a 3 and
1/2 millimeter headset jack now because
of its smaller footprint versus its
predecessor the idol 5s also has a lower
capacity battery 26:20 million power
battery cell inside of here it's nice
that it's felt but the battery
performance here is average at best
you'll get by through most of a day but
if you're a power user of big into
gaming the battery is going to need
routine charging lots of concern if a
phone has a lower resolution with its
camera versus its predecessor so the 12
megapixel camera here in the idol 5s is
definitely suffice it gets the job done
just as long as the conditions are ideal
of course when the lighting conditions
are nice it's going to take some
beautiful looking photos good mount
sharpness there's a vibrant colors and
that's an excellent job when it comes to
macros you get that soft out-of-focus
effect with the background now when it
comes to the front-facing camera it does
a great job - it's an 8 megapixel front
facing camera good amount details
capture the only areas that have a
problem with the camera is with low
light of course it's natural but you do
see a heavier presence of digital noise
a lot of artifacting and becomes more
pervasive when you shoot video there's a
whole lot of bloatware or heavy
customizations with the experience it's
running a mostly stock Android 7.1 new
good experience the only difference
though is if you get the Amazon Prime
exclusive version the phone now that
one's going to have ads and offers in
the lockscreen so that might be a little
bit distractive but that's what you get
if you want to get the discount and
finally I have no issues whatsoever with
the call quality performance because the
earpiece itself is very good voices
sharp clear very powerful - so even in
noisy environments you're not going to
run into any trouble with it now despite
having all those reductions with the
specs versus its predecessor the
starting cost of the idol 5s is $280
through Amazon that's unlocked so it's
available to work with 18 T or t-mobile
and for the price point it's not bad and
that's something that becomes more
profound because for the money the
design is really attractive its high
quality and you
I feel like you're getting a handset
that's higher in price and finally if
you want more savings instead of paying
a $280 you could actually pick up the
Amazon Prime exclusive edition of the
phone for only $200 so that's an $80
savings yes you're going to get those
pads in your face in the lock screen but
if you're willing tolerated the
discounts worth it
now this one's not for everyone but if
you're looking to save some money you
want a brand new phone with a premium
design with that pounds pay the premium
cost the idol 5s isn't that bad of an
option there you go guys that is a
