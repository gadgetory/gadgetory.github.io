of what's going on everybody and I'm
here with Rob from Hyundai and
automotive is a big story here at CES
and no less than having Nvidia talk
about their console and their particular
type of platform do we have a lot of
manufacturers like Hyundai coming to
events like Pep come which we are here
at right now live at CES 2015 but Rob
here wanted to show me a couple of
iterations that they have that involved
the Android platform not just Android
auto but an Android wear app that he
will be showcasing in a little bit but I
did have a couple of questions for you
about your guys's implementation of
Android auto Android auto being a
platform that nearly every manufacturer
can use what is the way that Hyundai is
changing the way that Android auto is
perceived and the use in the eyes of
your manufacturer right well we're
really proud of our work with Android
auto and really how we differentiate
ourselves we're one of the first to
market we've been working since the
announcement of Android auto very close
with Google and one of the ways that we
really see Android auto benefiting our
customers and shoppers is in how we're
bringing navigation to where really
navigation wasn't available before it
was always seen as a high trim item of
more of a premium feature with Android
auto and our announcement recently a
display audio where we're going to be
providing head units have screens with
no CD players no built-in navigation
software where you can bring your own
navigation through Android auto or car
play so we really see our
differentiation and we're gonna bring
Android auto and navigation to the
masses by having a really high access
you know a high volume
products so here you can you know just
like any Android wear app you can go in
there and just select it manually or you
can ask you can tell Google you know
start blue link and it'll divert into
our blue like app and our blue link app
is really an extension of our Android
app for you know for your mobile phone
and you can access all the features of a
blue link through this Android wear app
and so we've got you know remote start
door lock door unlocked remote stop you
can flash the lights if you're looking
for a car in a parking lot you can flash
the lights and honk your horn if you're
looking for a car you can find your car
and it'll get actually located on GPS
call roadside and these are all these
will execute commands on your phone you
just start dialing and we also have
voice commands within so you can just
tell unlock my car and it'll dive into
the unlock menu and it'll actually send
an unlock command and my car is actually
a couple hundred miles away in
California right now and I'm just
sending an unlock command in the parking
lot so it's really cool it's fast we've
have a calculator flat form that makes
it really fast and easy to do this and
you can divert it in so you know one of
our most popular features of blue link
is remote start so making it as easy as
possible to use for our our owners can
only make the experience even better so
blue link is it's a telematics platform
which means it's a connected car
platform so all our vehicles that have
blue link have built-in modems whether
it's a 4G LTE modem or something a
little different we we had the lincoln
MKT for about three years now and it
allows our owners to access about 30
different features safety convenient so
for example crash notification if your
car gets in an accident it calls you
know and ask for help also from a
service standpoint with blue link you
can actually schedule a service
appointment we're one of the only
automakers that has full and an
integration with like a dealer
appointment book where you can use
bullying
schedule an appointment for like an oil
change and it knows the actual open
times and it's all done through the
cloud all right so you just saw in that
the one segment the actual application
on his one plus one for Android
obviously but I did have a couple
questions now that we went through that
oh by the way one of the really cool
features that I saw in there was the
ability to send your route or the
directions straight to the car so
they're ready the moment you get in I
know that was really cool anyway
bluelink
is it only a Hyundai system that's
available that's correct it's a it's a
built in from the ground up we have
built it it's it only works on Hyundai
vehicles it's available on all our
models except the accent so we have we
want to give everyone access to these
amazing cooling features for safety
reasons and for convenience reasons so
is it something that this is a question
for a couple of my friends who owned
Hyundai's can it be retrofitted into
cars that or no it cannot be able to
need to come because it's so tied into
the electronics of the car there's
actually a a modem and a telematics unit
that talks to the systems in the car so
it's pretty deeply wired in there and
the final question that I had with
Android auto becoming the platform by
which a lot of a lot of these consoles
and a lot of these driving aids are
going to be blue link I'm guessing is
going to have some sort of integration
in with that right yeah so we we see all
our systems working together right
Android auto is really an infotainment
platform that allows us to really
enhance that experience while driving we
see blue link as another way for us to
enhance
ownership experience so we feel that
without all these things together it
really creates an awesome driving
experience immersive experience for our
customers we got a nice rundown of the
Android wear application blue link on
the actual Android platform itself and
then Android auto will be coming in the
next couple days so make sure you guys
stay tuned here for all of that and even
more coverage Rob thank you so much man
it was great to see you and great to
hang out with you
we're here at pep comm at CES 2015 make
sure you stay tuned for android
authority your source for all things
