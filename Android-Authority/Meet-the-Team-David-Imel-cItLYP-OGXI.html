mal amel imal however you want to say it
I don't really care because I don't
really know how to say it myself
and here Android Authority we like to do
a little thing we call meet the team and
given recent circumstances I figured
this would be a good time for me to do a
little meet the team video myself so I
was born and raised in a little town
called smartville California which is
kind of way up north near Lake Tahoe but
I spent all of my time in that a city in
Grass Valley California where I went to
school did elementary school in high
school there if I could break myself
into three main hobbies I'd probably say
that it is computer hardware technology
jazz and drumming and also writing I've
been really into drumming all of my life
so when I was five I joined this group
called Grass Valley taiko which is these
large drums that you hit with these
giant sticks called bocce and we would
perform all throughout California and I
did that until I was 14 but when I was
in middle school I joined the school
jazz band and have just been playing
jazz and funk music and all that kind of
stuff
all throughout my entire life in high
school actually formed this band called
loose cannon mariachi which is also a
huge part of my life we are not
currently together anymore but it was a
scotch jazz rock Orchestra and we had
drums bass guitars saxophone trumpet
everything
so that was that was definitely the most
musical part of my life and I still
haven't been able to play as much as I
would like where I'm currently at now
but I'm hoping to jump back into that
soon as far as writing is concerned I've
kind of always just been a writer as a
hobby in high school I wrote I know it
sounds really dramatic but I wrote tons
of poetry and that kind of just
eventually translated into writing for
blogs into stuff that I really enjoyed
so that kind of blends itself into the
tech part of my life now as to how I got
into technology I was kind of really
really into Nintendo and Pokemon as a
kid myself kind of am obviously but when
I was five I got my first video game
which was pokemon gold version but we
got a first computer around that same
time too and this whole electronics
thing kind of interests me I would
started tinkering with our computer my
parents had no idea what they were doing
with it so my sister and I would just
kind of mess with it look inside you
know those gold Dell HP compact cases I
get blamed for all the problems which
was probably our fault
yeah when Google search kind of started
blowing up that just like blew my mind
because it was like you could get any
information at any time and to me that
was like the most crazy thing of all
time and even when I was like in middle
school elementary school I was just like
how how is it that we are not utilizing
this to a solar potential so this is
when the technology bubble was bursting
everyone was just freaking out so I
thought that was absolutely amazing I
would just sit on the computer for hours
and be googling things and going on
Yahoo Answers because that's where he
found the information back then when I
was in middle school we had a thing
called Gilmore News Network which was
kind of this thing with we would put on
with the teachers before school we
learned how to use all these cameras and
all this editing software and we had
Apple computers that were donated that
we were working on just kind of learning
Final Cut Pro and all this stuff as like
little kids so that was really cool that
that was amazing because I got to learn
how to use all the computers all the
software all the camera stuff and I just
got really interested in kind of like
media in general so we didn't really
have anything like that at my high
school but I did start the technology
and business club at my high school
which was a very similar thing
but rather it was just we would meet
every week and we would talk about like
what's happening currently in technology
and all the stuff that's going on we had
a senior project that we had to do when
I was graduating high school and what I
chose to do was create an Android app so
it was this little app called turtle
tank which was dumb but you know it's an
app and you were just like this little
turtle with a triangular shell and then
as you level up you get more shapes for
your shell so you get a square and then
Pentagon and hexagon so forth you shoot
pellets it was really dumb I did it for
hackathon but it was really fun and it
kind of like made me really really
really excited about Android so if we
kind of back up a little bit to the
beginning of high school that's when
Android was kind of first starting to
like blow up blow up I was actually able
to convince my mom to let me get a
smartphone because Google Maps came out
and that became a thing and I convinced
her that I can find myself anywhere
anytime I can find my way back to you
which was like a great reason it was a
good convincing text expected but I
remember I just was like researching the
heck out of these phones and the Droid
Bionic was the phone that I just started
being completely obsessed with and going
on Google News and setting tags and
getting email or every single time a new
news article published about this phone
and of course ended up being one of the
most delayed phones of all time which
was terrible but essentially when
Verizon was switching off of the
unlimited data plan thing that's when I
was like okay you know I'm done waiting
for this phone I just need to get
unlimited data so that I can do some
limited data things I ended up picking
up a HTC Thunderbolt this phone was
amazing and I still miss it at a
kickstand it burned my hands oh it
overheated when I was using Skype and
like all this stuff together now you
don't need to know all this stuff HTC
Thunderbolt was amazing but I had to
return it and I fished it out for a
Droid Charge which was a far worse phone
and
was one of the worst decisions I've ever
made but I digress
anyway after high school I went to UC
Santa Cruz for college I originally
majored in straight computer science
because I was just really into Google
and everything and Android and I just
really wanted to be the head of Android
at Google eventually a very very long
pipe dream of mine so we'll see if I
ever comes through obviously not
happening right now
then my sophomore year at UC Santa Cruz
I discovered that we had this kind of
dual major thing it's called technology
information management but it's kind of
a combination between computer science
and economics so as soon as I found that
out I was like oh my gosh I have to get
into this like right now so I switched
majors and if the next year I had joined
the technology Information Management
Association I became the president of
the Association the next year we went on
company tourists we mused we went to
Google and Apple and Yahoo but my
freshman year of college I really wanted
to start writing and I met someone who
worked at this blog called one tech stop
net which was a phone blog which is what
I've been wanting to do forever and so
he told me he worked at this small blog
which was a Windows Phone centric blog
it was it was you know technically
focused on Windows Phone but I really
just wanted to start writing I really
just wanted to get a portfolio out there
so I asked him like can you ask your
boss if you might be able to possibly
you know get a writing job there so we
asked him I wrote a couple articles for
them and then they hired me so I worked
at one tech stop for about two years
basically I worked there from early in
my sophomore year of college until
sometime around my senior year probably
halfway through I made a bunch of
reviews for that channel the video
quality is probably not great I'm pretty
sure everything is really slow now as I
really didn't know that much about
camera as a passed point but again it
was just an amazing way to get a
portfolio so that I could later apply
these other places that's kind of how I
got started with these text journalism
thing so also well about halfway through
college I actually landed a job at Intel
as a systems engineer so intelligence
Santa Clara California
and I lived in Santa Cruz California so
I started commuting an hour and a half
to two hours every single day I was
working on their server stacks and we
were kind of installing new data centers
doing the computer hardware thing
because I was really really into like
building pcs and I would do it for
people for side money and all that stuff
so I worked for them for about a year
doing that and then I got promoted to
being a project manager for their
wearable devices systems things so I
worked on a lot of the wearables and
victory chips that they used in a lot of
these wearables but I had applied to
Android authority probably eight to nine
months before that just you know seeing
what was out there and then I got an
email on the way to work one day and
they said hey like we're opening this
new thing called VR swords being a
technology nerd like we all are
yeah virtual reality is awesome you know
it's really cool so I said yeah of
course I kinda I still was technically
in school but I would go to work it
Intel full-time and then during my lunch
I would do VR source articles and I'd go
home try to figure out what technically
the professor's did in class that day
and then I would do my homework and then
I would write like one or two more
articles and this was kind of a daily
ritual and then like sometime along the
line there I was finishing up with
school and I was kind of tired of doing
the nine-to-five office job thing and
until I was mostly just tired of
commuting an hour and a half every
single day and so I kind of talked to
the Android authority people I said you
know my passion is really in writing and
informing people about technology and
not really being in this kind of giant
corporate structure like I thought it
would be because I always really really
wanted to work for Google so Intel was
like you know up there with Google for
me but I kind of learned that hi like I
really like journalism a lot more and
it's fun to like me people talk to
people help inform people about
technology interact with people to talk
to them for a while and I said you know
you've been working us for us for a long
time now and if you want to come on a
full-time on board then you can so I
quit my job at Intel I move
San Francisco and that's where I'm at
right now
you guys just recently found my first
Android authority video which I know
that I'm making it better I'm trying to
get better but this is kind of me diving
straight in to this video side of things
so please bear with me while I learn
kind of just learning over time taking
your feedback and figuring out like what
works and what doesn't so it's a piece
of process so so thanks so anyway that's
kind of where we're at today and I
really hope that you guys will bear with
me as I kind of learn all the ins and
outs of this industry it's been like my
dream for a really long time so I'm kind
of like finally living it finally where
I want to be and I think that I can
inform you and the best way possible so
thanks again and if you're interested in
