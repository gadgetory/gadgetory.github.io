with mobile technology and they have a
new tablet with a tagline thinking ahead
how far does this think ahead and will
this carve a new niche for a declining
tablet market
I'm Kevin the tech ninja this is the
Nokia in one tablet review Nokia brought
a premium build to the n1 tablet
starting with the materials the n1 is an
aluminum one-piece design with surface
analyzation which provides a solid
premium feeling device in the hand the
back surface is smooth and the best way
for me to describe the fill is a sheet
of metal the tapered edges gives it a
nice rounded look and it makes it very
pleasing to hold the tablet layout is
pretty familiar volume rocker on the
right side up top the headphone jack and
power button mic whole left side is bare
at the bottom is where we'll find our
dual mono speakers and flanking that is
the USB C port on the face of the n1
you're greeted with your 7.9 inch
display and also the fixed 5 megapixel
camera the buttons provide a great
tactile field and each press requires a
decent amount of travel and this
prevents from phantom presses even when
shaking the device there's no traces of
any type of rattling or loose parts
as far as design the n1 feels great and
you can compare it to any tablet on the
market
Nokia's in one tablet gives you a 7.9
inch screen at 2048 by 1536 resolution
which is a four by three ratio this IPS
324 PPI panel is backlit and according
to Nokia it's a fully laminate zero air
gap display the panel should provide for
some decent scratch protection due to
the fact that is also using Gorilla
Glass 3 the screen looks great the IPS
panel provides a consistent picture no
matter which angle you use at first
glance colors can appear a bit dull to
some after doing a few color tests
online I found that the colors are
extremely accurate nokia chose to go
with a natural color profile which is
easier on the eyes the text is decently
sharp on the panel but not the sharpest
I've seen for most cases 324 PPI is fine
just zooming in on text is not as crisp
as other devices one thing that I found
is that if you put any pressure on the
display you'll notice some color
bleeding I don't think this will provide
any long-term issues but it's something
I needed to mention as I found this just
by gripping the in one don't let this
one negative point turn you off from
this display it's still fantastic to use
and even better to look at
the n1 brings a different chipset than
what we're accustomed to seeing with
Android the chip that provides the
horsepower is the Intel 64-bit Atom
processor z3580 2.3 gigahertz
I was not really familiar with this chip
starting off after digging into it it
seems like a very capable chip the SOC
integrates a power VR g60 430 GPU we
also have 32 gigabytes of on-board
storage and 2 gigabytes of ddr3 800
megahertz Ram it weighs just 318 grams
as well to keep everything juiced up
inside we have a 5300 milliamp battery
as mentioned earlier this is using the
new USBC connector and it's honestly a
joy to use
the USBC cord is reversible so makes it
much easier to plug in our very own gary
sims did a video explanation on USB see
so check out the links down below to get
more information about it
beefy specs are only half the story with
this device performance is the second
half the nokia any one tablet is a true
speedster everything from navigating the
UI gaming and even boot up is extremely
fast on this device the tablet provides
a smooth and consistent experience
throughout all the menus and
applications a great example is when
playing plants vs. zombies on some
devices there's a lot of action on the
screen it does slow down a little bit
well this tablet had no slowdown issues
at all it just ran at the same frame
rate as it ran if there was just one
plant on the screen another example is a
game like fruit ninja where there's a
lot of action on the screen pretty much
the whole time
the only time there was slowdown is when
you hit one of the bombs that ends the
game because your whole screen goes
white and everything explodes right
there it was a little bit of slow it out
but all in all it ran better on this
device that I've seen other devices play
this game out of android tablets this is
one of the best performing ones I've
personally used the true test is when
Google services are running in the
background which we do not have access
to just yet battery life for standby was
impressive I was able to get four days
of off-and-on usage but keep this in
mind that Google Play services will
slice into this
just a little bit speakers on board get
plenty loud but quickly loses its
effectiveness around 75% it becomes
distorted sharp and airy also each
speaker is a mono speaker so if you
cover up one of the speakers you can
still hear both channels out of the
other speaker
it ruins some of the immersiveness that
stereo speakers can provide onboard the
n1 tablet is Android 5.0.1 lollipop and
it has a custom launcher on top called
the launcher C launcher is a simple
launcher that only consists of two
screens the first screen your last 12
applications you've opened and the
second screen is a list of all
applications installed but what makes
this launcher really unique is that you
can write out what you want to open on
your screen and is not specific neither
so you can type in take a picture and
the camera comes up even if you can't
find what you're looking for it does a
Google search for it now it's not
perfect there are a few times where it
does not register your finger inputs and
what I found that works best is just
keep riding until it eventually shows up
now there is something to know about
this launcher that is still in beta so
it's quite possible when the
international version is released the
launcher will provide even more
functionality but I like it the way it
is it works great for a tablet now
beyond this launcher which is very
simple it's still running a pretty much
stock version of Android are there a few
settings built into the n1 tablets that
vanilla Android does not have additional
settings that you'll find a sensor
calibration which lets you use the
compass to calibrate your tablet Intel
smart video which provides smoother
video when you're playing it on your
tablet and also z launcher settings
which lets you tweak to z launcher a bit
more none of these are anything that
would change the game of Android but
it's just a nice addition to have
the 8 megapixel camera on the rear
provides you with average images from
what you will see with the tablet
details are not that strong at all and
also low-light isn't the best the images
also have a layer of sharpness applied
impost that just looks bad the
front-facing camera provides you with
the same story a lot of images come out
yellowish and has a lot of grain even in
well-lit areas now as far as camera
software it is using stock software sort
of a lot of extra features are stripped
out it just leaves you with timer
gridlines and switching between cameras
I got to be honest here it's a big
disappointment that this camera isn't
that great everything else the tablet is
great in high quality and premium but
the camera is just lacking I don't walk
around taking pictures with my tablet it
should have a consistent flow with
everything being high quality and I
think Nokia truly dropped the ball with
this one the Nokia n1 is a fine fine
piece of hardware but it's really tough
to judge without having Google Play
services every single application that I
threw at it it ran fine now as far as
hardware there are a couple of things
out there but every single tablet in the
market has a few things here and there
if you can look past this flaws the
Nokia n1 is one of the best Android
tablets out there as far as build
quality it's fantastic to hold and it
seems like it could stand the test of
time also the processor that it used is
no slouch it ran all the applications
without an issue z launcher does the job
as well and I like it for a tablet
launcher but it is replaceable so if you
don't like the Z launcher you can throw
on any third-party launcher that you
want on there as well if you're in the
market for an Android tablet and the
international version becomes available
I will have no problems offer my
recommendation of this tablet
