by bitdefender mobile security Lenovo's
big phone looks to pack quite a wallop
in terms of longevity it's Josh of agar
from Android thority what's going on
everybody and this is the Lenovo 860 in
this first looking hands-on
Lenovo's biggest offering here at MWC is
the s 860 a large smartphone packin a
huge 4000 milliamp hour battery
underneath a nice brushed metal body the
body of the phone does feel quite nice
as Lenovo was able to keep things from
getting way too thick at just around ten
point three millimeters and still pretty
light at around 0.4 pounds it's not hard
to get a good grip around this phone as
the flat sides make it pretty easy to
get a grip around the 5.3 inch screen
speaking of which this 5.3 inch IPS
display packs 720p resolution and
provides some pretty vibrant colors the
Nova's colorful UI does come through
quite nicely and the high brightness
usually associated with IPS displays was
definitely on display it's not a
difficult display to manipulate by any
means making this on par with many of
the 5-inch offerings out there powered
by a quad-core MediaTek CPU clocked in
at one point three gigahertz performance
is pretty reliable if somewhat
noticeably slower than some of the more
high-end processing packages out there
two gigabytes of RAM does help with
multitasking and sixteen gigabytes of
storage or is available dual
front-facing speakers are also here but
our surroundings didn't make it very
easy to really judge their quality the
big story here however is definitely the
four thousand milliamp hour battery unit
much larger than a number of phablet
batteries out there the s 860 can go for
up to 43 hours of talktime and 40 days
of standby whether or not those claims
are actually true doesn't quite matter
as it is still clear that this phone
will please those who need power
throughout the day and then some the UI
used on the s 860 might not be the most
polished Android iteration out there but
it does get the job done even if the
lack of an app drawer might be a little
off-putting for some now-enhanced do it
apps for photo imaging and for sharing
files do bring more functionality to the
experience one in particular that we
liked was the shara tap which allowed
for group sharing and also the
manipulation of content across a
wireless connection
the s 860 will be available for the
starting price of 349 dollars making it
a viable alternative to a number of more
expensive smartphones out there
once again this is Joshua Vergara
bringing you the latest from the Mobile
World Congress here in Barcelona Spain
