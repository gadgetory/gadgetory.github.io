our Android world but especially because
there are so many of them they try to be
Jack's of all trades and do basically
everything our smartphones can do except
with larger screens but what happens
when you narrow the focus you make a
tablet really made for one particular
purpose and thus you construct the
entire thing based upon that focus well
recently I've been using a tablet that
does just that and I have to tell you I
really enjoy it
hey it's Josh or Garth majora thority
what's going out of your body and this
is my review of the Nvidia shield tablet
so when we talk about design we do have
to talk about the backing first up to
roll we have that shield logo proudly
displayed on the back and it is
surrounded by a soft touch plastic but
once you get the tablet in your hand
you're going to find that this is a very
substantial device not only in terms of
looks but in terms of its feel what we
have here is a thick device that is made
of like I said soft touch plastic it has
a very industrial design about it you
have the button layout over on the top
if you're using it in landscape mode or
on the right side if you're using in
portrait they have power and volume
buttons and right below all of that is a
micro SD card slot look at the top of
the device if you're using in portrait
mode and you'll find the mini HDMI ports
the audio jack and of course a micro USB
charging port and right in front of you
when you actually use the tablet or some
front-facing speakers but those aren't
the only ones that are available because
there's a great speaker setup on here
that includes two on the sides so that
you really have an immersive audio
experience but we'll get into that a
little bit later have the tablet in your
hands and you'll see that even though
there is a pretty sizable bezel around
this 8 inch screen it is actually there
so that the handling and when in
landscape mode is a lot easier you will
be covering up those speakers a little
bit when you're using this tablet in
landscape mode but really doesn't
detract from the audio quality one bit
and it is still quite gripa belen one
hand if you use it in portrait mode I
really do enjoy the look and feel of
this device but I will tell you this
despite there being already some tablets
out there that are much slimmer in their
profile after all this is a pretty beefy
tablet to hold the shield tablet really
from the design all the way down to the
specs and everything underneath really
screams to you that it's supposed to be
a gaming tablet and right
to the design you really get the sense
of that the moment you take it out of
the box a 1080p 8 inch display is what
you get on the Nvidia shield tablet but
unfortunately it might be the only real
hole in an otherwise great overall
package the reason why is because
despite bringing the kind of
specifications that you would expect out
of a tablet like this with the high
resolution and the high pixel density it
actually has a little bit of lacking
color reproduction it should use a
little bit more vividness and also some
more contrast in the colors but overall
it does provide a pretty decent
experience what I will tell you though
is that if you don't really like the
tablet display experience on here you
can always connect the tablet to an HDTV
using the HDMI port on the side and that
should alleviate a lot of the problems
that you're probably going to have when
it comes to really looking at this
display and then we get to the
performance in which the Nvidia shield
tablet really is the coming-out party
for the Tegra k1 and here is a quad-core
cortex processor that comes with a
kepler GPU all of which comes together
with two gigabytes of RAM in order to
bring you one of the best gaming
experiences available that as Nvidia
says should be like a console experience
and I showed you a lot of different
examples of how awesome the gaming is on
this tablet whether you're looking at it
on here or on TV as you can see I'm
already playing real boxing on a tee
HDTV right here and really there's no
slowdown at all now mind you I am
playing a lot of these games at the high
performance setting inside of the power
saving features but you should probably
be doing that already anyways in order
to get the most out of all of the gaming
and performance in this tablet now one
thing I will tell you is that game
streaming using an Nvidia graphics card
on your computer is definitely possible
on here and it is one of the marquee
features of the shield but on my
particular laptop that I use for all of
my work unfortunately I have a 760 M
which just doesn't cut it when it comes
to true game streaming and it really
doesn't provide a very good experience
but that is where the Nvidia grid cloud
gaming comes in it is a surface that
Nvidia is creating in order for you to
have some cloud gaming and currently it
is free but that's because it's in beta
and you will be able to connect to San
Jose servers where NVIDIA has a bunch of
games available for you including Street
Fighter 4 like you're seeing right here
in order for you to enjoy some streaming
without having to use your laptop or a
computer we couldn't help but really put
this thing through its paces with a
bunch of different benchmarking
applications and we start off with m22
and if you
really want to know what the power of
this tablet is well take a look at the
result there this tablet is at the top
of the heap consistently and even when
it heats up we do still have the same
kinds of scores throughout and then head
on over to 3d mark where we pretty much
see in the ice storm extreme benchmark
that this thing gets maxed out we'll
start off in hardware with one of the
better more prevalent features in the
hardware aspect which is the speaker
layouts you have two in the front and
two on the sides that provide altogether
a great sound experience there's
actually quite a bit of nuance and
richness inside of the sound quality of
the Nvidia shield tablet and it really
provides a pretty immersive experience
if that is the way that you're going to
be listening to the music or the sounds
inside of any gaming experience that you
have the follow-on ruins they came to a
great big steaming swamp speaking of
gaming yes the touch screen is pretty
good when it comes to its responsiveness
is really no complaints there but when
it comes to touchscreens you probably
don't want to just use touchscreen
controls for all of the major games that
you're going to be playing that's where
a controller comes in well luckily
Nvidia made a shield wireless controller
this is a beefy controller that comes
with a lot of features and I made a
video just about it and you can see all
of the features that it has and how
awesome it is when it comes to gaming it
connects via Wi-Fi direct and it brings
a one-to-one experience when it comes to
your controls and what you see on the
screen it's a wonderful controller that
actually is worth at $60 price tag if
you're only thinking about the build
quality which is stellar on the Nvidia
shield wireless controller now the
Nvidia tablet does come with a stylus
this is the direct stylus to and you're
going to see that it has a bit of a
unique tip it's not just a typical tip
that you would see on a bunch of other
stylus is it has a bit of a brush to it
you can point anywhere type anywhere
using the stylus or even write using any
of the included applications like let's
say Evernote but also Nvidia put in
their own sketching application that
allows you to release have some creative
fun battery life unfortunately it
doesn't really provide the kind of
stellar performance I was hoping for I
did do a test first with Netflix and I
got about 6 hours out of it and that is
pretty standard for a high performing
tablet like this but then I only got
half the time when playing games at the
high performance rating now it's not
that much of a surprise but it would be
great to see great battery life on a
tablet like this so you can game as much
as you want but when you think about it
this is a gaming tablet made by Nvidia
which is a gaming company and when you
think about gaming apparatuses like
let's say gaming laptops you know that
battery life is not necessarily
something you're going to be getting
when you buy a laptop like that and
that's something that we kind of know
already as geeks and nerds and the same
goes for the Nvidia shield tablet so I
can't fault it too much but it is
something that you should know that the
battery life is not quite as great as
you might be hoping it to be for a
tablet now we don't have to give a whole
lot consideration on cameras when it
comes to tablets the reason why is
because they just pale in comparison to
smartphone counterparts and they don't
come with too many features and after
all you're going to be holding up that
huge tablet in order to take a picture
but on the Nvidia shield tablet you get
a five megapixel rear and five megapixel
front facing camera that does provide
some functionality if you still want to
get some photos using this tablet you
will be able to use things like software
stabilization burst burst modes 1080p
video capture and there's actually a
mode called awesome eyes that allows you
to tweak the settings of the photo in
order to make it look even better that
can be everything from just the exposure
to cropping to even filters so there are
some things you are able to do with your
photos if you do happen to take photos
with the Nvidia shield tablets and of
course the five megapixel front facing
camera has a pretty lifes resolution if
you just want to take photos of you
taunting the people that you've just
pwned on the other line in your game now
gaming might be the focus of the Nvidia
shield tablet and I would say that
having that perspective really makes
this tablet great but it is still great
at being just a tablet to after all
having a tablet you need to have the
right kind of software in order for you
to perform all the general tasks that
you really need to do even if it's not
gaming or media consumption and that's
exactly what you get in the Nvidia
shield tablet Android 4.4.2 kitkat is
what you get on here with all of the
general bells and whistles that you
would expect from a stock ish like
Android experience and that includes the
app drawers the notification drop-down
with a couple of extra features built in
but other than that it is pretty much
the kind of Android experience you would
expect from one that looks like it's
stock from there any of the additions
that are put into the Nvidia shield
tablet pretty much include Nvidia zone
applications that includes the already
after mentioned a direct stylus to
application for doodling and then of
course you have the Nvidia hub the
Nvidia hub is a nice way of taking a
look at all of the games that are
available
and are optimized for the Tegra
experience but from there you will be
able to download or buy those games and
be able to select from them easily as
well as the games from your PC or from
the Nvidia grid which are all available
inside of the Nvidia hub whether you're
looking at it on your tablet or on your
television and it kind of rounds out the
experience of the Nvidia shield tablet
because while NVIDIA has the gaming
experience down pat you also get the
kind of experience that you the Android
user still wants and that is a stock
like experience that is a canvas for
your customization and everything you
want to do to it so for $2.99 you get
the 16 gigabyte version that we used in
this review but for 399 you get 32
gigabytes and it has LTE but on top of
all of that you still are able to expand
the storage obviously with that microSD
card slot that is on the side the
competitors for the Nvidia shield tablet
include well the Nexus 7 which is the
main Google competitor at the moment
that provides the same type of software
experience even if it can't provide the
same kind of gaming experience but then
again which tablet can well there is one
other tablet that might be able to and
that is the Samsung Galaxy Tab s with
its super high resolution screen and a
very good processing package underneath
but I will tell you this if you just
want the general tablet experience the
Samsung Galaxy Tab s 8.4 definitely
gives the Nvidia shield a run for its
money especially because it has a
thinner slimmer and somewhat more
attractive profile to some of you out
there but the industrial look of the
Nvidia shield tablet really points to
the fact that its focus is very
particular and therein lies the reason
why I absolutely adore the Nvidia shield
tablet I really do think that tablets
recently have been bombarding us with
all of the different features that they
have after all they have to be Jack's of
all trades but the thing is once you
change the perspective you narrow the
focus and you get very precise with what
a tablet is supposed to do it shifts
your perspective it makes you realise
that when a tablet sets out to do
something like this gaming and performs
it so well it makes you fall in love
with what it's capable of doing and and
so consequence it makes you fall in love
with it what we find is that the
performance what it is sets out to do is
so good that it makes you forget the
little flaws that are available and it
makes you look at the whole package and
realize that it is really great and that
is the reason why the Nvidia shield
tablet does get our editors choice award
for being one of the best tablet
experiences ever
and providing an experience that is
accessible to anybody who really just
wants to have some fun on their tablets
whether it's on the screen here or on
the big screen that you connect it to so
check out the Nvidia shield tablet like
I said it's $2.99 for 16 gigabytes and
you also have the Nvidia shield
controller that you can use the wireless
controller for $60 that I actually do
think is worth the price tag and you can
see videos about those right over on the
