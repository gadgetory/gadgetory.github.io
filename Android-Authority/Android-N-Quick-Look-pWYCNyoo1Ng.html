they released the Android and preview
ahead of Google i/o now we can catch a
glimpse of what the next version of
android is going to be like and how it's
likely going to act I'm Joe Hindy from
android authority calm and this is a
quick look of Android n let's first
tackle the general look and feel of
Android n on the surface it looks and
acts very much the same as lollipop and
marshmallow with your usual home screens
Google now settings notification quick
settings and for now the app drawer
remains as it was in marshmallow getting
around the OS is pretty much the same as
it ever was and there are no big changes
there one of the first noticeable
changes is the quick settings you can
now drop down your notification shade to
see a set of toggles nestled at the top
these allow you to interact with the
usual variety of settings including
flashlight Bluetooth Wi-Fi airplane mode
do not disturb mode and all of the
others you can of course swipe down a
second time and see the quick settings
in their full majesty unlike prior
versions of Android the quick settings
are paginate announced a more than one
set also unlike prior versions of
Android the quick settings can now be
edited without using the system UI tuner
it's worth noting that the edits you
make will also change the available
toggles when you first drop down your
notifications you can short press some
of the settings such as Wi-Fi and open
up a window for more options please note
this does not work with all of them but
mostly with things like Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth at any point whether viewing
the toggles only quick settings you'll
be able to long press each thing and be
directed to that functions page in the
settings menu finally it's worth noting
that Google will include an API where
developers can create their own quick
tiles they're being encouraged not to
use them just to launch the application
but performing quick tasks associated
with the app for instance we imagine
that Google keep will have a toggle to
create a quick note personally I'd love
to see a toggle for music controls but
that's just me well we're hanging out in
the notification shade area let's talk
about the new notifications they
received a visual tweak where the
notifications are now more flush with
the size of the screen and with each
other which gives a cleaner more
organized look although it can be a bit
tough to tell the note of the case
apart especially if you're just glancing
at them quickly you'll also get to see
bundled notifications in marshmallow
receiving multiple notifications from
the same app forced you to open up the
application in Android and you'll be
able to unbundle the notifications and
deal with them individually this is
definitely an improvement and great for
those who want to respond to a message
but ignore all of the other ones for
right now on top of that is the new
quick reply feature which is only
available in Google Hangouts for right
now it will open up a quick reply window
right there in the notifications so you
don't actually have to open the
application this is going to be a
godsend for messaging and SMS apps where
it can get really tedious opening the
application over and over again on top
of that some notifications will also
have little arrows that you can tap to
expand the notification which is pretty
nice this can be tripped by tapping on
the top half of the notification so you
don't need to snipe the button with your
fingers or risk missing the press you
can also have swype for notifications a
way to reveal a Settings button that can
change the apps notification settings or
block the application from sending
notifications all together the recent
apps screen received a few visual tweaks
as well the application cards will now
be larger and easier to read which makes
better use of the screen real estate
there are some function tweaks for the
recent apps screen as well if you
continuously tap the recent apps button
you'll cycle through each application
quickly until you find the one that you
want additionally a little timer will go
off in the form of a loading bar and
when it reaches its end it'll
automatically open the application for
you this is quick and simple but
occasionally too quick if you take more
than a second to decide or remember
which application you were looking for
you can also quickly switch between two
applications by double tapping the
recent apps button this has been
frequently compared to the alt tab
functionality in Windows albeit not as
powerful during our testing we were only
able to cycle through two applications
but in most cases that's all you need
it's a pretty nifty little feature while
we're in the recent apps let's talk
about split screen there are currently
two ways to launch split screen mode the
first is to launch an application and
then long press the recent apps button
this will drop the application into the
top pane of the split screen and allow
you to choose the second application
that will go with it the second way is
to enter the recent apps screen and then
long press the colored banner at the top
of any applications little Cardin you
can then drag and drop the application
into split screen mode this feature
loses a little bit of its charm on such
a tiny little phone as the Nexus 5x here
but on devices like the pixels see or
the Nexus 9 the large screens can
definitely handle two applications
comfortably and it will be a welcome
change for those wielding tablets
obviously applications will be updated
to make better use of this feature
although we found that even incompatible
applications generally worked ok most of
the time and then you can leave
split-screen anytime by long pressing
the recent apps button and the
application populating the top pane will
become full screen and split screen mode
will come to an end it's also worth
mentioning that Android TV devices are
also getting picture-in-picture supports
although there is code that suggests
that tablets could possibly get this
functionality as well there is also
evidence to support that Google may
eventually give us floating windows in
the future just like you see in well
Microsoft's Windows the system UI tuner
has been revamped as well for those who
don't know you get to the system UI
tuner by long pressing the Settings icon
in the quick settings and then the
system UI option will be available in
the settings menu inside the system UI
tuner you'll find a few really fun new
options dark mode has returned to
Android and like it was in the
marshmallow previews but this time
around it only works in the settings
menu my best guess is that individual
applications will have to code dark mood
support in before it'll work for any
applications you'll also be able to add
just a tint which overlays a bit of
color to help lower the harshness of the
screen on your eyes at night finally you
can have the OS lower the brightness and
turn on during certain times of the day
and only in certain lighting conditions
which is also kind of cool perhaps the
most awesome addition to the system UI
tuner is the ability to control the red
green blue values for your screen this
gives you the ability to change the tint
of your screen manually so you can
perfect your white balance or overcome
issues on your own it's a very welcome
addition
and while we're in the settings let's
take a look at what's changed their the
settings is more or less the same as
it's always been with a couple of new
things added in the first is a slide-out
menu from the left side of the screen
this lets you maneuver between parts of
the settings menu without having to go
back to the main list the slide-out menu
is also available while on the main page
which gives you two identical lists of
settings options which I thought was
kind of goofy and amusing because it is
in effect totally worthless on the main
page you'll also start receiving setting
suggestions at the very top four popular
settings that you may not have looked at
yet for me it was encouraging me to set
up the off-screen voice recognition for
Google now which I eventually did you'll
also see an alert at the top notifying
you if you're in do not disturb mode
just in case you may have forgotten a
little thing that was added to these
settings is the ability to add an
emergency information if need be this
can be found in the settings under the
user section you can have a name address
phone number add an emergency contact
info and that's a medical info like your
blood type any medications you're on and
more it's a little bit of a hassle to
get it on the lock screen but this could
be a very useful feature especially for
those who are chronically ill we imagine
that this feature will be improved over
time google has also integrated
universally accepted call and SMS
blocking this is accomplished by going
into the dialer application and then
going into the settings and then you can
add numbers from there this is universal
and should work everywhere once it's in
place this is another feature with AP is
that will help improve the feature over
time as more developers and mobile
carriers use it there is also a call
screening feature built directly in
where you'll have more control over who
calls you whether those calls get
recorded on your device or even answered
at all another new feature for the
tinkers and our audience is the new
special access app settings originally
these were kind of like permissions but
didn't appear in the traditional
permissions list now when you go to the
configure apps by pressing on the
Settings icon in the app section of the
settings you'll have quicker easier
access to special access settings and
you can approve or deny applications
that way for further control some of the
things you can change include
notification permissions data
permissions and
battery optimization permissions there
were a few other under the hood things
that came with Android n and we'll go
over those briefly in the developer
options there is a new option for
Android webview settings for now the
only option is chrome stable but some
pundits have predicted that you'll be
able to change that to Chrome Beta or
chrome dev eventually under the display
settings you now have the option to
change your screen size no your Nexus 5x
will not magically get any larger but it
will change how things are displayed to
make them appear larger or smaller this
is OS wide as well so it'll work in the
settings on home screens and even other
apps doze mode has been slightly
recalibrated before the device had to
remain perfectly still with the screen
off before doze mode would work now
there is a kind of lighter doze mode
where the screen still has to be off but
the device can now be in motion and we
really like that a lot Android n
includes a new data saver feature where
it'll turn off background data usage
from applications in order to save data
you can also whitelist applications to
allow them to use data in the background
through this service if you want to
android end is also read doing how it
optimizes application for faster boot
times before we were graced with the
infamous optimizing apps screen after
things like system updates now you'll be
able to boot faster and the applications
will become optimized in the background
after the boots they should result in
slightly slower app loading times
slightly faster application installs and
much faster boot times ok so now we've
been through the new features and you
want to know if this is something that
you could run on your daily driver
everyday those who may be thinking of
running the Android and preview will
have a few issues that they're going to
deal with for starters there are
virtually no applications with direct
Android and support and while most
applications will work perfectly fine
there are still plenty that have issues
on top of that voicemail playback
doesn't work various settings and
toggles may not work properly gmail is a
little bit broken bluetooth is unstable
video playback is unstable NFC is a bit
goofy and your ringtone may or may not
go off what that means is that this is
definitely not daily driver material so
be sure to only install this on a test
device or a second
a device because well it's just not a
good idea to use this on your main phone
in case you need it to do something this
is after all a developer preview and not
meant for consumer level devices overall
Android and does feel like a bit of an
iteration over android marshmallow
rather than a full refresh and that's
perfectly okay there are a lot of
positive changes in android in a few new
features for good measure and a great
deal of polish from features carried
over from marshmallow there are a few
new things like split screen and some
visual tweaks to freshen things up a bit
but the main positive force here is the
under the hood stuff like the revamp
doze mode screen calibration settings
and the display size settings when you
add it up it gives you unprecedented
amount of control over your device and
we expect those other new features to
grow as well that said not everything is
all that great the notifications can
become cluttered and visually confusing
if you have a lot of them to deal with
it once since they all look so similar
with so little space between them also
some of the best features are locked
behind hidden menu items the ability to
calibrate your screen for instance is
hidden in the system UI tuner which
isn't necessarily easy to find for
average users I understand that's
probably by design but still mid kinda
sucks mostly though the only thing that
Android and really needs is some
developer loving and polish which we
assume is going to happen over the
course of the next several months and
we'll see the results of that over the
next few developer previews even still
Android and seems to be a positive step
forward at least for right now do keep
in mind that this is just the first
developer preview and will likely see
changes as things go along so don't be
surprised if some or all of this
information changes before the final
release come this fall and that about
does it for this video folks if you'd
like to give us a thumbs up and if not
tell us why in the comments we have
lawns review of the Samsung Galaxy s7
edge linked up on the screen and in the
video description below if you're
looking for something else to watch
