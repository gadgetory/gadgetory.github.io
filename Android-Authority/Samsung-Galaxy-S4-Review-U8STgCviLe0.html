smartphone releases of the year and it's
certainly one of the most anticipated
Samsung is storing everything its guide
to its newest flagship release so does
it live up to all of the hype a Java car
from Android Authority what's going on
everybody and yes this is the Samsung
Galaxy s4 the Samsung Galaxy s4 follows
up the tremendously popular key galaxy
s3 and helps to not only please those
loyal to the line but also to entice
anyone who has held out until now the
design of the s4 is largely derivative
of its older counterpart especially in
the white model you have the white bezel
shrunken down to accommodate the 5-inch
screen flatter sides and a different
layout for the rear camera and speaker
otherwise the button layout is just
about the same as it was on the s3 the
back cover is still removable you not
only get access to the SD card slot and
battery but you can even buy accessory
covers like the smart cover or the
wireless charging cover for added
functionality but the phone continues
Samsung's trend of plastic bodies and
covers it may be a material choice that
is starting to get old but nonetheless
anyone who has used a s3 in the past
will feel right at home here let me
reiterate that the Samsung Galaxy s4
feels pretty much like its predecessor
while the general aesthetic might be
getting a little played out remember
that there is so much improvement
everywhere else and yet it is actually
smaller than the s3 with the same height
that s4 sheds a fraction of the s3
thickness and is even a little bit
narrower most important here however is
that the s4 is even lighter though it
might only be 3 grams lighter there is a
balancing to the galaxy s4 that makes it
feel like a feather
you can definitely call that a victory
in the design department as this is the
best handling 5-inch screen device out
there shortly after receiving this unit
I was able to text chat browse and play
with one hand comfortably the flat side
to make the phone easy to grip with your
fingers and palm any ham gymnastics
typically needed for a 5 inch screen or
at their least required when using this
phone only rarely did I need to use my
other hand to reach the very top left
corner of the screen perhaps the most
obvious improvement at first glance is
the display Samsung brought their Super
AMOLED tech up to a 5 inch screen
capable of 1080p resolution
and 441 PPI the result is one of the
best displays on a smartphone period not
only is it easily viewable in almost any
condition it is also capable of some
very steep viewing angles the Oubre
colorful TouchWiz UI benefits from the
screens high saturation making colors
pop out and basically punch you in the
face reading anything on the screen is
easy - as text is incredibly sharp move
under that screen and you'll find that
the galaxy s4 is among the fastest
phones around it has the quad-core
Snapdragon 600 processor that is only
currently found on about a few other
devices and is a big leap from the s4
pro it is not the exceed O's octa-core
that we may have heard about but this
processor package definitely included in
North American models is still an
incredible performer I was zipping
through all elements of the UI and
multitasking with no problems a few
tests in antutu benchmark put the galaxy
s4 right around the very impressive
25,000 mark Epic Citadel puts the tried
and true
Adreno 320 performance at very high
ratings and the two gigabytes are
available for all of your multitasking
pleasure hardware is what the Samsung
Galaxy s4 has in spades the speaker is
no front-facing boom sound but it is
quite loud and is far from tinny the s4
is then not only sporting expandable
memory and a replaceable battery but a
host of new sensors and utilities for a
bunch of uses first one will list is a
IR blaster capable of controlling a host
of TV's cept op boxes and players GPS
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are your standards
while NFC with SB makes its return but
there are many sensors add-in that
complement the typical accelerometer and
proximity sensor you now have a
barometer and a temperature gauge to
check the general conditions around you
an RGB light sensor that helps adjust
the color and white balance of the
screen based on its detection of light
an infra red sensor for all hands and
air gestures and a hall sensor for
detecting closed smart comforts and
finally a compass what is perhaps best
about these additions is that software
inclusions make them all useful in one
way or another but we'll get to that
soon the battery unit included with the
s4 is of
higher capacity than most five-inch
screen device offerings 2600 milliamp
hours are able to power this phone for
quite a while making the end of the day
a little less precarious for the common
user with a bit of a robust test using
Wi-Fi and Netflix movies the phone
finally knocked out at right under the
four hour mark otherwise straight
browsing time and playing videos from
memory certainly came in at impressively
long times usually around eight or so
hours on Wi-Fi without disabling sync it
is definitely among the longest lasting
5-inch screen devices available and with
the ability to replace the battery when
it finally runs out of juice you really
shouldn't have any power issues on the
galaxy s4 improvements on the camera
start off pretty standard 13 megapixels
are what you get this time around while
the front-facing camera gets two
editions are all in the application
itself in which there are now a bunch of
new ways to use those optics ones you
may expect include best face which takes
a burst shot and allows you to replace
detected faces to find the right one you
need for the shot an animated photo
which just basically takes that burst
shot and creates animated gifs from them
HDR and panorama you are also able to
use both the front and rear facing
cameras in order to create a dual shot
picture or video now the big additions
take further advantage of those burst
shots via eraser mode and drama shot
eraser detects the objects that move
aside from your subject and background
and erases anything not meant to be in
the picture drama shot instead adds the
moving subject on top of the stable
background creating a nice-looking one
picture burst subject both are nice to
use as long as your device and the
general background are stable picture
quality on the s4 is really quite good
just as the s3 was considered a great
performer in the 8 megapixel space the
s4 is among the best in the 13 megapixel
space you get a great deal of detail and
the color shot saturation is high enough
to make any picture nice and vibrant
with great quality in a host of ways to
take a picture the Galaxy s4 is
definitely at the top of the list of
smartphone cameras and finally we get to
the software TouchWiz is an Android UI
that you either love or hate personally
I've never been a big fan of its more
bloated and yet
a colorful look though the great quality
of the screen certainly helps make those
colors really go nuts but this time
around with the jelly bean 4.2.2 powered
version of Samsung's UI I actually
didn't immediately replace it with a
different launcher while that might
happen eventually I have found why it is
more tolerable this time around it's the
size of the screen high-resolution
displays often run the risk of making
things uncomfortably small or weirdly
spaced out
but the already enlarged and bloated
TouchWiz elements translate perfectly to
the 1080p display what you get is an
easily accessible interface that even
with the smallest font size is simple to
navigate without having to squint or
pinpoint there are a number of new ways
to get around in built-in applications
it might be a little daunting to look
through all of these but a large power
widget in the notification drop-down
gives you a quick glimpse there are
motion features that return like direct
calling which caused the contact
currently displayed automatically when
the phone is brought to your face or
muting when turning your phone over onto
its face a sensitive screen allows you
to get around even when wearing gloves
as well as use your finger like an S Pen
to get quick previews of gallery albums
I think the most practical application
of this air view is previewing your last
received text and then there are all of
the different air gestures that take
advantage of the motion sensor you can
jump through a web page go to the next
picture change the music track
my favorite one is a quick info screen
that pops up after you wave your hand
it's a brilliant way to quickly get the
time date and notifications of missed
calls and texts quick tip though
use some finesse the sensor has to pick
up the movement for the gesture to
register so you don't have to do so fast
smart screen capability is utilized the
front-facing camera to detect if you're
still looking the screen will stay on as
long as the phone is at an angle and
eyes are still on the screen and smart
pause will pause the video playing when
you look away I personally like the
smart squirrel let the phone detect your
eyes after which you can slightly tilt
your head to look at the bottom or top
of the screen which will scroll a
webpage accordingly you just have to
take that extra second or two to allow
the phone to detect your eyes new apps
included are the s translator which
allows for voice and text translations
among about a dozen different languages
story album which put your pictures
together in a nice flip book format and
group play which allows you to connect
to a bunch of other s4 devices to share
pictures documents presentations and
music well I don't have other units to
demonstrate this right now I can say it
is a really cool feature especially when
you have five total devices put together
and make every single one play one of
the five channels of music and finally
there's s health perhaps the biggest
endeavor if you have ever used multiple
diet or exercise tracking applications
Samsung has tried to consolidate them
all into s health
you can track food from a database or
from information you add in yourself
track physical activity log weight and
even use the thermometer and barometer
to check humidity and temperature of
your surroundings the gyroscopes in the
s4 can also be set on for tracking your
steps if your phone is in your pocket
why not put it to some work still all of
these features will be further augmented
with a number of accessories you can buy
like a heartrate monitor a wrist
predominator and a weight scale it's
actually a nice suite of diet
applications that can help anyone who
gets into the habit of tracking to get
into shape to end we have the price the
Samsung Galaxy s4 should be coming out
on pretty much all major carriers most
of whom have already posted pre-orders
in America it will be around 200 with a
two-year contract while the uncarrier
t-mobile plan will ask
150 up front with $20 device payments
each month for two years with the galaxy
s4 slated to come out on just about any
carrier you will be able to get your
hands on one no problem unlocked prices
will likely get around the $700 us mark
and so there you have it I will say this
Samsung put a lot of work into making
sure there are s4 offers the most to its
users all of the sensors give many ways
of performing tasks we've gotten used to
doing with just our fingertips other
features like group play and the camera
editions are neat tricks that are fun to
use once you find a time to use them and
s-health will help anyone proactive
enough to use it and that's about the
gist of the live companion samsung
galaxy s4 it may not be particularly
revolutionary but it does get close to
perfecting what is already in place
while giving you a new alternative ways
of how to do them you're given choices
on how to tackle pretty much any typical
task and if you don't want to use those
particular features well you really
don't have to but just like Samsung the
company itself it's all there for you
and one day you just might end up trying
it out serendipitously or even out of
sheer boredom and then before you know
it you fallen in love for all the
