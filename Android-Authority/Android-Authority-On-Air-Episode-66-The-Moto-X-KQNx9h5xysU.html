original android hangout show on google+
I'm dare cross I'm Scott Anderson not
getting Charlton and I'm Johnathan
Franklin this week on android authority
on air we're going to talk about the
motorola x phone also known as the Moto
X or talk about the new announced HTC
one google edition that was just
announced today very exciting or talk
about some other devices that were
rumored and also announced this past
week some app updates so I'm actually a
very interesting app updates and some
root and rom and information CM 10.1 all
the things then we're gonna have a big
lengthy discussion about you know the
State of the Union the state of the
Nexus program we all with all these
stock vanilla Android devices coming out
it's very interesting times out we're in
it's something you know a lot of android
fans have wanted for a long time so I'm
excited to talk about it so let's uh
let's get started in and talk about my
my favorite thing I think that we're
going to talk about tonight the Moto X
phone the Moto X we have heard this for
forever it's been leaked all over the
place we've seen screenshots we've seen
leaked images you know from from out of
I wasn't out of Vietnam you know we've
seen a phone that looked like a nexus 4
met a razr maxx you know it was kind
like a squarer looking nexus for all you
know ever since then we've heard nexus
we've heard motorola x film is my role
expert on that we saw job postings on
linkedin that were removed after
everybody found out about them for an ex
foam project manager you know we've
heard people from google specifically
you know Larry Page and Eric Schmidt say
we're really excited about what Motorola
is coming down within their pipeline we
heard that you know phone should last
all day long
long you shouldn't be tethered to a
charger and Larry Page has kept you know
he keeps saying phones shouldn't go
splat when you drop them so all these
things keep pointing towards a an
awesome phone and a phone for motorola
to bring them out of the ashes because
motorola hadn't been doing so well in
the past so many years compared to you
know other people other companies in
this space so we're you know we're
really excited for what Motorola can do
because they invented the damn smart
phone you know what I mean like motor
would you guys going to disagree sure of
the sparkle okay okay I'm sorry they
invade the cell phone but could you you
guys want to can you a disagree or agree
with me that motorola radios are amazing
like they make some of the best radios
do don't accept any kind of design out
of anybody you know they really put a
big focus on antenna placement and you
know their software stack I mean drivers
and everything man Motorola phones have
just have a lot of things are yours sir
paul deferral you know as far as i can
remember so I'm really excited for this
so anyways yes the motorola x phone aka
the Moto X is they're calling it is real
we found out at all things digital akad
11 this clean water call it be 11 be
honest with you but anyway I better let
along it that's how long it is also it's
the 11th digital all things digital
conference okay so that was you know you
learn something new every show okay so
after all things D akad 11 this year we
found out that the Motorola X phone the
Moto X is real and what's interesting is
they're advertising it as the first
smartphone that will be fully assembled
fully built in America and though
they're making a very big deal about
that saying that you know no other
smartphone has been ever been built in
America before they're assembled
overseas and now don't get me wrong that
you know all the parts are coming from
the US
you know their you know their display
screen and the processor most likely are
going to be built over C or manufactured
overseas I'm gonna be shipped over here
in the US then though you know take
everything and do what they do best mix
and match it all up and come out uh
smartphone somehow so that's that's in
it that's an interesting take you know
motorola says that they're going to be
able to reach consumers you know faster
maintain high quality control and all
sorts of other stuff that the reasoning
for building here and in the US and
that's that's inside we really haven't
seen that before yeah i think the thing
that I find most interesting about that
is there talking about a phone that
speak about later this year that they're
going to build entirely in America
meanwhile and like on the same website
where they're bragging about that they
direct people to where they can get
hired for jobs at the factory they are
starting to build right now in Texas
yeah yeah yeah I don't really understand
how they're gonna be selling a phone to
the public in a couple of months
produced at a factory that they're still
hiring staff or and building they're
gonna rent out a whole bunch of houses
and have workers no doubt and get
somewhere else and those job postings
are not to build this particular device
but the next device well it wasn't there
was a nokia facility before then so i
guess maybe they bought the tooling
while they were at it but i mean they're
still not to be too late to get an item
if I agree but it probably won't take as
long is that building grew scratch yeah
so it's down in Fort Worth Texas if
anybody was curious where it's at it's
in Dallas I think it's tell us for work
then the Dallas for Dallas Fort Worth is
basically the same area it's like two
miles apart and it's one big massive
metropolis dallas-fort Worth area so
they so you know we still really don't
know a lot about the Moto X in terms of
hardware we've heard a lot of different
speculations a lot of different rumors
you know so we're not gonna really talk
about that because you know what we
don't need to rumormonger about this
phone anymore we've we've done it enough
but let's talk about what we do know at
all things D motorola said that
the Moto X was going to be you know very
contextually aware you know it's gonna
know when it's in your pocket and pulled
out of your pocket whether you're biking
you're driving you're walking and now
you're saying well that sounds familiar
a lot of phones can do that now based on
you know Google API it's and which is
correct because they also said that the
phone is going to have her heavily
leveraged you know then the new google
api is that were announced at i/o so you
know what it kind of reminds me of
initially you know hearing that is the
s4 s3 all of Samsung's bloatware
regarding their you know it'll pause the
video we were looking away and stuff
like that that's right and it it
initially reminds me of but hopefully
they do it well and actually give some
use to it and not like blow like
something that you would always want to
have on yeah s health really taps and
all those sensors which that's probably
one of the least offensive one of their
Footwear apps but it's still an app that
you probably use the third party for
anything yeah we're pulling the phone up
to your your head and having an answer
the phone call I mean that's like a
usable feature but you know it needs to
be foolproof and it means to work all
the time you know face unlock was kind
of a has turned into kind of like a oh
yeah you know not really use it that
much I mean there are some people that
use it but it doesn't work on
representing the time but that's what
google really needs they need something
that uses the sensors that works all
very well and isn't considered bloat and
something that people use as you know an
afterthought yeah I mean the thing is
google is is making all of this data
accessible to anybody and Motorola is
trying to actually take that data and
make it useful and apply it so I
definitely hope that they can do that
well and even if they only do it okay
did such a good direction for them to be
going in because they're doing it in a
different way than Samsung's I mean
you're right about sales on the tip
and we're back on air and we are back I
believe we may or may not have dropped
off there there yes if you guys can see
us please comment thank you yeah that
was interesting my whatever you know
taking the technical difficulties the
the live streaming bug that you know
happens from time to time I don't know I
lost the connection he used to have a
lot but now it's better I haven't had it
happen in months look you know what that
says yeah but it actually wasn't it
wasn't a google hangout disconnection
like my actually my actual machine lost
network connection like my my uh no
comcast decided you know what we're
we're gonna cut your internet for a
second which is odd because I have an
impeccable internet connection normally
so I know well whatever we're back hey
hopefully so those of you that are
listening to this later yeah we're
saying and watching it later sorry about
all the screw-ups I'm sure that was not
something you planned on okay hey so
what we talking about and remember my
rolex gun motorized phone and sensors
and them using them down using the
sensors and I think that by going in
this direction and not going in the
ridiculous assault of color and bloat
that is TouchWiz or just the dated and
excessiveness own sense if they're going
to go with a stripped-down you I that's
maybe just lightly modified like go to
blur had become before google bought
anyway uh and then there you know there
s stuff for their bloat is actually
useful contextual awareness you know
applications I think that's excellent
but I think even just pushing the
contextual awareness and taking
advantage of these new AP is is going to
push other developers and other
applications and other thinkers to push
even further for those of you who are
listening or watching what do you think
a good idea or implementation that moto
or any type of phone manufacturer could
do that would not be considered below
that you would want to use on a daily
basis I'm kind of curious as to what
they can actually do because it's going
to be something that's going to have to
be useful but not bloated up on the
topic of that Motorola already has one
of the best contextual apps Smart
Actions which is actually a really good
app and adding in Google's current api's
to Smart Actions just by itself would
actually help it out a lot you know
especially if you could um kind of
create contextual location-based stuff
that doesn't use a lot power it would
really kind of help it out a lot it
would it would help them make smart
actions more in using existing its
average user you know what I mean cast
asker and stuff is powerful but people
just get confused with it and John think
about using the new fencing or mesh
location API you know with that I think
that's that that could be big so I'm
excited as to what they're going to roll
out so what the what carriers is this
coming on none have been announced yet
but if you watch this last week where
you follow Android news you'll know that
the Moto X has passed through the FCC
with sprint radios sprint compatibility
with ATT compatibility and with verizon
compatibility they announced that there
would be heavy US carrier support so
that makes me believe probably t-mobile
would be supported as well you'd be very
surprised at the AT&amp;amp;T version also run
onto yeah so yeah exactly so just
because it hasn't we haven't seen it yet
and this is all speculation based off of
us reading a document at the FCC doesn't
mean it's not coming or doesn't like dan
said doesn't mean it's not supported so
fingers crossed confidence extremely
high all major carriers will support it
in the u.s. question do you guys think
that this is going to be pushing the
envelope with regards to hardware specs
or is this going to be more so a
high-end hardware specs but more so
more features as a selling point I think
it depends on when it comes out let's
say it comes out towards the end of the
year then yes it'll be using a step this
summer so I know it's coming out this
summer okay so two most late summer I
think they'll be trying to push a
Snapdragon 800 into it and and yeah
pushing the pushing the hardware okay so
so I'm gonna say do you remember a few
months back you know rumors were that
this was going to be a truly affordable
phones gonna be low end specs and it was
going to be a phone that it was a
mid-range phone available to everybody
and and that that that you know a lot of
people like okay that's cool cheap phone
and it's not that you know the hardware
is not horrible but then you know we
heard yesterday that Motorola said that
the that the ex line is going to be the
future it's going to be their new focus
they're not good I don't think they're
going to start out a major overhaul to
the company and into their line with
something that's yeah you know that's
something that's not gonna have good
specs something that's not going to be
flagship I really hate saying that word
but flagship ask you know it I I think
that they're gonna do good with it I
think they're gonna been processed and
they should yeah because you know this
is they're coming back mmm you know I
mean uh how long has it been since they
bought more raw ability the deal closed
last summer okay so it's been it will be
roughly a year and then hopefully that's
enough I did the first device that
Motorola's put out that will have been
fully designed since they were on my
google i'd say like eighty percent yeah
i would say they're probably working
with a current product line but that's
not necessarily horrible because yeah in
like the razor wasn't a bad phone it was
really late to the party but it wasn't
worse than the biggest thing that
Motorola has to do from a hardware
perspective is improve on cameras and
displace those are the two biggest items
because the bill qualities always been
there I always I liked the feel of the
Kevlar I think they should just should
have done a better job and use like a
darker as
so it didn't look like Kevlar or the
droid x nothing was a beast oh the droid
x was built like a tank I think a lot of
people had that phone yeah but the other
three names do not not release a moto x
max three months later oh god I I don't
think that they'll do that hopefully
they learned over mu dou X qh I don't
worry Danny I don't want to see that I
really don't oh yeah so we have some
user comments here let's uh hit a few
those up here lets me move on another
topic so Michael Brown asks any thoughts
on a galaxy nexus 2 or a nexus 4 cdma
version for sprint or for verizon um i'm
going to say wow I would love that kind
of a verizon customer but yeah that's
not gonna happen you know I I think I
think Michael I think you and I will
have to hold out for the next best thing
to a true Nexus and get the X phone
that's that's why I pin you guys agree
with that yeah gonna be very surprised
if another nexus branded device ever
runs on verizon see Megan I don't like I
don't expect verizon to get paid Nexus
until an AWS could completely kill it
but until there's open access to the LTE
network and cdma is not a factor I don't
expect to see on Nexus I'll expect to
see more developer edition phones that
nobody buys until somebody just puts on
a phone that can't be cracked and the
other thing I would expect is typical
verizon any variant of a phone you get
is going to be demonstrably worse than
anything you'd get on any other carrier
it's gonna come bloated it's going to
come with stupid modifications that
shouldn't have been made and it's gonna
have a locked bootloader so developer
additions and just you just expect to
get well I mean verizon's in a little
bit of a slump right now because they
just tend to
devices until Christmastime and milk
everybody then but yeah I you your
Galaxy S line your flagship phones like
that are going to be what you're going
to see on verizon I doubt you're going
to see a OSP device on it for a while
you know in and speaking of verizon
let's uh hit up another question here x
shocks z100 on youtube says you know
what about the verizon HTC One and you
know that's that's unconfirmed that's
based off of rumors and leaks you know
evleaks is generally pretty good I know
pretty much what evleaks says generally
turns out to be true so if he puts out a
leaked image that shows the HTC One on
verizon and if you know FCC has a ad LX
plus phone that looks internally exactly
like the HTC One chances are it sounds
like it's gonna come out but you know
that the thing with the rumors is in
speculations you never know I that would
be great for HTC if it did happen I
think there's a great for them and great
for Verizon Verizon hasn't put out a
phone in seven months so something needs
to happen soon it's kind of it's kind of
crappy on verizon's in that the one
would be out that long and they would at
least not announce it where the s4 came
out because there are a lot of people
that would like to have you know i mean
there's a it's not easy but it's not
surprising no it's just crappy that they
wouldn't bryci j hey got something
coming we're working on something for
you guys verizon treats manufacturers
like crack them this is not they almost
single-handedly killed Paul by ordering
a million devices and then refusing to
pay for them hmm right like that's what
caused all to die but they got stuck
with all these only run on verizon
devices that verizon asked them to build
that they then couldn't sell and so
let's
around all over the place look at the
what did they end up calling at the
verizon merge which was basically the
ebo shift on verizon that had been
rumored and like gone through the SEC it
didn't come out until like a year and a
half later alright so let's talk about
the HTC One since we're talking about it
as well let's talk about the HTC one
google edition that our Google
Experience Google additional everyone
call that was announced today as well
it's pretty much exactly what it sounds
like it's the HTC one that runs stock
Android yeah it's going to be available
the same date as the samsung galaxy s4
Google edition which is jun 26 the sgs4
google edition is going to cost 650
bucks the HTC one is going to cost 600
gonna be fifty dollars cheaper which is
not I mean don't get me wrong when you
spend 600 bucks what's another 50 but
but 50 bucks is 50 bucks so that's nice
that's a little bit cheaper so yeah that
is the same as they cost of which sense
and touch miss respect please mom yeah
so if you were to buy a a and the
subsidized if you were to buy an
unsubsidized or the developer edition of
these phones or an unlocked version of
these phones they would cost the same
price same price yeah and you got to
remember that the galaxy s4 doesn't have
a developer edition available like the
s3 did so this is basically the
developer edition and as well with the
HTC one so it's going to be available
just like the s4 Google edition will be
available on AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile so a lot
of people are at a few questions about
you know software well well it will
beats work you know will the sense
camera work will the boom sound work
well you know it its stock Android it's
not it's not sense so we'll Beats Audio
work yes because but are you going to
have an icon pop up and say hey look
beats is playing no you're not going to
have a red icon pop up and let you know
that beats is being played you're gonna
have to go old school and
your ears to determine that higher
quality audio is playing and that's okay
you don't need to see a red icon all you
need to know is it I got some good
quality audio in sorry it will work but
there's no icon yeah yeah there's not
gonna be a toggle on and off you're not
gonna know it's a bunch of settings of
the hardware yes I I'm assuming there's
gonna be an app that comes out that says
you know like a widget somebody might
come up with some he a rooted phone you
know what if you know what if you missed
the icon if you don't know if you're
having a good quality audio plan or not
you know yours don't work too well route
it someone's gonna make an icon and I'm
just on that line that's gonna happen
alright awesome beats which people are
rolling into every room that they can
get awesome what's a DJ yeah so uh yeah
the rest of that stuff is all no
proprietary HTC software and so is the
IR blaster going to work no you're not
gonna have an IR blaster so you can't
have it be because there's no ir blaster
support in stock android and so you
can't have a control your you can't have
it be remote control stock android you
know what I'm sure somebody will port 1
over you know pick the IR blaster out of
the device go yeah its food can't I are
blast the problem is that it doesn't
have software to let it bleed end
somebody's going to come along and write
this offer so Dan is there going to be
so support you know senses know exactly
so is HTC software so if you're somebody
that that needs to do so you can't do it
but you know what you can do photosphere
and you can do all the other cool auto
awesome stuff with google Plaza instant
uploads and all that so you know and the
other pixel technology is independent of
the software so it's still gonna take 4
megapixel pictures yeah but there i mean
it's still going to be the you know
super enriched pics yeah exactly 30
special there any special pixels there
also so some people asking questions
about the buttons you know because the
the HTC One has some weird buttons on
you know it
the back button and the home button are
swapped and there's no you know middle
button it's just HTC logo so how the
house on the right yeah exactly so how's
that gonna work so the home button over
on the right if you hit home while it
goes home if you long press it you know
you hold it in for a second Google now
will pop up if you long press the back
button you'll get the recents menu so
it's it'll be programmed around inside
the Android code to get to work it's
just not going to be you know what
you're used to on a regular in nexus
asked device this really isn't
particularly complicated I think this is
a dominate that given plan out let me go
to buttons that accomplish for actions I
think that's a lot better than wasted
screen real estate for three buttons
that accomplish three actions I agree I
just want buttons to do think oh I don't
care where they are have a question here
in relation to what we're what we're
talking about here Justin says do we
think that the Google HTC One will be
successful and you know and I I'd say
you know successful is a relative term
um is it going to sell 5 million devices
I wouldn't say I would say no um it's
it's gonna be for you know the specific
niche market it's going to be for people
like you that are watching this right
now that actually know and understand
and care about this kind of thing will
it sell 1 million oh my god yeah I mean
I don't even think they're gonna make
that I think that it's really just for
people that are enthusiasts that want
this thing it because you know what
Android isn't a one-size-fits-all
platform it's about choice and that's
what this is this this gives us choice
knows what they're doing this on a note
that has been rumored for HTC today and
that's that they're going to make the
google edition rom essentially an option
for people that already have the HTC One
and chose to take the HTC down my mom so
if you already own an HTC One you can
google edition eyes yours pretty easily
I'm flashing your bra because it's
identical hardware so huh I think that
the measure of success of the google
edition is kind of irrelevant in fact
I'd be very surprised anyway actually
specifically tracks it because it's
essentially just another identical phone
with slightly different software you can
very easily pick between phones well
though okay what your hand but the thing
if you if you buy the if you get a
subsidized home and you've got an unlock
of you know the ability to unlock which
somebody like Verizon is not going to
give you that but you know the majority
of them do a TS can be unlocked and you
you haven't really have the choice
between sense or AOSP and can go right
between both of them I don't think the
end it's not just the one I don't think
the one or the s4 Google edition are
going to be particularly you know
successful in sales numbers yeah it will
give some sustainability to the devices
a year and a half from now because you
know good and well that Samsung and HTC
on their proprietary software are just
not going to update these devices but
you're going to have something that
works out of the box whenever relatively
close to when a new Android release
comes out you're going to have something
that's going to be functional it's not
going to be three months worth of
begging the developer community to get
bugs fixed or anything you're just going
to be ready to go like a like a nexus is
that part of it is really exciting for
anybody that has the device even
somebody that doesn't buy a google
edition version of it yeah I mean I
think really the these google edition
devices I think the physical devices
themselves are completely and utterly
irrelevant it's just another s4 another
HTC One this isn't anything new at all
the only important thing is the cub the
Tony cousin got heels revised is going
to be available and open source for
these devices they obviously aren't
going to open source their own
proprietary overlays but that doesn't
matter it means that when you get your
droid DNA you don't have to wait six
months for somebody to hack iOS be
honored it means in a
this is something that carrier that
device makers do going forward and do
sort of at lunch as opposed to funds
after launch I mean it's really going to
open up the development community
whether anybody buys a single specially
branded google edition version or not
because once you have a device of any
addition the codes going to run on it
and that's all the exits the code okay
so there let's talk about a smaller
announcement Derek smaller yeah okay so
good mini so if you like Scott you like
things they're a little bit smaller you
can't handle something is is big in your
hands so you might like the Samsung
Galaxy s4 mini uh it's a 4.3 inch mo
with qhd screen you know so it's not
it's not the most impressive screen but
I don't know think it's supposed to be I
think it's just supposed to look like a
smaller s4 on the outside and the inside
is nothing like it it's an S fail on
just regular it's an s4 on less roids
and have you get like the we have come
to the day and age where a 4.3 inch
screen is a mini screen did you guys
think we'd ever be here no back when the
droid x was out as of the evo original
eager people what everybody think that
was going to be the small oh man it
baffles me and said oh so besides a
smaller screen you know it's it's
smaller all around the eight gig storage
8 megapixel camera now that the front
facing cameras 1.9 the batteries in
nineteen hundred million power does come
with android 4.2 point2 like i said it's
an s4 mini and that the processor is we
don't really know but it's probably
going to be a snapdragon 400 it's going
to be 1.7 gigahertz dual-core processor
so Samsung didn't really come out and
say what it is but
azhar it'll be a Snapdragon 400 so it'll
be a little bit less powerful I guess
said it's it's not I don't like calling
it an s4 mini because it doesn't have
the same specs it's like a it's like me
no matter the HTC One S that's what they
call it okay you know you know in here
York 1002 at aim 4.3 inch AMOLED qhd
screen it's got a slightly faster newer
processor right but the same underlying
architecture and Qualcomm nake yeah yeah
all right so another another device you
know yeah anybody ever play with the HTC
flyer from long as that Alec three years
ago you know uh HTC Flyer was before its
time in my opinion it was it was a
honeycomb tablet there was a 7-inch
honeycomb tablet back before seven inch
tablets were cool you know nope nobody
nobody used a 7-inch tablet you know it
was like oh it's a 7-inch tablet way to
10 you know it was and they didn't sell
a whole lot of them they didn't their
breath what's that listen to kind of
stylus and gingerbread yeah yeah well
you get came with Gingerbread and it was
upgraded the honeycomb open already
column oh yes but it was a huge tablet
and the only other one the correct me if
I'm wrong was the original Galaxy Tab
from Samsung at that time that was John
gingerbread so wrong yeah well that had
countless Chinese she not knock off
seven inch brands okay right so in so
anyway so hi yes I had a chance to play
with one two and a half three years ago
whenever that was it and I liked the
flyer it was neat it was a nice it was a
nice device it was actually faster than
my acer iconia 10 inch tablet that I had
at the time I I liked it um so it's one
we're talking about you know why am I
going down memory lane well good ol
evleaks he lets us know basically what
we need to know well we need to know it
and
he told the world that HTC is coming out
with a t6 was that was the you know that
the model number so similar to you know
like the one became the m7 so that's in
the backwards the m7 became the one so
the HTC t6 is a rumored 5.9 inch
smartphone not tablet but the reason I
compared to the flyer was because
there's only an inch difference and I
love the love the flyer I really did so
i was stylus and did Emma stylist so so
so this is going to be I hate this town
term phablet but this is people calling
a phablet I hate that term it's just a
big ass phone rumored specs are a
Snapdragon 800 which you know isn't
readily available yet so who knows you
know it may end of the summer maybe the
fall when this thing actually comes to
fruition you know two gigs of ram 16 gig
internal with a micro SD slot and a 3300
milliamp hour battery and an ultrapixel
real rear camera so it's kind of like an
HTC One meteoroids meets the ultra fire
in size and it just all sorts a badass I
I mean this is really clear answer to
the galaxy note yeah exactly yeah well
the galaxy note and the optimus g pro
yeah yeah so so I think it's cool ah man
if this thing comes to verizon I don't
know I like HTC devices i do but you
know at that time i'll be rocking the
Moto X so i won't want anything to do
with it uh this is a question for Derek
why doesn't anyone ever give that the
droid DNA props why doesn't anyone ever
give the droid DNA props all right so I
happen to be a a person you know what I
could rant about this for honestly we're
gonna have a show special where I just
talked about the DNA for an hour Kevin
open this is what you caused just this
is right I'm gonna try you started I'm
going to give a
two-minute max try for one minute
discussion on this phone this phone has
a gorgeous screen arm it the screens
awesome um is 1080p um yeah yeah I like
the screen alright so that's that's the
only thing in my opinion that is good
about this phone you know the it's hard
as hell to press the power button up
here you have to like you can't let you
can't like cut your fingernails for like
two weeks you can press the power button
you know like I've never owned a phone
where you said I have to like you
degrade your own personal hygiene so you
can like turn it on and off like um I
hate hardware keys i do so and i hate
sense and this thing now has a ninety
percent working AOSP rom so I'm not the
best person to talk about the DNA the
DNA has a great screen battery life
isn't pathetic if you like sense it's a
nice phone if you're an Android
enthusiasts that likes to crack flash
things you're not going to like the
phone but it has a gorgeous screen and
that's why I bought this device because
I wanted something they had a an awesome
screen and I couldn't use the nexus 4 on
verizon obviously so I it's a it's an it
not a bad phone I I'm a critical bastard
because I hate it and I hate it for
reasons that most people wouldn't hate
it okay thank you for that i rant oh
that that's enough that's enough all
right I pologize a reoccurring question
in the comments is will the X phone the
Moto X compete with the s4 and the HTC
One well I think we we speculated a
little bit earlier that we think it'll
definitely be a no high-end phone and
not a mid-range device so I definitely
think absolutely they will give them a
run for their money similarly expect or
else even better specs I think it has to
be better Spectre they're in trouble
right so so she'll dois wants to know
why I hate the term phablet well
two years ago how long has it been since
the note came out has it been a year and
a half two years yet roughly a year and
a half two years ago when the original
note came out people didn't know what to
call because it was it was a five inch
device in most devices weren't that big
so they're like let's call it a phablet
because it's a phone that's kind of
tablet they only really know what to
call but that was when it was the only
device that was a five inch device now
almost there's dozens and dozens of
devices flagship devices that are five
inch devices such as my DNA you know the
Oppo find of five the Appa Appa vs sony
xperia you nosy of their in others
Huawei has devices uh huawei the Condors
even devices bigger like the Huawei has
a 6.1 devicessamsung galaxy mega 6.3
mega there's so many devices now there
are over five inches that I don't really
consider them phablets or just phones
it's just it's now almost a standard to
be that big so I just say it's a phone
you know it's it's a phone Derek
regarding your HTC One rant Jason Sandry
makes a very good comment DNA was the
one beta that's good that's good he's
right on right there you know and it
because it we appreciate your testing
area it's a good good use it's a also
result in Terezin HTC's farm league
though you know it's not a bad phone I
just I don't like it anyways don't get
me started second to still talk about it
forever alright so let's let's take one
more question then let's hit up some
awesome app updates so uh Randy wants to
know what's the better choice you know
the the one google edition or the s4
Google edition internet and that boils
down to well what's a better tour screen
HTC one at the regular and the s4
regular it choice I mean no golly what
what do you
for a better I mean it all comes down to
build quality what do you like better
yeah if we're saying build quality I
think we all agree that the one is
better build quality and placements if
you don't like like the huge like middle
button like you know it's hard work it's
literally the hardware go out touch the
phones put it in your hands figure out
what you like better and that will be
the determinant because the software
will be the same on both phones so what
feels better what you think you can you
know roll realm with as a daily driver
that will be the determinant so go to a
store check it out yeah that's a good
point stop okay alright so let's know
Scott won't tell us about some a few
apps that got some updates this week
yeah google play music with their
all-access they've been rolling out a
couple of updates recently uh the
biggest one the biggest update in this
app version that I have been asking for
since day one is it added the option to
delete tracks from the app from your
library on get them out of there it was
very hard to do that so that's a nice
feature you can share a song and add it
to a playlist from the now playing
screen and you can what thank God yeah I
know the I don't know why these weren't
built in before but you know whatever
beta right remove from my library is now
supported as well cool stuff I don't
know why those features weren't there
before but a lot of useful go into those
google calendar got an update now you
can change your default calendar and
event colors which i'm annoyed at seeing
the same colors as i have on my desktop
so i want to change them more
reoccurring event options new time and
date picker for event creation it's got
that little wheel I it's all you I
special looks nice you guys used it I've
not doesn't have December in it yeah so
good but it's not the app that's built
into you know android snow I know until
you Cal because they have just better
options for singing your calendar events
like a a text month I mean
that's one thing i'll get that google
has an added era calendar is the ability
to actually pretext and see what events
are coming up in the month instead of
the little bar that yeah good point also
launching a location like you've a
location for a event it'll launch Google
Maps I don't think it did that before um
searchable timezone picker because we
love our timezones right and you got to
be the right one yes Scott remember when
you didn't know what time zone you were
in um now I know and I was educated
about a year ago so you know be nested
so now that you have this new update on
your phone and tablet you should always
know it's a time you're in it's going to
help me and I will spread the word on
what time zone i'm in i'm pretty sure
the other people around you know at
times i will find some i will find
someone that does not know and i will
educate them okay uh gmail app update is
coming the desktop UI got revamped the
if you've seen screech screenshots for
it looks beautiful in my opinion looks
more user friendly what do you guys
think from I mean you haven't been able
to use it but like the screenshots they
look better I mean I've applied the
update on my desktop gmail so I kind of
play with it a little bit and I mean it
it's nice in its organization I'm not
necessarily wild about the tabs it's
different yeah it's different and it's a
little bit off-putting I feel like it
doesn't surface information as well only
on over time maybe yeah like the tabs
will say on the top if you have new
emails in those categories but they
don't give you like just a general
unread account or how many you have an
account and I mean I'll just that
there's a lot less ads like the top bar
of ads that are always in gmail isn't
there but I have noticed it inserting
adds sort of in line with emails where
like I see my list of emails in the very
top one is
but it kind of looks like okay moving on
um uh they released a app Google admin
it's for Google accounts business
accounts and Google App accounts yeah
Google Apps accounts and it allows
basically the management team to you
know overseeing add members and edit
things and email people and well you can
you can manage user accounts basically
on the go you don't have to log into the
web yeah you can reset a password or add
a user account you know simple things
like their nose for systems
administrators of Google Apps accounts
every this admin I applaud the app yes
very nifty um I have a question here
that it's about it's about the DNA and
you know what you guys gonna keep you
guys are gonna keep bringing me back to
it I so so Kevin wants to know should we
would you do Kevin Kevin wants to know
should you route to be a name or just
wait until they finally release the
update the updated in jelly bean version
or will you really want the Moto X you
know and that boils down to your own
personal taste and personal choices you
know I rooted mine the second I got it
because I like to do that that's a hobby
of mine I like to do more I like to
tinker if you like to do that too then
yeah go ahead um you know there's a near
a hundred percent working I seen near
hundred percent but there's a there's a
near-perfect CM 10.1 which is android
4.2 point2 AOSP based rom available the
only thing that really doesn't work
right now is the microphones kind of
shaky when you're doing like voice to
text so if i go to talk to it and say
into google voice search it may only
pick up a couple of the words and/or
thinkers day and how or or i won't even
pick anything up or doesn't understand
me at all if i put my nexus 7 right
beside it and talk it you know and have
a conversation with it the nexus 7 picks
up everything the DNA does it half the
time is junk um that but but they're
continually fixing stuff
like a NFC just got working bluetooth
audio just got working there's no more
force closes or crashes whenever you
watch youtube video and landscape and
turn it to portrait like all these bugs
are continually getting fixed and fix
anything so so CM 10.1 actually makes me
like the phone you know cuz i can play
around and do some more stuff with it so
I don't hate it as much as I used to but
the very moment I can pre-order the
motorola x i'm ordering one for my wife
and I'm wondering one for myself because
I parag right now my wife is using my
old Galaxy Nexus okay so I but it but
I'm that confident that I will like it
that much more because i don't like
hardware keys and i'm pretty sure it's
going to be software keys and it's going
to look exactly like the nexus 4 maybe a
little more rectangular lish and i like
the nexus 4 so anyways yeah it's all
personal preference you do what you want
you at you makes you happy android isn't
one size fits all you can customize to
however you want or not calling it right
now the X phone is going to come out
with the version Derek's going to buy it
pre-order it and then they're going to
come out with another version I'm going
to call it two and a half three weeks
after and Derek will be in the same spot
e is now okay all right so uh so we were
talking about you know root and CM 10.1
so let's uh continue on with that
segment I guess good good timing Kevin
thank you for leading us in the Segway
cm 10.1 release candidate three is now
available for various devices so go
ahead and hit up get cm and see if RC 3
is available for your device it's a
bigger badder better more stable it's
slowly approaching a full stable version
but you know the release cancer pretty
much completely stable anyways it's just
you know fixing probably bug or two that
you may not even be aware about but
they're there you know they're trying to
squash as many bugs as possible so go
ahead and check it out uh who doesn't
like a completely stable non buggy rom I
know I know I can't wait to my blast bug
or two is stable in this but that's
nothing to a CN that's more of a HTC
device you got a squash those bug
okay so uh you know we have some other
questions here is anybody played with
the Oppo find 5 dan John that will move
already reviews on it other guys here at
Android authority would put a good you
know reputation with and what other guys
here at enjoy Thornton have used doesn't
what I'm saying the heaven woman
absolutely okay and then they enjoyed it
all right so so we have a question here
here arm um what is the what is your
opinion of the Oppo find five
considering this you know versus the
galaxy s4 and HTC one you know it's
another high-end device it's another
nice device from what some of my
colleagues here at Android authority
they you know did reviews on the device
like the device a lot it's a high
quality built device you know it if you
want to give it a try I would say you
know go ahead now that versus the sgs4
the HTC One um I mean it all boils down
to software in your own personal
preference for hardware if I had to
choose one of those 3 i'd still probably
choose the HTC One then probably the
fine five and then the galaxy s4 how
about you guys I think that's probably
my ovaries well yeah I would say the
fine five in the Warner almost even
there for me and the s4 would be for the
last choice really is impressive to me
how low quality Samson's bill dance
right there trying popularly going on
premium versus the one and pretty much
everybody everywhere recognizes that the
one is vastly higher quality build than
ps4 the Oppo find 5 uncle is not a big
name manufacturer like HTC or Samsung
and yet their build quality is better
than Samsung's LG's device build quality
is getting to be a better than Samsung's
and they used to be joke it's all in the
marketing and you know I think it really
boils down to it because the HTC One we
think if we argue that it's better and
it has sold half the amount devices that
the s4 has and some insanely calculated
due to some type of math number came out
a little bit ago that this year they
think
I don't know this is accurate or not but
80 million s4 devices are gonna be sold
that's in it let's say that that's ain't
even half that you know that's still
insane 35 max so what it boils down to
marketing as Scott said you see Samsung
heavily flooding the market pushing
their product name in their brand you
just don't see that with HTC so I don't
like HTC has the budget for it right now
they're not making a whole bunch of
money but Samsung you know there's this
vast company and they as we've put it
you know throw phones at a velcro wall
and see what sticks and that's what
they're you know they're going all out
of their marketing that's the person
who's asked earlier what can the Moto X
phone compete and that's where they have
to compete it if google wants motorola
to be successful and google is the
world's largest advertising company
that's where they have to hit samsung it
they're not going to just throw a great
device on the shelf and expect the
average consumer to adopt it but the
nexus 7 they put together a really good
marketing campaign if they do something
like that and then elevate it and
actually get it on TV then that phone
has a chance to actually get back but
until you overcome Samsung's marketing
budget nobody is going to outperform
them just because Samsung spends more
money than really they spend more money
than apple and HTC that react by a good
margin and if that's really the it's
from their success right now it's not
surprising that Apple and Samsung have
the majority of the profits in the
mobile space when Apple and symptoms and
the majority of money on advertising in
the local space hmm they spend far more
than asus or HTC or LG or Google or
motorola and a wreath or awards all
right so we have another question here
and I think this is a this is a good
question so Sean wants to know what do
we think is going to happen to the razor
line after the Moto X is released and
iiii think that motorola kind of hinted
at today or yesterday yeah yesterday
that the the motorola x line is the new
future of motorola that's going to be
their new flagship line the other yeah
they're gonna come out razor still out i
would say probably not but but they're
gonna still support the mm ah you know
until they reach n to life the razr HD
line is not even a year old yet thou you
know come this fall it'll be a year old
so I would look for it to be supported
you know for 18 months just because
that's what usually Nexus devices are
supported for and that I could be
completely wrong on that but support
there is a pretty loose term I would say
all updates about that mmm Motorola's
dunno one don't count on updates you
know basically don't hope for updates
with the older devices Motorola's done
better than in the last let's say six to
eight months they've done better than
anybody has of course it's hard to turn
around the road a reputation like that
but the bonnie is on jellybean at least
the charge and Thunderbolt are but
that's a good point yeah you know this
day they kind of went back and fixed a
lot of pasture static look amazing at
headlines could whatever well I mean it
came out after but it didn't come out
that long about eight oncea it was the
big see that higher version of Android
later alright so we've another question
here and this is something that you know
we it's based appear in speculation then
do you think Samsung's of phones will
get better build qualities and stay away
from plastic no I yeah I mean that
that's kind of their thing you know
they're there they build plastic films
well let's not be mean to plastic here
because I work in the plastics industry
and that's not take the battery cover
off of your Samsung whatever phone turn
it around and feel the inside of the
plastic that textured field that doesn't
have that crappy oily hyper blaze
coating but okay like Kevlar as
an epoxy resin which is a polymer which
is it's plastic yeah what bonds
composites together so it's not the
plastic can't be made to feel good it's
just that Samsung Business Bureau yes
plastic you could possibly put on there
because all of the best luggage is made
out of polycarbonate it's just can they
implement it and I can tell you right
now that there are manufacturing
processes where you can make plastic
fuel just like metal you can make it
feel like in looking for composite you
want to and their additives to get
whatever you want it's just how they
implement the plastic so they could stay
with plastic and just not suck at it and
they still have a good feeling phone so
I think they're going to slightly answer
this with the s4 active that is going to
be a tougher built s4 um all phones that
have been made to be tougher have never
done well well that's because the
hardware always sucked on it that is a
very good point but there has never been
a phone that has been a tougher phone or
it used for on-the-go people or at work
people yeah it has succeeded what about
that traveling with my brother-in-law i
used to have casio it was it called
don't don't like commando or something i
think that's a that things are brick ya
know there are great quality phones and
they you know withstand a lot but they
don't sell that much yeah that's true so
maybe the s4 active will change X it's a
it's a well-known name from manufacturer
it sells tons of phones you know maybe
maybe who knows I talking more that's
good all right so uh I think I think
it's about that time so if you have any
questions for us go ahead and hit us up
at various corners of the Internet Scott
and where are those corners at first
corner uh I guess we're going to do a
circle here um you were such a fit of
quarters okay uh correct glad we're
getting this over with you know this
could go on
youtube youtube channel for app reviews
barber reviews all those things what
Derek's make in a circle with his hands
for all those listening on soundcloud
which we are on soundcloud if you don't
want to use the video feed and just want
to subscribe to a RSS RSS feed of audio
soundcloud audio also podbean and on-air
section on the website android authority
calm and you look closely at basically
everywhere everywhere you don't want to
be we are there even itunes and our
google+ page alright guys have a
wonderful weekend dan john scott and you
all out there watching us thanks for
thanks for tuning in what I don't know
