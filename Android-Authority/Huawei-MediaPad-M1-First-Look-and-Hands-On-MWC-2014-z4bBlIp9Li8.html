by bitdefender mobile security
huawei's largest tablet offering here at
MWC can do more than you might think hey
it's Josh of Agartha manager authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the huawei media pad m1 the design of
the 8 inch media pad m1 borrows a couple
of design cues from the HTC One as is
probably what you're going to think when
you first take a look at this tablet but
it does rock the look very graciously
and the end result is still in overall
good looking tablet so maybe it doesn't
matter as much the m1 is just 7.9
millimeters thick which is less than
most devices competing in its class it's
also pretty light for an 8 inch tablet
at 329 grams we are looking at an
all-metal device with a clean design
that has a premium feel beyond its
mid-range specification sheet and it is
also available in grey and white now the
front of the m1 is especially pretty
with the very large screen and also the
thin vertical bezels that plenty of
people do favor greatly the 8 inch IPS
LCD display of the media pad m1 has a
resolution of 1280 by 800 translating it
to a pixel density of about 189 PPI now
that is pretty low for most standards
but we do need to keep in mind the price
tag of this device this is really just
an average display for all intents and
purposes but that could still be just
fine for a plenty of users out there the
media pad m1 is also powered by an
in-house made high silicon quad-core
processor clocked in at 1.6 gigahertz
and combined with one gigabytes of RAM
the processor should do a good job of
powering the user interface though we
won't really vouch for more intense
activities like let's say multitasking
in high gaming you do get the option of
8 or 16 gigabytes built-in but you can
also add additional storage thanks to
the micro SD card slots and as far as
the camera goes you get a pretty basic
setup a 5 megapixel main shooter and a 1
megapixel front camera for video calls
and the occasional selfie and as far as
the battery life goes you do get a
pretty sizable 4800 million power
battery that should power it for quite a
long time and finally when it comes to
the software the emotion UI Android
overlay on the media pad m1 is designed
to be as easy to use as possible hence
the lack of an app drawer that's present
on most Android devices
I do understand however if that's a bit
of a turn-off for some of you out
but it is a motif of Huawei software
instead all of the apps are shown on the
home screen and unless you do a little
bit of organization it could get a
little bit cluttered while we also went
for a very bright and colorful aesthetic
with their software which was rather
easy on the eyes overall it does get the
job done and you should be able to get
quite a bit done in this software
without really too much fuss at all in
the end this is still a tablet but it is
capable of taking SIM cards connecting
to mobile data networks and taking calls
and doing SMS messages and that does put
the media pad m1 on a rather unique
scale and in the end we do kind of like
what we see so this is Josh Pagar from
Android authority reporting to you live

Barcelona Spain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
