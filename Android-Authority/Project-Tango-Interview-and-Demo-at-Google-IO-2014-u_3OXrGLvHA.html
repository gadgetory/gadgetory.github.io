authority here at Google i/o at the
project tango booth and I'm here with
one of the engineers of project tango
Johnny and I wanted to get some to get
some extra information because I know
that tango in some ways might be
somewhat of a mystery to some of you out
there so I wanted to get it from the
actual people themselves what project
tango is from their word so when we get
a bit of an explanation about our
project tango is and we have seen gaming
examples of it but what else can project
tango do sure they at a high level the
goal our project tango is too advanced
3d sensing and tracking on mobile
devices so we've been working with the
hardware ecosystem and the software our
partners to advance both the sensors and
the algorithm is necessary to make these
devices track their position and capture
models of their space so one of the
things that we've done it a lot recently
is what you can do it just the tracking
information where we take that camera
and control either a unity basic 3d in
my environment or an unreal engine based
3d environment we and we add the data
from the depth sensor this is where it
starts to get into a new code and new
algorithms that aren't quite ready to
put in the SDK yet but also why we
haven't had so many demos but we have a
few demos here that essentially as you
walk through a space you're actually
able to capture the geometry of the
floor and the walls and the furniture
and outside of gaming well inside of
gaming that allows you to have
characters that sort of know how to
navigate through your hallways or
potentially play hide-and-seek in your
in your house and because it knows where
your closet is but industrial
applications and professional
applications include real estate where
you're trying to estimate the square
footage of your home we have apps from
Trimble which essentially start to
explore well how much better could you
make room scanning because rim scanning
has ends up being important for shopping
for furniture or being able to figure
out how much corporate do you need or
how many tiles that you want to put on
the
and then there's an industrial
inspection so the trumbull also has
another very early prototype of an
experience where we've taken a 3d model
of the most funny center and once we
recognize the position of the device in
the Moscone Center you can essentially
get x-ray vision of where the elevators
where's the service stations for this
particular amount panel and without
having to walk around the building sort
of looking at the signs on the walls you
actually can hold up the tablet and see
sort of through the walls with sorry
with a one one question I just came to
mine for for various applications I say
consumers would be using would the
algorithms or the 3d schematic switch
let's say would they be made available
for the various applications or would
the consumers be able to create those
schematics themselves so the amount of
data that the device can generate from
scratch is relatively modest it
basically is just the position of the
device as you were holding it and then
rough geometry information sort of i can
pick out sort of rough walls and floors
and some furniture it since it has a 3d
sensor to capture that geometry it does
not automatically know about say where
does the hot water pipe run through the
wall that requires having the CAD model
in advance or some other source so and
chances are people don't won't have that
available in most buildings but for
professional and industrial commercial
structures that data may be available by
the Builder so that it's a 7-inch tablet
that has a Tegra k1 inside and our
custom designed sensor so we have a
fisheye camera that's designed for
motion tracking which is in the middle
and if you think about human vision we
have a tremendously wide peripheral
vision that expands up and gives us
enormous amount of context about the way
the environment is moving and so what
this does is gives us a wide field of
view of the environment and then we have
a set of sensors on here that are depth
sensors these are sensors that basically
give us information about the floor and
the walls to tell us what the geometry
is in this particular tablet we have
structured light depth sensor from a
company called mantis but we also have a
prototype hear of a depth sensor from a
company
PMD tensions that has a different
principle of operation which is time of
flight and the time of flight has
slightly different properties and that
it doesn't require a large separation of
sensors and potentially is more robust
to sunlight but as we evolve the
hardware will continue to sort of push
the push the envelope in terms of the
performance of those deficits is true so
let me give you a quick tour of the
software that actually runs on a project
tango device this is our Diagnostics
tool which just gives us a view of the
sensor data coming in so on the left
side of the screen you can see this
fisheye lens in fact I can still see
that my fingers just around the tablet
and so this is a super wide camera that
that allows us to understand the motion
of the device the left points are being
tracked yes so those green points are
essentially the image processing doing
optical flow so this allows us to
understand while everything moved in the
world in a way that makes sense to the
way that device was help we also have
the gyro and accelerometer data right
below the image that is essentially time
synchronized with the with the camera so
this allows all the sensor data to come
into the same time Orwell timestamp so
we can make an estimate of where the
device is but if I actually move the
tablet left and right or actually make a
circle you can actually see that it's
actually tracing out a circle on this
one over on the screen yeah so I'm going
to just walk around here a little bit
and you'll see the tracking showing up
on I'll point at it over here yeah so
Johnny's gonna go off camera and you'll
see the tracking right here is actually
taking where he is and there it goes you
can see it's actually mapping the entire
area that he is walking through using
all of those sensors and now we have
this sort of this kind of janky figure
eight right here oh that's great yeah so
this is tracing out my path so one of
the things we can do is insert that path
into a game environment
so this is one of the unity applications
that we have will be part of the SDK
which is how do you actually use this
data for end user experience and so what
we've done is we've connected that
tracking data to the unity camera and
this is a very simple game where
essentially I just pick up the cube and
put it on the switch but to actually
finish this game I you can see that I
can't quite reach the cube from where I
am now so actually have to go walk
forward to solve anything is that using
the data that you just tracked that's
right all right so so that this ability
to track the physical motion of the
device is now being piped into unity so
if I pick up this green switch buck
sorry I can see that the green switch is
actually over there on the booth you hit
them so I'll come back alright and there
you go so this so this basically
introduces motion into mobile gaming so
if I move forward in the real world I
actually move forward in the virtual
space as well so this allows game
developers application developers to
start thinking about well how would I
actually use my physical room either my
my living room or my office space and
actually use this inside the game which
is if you can imagine now that I
understand where I am in my house or my
environment and I actually have a little
bit of geometry data I can sort of
transform my environment into a fantasy
world so again i'm just using the tablet
as a camera controller i can look at the
trees and the stones but i also see on
the ground there's a small wizard so if
we crouched if I crouch down I can get
down to the Wizards level and interact
with him so essentially if I have the
ability to place these assets i can
start transforming parts of my living
room into a fantasy environment so I
can't imagine you know my living room is
fantasy world versus the my bedroom is
another sort of safe haven or you know
in Iceland and you can actually use
physical space as part of the game if we
had game a game that actually understood
the shape of the Moscone Center you can
imagine actually having multiple people
walk around the space competing with
each other for territory
you think that would not be very
dangerous though like I actually have a
personal desire to see a game at some
point that causes two people to actively
tackle each other but we'll see that
actually comes to comes to fruition
here's an app from a university partner
that we just got recently that actually
combines the real-time data of the
tracking with the depth sensing that we
have I will see you this runs this was
an app that we just got a few days ago
so what this is doing right now is
actually combining both the tracking
data and the depth sensor data to allow
us to create a 3d capture of the space
oh it's like oh that's actually imaging
the yeah so this is like well I'm
painting the environment with my camera
and I can back up when i'll scan you
into this place okay
that's supposed to be me right there
yeah so this is a you know a very simple
mesh that we're building in real time
but as the software improves and as the
hardware improves in terms of accuracy
we can imagine that the quality of this
data continues to get higher and higher
fidelity if we actually stored the data
and did more post-processing on it app
developers could actually get much much
higher quality but this is just what we
could process in real time so these are
sort of the building blocks you can
imagine allowing developers to start
building use new user experiences that
use both motion as well as physical
geometry to create new eps ok do you
think that next year maybe for i 0 20 15
or 20 or 16 you'll be able to create
that game using the Moscone Center
schematic I think it would be a really
neat target to aim for oh cool we'll
have to see there's a lot of things that
have to sort of improve on both the
software side and the hardware side to
make it happen I'm sure it's gonna get
there I mean yeah some great minds
working on end with the way the word is
already i'm almost sounded this is
really wonderful like it's great all
right well thank you very much and yeah
you know keep it tuned here we have
project tango as it as it happens we're
going to be covering it as it comes
along it's a wonderful wonderful sweet
of technology that we have here and
Johnny one of the minds behind it thank
you so much for for fielding our
questions and for giving us a demo of it
thank you right take care all right this
