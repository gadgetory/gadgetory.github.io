Hindy from android authority calm and oh

first up let's talk about exactly what
this contest is we are teaming up with
opera to do a giveaway that's going to
span the course of three weeks the first
week just ended and we gave away a
samsung galaxy note 4 there are still
two weeks left in this contest and that
means there are still more prizes to win

days later on Halloween the grand prize
winner will get a nexus 9 a Moto X 2014
and a moto 360 SmartWatch if you happen
to be watching and you're the winner of
the galaxy note 4 congratulations dude
or dudette on your brand new smartphone
have we got your attention good here's
how you can enter to win keep in mind
that once you enter yourselves when
you'll be entered to win every prize in
this contest the first thing you'll need
to do is head on over to the contest
page which is linked in the video
description below once there you'll no
doubt see a very large rafflecopter
widget from here you simply need to
decide which one of these things you
want to do or you can do all of them you
have plenty of options the first of
which is downloading opera max opera max
is an application that will save you
data without a lot of effort on your
part it compresses the data that some of
your applications use and thus allows
you to do pretty much the same stuff
you've always done but you'll be using
less data if you want to know more we'll
have my review linked up in the video
description below if you download opera
max you'll get to contest entries if you
want more contest entries there's a
really fun way to do that you can post
on Twitter Facebook Google+ or Instagram
about a horror story that happened to
you and your data you'll need to hashtag
the posts with hashtag data horror
stories and hashtag opera max it really
is as easy as it sounds tell us about
your worst data experiences it can be an
application that use too much data or
even a massive bill that you don't know
how you've got because you use too much
data somehow for each social network
that you post that story on with those
hashtags you'll get an additional bonus
entry just don't forget to let the
rafflecopter widget know that you didn't
if you're a particularly motivated
individual you can actually post your
data horror story in the form of a
YouTube video if you do this and use the
hashtags like you would on other social
networks you'll get
I've contest entries instead of just one
and again that don't forget to let the
rafflecopter widget know that you did it
if you want two more contest entries
there is an easy way to do that you can
follow opera on twitter and like them on
facebook each one of those will nab you
one contest entry apiece we recommend
that you do this so you can keep up on
all the cool things opera is doing if
you want even more contest entries we
can help you out with that also once you
enter using one of the many methods
above will give you a unique URL simply
share that URL with your friends and for
each one of them that enters using your
link you'll get an additional bonus
entry with a maximum of 10 bonus entries
available ok so part of this is telling
a data horror story so I'm gonna tell
you one of my data horror stories so
that you have an idea of what kind of
stuff that you can talk about ok so a
couple of weeks ago i was downloading
the onedrive application because you
know I use it on my computer a little
bit and it's 15 gigabytes of free cloud
storage and I like free cloud storage I
don't really care who it's from well I
was on the I was on my mobile network at
the time I was connected to t mobile's
4g and during the thing I wasn't paying
attention and I guess I set it to upload
my camera roll over Wi-Fi and over
mobile data I have the tmobile plan
where I have 3 gigabytes of data and
then I have unlimited data but the first
three gigabytes our 4G and then it drops
you down to the edge network so long
story short I ended up uploading my
entire camera roll using t mobile's 4g
and it chewed through mike three
gigabytes of data in about an hour so
until november i am stuck on t-mobile's
2g edge network so yeah that's my data
horror story we're looking forward to
hearing all of yours if you want more
details on how to do everything we
explained it earlier but if you want to
see more details don't forget to check
out the contest page once again I'm Joe
