authority of this summer while we
released a great smartphone called vp9
and it was remarkable because it had a
camera set up from Leica now that had a
5.2 inch display now while we have
released a bigger version of basically
the same phone the Huawei p9 plus it
comes with a 5.5 inch display plus a few
other extras so let's take a look at it
the design for the p9 plus is very
similar to that of the p9 on the back
you've got the bright metal you've got
the sham fit edges and you've got the
metal unibody design and then of course
on the front you've got this lovely 5.5
inch display now looking around the
phone on the bottom you'll find the USB
type-c charging port you'll find the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and a single
speaker on the right-hand side you'll
find the textured power button and above
that the volume rocker on the left hand
side is the tray for the SIM card and
the SD card on all the top you have
something new that comes with the p9 and
that is the IR blaster flicking it over
to onto its back you've got this black
band which contains the camera
technology with dual sensor like a
camera and then just below that you have
the fingerprint reader now on the front
is the 5.5 inch full HD display now the
standard Huawei p9 also had a full HD
display this time in a 5.2 inch panel
that means that the wire weigh p9 plus
has a slightly lower pixel density they
didn't bump up the resolution for this
bigger model however it does have one
ace up its sleeve the huawei p9 plus
uses an AMOLED panel as opposed to an
LCD panel as well as the AMOLED display
the p9 plus also includes press touch
technology which is basically a
pressure-sensitive screen what that
means is if you hard press on one of the
built-in apps that say the camera then a
little shortcut menu will appear that
will take you to some direct actions
inside that app also from inside the
gallery you can hard press on a photo
which will bring up a magnifying glass
allowing you to
see different levels of detail on the
photo now the pressure level can be
configured inside of the settings you
can set it to be harder or to be softer
and there's a little test area that
allows you to test out how hard you need
to press to activate the press touch
technology the yp9 plus features the
huawei Kiran nine five five system on a
chip built using a 16 nanometer Finn fit
process it's basically a slightly
beefed-up version of the queuing 950
that you find in the Huawei mate 8 the
chip has an octa-core configuration
that's 4 cortex a 72 cores and 4 cortex
a53 calls it also includes a Marly t-80
GPU which is certainly one of the most
powerful GPU that while we have put into
their phones to date there also is 4
gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of
internal storage and that can be
expanded using micro sd in terms of
everyday use the p9 + is fast fluid and
great to use the UI animations are
smooth apps open quickly and
multitasking is a breeze
games also work well on this device and
while there are hands is out there with
more powerful GPU configurations the
mali t-80 is a fantastic GPU even in
this 4 core variant
although the benchmark show the GPU has
lower performance and say the GPU in the
Exynos 88-90 row for most users the 3d
gaming experience is certainly above
average the court is a 72 is one of the
latest and highest performance 64-bit
calls from arm the use of cortex a7 t2
and cortex a53 in an optical
configuration is duly reflected in the
benchmarks the Huawei p9 + cos 1829 on
geek benches single core test and 6000
573 for it multi-core tests these are
approximately the same scores as
achieved by the smaller Huawei p9 4 + 2
to the p9 + cord 97,000 910 which ranks
the device higher than the Samsung
Galaxy Note 5 and faster as you'd expect
them the Huawei mate 8 if a DS even
faster than the galaxy s6 however it is
slower than the latest flagships with
dragon 820 or the xnor eight eight nine
zero as Epic Citadel the device match is
a nice fifty nine point three frames per
second in ultra high quality mode and
really you can't ask for any more than
that the fingerprint reader on the p9
plus is very good and I really have come
to expect nothing less from Huawei the
fingerprint reader on the p9 was
excellent and the p9 plus has followed
suit
since the fingerprint readers on the
back you can wake and unlock your phone
just by placing your finger on the
reader you can also use the fingerprint
reader to trigger the shutter while
taking photographs or use the swipe from
left to right when viewing photos in the
gallery we can even use it to answer a
call the huawei p9 plus features a
single speaker on the bottom edge next
to the type-c USB port the speaker is
quite loud and the sound is reasonable
considering it isn't a front facing
speaker however as is the case with many
smart phones music can sound a bit thin
with a lack of bass I found that at full
volume some tracks tend to distort and
the sound quality improved when the
volume was actually turned down a notch
or two
the p9 plus has a 3400 milliamp hour
battery which is impressive when you can
see the house sleek while we have made
this device Iran epic sees a deal to
test the battery life while playing 3d
games and according to my calculations
you'll be able to play 3d games for over
four hours from a single charge for
simpler tasks like browsing the web you
should be able to use this device for up
to 11 hours and if you're watching
videos that stores locally on the
internal storage you should be able to
watch 10 hours of movies what this means
you'll easily get through a whole day
without having to recharge your phone in
fact if you are a moderate to light user
you may even see two days usage out of
this phone before you need to recharge
it now the huawei p9 plus supports fast
charging and a fast charger is included
in the box using the supplied charge it
takes just 40 minutes to go from empty
to 50% and to go from zero to 100% take
just under two
half-hours one of the extra features on
the p9 plus is the IR blaster the
bundled smart control app allows you to
control TVs air conditioning units
set-top boxes DVD players projectors and
more device it up is easy enough you
just pick the type of device the make of
device and then you follow the on-screen
instructions over all the IR blaster
worked well and was as expected and is
in my opinion a good addition to the p9
plus the Huawei p9 plus comes with
Android 6.0 marshmallow out of the box
on top of that while we have placed
their emotion UI that means there are
redesigned icons some redesign layouts
and redesigned colorings however the
biggest difference is it doesn't include
an app drawer now if you insist on
having an app draw the p9 plus is not
for you personally I don't mind either
way as well as the UI changes there are
lots of additional features that you
don't get with stock Android including
motion gestures a floating dock voice
wake up one-handed mode and Huawei's own
take on the Do Not Disturb mode and the
motion gestures you can enable motions
like flick to mute raise to ear to
answer calls and tilt motions to move
icons and widgets there is also the
knuckle gesture which allows you to take
screenshots by double tapping the screen
with your knuckle or drawing a letter to
open an app both types of these knuckle
gestures can be disabled if they misfire
with a built-in voice app wake up you
can talk to your phone when it's nearby
its usage is limited to locating your
device or placing a call but it works
well the default phrase is okay MA but
it can be changed to anything you want
since the p9 plus uses on-screen keys
while we has added the ability to
customize the order of the navigation
buttons by default the back is on the
left and the recent apps is on the right
however this can be reversed it's also
possible to add a fourth button for
opening the notification panel tapping
the icon is the equivalent of dragging
in the notification shade down from the
top there is also a theme engine that
allows you to change the look and feel
of the UI to something that better suits
your tastes Huawei has included in their
battery manager which gives you a high
level control over batch related
features
for example you can set a power plan
which will tweak the CPU according to
your usage one interesting feature that
I also found on the wire way p9 is you
can change the screen resolution to just
720p according to the battery manager
app this will help you save power other
batch related options include a
whitelist function to ensure that
certain apps keep running after the
screen is turned off and a power usage
firewall which warns you about
power-hungry apps
there is also an ultra power saving mode
which will disable everything except for
calls and messages it also brings up a
simplified monochrome interface when
running low on battery power going into
ultra power saving mode can certainly
add a few hours onto your battery life
one of the key selling point of the
Huawei p9 plus is the camera now just
like with the p9 while wear has teamed
up we like her to bring basically the
same dual sensor camera to the p9 plus
the p9 plus has a 12 megapixel dual lens
setup on the back one with an RGB sensor
specifically for color reproduction and
the other purely for capturing black and
white detail the F 2.2 dual lens carries
the like a seal of approval the camera
setup was Co engineer with Leica as part
of a long-term partnership that was
announced back in February the idea
behind the dual lens is the ability to
deliver better light sensitivity with
the monochrome sensor promising a 200%
increase over regular sensors and a 50%
bump in contrast there are three
different focus modes onboard laser
focus depth focus and contrast focus as
well as a dedicated depth measurement
chip this means that both lenses can
focus individually and the p9
image processor will automatically
choose the best result apart from the
more standard modes like HDR and
panorama there are lots of camera modes
available including a full manual mode
there is also a special shallow depth of
fill mode when using the shallow depth
of field mode you get the added ability
to be able to refocus pictures post
capture from the gallery you can enter
the refocusing mode and change which
object is in focus and the depth of
field other mode include
night shot time-lapse slow-mo and
watermark there is also a series of live
filters available if you want to get a
little bit fancy with your picture
taking while they also add a light
painting mode which lets you capture
light trails created by things like
moving cars or stars in the sky the
effects are really cool but they do
require a steady hand or a tripod to get
the best out of these modes when in
promo you get some extra options on the
setting page name ability to save images
in raw and JPEG formats plus the option
to enable or disable the AF auxilary
light feature there are two things that
detract from the overall camera
experience one is a lack of optical
image stabilization and the lack other
is a lack of 4k recording the good news
is there is a software base image
stabilization option for when you are
recording video the 8 megapixel
front-facing camera as autofocus
something missing from many smart phones
including the standard p9 the autofocus
is a nice feature and should make selfie
junkies happy you will also find the
standard beautification mode available
plus the perfect selfie mode from Huawei
my biggest complaint with the p9 plus is
camera app is it doesn't rotate all of
the UI elements when you move from
portrait to landscape although some
elements do move the setting pages
remain in portrait as do the pro
settings and there you have it the while
a p9 plus it's got that great 5.5 inch
AMOLED displays with a good processing
package and it's got that nice like a
camera setup on the back it's also got
that autofocus front-facing camera not
something you see on too many
smartphones nowadays the only thing that
may stop its widespread adoption is the
use of emotion UI rather than stock
