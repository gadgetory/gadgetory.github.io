Hindy the android authority app guy we
reviewed Opera browser before but a new
update has brought not only a lot of bug
fixes but a brand-new tablet UI in this
video we're going to check that new UI
out even though there are a lot of
changes many of them are subtle to start
opera takes advantage of the increased
screen real estate on tablet screens by
using a real tab system like you'd find
on a desktop browser this differs from
the phone browser which uses the chrome
like square with buttons to denote open
tabs another change you'll notice is the
settings menu instead of opening the
settings to a full screen you instead
get a windowed settings menu that you
can click out of without using the back
button it looks nice and it doesn't make
you reach for that back button and
that's a big improvement other UI
enhancements involve moving as many
things to the left and right sides as
possible adding things to the speed dial
is now on the top right where you can
get to it using your right thumb
replacing it on the left side of the
address bar where it is on phones is an
icon that will quickly take you to the
speed dial so you can add something to
speed out with your right thumb and then
immediately get to it with your left
thumb aside from moving buttons around
the new settings and the actual tabs
everything else remains pretty much the
same since there is more screen real
estate now the app feels like it makes
better use of that space and everything
looks more spaced out and comfortable it
does not have that cramped feeling of a
phone browser and we really like that a
lot overall we like this new UI
improvement it really takes advantage of
the space provided by tablets while
maintaining a user friendly interface by
putting essential functions within the
reach of a thumb if you're looking for a
browser on your tablet it's definitely
worth giving this one a shot once again
