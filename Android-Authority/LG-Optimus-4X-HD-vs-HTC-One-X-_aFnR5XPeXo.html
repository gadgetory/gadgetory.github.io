clayton over to android authority calm
today i'm bringing you a head-to-head
comparison between the LG optimus 4x HD
and the AT&amp;amp;T variant of the HTC One X
these phones are both super hot right
now the great devices they're powerful
built well their high-end Android
smartphone so we're going to put them
head-to-head and show you which one
comes out on top anyways we'll get into
some of the hardware software and native
features of each of these phones in a
minute first we'll go over the build
quality both your really solid in the
hands they're built nice they're just
about equal in weight and they feel
really nice on our HTC we've got a
sealed in battery that's eighteen
hundred milliamps so not too big but you
know it's up there for smart phones
these days and in the LG we've got a
2140 milliamp battery which is actually
removable and you can probably get
extended batteries here in the near
future for the LG so the battery life
goes to the LG on that one anyways we
look on top we've got our headphone jack
on each and on the HTC One X we're
featuring Beats Audio let's have a micro
USB here and we've got our volume rocker
not one be LG optimus 4x HD we've got
our volume rocker right here as you can
see and we've got our power button here
on top micro USB on bottom anyways the
cameras on each of these devices are
both 8 megapixel we've got some flash
we've got 1080p HD video recording and
then we've got a 1.3 megapixel on the lg
optimus 4x HD and we have a 1.3
megapixel on the HTC One X as well now
both of these front-facing cameras are
capable of a 720p video capture so we'll
just pop the display on each of these
phones as you can see the LG optimus 4x
HD is bearing a 4.7 inch HD IPS LCD
screen we've got some capacitive buttons
there on bottom we've got our home back
and our menu button and then our HTC One
X also has a 4.7 inch HD screen now this
is a super lcd2 screen both have 720p x
1280 resolution ways we'll have a lot
this we've got our capacitive buttons
down here on the HTC One X the back home
and the recents so upon locking each
device we notice that we're running
different UIs both do rub me Ice Cream
Sandwich operating system from Android
but the Optimus is running the
three-point Oh Optimus UI and these
senses running the HTC Sense
four-point-oh you I the both of these
two eyes are just fine they are carrier
skins we don't have stock Android on
either of these phones so before we get
into any more hardware will just make
notice some of the differences in you I
between these two phones now I found our
first look and feel we notice that we
can expand the dock bar on each of these
phones simply drag and I calm down and
we can create a folder in the dock bar
of the HTC One X or we can drag an icon
in and actually expand the number of
icons we're holding in the dock bar of
the lg optimus 4x HD now the cool thing
about the 4x HD is that every single
icon is customizable and resizable so we
can choose the Edit here and we'd
actually be able to choose a which icon
we want to represent that and we can
even create a photo icon and resize it
now the HTC One X lacks that feature but
much like the LG optimus you can grab an
icon move it to a folder very simple
unlike the galaxy s3 where are they
TouchWiz UI makes that a little
difficult anyways we've got a native
widgets on each a lot of cool stuff
we've got a lot of clocks with HTC as
usual we've got some cool clocks and
weather widgets with the LG as well as
will pull down a notification bar so you
can see in the eighteen t version of the
HTC One X we don't have any
notifications so it's lacking much of
anything in the notification bar whereas
on the lg we have all of our different
toggles we've got a quick memo of sound
Wi-Fi Bluetooth all that stuff and we
can actually edit which toggles appear
there now we also can access the
settings from each of these toggle menus
here and basically have the same amount
of settings on each of course we've got
our Wi-Fi our network settings Bluetooth
mobile on each we have NFC we can use
the Android Beam to transmit data apps
videos you name it HTC we can actually
personalized by going through here we
can choose the scene now we can go
through and
HTC travel play work all that stuff not
much like the themes on the HTC One X as
we can see here we do have some themes
on the lg optimus accessed by going on
the home screen options so anyways we go
to our theme we've got Optimus bids cozy
wall marshmallow know what actually is
cool about the LG is that when you
choose a theme it seems the whole entire
thing icon packs your menus your widgets
everything whatsoever we can also change
the font now that's cool about both
phones they each have that on the HTC
we've got our wallpaper style options
here we can just do that by scrolling
here and clicking the wallpaper on the
lg optimus 4x HD we've got to display in
gestures on each go to our gesture
features we have tilt sensitivity we can
now flip devices to stop incoming calls
we can enable our three finger gestures
on the HTC there because we've got our
apps can manage our apps from here as
well we've got some power saving
features on both and of course we have
our developer options because their ice
cream sandwich devices if we go to the
about phone we can see that on the lg
optimus 4x HD we're running Android 403
and then we are also running the Android
403 on the HTC One X here we have the
sense version 4.0 and like I said
earlier we have the Optimus UI version
three pointer on here they're getting
into some of the native features at each
of these phones possess that are really
cool we'll start with the lg optimus 4x
HD pull down the status bar here we can
go to our quick memo now what the quick
memo allows you to do is actually open
itself up drawn any application you're
in no matter what your viewing on the
phone we can actually just use the quick
memo application do this draw anywhere
you want it's all good there we can save
it we can erase and we can share with
people so if we're in a nap want to
create a memo show some people some
stuff send them that on the LG we can
access our recent ass by holding the
home menu that's where we will swipe
them away much like the stock ice cream
sandwich android task manager then on
HTC one x we have our dedicated button
where we can swipe away simply by
flicking upwards takes a little more
time and it's
more tedious but it does have a nicer
user interface this looks pretty cool so
we do have our camera and when we're
just shooting a photo we can click both
are actually pretty fab can access our
camera options on the top here on the
HTC One X choose if we want to use the
main camera or the front-facing camera
got our self timer our image resolution
options video quality options the
duration the white balance video camera
options we've got our settings here on
the LG optimus 4x HD got our flash
brightness focus image size the white
balance of course geo-tagging that's a
recent feature and a lot of phones then
we switch our front facing camera there
then we'd actually have to press this
button to choose whether or not we
wanted to record or to take a picture
while on the HTC One X we can simply
either choose the recorder to take a
picture anyways HTC One X does have the
burst mode that the LG optimus 4x HD is
lacking so web browsing is going to be
basically about the same thing we've got
our controls down here for add bookmark
saved and tabs as well as our menu up
here on the HTC One X where we can
enable flash player and view the desktop
site and we can actually pull up this
tab here on the lg optimus go back and
forward create a new window create a new
tab and then go to our bookmarks up here
is where we have our tab manager where
we can slide to the left and right and
on our tab manager for the HTC One X we
actually can scroll through like this
now they're basically the same web so
it's not worth getting too much each of
these phones are awesome guys i would
suggest checking them out for yourselves
if you're in the market for a high-end
smartphone both are sexy they're
powerful they're fast they're going to
get the job done so stay tuned with
android authority calm guys because is
plenty more where this came from
