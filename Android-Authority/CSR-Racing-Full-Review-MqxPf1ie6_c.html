handy the Android authority app guy do
you like racing games I know I do and in
this video we'll take a much closer look
at a popular and highly rated racing
game called CSR racing when you first
open CSR racing you're greeted by a
chick and immediately begin your first
race the first thing we noticed was how
good everything in this game looked but
we'll talk more about graphics here in a
minute
the gameplay is fairly simple when you
race you must tap on the gas to start at
an optimal rpm then it's a matter of
tapping the shift buttons at the best
time and using Nos once you unlock it
other than that it's just a really
simple drag race down a straight road
one of the best parts is that there is
no turning all you're doing is racing
straight ahead so there is no weird
physics to deal with and while the game
does require good timing it actually
doesn't take that much focus you just
have to wait for the green lights and
then tap your screen while it is based
around racing there's a lot of other
stuff in the game as you earn money and
coins you can purchase upgrades to your
car as well as additional cars and
decals there are a good number of cars
to choose from and they all come in a
variety of colors there's Facebook
integration if you're into that sort of
thing and even a page with all of your
stats ok time to talk about graphics
this is probably one of the best looking
games that we've ever tested the cars
are shiny and gorgeous the tracks and
environments are bright and well done
it's really something that helps it
stand out from the crowd add to that all
the decals all the various car models
that are available in the occasional
change in venue and you've got a game
that's as much fun to look at as it is
to play the sound effects and music
aren't gonna win any awards but frankly
that really doesn't matter that much for
those who do care the sound effects are
accurate and the music is that same old
techno is stuff we've been listening to
in racing games forever so how well does
this game run on the latest generation
of smartphones it runs pretty well we
tested on the Nexus 4 and the HTC One
and the game performed admirably on both
of them we imagine the game will perform
optimally on devices from last year as
well including the HTC One X and the
galaxy s3 other than the graphics
potentially causing problems for older
devices we really couldn't find much
wrong with this game only a few spots of
lag no weird glitches or bugs and no
force closes of course it won't work on
all devices but those with devices that
are somewhat current should be ok here's
what we liked about CSR racing the cars
are gorgeous as are the environments in
which you race them the gameplay is fast
and fun and doesn't require a whole lot
of focus or
there are built-in mechanisms to help
prevent you from playing this game for
hours upon hours and that's probably a
good thing we also like the wide car
selection when you can play a racing
game and even Ford is present that's a
racing game that really cares about
variety nothing against Ford or anything
but it's not every day you race with or
against a Ford Focus here's what we
didn't like the audio in this game is
pretty generic close your eyes and
listen to the soundtrack and sound
effects of this and nine other racing
games and you probably can't tell them
apart no one plays racing games for
music but it would have been nice to
have a little something different this
game also has the quintessential
Facebook flash game mechanics where you
have in-game currency and then currency
you have to buy with real money we
didn't really mind this but we know our
viewers aren't big fans there will be
points where you'll have to grind for
money to upgrade your car so you can
beat bosses and progress in the game
grinding is a natural part of gaming but
that really doesn't make it any more fun
overall considering the game is
free-to-play you really can't go wrong
with CSR racing the pros outweigh the
cons by a lot and it's simple gameplay
and great graphics set it apart from
other racers just don't be afraid to
turn off the music and bring your own
soundtrack this could even spark the
interest of gamers who don't
particularly like racing games obviously
fans of the scene are going to enjoy it
more but if you want something a little
out of your wheelhouse this is the game
we'd recommend you try first in this
genre once again i'm joe hindi the
