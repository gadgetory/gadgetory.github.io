obviously like smartphones a lot it's
what we do every single day we make
videos about it we write about it just
to make content for you but of course
there's a lot more to do with technology
than just smartphones so mean the team
thought that we wanted to put together a
little video just talking about our
favorite technology that we've got in
2018 it can be something that came out
this year is something that we just got
this year that we really love so without
further ado I'm gonna play a few videos
from the rest of the team okay actually
I'm gonna start so my favorite piece of
tech from 2018 is the Fujifilm Instax
share sp2 now actually this didn't
really come out this year this came out
late last year I'm pretty sure and it's
not really a traditional piece of
technology but what it is is a little
printer that you can print photos from
your smartphone from your camera and
they come out as these little Polaroids
so I got this because I travel a lot for
work and then if you follow me on
Instagram or Twitter you probably know
that I really love to do photography so
with this I can just be at a show or
maybe be hiking and I can take a picture
of something and instantly print it out
for someone and just give it to them as
a little gift so I think this has been
the biggest piece of tech that has
changed my life so far this year and
let's move on to the next video I guess
mm AG's been a great year for tech so
picking something that's the best bit of
tech for me is quite hard but I'm going
to go with the graviton armed server
chip from Amazon which you can now use
on there Amazon Web Services I think
that shows a 2019 is going to be the
year of the ARM based chip not in the
smartphone but you think like tablets
and things like servers hey everybody
Joe handy here and to answer the
question I think my favorite tech from
2018 has to be the foldable display
we've hit kind of a snag when it comes
to smartphone design everybody is going
with the glass on metal on glass candy
bar style or reusing old favorites like
the slider or the hardware keyboard with
blackberry foldable displays by contrast
are basically a whole new product
category it's a new form factor and
that's always exciting to see now Royall
got there first but to be honest they're
foldable display looks like a
proof-of-concept rather than an actual
consumer product however Samsung LG and
others have announced that phones are
coming in 2019 and to be honest it makes
look forward to 2019 just a little bit
more so my favorite device this year was
the error ring - this is something that
doesn't a bit different it's less of a
fitness tracker more of a health tracker
it's able to measure things like your
resting heart rate your body temperature
and your heart rate variability which
biohackers and people interest in that
kind of thing we'll know is a really
interesting metric which not many other
devices will measure really good and I'm
really excited to see where they take
this I hope that more manufacturers will
follow suit and create other health
trackers that don't just measure
calories there's more to help with
Fitness than just losing weight and just
a personal side note because it's not an
Android device I also love this thing
the GPD win - it's a full Windows
computer has a keyboard and also a
control pad I'm using it for emulation
with launch box and I've got every Mega
Drive game on here every snez game no I
don't that's illegal I just made that up
it's not true hey there so my favorite
and most used tech of 2018 for one is
the Logitech MX anywhere 2 Mouse I use
this all the time when I'm traveling and
when I'm working I'm really just all the
time period and then also I really love
the jail abs and J buds err true
wireless earbuds it's a long name but I
love that they make true wireless
technology accessible for just I believe
they're still on $50 without cutting too
many corners so yeah I hope you guys
also enjoyed 2018 and we're looking
forward to 2019 Cheers
so rather than talk about super fancy
phones or expensive new groundbreaking
tech I wanted to talk about two products
that I use on the daily that make my
life a lot easier
one of which is this it's the SanDisk
flash drive it's USB CTOs ba use this
all the time for transferring files
between my phone and my laptop but also
filling in full movies for when I get on
a plane another thing I use every day is
this it's a power bank from Anka it's a
five thousand milliamp or I think so
it's a great size but it's also this
nice soft touch material which means it
doesn't matter which way you put your
phone in your pocket it's not gonna
scratch all the screen very easy stuff
never leave home without it because the
battery life on the pixel 3 is not
exactly
fantastic my favorite piece of tech will
probably have to go to the pixel three
XL I know that probably sounds like a
really common answer or really easy
answer but I really enjoyed this phone
it's awesome has great software and a
really really great camera and I'll just
leave it that as far as a non smartphone
related piece of tech I would have to go
with this piece that's behind me this is
the Corsair one pro you've probably seen
it in a bunch of my videos it's not a
product that came out in 2018 but I did
buy this year and it's an awesome gaming
PC so I'm gonna go with this anyway so
that's it thank you guys I'll talk to
you in the next one
hey everybody see Scott Brown here from
Android Authority I wanted to tell you
about my favorite piece of tech from
2018 which has to be the oneplus 60 with
it's in display fingerprint sensor hey
guys
it is Hadley Simons yeah and my product
of the year isn't just a product that's
a product category as well it's the
triple camera smartphone giving us a
unique number of perspectives like the
LGD 40 and my trainee Pro giving us a
normal a wide and a telephoto
perspective which just makes our phones
way more flexible in terms of situations
where you actually get a decent shot it
might not be the best camera experience
out there but it's definitely the most
flexible has gone everyone Adam from
sound guys here and I'm kind of cheating
a bit with this bit because in 2018 a
company called teenage engineering
released something called the opz a
synthesizer that I'm dying to get my
hands on unfortunately I don't have it
yet which has caused me to appreciate
what I do have which is the op1
synthesizing this thing is a joy to use
and you don't have to be a full-blown
producer to figure it out though it did
come out in 2011 so kind of cheating
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
