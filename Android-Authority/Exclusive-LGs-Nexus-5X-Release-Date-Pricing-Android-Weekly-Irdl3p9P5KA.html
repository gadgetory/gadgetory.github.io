brought to you by domain.com that's
right we have some good news regarding
the LG Nexus exclusive to Andrew an
authority or shall I say the LG Nexus X
hmm a source close to the matter has
revealed to us details about Google's
and LG's plans for the next generation
of the Nexus 5 smartphone the source
warned us that this information is not
final and as such official details may
differ as time goes on but we feel very
confident in the veracity of this report
our sources confirm that the new Nexus
will be made available in the Google
Play Store September 29th both the LG
Nexus and the hallway Nexus will be
offered on this date this confirms a
recent report from CNN as well as an
older rumor from Korean media the LG
Nexus will probably go on to the Nexus
5x moniker we say probably because the
decision on the final name has not yet
been done at Google HQ the name makes a
lot of sense however it allows Google to
keep its Nexus naming convention while
signaling that this is a new device in a
much more intuitive fashion than by
adding a 2015 or second-generation
suffix perhaps the most important detail
we glean from our source is the price of
the Nexus 5x the device will be
affordable but not as affordable as the
original Nexus 5 the Nexus 5x will cost
$50 more than the Nexus 5 according to
our source that means we can expect a
starting point of $399 u.s. for the 16
gigabyte model and 449 for the 32
gigabyte model assuming google has
decided to stick with the 16 gigabyte
for the base version so what do you guys
think of that the Nexus 5x curious now
I'm gonna report on Google's new logo
and it's not just about new fonts and
colors google recently announced and I
quote today we're introducing a new logo
and identity family that reflects a new
reality and shows you when Google's
magic is working for you even on the
tiniest of screens as you'll see we've
taken the Google logo and branding which
were originally built for a single
desktop browser page
and updated them for a world of seamless
computing across an endless number of
devices and different kinds of inputs
such as a tap type and talk it doesn't
simply tell you that you're using Google
but also shows you how Google is working
for you for example new elements like a
color for Google Mike help you identify
and interact with Google whether you're
talking tapping or typing meanwhile
we're bidding adieu to the little blue G
icon and replacing it with a four color
G that matches the logo so in my opinion
this isn't just about redesigning for a
mobile first strategy but really
allowing users to know when they are
using Google and not other types of
products now although Josh and lon will
have a lot more to say about the Samsung
gear s2 and s2 classic let's cover
briefly what we know so far both models
of the gear 2 feature the same specs
including a dual-core 1 gigahertz
processor a 1.2 inch circular display
with a resolution of 360 by 360 512
megabytes of RAM 4 gigabytes of storage
an IP 68 dust and water resistance
rating and a Bluetooth 4.0 NFC for
mobile payments and a variety of sensors
such as an accelerometer gyroscope heart
rate monitor ambient light and a
barometer samsung says the 250 milli amp
hour battery will last about 2 to 3 days
and will recharge using wireless
technology as for the controls the gear
s2 offers a rotating bezel as well as a
home and back button for easily dealing
with notifications now as you'd expect
the gear s2 runs on Tizen and that means
you won't have the large library of
Android wear apps but Samsung says they
have a number of built-in apps ready to
go and are working with developers to
quickly expand their app library judging
by their past watches it's likely that
the gear s2 will only be compatible with
select number of Samsung devices with
the Android wear branching out into iOS
territory it's possible Samsung will
broaden the support this time around to
better keep up with the competition now
let's talk about an intriguing new kid
on the block it's called next bit Robin
of course the next bit Robin isn't
actually expected to ship to its first
backers until January or February of
2016 but thankfully we were able to get
a little time with a non
working prototype here at IFA 2015
though next bit borrows familiar
concepts like dual firing fun facing
speakers it manages to do so with a
brand new design language that certainly
looks like nothing else we've seen in
the market today but what about the
specs next but promises a mid to high
range experience backed by a hexa core
snapdragon 808 system on a chip with
three gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of
internal storage other specs include a
5.2 inch 1080p display a 13 megapixel
rear camera a 5 megapixel front camera
and a 2670 milliamp hour battery
sadly the phone offers no microSD card
slot for expansion but instead promises
a unique cloud syncing experience with
100 gigabytes free storage for life
unlike typical cloud backup this system
is smart
at least claims to be and knows when to
push off apps and pics you haven't used
or looked at for a while need to access
them again well next fit claims they can
redownload the information from their
own servers when you need it now this
can only be good news because this
market needs more competition what do
you think would you get a next bit Robin
now I read the comments I get it
I'm listening I really do and some of
you say what's up with all the dot-com
domain names
what's wrong with nad or org good
question a dot-com is like downtown
Harbourfront real estate it's premium
real estate because no domain name
extension tells your story with the same
level of trust as a.com or.net domain
name dot-com and dotnet domain name
extensions and djaq credibility into
your online presence and who doesn't
