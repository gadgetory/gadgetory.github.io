Clayton once again coming at you from an
authority calm today I've got another
case extravaganza for the Galaxy s3
I've got a few hard cases in a few
leather cases and hard bands today so
without further ado let's just check out
the ones I've got lined up we have our
Archon Sports armband for extra large
smartphones now this one's not galaxy s3
specific but it does say that it
protects larger size smartphones from
4.3 to 4.5 inches during workouts now
we've got our lug Simo luxury mobile
leather case for the Samsung Galaxy s3
so one looks really nice and promising
check that one out in a minute we've got
our spigen s GP the I think that says
camana slim pouch case for the galaxy s3
something you want for yell FC s3
progressively designed looks cool got
our case crown leather hard case here
scratch resistant ultra slim slip free
all that good stuff we've got our v post
Samsung mobile case for the galaxy s3
simple stylish design so let's just
check these so this is a V post vogue
case simple stylish designed well well
chose materials of high quality combined
with advanced protection techniques
which can beautify your beloved machine
okay awesome we've actually got some
install installation steps here slider
out of the box
this one's really classy looking this
one's almost like a case made case you
can check out a review of the case made
tough case series this one actually
comes to mind when I think of case mate
this one's really cool though we've got
our logo right here some hard backing
some nice metal accents our cutouts just
pop our galaxy s3 in there and see how
it looks
first off fits really nice we've got our
protection on the sides no protection on
the bottom or top though we do have our
scuse me headphone jack that are cutouts
for the LED the camera and the speaker
here easily accessible power button
easily accessible volume rocker got a
little bit of raised protection but not
too much it's almost flush with the
screen so if you have any uh facedown
impacts you still might get some damage
but the view post is a very nice case
very classy looking it's got style so
pop this one off head on to our next one
here which is our case crown case see
this one's packaged really nice this has
a solid packaging until it's gonna be a
nice nice case for the galaxy s3 just
open her up don't really care if I tear
it so now this one is our case crown
protective case for the Samsung Galaxy
s3 just scratch-resistant
ultra slim slip free has an ergonomic
design says the case come provides
electronic cases of superior designed to
fit every lifestyle by offering
exceptionally unique products of
transcend quality now we've got our QR
code on here if you guys want to pause
the video and snap a pic take you to the
website anyways just pop this out of its
little protective plastic here so it's
really cool it reminds me of an old a
PDA case or something like that I've got
our foam in there this is really nice
got our leather not too weak so it's
classy
so it holds our galaxy s3 in there just
ever so slightly it's not really a snap
fitting design it just kind of cradles
inside this case it is strong though
it's not going to fall out of the case
and we have our top cover to it which
just hooks on like that this one's
really nice this one's classy as well
it's got like a padded design so this
will protect face down and rear drops
not too much protection for the sides
but you still get to see your nice
chrome accents on there you got our
cutouts for our LED our camera and our
speaker and we can flip this open now my
complaint here so it just doesn't Bend
all the way back so if you're gonna be
using your Galaxy s3 you're pretty much
going to have to just hold it and let
this hang there when you're using it
doesn't flip back too much has a lot of
resistance when doing that that's my
only complaint it's a really nice classy
case slide this into your pocket look
sharp next we'll do our spigen case here
this one is the commonness slim pouch
case for the galaxy s3 it's
progressively designed let's open this
one up
see here's the contents of our spigen
case I've got some other promotional
offers inside it's a nice little
pamphlet folios glass all of their stuff
guys can check out their website again
this one has a little foam insert just
to keep it form fit this was just a
pouch just slide your Galaxy s3 in there
it is a nice tight fit very tight this
is going to provide a little bit of
protection if it falls I've got a nice
little clip here a holster or little tab
and we can access our speaker to still
hear our phone ring headphone jack so if
you got this in your pocket you can
still listen to your music no charging
port access and no volume rocker or
power button but what can you expect
this is this is a nice little pouch this
is very classy got some leather on here
and it fits nice you just get your
fingers in there and pull a little
difficult to do that but no big deal
nice case that's our spigen next we're
gonna try out our lug Simo this is the
luxury mobile nice little leather thing
for the samsung galaxy s3
if I'm lucky some old case out here
luxury Mobile's done a nice job of just
making this look classy I love the dual
toned leather you think got some silica
gel in there to preserve them life of
the leather got our black here we've got
our little logo here you can slide our
phone in just like this now it's not
necessarily form-fitting the galaxy s3
kind of sits in there but it still is
nice and classy it's not going to rock
around in there as you can see I'm kind
of shaking it around it's not rocking
anywhere got our holster clip like that
nice strength to that and even put this
through a small belt - it looks like but
the galaxy 3 kind of does rock around in
there because this isn't specifically
made for it
well it is but didn't and the galaxy s3
kind of rocks around in there this is
the galaxy s3 kind of rocks around in
the case it is specifically made for it
but uh still moves around a little this
one's a nice classy one though I like
this good to show off your side your
Galaxy s3 cinema nice finally we'll get
into our Archon generic large armband
for extra-large smartphones it's open
this one up this one's going to be nice
if you guys work out and take your
Galaxy s3 to the gym now we do have our
armband here
adjustable stretchy fit our galaxy s3 in
here yeah we slider in and it looks like
it fits just about right here on the
bottom still have our camera exposed but
we can take the lip from the top put it
over and we've got full coverage this
really is a nice fit now some of the
plastic here might stick I've got a
screen protector on my galaxy s3 so
that's why we're getting these air
bubbles but it's just fine you can still
hit your power menu from out here now if
you try but you won't
you can still touch even still have
access to your phone through the case
it's really nice you can strap this
along your arm it's got velcro you just
strap this on when you're working out
you can run with it you can even just
wear it for the heck of it you tighten
that up your Galaxy s3 on your arm it's
not necessarily upper arm there but uh
fits nice really cool design I like this
even though it's not specifically made
for the galaxy s3 you're gonna have a
little bit of a hard time getting the
Samsung Galaxy s3 out of this one just
for the simple fact that the case
material on the front sticks to the
screen a little bit but it's still
pretty nice so I pick one of these cases
up if you want some extra protection and
you want to look sharp while doing it so
anyways guys stay tuned Android 30.com
we've got a heck of a lot more always so
tune in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
