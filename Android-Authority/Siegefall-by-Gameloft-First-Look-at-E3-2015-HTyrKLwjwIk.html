Android authority and we are still here
at e3 we just got here III actually and
we're hanging out with Gameloft and we
got a chance to check out a few of their
games today and I just wanted to give
you my reactions on the games we got a
chance to play with them won the first
game there's like three different games
with the first game which was siege fall
and this was the game that we got to get
a little bit more experience with we got
to play and also get a lot of video for
it so we'll be able to show it to you
guys
but I just want to talk a little bit
about the game and the experience and
when I first started playing it I was
able to play for about five to ten
minutes or so and I got through the
tutorial and a couple of the missions
throughout the game and when I just
first started playing it the the thing
that I immediately sort of referenced it
to was clash of clans and there's a lot
of games out there that are like that
where it's very you have a base that you
build and you upgrade weapons you
upgrade your defenses and you also can
attack other players or attack in
missions rather and sort of gain things
like loot and also be able to sort of
build yourself up as an as an attacker
and just get better at the game and
start advancing the same way that you
would in a game like clash of clans or
any other sort of medieval type game or
like game of war things like that it
also kind of plays into people's
different you know I'm kind of good just
go attack fire dragon boulders kind of
thing um whereas I have friends who are
very attacked oh they're like I'm gonna
sit back here I'll just let my siege
equipment go and do all the work show
you their tactics yeah let me throw down
a Hugh
okay so it's very similar to those type
of games and you can also gain different
abilities like spells and potions to
sort of make your troops more efficient
at attacking and you also get heroes as
well and the heroes are really cool
because they're basically just a bigger
version of the troops that you have
they're a lot more powerful so you can
send them in and attack the more meteor
parts of the base the more powerful
parts of the base so you can basically
sort of use them as a meat shield and
really also take out the base a lot
quicker and more efficiently and you
also have your all of your other troops
and there's just a ton of different
things you can do with this game as far
as upgrades and defenses so you have
various different weapons like Archer
towers mortars and you can build walls
to sort of upgrade your base and make it
a lot stronger so there will be some
in-app purchases they're gonna be
centered around gyms which are used in
the game approp really two purposes
that's one is either to speed up when
you're doing building okay or two is
really to kind of instant upgrade
something again it's very similar to
clash of clans so you can use these gems
the gems that you collect from attacking
you can use these gems to upgrade your
base a lot quicker if you don't want to
spend the time waiting on those upgrades
so you know so it reminds me a lot of
other you know base type games like this
so it's a really awesome game I thought
it was fantastic and it's really cool
the graphics look really good on it so
it was a lot of fun playing the game
even though I only played it for you
know five to ten minutes a very cool
game there was gonna be a multiplayer
aspect too as well where you can attack
other players which is going to be
really cool
but I was only able to check out sort of
the the single-player and the missions
and there are a ton of different
missions that you can check out so
basically this game can be played for a
pretty long pretty long amount of time
it's very lengthy game which is which is
really great to see some of the aspects
of the game we weren't able to exactly
show off because the game is not
completely a hundred finished I kind of
want to jump into a couple the other
games that we were able to check out so
the first one
was minion rush so if you're a
despicable me fan you'll definitely like
this game it's basically a runner type
game sort of like Temple Run or the
spider-man unlimited game where you're
basically just running down a straight
path and you're actually racing against
other players so it is a multiplayer
game and you also get weapons basically
because everybody's running at that all
the minions are running at the same
speed so you have weapons to basically
sort of give you give yourself a boost
in sort and in terms of getting ahead of
the other player so you have offensive
weapons and defensive weapons so you can
use these weapons to slow the enemy down
or sort of basically knock them out so
you can get ahead of them and that kind
of adds another level of a little
another dimension to your basic run or
game it makes it a little bit different
because some runner games are really
basic where you're just basically just
running and jumping but with the minion
rush game you have the ability to attack
and also defend yourself from from
people trying to get ahead of you so it
was actually a pretty fun game and we
also got to check out brothers in arms'
the multiplayer version so a lot of
people have been clamoring for a
multiplayer version of this game and
it's finally going to be coming so
you're gonna be able to jump in and do
free-for-alls and team death matches
things like that and that seemed pretty
cool as well we weren't able to really
extensively play it because we didn't
have a multiplayer server to sort of
test it on we were just able to sort of
run around a little bit on the map and
just kind of shoot the gun things like
that and crouch and kind of just play
around on the map but we weren't
actually able to play against other
players so again it's just you know it's
very early in the development right now
but these are really awesome games that
are coming out of game loft so make sure
to keep keep make sure to stay tuned for
what's to come from them they have some
really amazing games coming out I had a
lot of fun testing them out they're
great games so but that's really it who
we're still here at e3 just hanging out
checking out some more stuff so
definitely let us know if there's
anything that you guys want to see and
again thank you so much for watching
keep it tuned here to Android Authority
because we are your source for all thing
