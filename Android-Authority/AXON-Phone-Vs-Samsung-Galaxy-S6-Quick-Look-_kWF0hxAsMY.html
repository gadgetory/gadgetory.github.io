Android authority and the axon phone is
a powerhouse of a phone on the spec
sheet but how does it compare to one of
the best flagships on the market right
now this is your quick look of the axon
phone versus the Samsung Galaxy s6 it's
not too often that we see smaller OMS go
head-to-head on the design front with
major smartphone makers like Samsung but
that's exactly what we're witnessing
today placing form over functionality
Samsung really ramped up its design
language with the galaxy s6 making it
one of the most attractive smartphones
on the market with that said the brand
new axon phone may give it a run for its
money when it comes to design although
these are both extremely premium feeling
devices it's easy to spot the
differences between the two right away
the axon phone features an industrial
design language thanks to its sleek
metal body and unique front facing
speaker grills this device does its best
to offer up a heavy duty aesthetic
without sacrificing its classy look and
feel which will translate well for those
in search of the best of both worlds
while it doesn't feature too many design
elements that help it stand out from the
crowd the axon phone is still a really
great-looking device that will probably
catch the eyes of many consumers out
there on the other hand the s6 is one of
the best design smartphones Samsung has
ever produced thanks to its aluminum
frame that surrounds two panels of
Gorilla Glass 4 there's no mistaking
that this is a Samsung device through
and through largely due to the tactile
home button up front which is flanked by
the typical capacitive recent apps and
back buttons both of these devices feel
very substantial in the hand although
the axial on phone is clearly the larger
of the two and pretty much every
dimension much like comparing the latest
from Samsung would say the all-metal HTC
One m9 your decision to go with either
phone will depend a lot on which
material you like better metal or glass
both the ax on phone and the Galaxy S
six offer up an impressive quad HD
resolution display but the galaxy s6 may
be the one for you if you're looking for
a more compact form factor featuring a
5.1 inch
play with a pixel density of 577 PPI
Samsung's offering comes with a Super
AMOLED panel that might entice more
users with its vivid colors and great
viewing angles but for those who are
looking for a bigger display the axon
phone will do the trick with its 5.5
inch TFT LCD panel even though this
device is 534 PPI isn't quite as high as
the pixel density found on the s6 we'd
still wager to say that the axon phone
will be a great option for viewing
videos and playing games when it comes
to under the hood specification
samsung's s6 really impressed us thanks
to its in-house Exynos 7420 processor
with three gigs of ram performance has
been absolutely fantastic with this
device especially when it comes to
switching between apps gaming and web
browsing on the other hand the ax on
phone feels really fast as well
it comes with a Snapdragon 810 CPU
backed by a massive four gigs of RAM
along with the popular Adreno 430 GPU
performance seems great so far and the
stock like software experience is
definitely a contributing factor both
devices feature non-removable batteries
and in samsung's case this has proven to
be quite the downfall the s6 only
features a 25 50 milliamp hour cell
which has failed to impress us in our
time with the handset obviously we'll
need to spend some time with the axon
phone to test battery life in full but
the larger 3000 milliamp hour unit has
was feeling hopeful where the galaxy s6
gets the leg up is in storage now that
one of these phones comes with microSD
card expansion but the axon phone only
comes in a 32 gigabyte configuration
which may not be enough for some people
whereas the galaxy s6 you have the
option of 32 64 and 128 gigabytes so if
you need more storage to galaxy s6 is
definitely the way to go and because of
the axons phones metal chassis wireless
charging isn't supported however if
you're looking for that added
convenience the s6 supports both PMA and
chief standards the galaxy s6 boasts one
of the best smartphone cameras on the
market thanks to its crystal clear 16
megapixel rear facing shooter with
optical image stabilisation it
consistently produces clear
well-balanced images both indoors and
out the camera app is quick simple and
offers up tons of
controls for those who'd like to tinker
with each shot the axon phone on the
other hand comes with a 13 megapixel
rear shooter and interestingly enough
features a secondary two megapixel lens
just like the One m8 from a couple years
ago the dual lens helps to capture depth
information provide for faster autofocus
and the ability to refocus shots after
the fact with an aperture of f-18 the
axon phone should be really great in low
light and that's something we'll be
really eager to test out with the
software the galaxy s6 runs android 5.1
lollipop with Samsung's TouchWiz UI on
top and it's actually very pleasant to
use Samsung toned down its software
experience with the s6 which not only
helps with the device's performance but
also gives the user an all-around better
experience with the device there are
still a boatload of Samsung's software
features built-in that many users might
not be too fond of but this new version
of TouchWiz is still the best Samsung
has ever put out
in contrast the axon phone really
couldn't be any more different from a
Samsung handset it runs android 5.1.1
lollipop out of the box with a near
stock android experience there are a few
pre installed applications like argos
and roc my run for tracking your fitness
and a few extra features but the
interface does a really great job of
preserving Google's material design
aesthetics so far the software
experience has been speedy and easy to
use and will probably be a more
attractive option for those looking for
a simpler user interface with the axon
phone packing so much great hardware
inside and out it's going to naturally
be compared to many of the major
flagships out there especially the ones
who have made a name for themselves and
it's going to be very interesting to see
how axon fares from this point forward
