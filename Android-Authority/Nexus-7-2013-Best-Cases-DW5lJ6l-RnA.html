name is Kevin aka the tech ninja and
today I'm gonna talk to you about Nexus
7 cases over the past few weeks I've
tried out the top-selling cases and I
determined my top 5 list so today I'm
gonna show you each case give you the
pros and cons and also let you know what
my favorite cases get ready what is the
first thing you do when you get a new
device if you're anything like me you
get a new case to protect your
investment well today we're gonna talk
about the Nexus 7 2013 edition and
compare the top cases in a showdown
first up we have the official Nexus 7
folio case that was released in October
of 2013 the case comes in a few
different colors and is wrapped in a
denim fabric it has precise cutouts and
it's beautifully stitched the cover
folds back and slips under the flap and
it has two fixed angles one is
completely vertical and the other is
more of a traditional 45-degree angle
the vertical angle is not stable at all
and can be easily knocked down with
normal screen tabs this case is not a
smart cover so it will not wake your
device and put it to sleep automatically
also it does not have a hinge so the
cover sometimes comes open when holding
the case or transporting it the part of
the case that holds your tablet into
place is a soft plastic edges does not
come out beyond the bezel to maintain a
sleek look the tablet fits snug into the
case and overall looks and feels premium
this case can be purchased from Google
Play for $50 plus tax and shipping the
second case that I'll cover is the
official travel cover and this two comes
in several different colors the case is
made out polymer and it feels flimsy in
your hand the initial reaction when
holding the case does not invoke an
emotion of high quality and the tablet
does not feel secure once inside and
it's somewhat transparent when the
screen is on you can actually see and
make out text right through the cover
the cutouts
are precise and the buttons are fully
covered but it does feel a bit mushy
well it never stops you from pressing a
button all the way but it just feels
kind of weird while
doing it the price is $15 and it can be
purchased from pretty much any major
retailer online next up is the poetic
graph grip case this case is made out of
silicone and has a square edging on the
back but I feel the cutouts are too
large for example when looking at the
camera you see the lens and you can see
some of the back of the device not a
game killer but something worth
mentioning this comes in an array of
different colors and the texture on the
back really allows the case to be easily
gripped it also provides a great grip
when setting the device on a flat
surface and this also provides
shockproof protection if it is dropped
the edges come above the bezel to
protect the screen if it were laying
facedown
although the buttons are covered they do
provide for an easy press this case
provides great protection and allows for
easy access to all the ports and buttons
this case is not as bulky as other shock
protection cases and I'm sure you do
give back some of the durability this is
a great mix between protection and
portability the fourth case is another
poetic case this one is the poetic
revolution this is a three part case
solution the inner layer is a hard shell
with a kickstand the second part is a
screen protector and a plastic bezel and
the third part is a silicon gel there's
a lot going on with this case but just
like the previous case the cuts are in a
correct location but they're just a tad
large and this does affect the way the
case looks also there's a cutout for the
kickstand that allows you to such device
on portrait or landscape the hinge is
thin metal and is very flimsy I like to
see how long this will really last with
heavy use the screen protector does
provide a layer of protection but I do
feel gets in the way of screen
responsiveness the screen protector
itself is flimsy and it also gets dirty
easily even after a few days of usage
the screen protector looks terrible and
it's pretty much useless to me the
silicone gel protects the outer layer of
the case and it has covers for all the
ports on the nexus it covers the
headphone jacks and also the charging
port
the only cutouts that stay exposed are
the speakers when it's all together does
provide protection for the device and it
feels snug is secure the silicone does
feel a bit slick and the screen
protector really makes it frustrating to
use the fifth and sixth cases are
exactly the same case made by
to manufacturers these are the moko case
and the blue Rex case what's the
difference well the moko case has a MOCA
logo on it and the blue X does not and
that's it these cases use a full other
material and a velvet type of material
for the inside these cases also come in
several different colors all the ports
are precisely cut out in are they
accurate size when the case is closed it
has a part that sort of juts out and
locks it into place also it has a band
that you can wrap around to ensure the
case will not come open in the event of
a drop unlike all the other cases I've
covered in this review these cases have
a magnet built into it to automatically
wake and put your tablet to sleep just
by closing or opening the flap to set
the tablet up to dock you need to remove
the bottom half of the case and pull the
tablet forward the bottom part of the
case has grooves on it so you can easily
stand your tablet up the way it handles
docking sounds confusing but it really
works and I think this provides
functionality of a slim case and also
provides the functionality of a larger
folio case alright so I picked the moko
and the blue Rex case because for me the
portability the functionality and the
durability was top-notch and you can get
it for less than $15 now for you
you may have different needs you may
want a different case I just picked the
top cases that I could find that have
sold the most so they're all pretty good
cases in their own regards as always
