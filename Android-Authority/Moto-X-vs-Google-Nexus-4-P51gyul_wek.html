should soon be on all major US carriers
so we're going to pit it against some of
the top tier devices available today and
this time we're going to compare it to
what is probably its closest competitor
hey it's Joshua regard from Android
thority what's going on everybody
and this is the Moto X versus the Google
Nexus 4 when it comes to design these
two devices are very similar in their
philosophies both come with 4.7 inch
screens that ultimately make them easier
to handle than many of the 5-inch screen
devices out now of course the Nexus 4 by
LG did come out before the 5 inch screen
craze so that better explains its design
choices made pretty much completely of
glass the Nexus 4 is easily gripa bowl
and manipulable in one hand and the
plastic spine keeps things from feeling
too slippery all around the back is
fully glass with the Nexus designation
on top of LG's crystal reflection
pattern design though the glass
durability might have been questioned in
the past there is no doubt that this is
one of the nicest phones available in
the hand you get what can be described
as a refreshing ly easier feel due to
the smaller size than most of today's
phones it is completely flat on all
sides which does give it also a level of
rigidity but that flatness was exactly
what moto wanted to alleviate when they
designed the X while the sporting a size
that is similar to the Nexus 4 the X is
actually a little bit thinner narrower
and sports a curved back that was
deliberately added in for better
ergonomics the result is a phone that is
even easier to handle in one hand if the
Nexus 4 was one of the last big releases
of the 4.7 inch game the Moto X has
gotten closer to perfecting that design
is pretty much the same phone all around
with the fully black front and what the
pattern design on the back that this
time isn't holographic it's clear that
Google's acquisition of Motorola
Mobility has given way to real Nexus
inspiration from Moto's latest offering
and of course the Moto X trump card is
its Moto maker platform that allows you
to fully customize the look of your
phone this is probably the closest
comparison we'll be seeing when
considering design the Nexus 4 is still
one of the best devices in its size
market but the Moto X takes those same
philosophies and makes them even better
so its plastic versus glass essentially
oh but if you want some individuality of
core
the Moto X as customization options make
it much more appealing than the
all-black and quite frankly short-lived
white version of D Nexus 4 ultimately
however you'll get the very similar
experience either way here but the Moto
X with its curved back and slightly
smaller overall profile may prove a
little bit more comfortable the trend of
having close comparisons continues with
the displays both of these phones book
the 1080p screen trend by packing 720p
displays ok to be fair the Nexus 4 does
come with a 1280 by 768 screen so in
reality it does pack just a few more
pixels all around it also has a slightly
higher pixel density at 318 PPI this is
basically due to a slightly fatter
screen compared to the Moto X as an IPS
screen brightness is really the Forte
here but that doesn't mean the colors
suffer the Nexus 4 does a great job with
the saturation still despite not having
the same level as the AMOLED that is
found on the Moto X the AMOLED screen on
the Moto X was again a deliberate choice
for moto as the active notifications
take advantage of completely disabled
pixels for battery saving on paper it is
outclassed by the Nexus 4 by just a hair
but there is in reality really no
perceivable difference I did notice that
despite having a more saturated profile
when it comes to color the AMOLED screen
does then take on a slightly warmer
overall tone compared to the Nexus 4's
IPS screen it's as if there's like a
small hue that's covering everything on
the screen but it does join alongside
the Nexus 4 as another great example of
how 1080p screens are great but perhaps
not really a necessity
despite their subtle differences it
really comes down to the Moto X taking
advantage of that AMOLED screen by
having the ability to activate only some
pixels the screen allowed for Motorola
to create the peeking active
notification feature that honestly is
pretty damn great in the end both
screens provide the same kind of
performance and easy to manipulate sizes
so there's plenty to enjoy though both
of these devices employ largely the same
processing packages it was motorola that
found a way of optimizing the Snapdragon
s4 pro that is still holding up even
today coupled with the s4 pro in the
Moto X is the audrina 320 and then a
dedicated pair of processors that govern
voice recognition they do help to
lighten the load on the s4 pro and
despite not pleasing many spec hungry
it really is just a crime to disregard
the Moto X solely on what processor it
uses because this thing is really that
blazingly fast I never fail to WoW
anyone with this quick little
multitasking demo while the graphics
processing might eventually get bogged
down by future gaming demands by daily
standards it's by far one of the
snappiest experiences available despite
not having the additions and
optimizations put in by Motorola the
standalone s4 pro and Adreno 320 package
of the Nexus 4 is still no slouch it
does have a slight pause and delay in
comparison to the Moto X but the Nexus 4
remains very smooth and is still one of
the most reliable experiences out there
in all reality the Moto X is just faster
than the Nexus 4 but that doesn't mean
that the a more affordable Google
official phone should easily be
disregarded for what are essentially to
Google fide phones Hardware offerings
remain pretty simple both of these
phones come with the usual bevy of
connectivity tools like GPS Bluetooth
and NFC the Moto X does come with more
storage at stock with sixteen gigabytes
over the eight gigabytes of the base
model Nexus 4 the speaker on the Moto X
is not only louder than that of the
Nexus 4 it's sound is actually a little
bit fuller and a little richer the voice
recognition enhancements of by Motorola
called for more microphones all around
the Moto X one on top one on the bottom
front and one on the bottom back and all
of them are always working waiting for
your voice and your voice only to tell
it what to do but that in a couple other
moto enhancements are the focus in the
software and camera sections and share
hardware however it's mostly a storage
war for both of these phones since they
offer pretty much the same things under
the hood the battery situation is
another neck-and-neck race as the Moto X
offers only 100 more milliamp hours than
the twenty one hundred million power
unit found in the Nexus 4 what does
matter here are the battery saving
features of the Moto X yes this does
involve just a simple battery saving
option that you can turn on and off in
the settings but also the additional
cores that govern specific functions and
the AMOLED powered active notifications
in my experience I've been able to get
all the way to bedtime with 30 percent
battery life still available far more
consistently with the Moto X than what
the Nexus 4 for moderate to somewhat
heavy usage you'll get a whole day's
worth easily either
and here come the cameras while the
Nexus 4 offers 8 megapixel optics you
get a couple more in the Moto X the apps
remain pretty much the same either way
with their offerings as Google usually
keeps things pretty simple
the Nexus 4's app interface uses an
arched touch and swipe interface that is
very minimalistic and does include HDR
and photosphere picture quality is
perfectly usable but doesn't really pop
out like the pictures of some of today's
better cameras shutter to file speeds
though are quite good so you can easily
rack up a lot of pictures in a short
time the Moto X unfortunately doesn't
really reach the level of today's best
13 megapixel shooters the app is also
very simple
utilizing swipes to access menus and
includes slow-motion video as the
replacement for the photosphere you can
also access the camera using the quick
capture feature in which flicking the
phone a few times opens the app picture
quality is actually the main detractor
here as colors end up pretty muted and
don't often accurately reproduce the
vibrancy of any given scene it's pretty
disappointing really but I will say that
pictures and videos come out much
sharper here than those that come from
the Nexus floor so in hindsight you
could always do some post-processing if
you really want to make those colors pop
in the end it comes down to color or
sharpness as the differentiators here
but with similar apps and equally just
on par performance this camera choice is
pretty much a toss-up finally we have
the software since Motorola joined
Google their software became decidedly
more stock like and Motorola's Editions
didn't change the general feel very much
the Nexus 4 does get the advantage of
getting updates before the Moto X but
the Moto X isn't far behind with its
4.2.2 you get the standard home screens
notification drop-down in shade and
Google now
but then Motorola added in their
voice-activated feature that you can use
by just saying okay Google now if you
were already used to opening Google now
and then saying google to activate it
while this is a way of streamlining that
process that actually works wonderfully
active notifications are honestly an
enhancement to the standard notification
light and is great at giving you a quick
glimpse at what you need in the end you
have the stock Android experience we all
known and loved pretty much either way
but Motorola has done a great job of
adding more practical features to really
sweeten the pot
now here's where things get interesting
while the Moto X is being touted as
Motorola's flagship device the Nexus 4
was the reference for many of the future
smartphones that came after it
but while the Moto X costs of $1.99 on a
contract and potentially over $500
unlocked the 8 gigabyte Nexus 4 just
recently got a discount making it a $200
phone unlocked
that's an incredible price for a phone
that quite frankly does do much of what
the Moto X offers and so there yeah I
can see why people saw the Moto X
specifications and wondered how it could
even dare considering itself a top-tier
device and you know what the Nexus 4 is
the reason why both of these phones
employ many of the same tools and specs
to achieve plenty of the same functions
so the lower price overall of the Nexus
4 is what makes it the same attractive
package it has always been but it's been
a year and Motorola has been able to
take what the Nexus 4 proved and made it
even better
it is really closer to perfecting what
Google set out to do with the original
Nexus and achieves that with flying
colors you'll definitely get your
money's worth taking advantage of all
that Motorola put into the Moto X
however at such an affordable price the
Nexus 4 is still very tough to beat so
this particular comparison is probably
better considered a tie more than
anything else if you still haven't
