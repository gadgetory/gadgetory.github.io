and this is our review of the jewel
model of the Huawei watch this is a
Huawei watch and yeah this is the same
watch reviewed months back but Huawei
has just recently released two new
designs for it what I have here is a
jewel rose gold stainless steel Huawei
watch and if you look closely you can
see that the watch is encrusted with 68
1.5 millimeter Swarovski zirconia stones
the other model is also a stainless
steel rose gold watch but instead of
these stones you just have the steel
case with a knurled pattern top ring and
of course anybody can wear these new
watches and they look fantastic but
Huawei definitely had women in mind when
designing these especially with the
thinner 18 millimeter leather straps
versus a 21 millimeter ones on their
previous designs but that being said
these new designs bring larger
dimensions when it comes to the watch
itself we have a 44 millimeter diameter
over the other models 42 millimeter
diameter there's also a boost in
thickness jumping from eleven point
three millimeters to twelve point forty
five millimeters but these larger
dimensions actually help this elegant
design adding more space for a larger
number of stones like all Huawei watches
you have a beautiful unboxing experience
while we really treat our watches like
real jewelry instead of a cool gadget as
they should because after all these are
accessories that we wear and become part
of how we look the Box Springs open and
greets you with the wash sitting with in
the soft fuzzy velvet interior and the
words timeless design smart within are
also printed at the top pulling up on
these little gold handles gives you
access to some paperwork with the
charging dock and cable underneath the
first thing you'll notice when pulling
out the watch itself is just like the
previous designs we have a round display
as opposed to a square one is the
direction lots of smart watches are
going now and even though that makes
viewing some content a little harder to
see it's by far the best-looking design
in my opinion the crown is positioned
for easy access around the 2 o'clock
position and although it can row
it only functions when you press down on
it to turn the display on or off or
long-press taking you to settings the
dual version of the watch usually comes
with a blue Italian leather strap while
the elegant version comes with the white
one however on the model I'm using we
were given the white leather strap with
a snakeskin pattern which I love and
like I said before the band is smaller
than the other models at 18 millimeters
putting a bigger emphasis on the watch
itself and it makes it very comfortable
on my wrist but the big eye catcher here
is a jewels that surround the top ring
there are 68 1.5 millimeter Swarovski
zirconia stones that make this one of
the most flashy and luxurious looking
watches on the market right now
they sparkle no matter what lighting
condition you're in and will definitely
cause some people to turn their heads
this ring around the frames is pretty
high up as it borders the screen making
the display appear sunken in which might
look a little strange to some it also
makes it a tad bit more difficult to
pull in menus with your finger we
thought the Huawei watch was a very
stylish and flashy watch to begin with
but the extra Flair you get with the
crystals it takes it to a whole new
level and it emphasizes our original
concerns with the watch which is it can
be hard to match with certain outfits
and occasions like when you're going to
the gym or something it may seem a
little out of place in those situations
but that being said I love the design
and I think the jewel version of the
rose gold Huawei watch is the most
luxurious SmartWatch on the market apart
from the design we're looking at the
exact same spec sheet as a while we
watch released a few months ago you have
a snapdragon 400 with 512 megabytes of
RAM and for a watch that's really all
you're going to need the watch is very
snappy with smooth animations and that's
all you can really ask for a standout
feature for the Huawei watch is this
AMOLED display there's no better use for
an AMOLED display than using it for a
watch the majority of your day the watch
will be in ambient mode displaying a
black background with the white outline
of your watch face this not only looks
gorgeous with the blacks being true
black but it preserves a lot of battery
as probably only 10% of the pixels are
actually lighting up underneath the
Huawei watch is running on Android wear
of course which is a fantastic operating
system for a SmartWatch what's great is
that no matter what type of Android
watch you're wearing this software is
mostly
technical you can select your watch face
customize them or even download new ones
from google play and when new
notifications arrive on your phone
they'll also be pushed to your watch or
you can look at them at a glance swipe
them away or swipe to the left to
interact with them there's a pulldown
menu for certain settings and swiping to
the left while on the clock brings up
apps contacts and Google now it's very
simple and it's a great way to know 100%
of the time what's going on in your
pocket but our biggest gripe with the
watch is its absence of an ambient light
sensor users will have to micromanage
their watches brightness setting it to
either one two three four or five
because there's no auto mode on the
watch which can make it blinding bright
when in low-light areas while we says
that their watch lasts you a day and a
half to two full days of life with this
three hundred milli amp hour battery but
it's closer to a day and a half for us
which still means you'll be charging to
watch every night but once again that's
all you can really ask for at the moment
included in the box is a magnetic
charging platform for easy charging and
although it's magnetic you still have to
make sure the watch's charging
connectors actually line up correctly
and snap into place
it's very easy for the wash to not
properly align to this connector leaving
you with a dead watch to start your day
also unlike some watches like the Moto
360 you don't have a night clock
displaying as you charge which is a
little unfortunate still though between
the beautiful AMOLED display and the
elegant crystals that surround it this
watch is in a class of its own it's the
most luxurious looking SmartWatch on the
market it's very flashy which will trace
some users away but for us women out
there we finally have a SmartWatch that
was designed with us in mind sure these
Swarovski zirconia stones make this
watch pretty pricey at 599 dollars but
that makes sense if you want something a
little less showy you can go with the
new elegant model without the crystals
that's $100 cheaper even if I'm losing a
few features with the Huawei watch the
new designs make it totally worth it and
that is it for this review thank you
