Authority and today we're taking a
second look at the Nexus 6p we've
already reviewed this device which was
very nicely done by Josh but it never
hurts to have a second opinion so let's
go ahead and get into my personal
thoughts and opinions on the Nexus 6p so
I'm going to try to keep this as short
and sweet as I possibly can and not get
too in-depth with all these super
technical stuff but if you want to know
everything you could possibly want to
know about the Nexus 6p make sure to
check out the full review also keep in
mind that many of the things that I said
about the Nexus 5x in my 5x review will
also be echoed here with the Nexus 6p
simply because there are certain things
that they have in common with that being
said I've been a huge fan of the Nexus
line for a very long time and I've owned
every single Nexus phone since the
Galaxy Nexus I have to say that the 6p
is easily the best Nexus phone Google
has ever released and it's made by
Huawei
a company I never anticipated to make a
Nexus device it all starts with the
build the all metal unibody design is
absolutely fantastic
it feels solid in the hand and even
though the body is made entirely of
metal it doesn't have that slippery feel
that some other metal phones do because
the sides are flat with chamfered edges
which really helps with the grip it is a
pretty tall phone and it's actually
slightly taller than last year's Nexus 6
but it's nowhere near as wide which
makes it 6p a lot easier for me to wrap
my hands around and it's generally a
more manageable one-handed experience I
also really like the visor on the back
that houses the camera and flash it's
one of those things that looks a lot
better in person than it does and
renders and photos it doesn't protrude
as much as you might initially think and
overall it gives the 6p a unique look
from what would otherwise be a pretty
standard smartphone design the screen as
you may already know is a 5.7 inch
AMOLED display with quad HD resolution
and it's a very gorgeous looking panel I
personally prefer AMOLED displays mainly
due to the deeper blacks vibrant colors
and high contrast ratios so I'm glad
they stuck with it for the 6p and I've
always felt that AMOLED screens suited
Nexus phones a lot Ben
as it blends in extremely well with the
clean black front it's very bright very
vivid and it's great for playing games
and watching YouTube which I tend to do
quite a bit on my mobile devices I know
not everyone is a fan of larger screen
sizes on smartphones but for me it's a
perfect fit for the way I use my devices
performance has been really good as well
it's got a Snapdragon 810 with three
gigs of ram and the 6p just flies
through everything it doesn't matter
what I throw at it this phone never lags
or stutters it's extremely responsive
and smooth from general everyday tasks
to gaming multitasking and video
watching it is by far the most fluid
experience I've ever had on an Android
device and of course the fact that it
runs a pure vanilla Android experience
with no additional bloatware or skin to
bog things down certainly makes a huge
difference one of my favorite features
on the Nexus 6p has to be the
front-facing speakers they really top
off the media experience they're
extremely loud the sound quality is
fantastic and they can definitely give
something like HTC's boomsound a run for
its money I'm a huge fan of front-facing
speakers on smartphones and it still
boggles my mind why more flagship
devices don't have this but I'm glad
this is something the 6p carried over
from last year's Nexus 6 new to the
Nexus line this year is the addition of
a fingerprint reader on the back and it
didn't really surprise me too much
considering I already had prior
experience with Nexus imprint on the 5x
it's just as fast and accurate as it was
on the 5x and even though you can't
unlock your phone when it's sitting on a
desk I'm still generally a fan of the
rear placement your finger just
naturally gravitates to that point on
the phone and you can have your phone
out of your pocket and unlock before it
even reaches your face battery life is
pretty much all day every day it's only
on days when I heavily game on it that
I'm able to kill it before the day is
over but otherwise it gets me through a
full day with no problems on those days
where I'm using the 6p a lot heavier
than normal I can just plug it in for
about fifteen to thirty minutes and get
some decent battery life back into it
thanks to the built-in fast charging the
6p and the 5x share the same exact
camera sensor and image processing and
if you saw my 5x review then you know
exactly how I feel about this camera
it's a really great camera and with so
many smart phones that came out this
year with awesome
cameras Google really couldn't have
picked a better time to finally get the
camera right it takes excellent photos
and virtually every lighting condition
including low-light it would have been
nice to have Oh a s not only for
low-light purposes but also for more
stable footage one recording video but
the larger pixel size definitely more
than makes up for the lack of OAS when
it comes to low-light or nighttime shots
one of the biggest reasons why I've
always been a huge fan of Nexus devices
is because of the software and there's
not really much I can probably say here
that you don't already know but the 6p
is running Google's latest Android
marshmallow and it is by far the best
version of Android yet I'm not just
saying that because it's the newest
version of Android out there either
marshmallow feels extremely polished
mostly because that's what this update
was about lollipop was great for the
material design but it had a lot of
problems and marshmallow fixed all of
that among many other things you've got
doze for better battery life in standby
user defined app permissions contextual
search results with now on tap and
revamped volume controls which were more
or less broken on lollipop this isn't to
say that marshmallow is perfect or
anything because features like now on
tap still need a lot of work as it can
be rather inconsistent at times but in
the grand scheme of things this was a
much needed update to improve the user
experience so overall I love the Nexus
6p and Google definitely hit it out of
the ballpark this year I would recommend
this phone to anyone who is a fan of the
Nexus line or just a fan of Android in
general Google and Huawei built a phone
that can finally compete with the best
Android flagships out there because
unlike previous Nexus phones no corners
were cut this year if you want the best
Android experience like Google has to
offer
check out the Nexus 6p and I think
you'll be plenty happy if you do as
