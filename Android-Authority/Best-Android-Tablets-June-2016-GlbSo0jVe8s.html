Android tablets your cheddar can buy now
right at the top of our list may
surprise you the pixel see a Google
in-house built tablet that's made for
productivity well maybe a tad overpriced
the pixel see does a lot right it comes
with a big 10.2 inch display a 34-point
2 watt hour battery and Android 6.0
marshmallow all powered by NVIDIA Tegra
x1 processor and three gigabytes of RAM
there are quite a few different official
accessories available for the tablet too
like the official keyboard or a folio
keyboard the pixel see is a bit
overpriced for what it offers though
it's still a great tablet if you have
the extra money to spend it's available
from the Google Play Store starting at
$4.99 us with official accessories
adding an extra $149 to your purchase
now let's talk the Nexus 9 and while it
is a little dated at this point the
Nexus 9 is still a great Android tablet
it was created by Google and built by
HTC which is basically an Android lovers
dream it runs the latest version of
Android and will continue to receive
timely software updates for another year
or so and the specs aren't bad either
it comes with an 8.9 inch display an
NVIDIA Tegra k1 processor either 16 or
32 gigabytes of on-board storage a big
6700 million power battery and weighs
only 436 grams
thanks to this devices specs navigating
around the device switching applications
playing games and streaming movies or
videos is a breeze
it also has a nice soft touch material
on the back similar to the original
Nexus 5 that makes this tablet easy to
hold as well next up is the Samsung
Galaxy Tab s2 8.0 the Samsung Galaxy Tab
s 8.4 was one of our tablet choices of
the past and its successor is here to
make an even better option the Galaxy
Tab s 8.4
which makes it more portable without
sacrificing too much screen real estate
it's really only five point six
millimeters thick and 265 grams in
weight don't mistake this little guy for
a lightweight though it still has plenty
of power to keep you going through all
your tasks for some of you it may be a
bit too similar to an iPad but it's
still a great Android
that many of you will enjoy now let's
talk a perennial favorite the Nvidia
shield tablet k1 did you like the
original shield tablet well you'll
probably feel just the same about its
direct successor the specifications and
design are pretty much the same with
both tablets aside from the addition of
a rubberized surface next to the
speakers and brush metal lettering the
back of the k1 Nvidia also removed the
stylus holder on the k1 which brings us
to our next point the stylus is gone so
is the charging cable and wall adapter
the big news here is that Nvidia is
trying to cut costs and they did that by
just not including a stylus or charger
with that being said the tablet is now
only 200 bucks which makes it not only
one of our best Android tablets here but
also one of the most affordable now
let's talk the glamour option the Sony
Xperia z4 tablet this is a sleek thin
and very attractive tablet offering from
Sony it comes with a 10.1 inch display
as Snapdragon 810 processor 3 gigabytes
of RAM plenty of on-board storage and a
microSD expansion slot up to 128
gigabytes it comes with a big six
thousand milliamp hour battery that
should be able to last quite a long time
just on a single charge it should be
noted that while this tablet still runs
lollipop
sony has plans to just skip 5.1.1 and
roll out android marshmallow as soon as
it is ready now let's talk about one of
my favorites the Dell Venue 8 7000 now
del may not be the first name that comes
to mind when talking about great Android
tablets but the company really impressed
us with the venue 8 7000 series tablet
it's one of the thinnest tablets
available right now measuring just 6.1
millimeters thick and you'd think that
in order to make this tablet so thin
Dell would need to sacrifice on battery
life however we can honestly say that
the Venue 8 7000 is really great when it
comes to battery consumption additional
specs include an 8.4 inch OLED display
an Intel Atom processor microSD
expansion and two really great cameras
for taking quick shots it also runs
Android 2 lollipop which may not be the
latest version but is definitely a
sizable step up from 5.0 it is a tad
awkward to hold but that's honestly one
of the only downsides with this tablet
with an impressive performance and even
better battery life the 7000 manages to
provide a lot without the
in price point that many might expect
and the last option you may not know
that much about it's called the Lenovo
yoga Tab 3 Pro in an age where tablets
are starting to get a bit boring its
manufacturers like Lenovo that are
trying to push us into new directions
the yoga Tab 3 is unique much like some
other Lenovo devices but this one is
really special you see that hinge well
we've seen it before but this time
around lenovo added a full-blown
projector and stand it is truly a media
powerhouse just look at those specs and
see what i'm talking about the yoga Tab
3 is a tad expensive but considering the
big display projector built-in stand
this might be the right thing for you
today nearly anything is possible if you
can dream it your team can build it
makers of collaboration software that
helps your team work better together
create and share content organize
results with the flexibility of
confluence they even have instant
messaging and video chat with HipChat
you can also manage code in real time
with the power of bitbucket visit
Atlassian comm and see how JIRA
complements HipChat and bitbucket can
give your team everything they need to
succeed so what did I miss
let me know what your favorite Android
tablet is in the comments below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
