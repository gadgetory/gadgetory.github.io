talk about what it means for all of you
who are gunning for the upcoming LGV 30
the design of LG's rumored upcoming
flagship phone the LGB 30 may have just
been outed in a new render video the
video arrives via on leaks the tips are
behind many such leaks and gear India
giving us a hint of what we might expect
from the new flagship for those of you
aware of the LGB 20 and LG g6 the design
might seem familiar the rear of the
handset is almost the same though the
camera flash sits to the right of the
dual lens on the V 30 further the device
face the bottom setup and the rounded
frame are all reminiscent of the LG G 6
also with slim bezels and likely no
secondary display meanwhile the video
would seemingly confirm the presence of
a fingerprint sensor headphone jack and
USB type-c connector on the v 30 and
gear india suggests that may feature
wireless charging now the familiar
design and the dropping of the secondary
display may disappoint some hardcore
fans what do you think you see the
original v10 arrived with a secondary
display built into the handset that
offered additional functionality
bringing something fresh to an industry
that for years has been accused of
growing stale once more it delivered
standout audio performance thanks to its
quad DAC audio support a feature a few
other manufacturers have pursued and a
removable battery something which has
been lauded by die hard Android fans
even when it came to the design the v10
didn't just look good it stood out it
didn't look like every other smartphone
out there but it looks like LG may be
scaling back on novelty with the
upcoming V 30 and instead producing
something more traditional but before
you bag too hard on LG remember that LG
has tried to truly be innovative in an
industry that just longs for uniformity
remember the LG flex the LG g5 in its
modular functionality they've been
trying hard but the fact is it's just
too little too late the industry has
matured
it's just droning on closer and closer
to total uniformity so they're going to
say fro and you can't blame them so what
do you guys think do you agree disagree
let me know in the comments below I
would make the argument that I know
there's going to be a certain percentage
of you that love the LG g5 and you want
you know an Android manufacturer to make
devices for geeks like you but there's
just not enough of us to make it
worthwhile for them yeah let me know
down there or on Twitter verse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
