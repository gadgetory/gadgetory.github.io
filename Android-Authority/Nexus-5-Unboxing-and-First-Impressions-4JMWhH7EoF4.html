going on everybody and yes it's finally
here
an extra day felt like an eternity but
at our doorstep today we finally got the
Google Nexus 5 and now it's time to
unbox and give my first impressions on
it so it's worth mentioning that the
version of the Google Nexus 5 that I
currently have right now is the white
one we're gonna see how the white
version fares I'm definitely excited to
see this one especially since the white
version of the Nexus 4 was really
short-lived
maybe common knowledge by now but there
is a system update that is required when
you first get your Nexus 5 to power on
it's a bit of a bummer because we're
gonna have to wait but luckily I'm using
Wi-Fi on a very fast connection so this
shouldn't take too long I'm actually a
little bit surprised that the
lightweight for a 5-inch phone this is
definitely very nimble feeling it feels
almost like a samsung galaxy s4 in that
regard but the more rigid lines and
definitely the less rounded look
definitely give this a little bit of a
better feel in my opinion and the
buttons are incredibly rigid you can
really feel that there they're the same
thing with the volume rockers on the
side so we're just gonna wait for the
google os or android 4.4 kitkat to come
up here while that update is going we're
just gonna take a gander over on the
back one thing I said before in the in
addition of Android Weekly was that if
the Nexus 5 is like a smaller Nexus 7
that is something I can definitely get
behind and this is for sure taking from
the design philosophies of the Nexus 7
of course this one comes in white but
what I mean here is the Nexus logo is
landscape on the back denoting that this
can be used obviously in a landscape
format and really just has that nice
material again this is not really a soft
touch material but it's also not glossy
it's just sort of I guess the best way I
can put it for now is it's like straight
plastic then of course another design
element is the camera module up here
which is surrounded by a nice large
circle however inside of there is
optical image stabilization so that's
what a lot of that girth probably means
another thing to mention is that the
sides as you can probably see in the
reflection of the light the sides are
actually glossy plastic so that is
something to keep in mind I believe on
the black Nexus 5 the soft touch plastic
kind of wraps all the way around so that
is definitely a difference one thing
about the glossy plastic on the sides is
that it can take fingerprints so that
might be a bit of a blemish no pun
intended in terms of the design choices
on the white one however since it's only
relegated to a very specific portion of
the phone that might not be that big of
a
you this white speaker grill up at the
top is really intriguing probably aside
from the camera optics this is probably
one of the few parts of the phone that
actually tries to dare to be very very
different and okay I guess for me I
actually do kind of like it as far as
Android 4.4 kitkat goes and pleasantly
surprised at how much I already fell in
love with it the moment I saw it I did
already get the Google experience
launcher for my Moto X and to be honest
I did not feel that it necessarily fit
on that screen and I say that screen
because obviously it's a smaller screen
but for a 5-inch screen this I wouldn't
I'm not gonna say that the launch right
here in 4.4 kitkat is bloated by any
means however it does have more of like
a bubbliness to it if you will there's
definitely a lot more of color going on
here that might make you feel it's not
quite as professional or quite as
simplistic as it was before but rest
assured it all still fits on this five
inch screen it all looks really great
okay Google is the phrase oh there you
go
okay Google is now the phrase that
you're going to be using and you can
actually use it from the home screens
like you saw me do just there so these
little enhancements among other things
are going to be covered in the full
review obviously and we already have a
great video outlining all of the new
features of Android 4.4 kitkat but
obviously I'm going to be seeing how
they work in real time in real life on
the Nexus 5 now of course this is just
the start of our Nexus 5 coverage so
stay tuned over the coming days for all
of the great videos that we'll have in
store for you including the full review
