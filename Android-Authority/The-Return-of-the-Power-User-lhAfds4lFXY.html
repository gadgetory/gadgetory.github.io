that has been used quite a lot in the
smartphone realm but it's one that we
weren't really using a couple of years
ago leading up to 2017 and the reason
why is because a number of features were
starting to disappear from our big
smartphones like SD card slots and large
batteries so in 2017 we noticed a trend
that there are very high-performing
highly reliable devices coming out on a
consistent clip but there's another
trend that's been happening in 2017 the
niche device now these are smartphones
that actually fulfill particular needs
and can be classified as power user
devices themselves so it's Josh of
Recaro what's going on everybody and
we're here to talk about five devices
that we believe signal the return of the
power user what if you just want the
absolute best specifications the best
possible performance lends itself to the
best possible experiences perhaps and
that is exactly what razer has attempted
to do with the recently announced and
soon to be reviewed razer phone the
razer phone is certainly one for the
spec hungry sporting the snapdragon 835
the completely used 8 gigabytes of ram
an SD card slot for more storage dolby
atmos speakers that sound incredible and
a quad HD screen with ultra motion 120
Hertz refresh rates to make everything
fly there's even a DAC inside of the
USBC adapter two headphone jack ports
because there's no headphone jack on
this device but you should be able to
get some really high-quality hi-fi audio
by using that adapter no one can doubt
that this phone is really made for the
gamer in all of us but this isn't really
a gaming phone because it has all of the
specifications you would need to do
pretty much anything and that includes
productivity it won't take a backseat to
the rest as these same specifications
will help users get things done in a
fast and reliable manner it's easy to
look at the razor phone as the power
users dream it's a late comer in the
2017 game but it serves as a reminder
that we're not through with this year's
bevy of incredible smartphones and it
comes alongside another entrant that is
thinking bigger and in a lot of ways
thinking double now we just reviewed the
ZTE axon M and even though it may not
have gotten the best score here at
Android authority we still give it the
nod from being a great phone for the
multitasker
the axon M comes with two screens that
fold upon themselves for twice the
screen real estate and dual screen
capabilities that you literally
cannot get on any other device so far
the two screens can work separately or
in tandem creating an even larger canvas
so you can have any of your applications
stretched across that entire screen
surface for the media lover one screen
could be the YouTube display while the
other is for getting things done
speaking of which you can even view
media in a tent mode and you're able to
share your media in a mirrored mode with
another user adding a complete second
screen to a phone is one hell of a move
to make and even if its specifications
don't necessarily make it a beast unlike
the razor phone we certainly give it the
nod for being a great multitasking tool
the X on M reminded us that it's not
necessarily all about power in order to
please a power user it's more about
fulfilling particular needs and the
BlackBerry key one was the early 2017
example of this very notion hardly
anyone that would prioritize gaming or
media consumption would call the key one
their best device but plenty of those
same users still look at BlackBerry's
keyboard toting smartphone very fondly
pointing at all that they can accomplish
with it as a daily driver a Productivity
user can still be considered a power
user as they need to get a lot done with
correspondence through email or
messaging through a lot of different
applications and that all requires one
particular everyday task typing and
there is arguably no better typing
experience than on the physical keyboard
of the BlackBerry key one but it's not
just about the keyboard blackberry
managed to even make the Android
experience still as enjoyable as
possible on that smaller screen while
providing all of the tools that are
needed not only for productivity but
even for security work is simply no
problem for this phone that provides
over 26 different shortcuts that you can
use to get to places quickly using each
and every key on the keyboard and even
if it has a mid-range processor and the
snapdragon 625 and 3 gigabytes of RAM I
was still able to use it personally as a
great daily driver in order to just get
my stuff done which brings us to the
last couple of phones and you probably
won't be surprised to see which ones we
feature the reason why we're
highlighting these two is because they
arguably fill both of the power user
needs great specs and niche
functionality and for the content
creator you just cannot go wrong with
the LG v3 I've already mentioned the
wide-angle camera is one of the most fun
ways of using your smart phone for
photography and the manual video
settings make for the most robust camera
control in an Android shooter there's
even a log format making
the v30 the smartphone for vloggers
video shooters instagramers and general
photographers alike LG has managed to
provide tools for making visual content
not only easier to do on a slim powerful
device but fun to do because of the
wide-angle secondary lens and we haven't
even mentioned fully the high-end
specifications the streamlined Android
experience and the headphone jack that
rocks a great sounding quad DAC that is
available in all of the V 30 units all
of these features are included in a
package that doesn't get near the
dreaded $1000 price point now $1000
price point is unfortunately what the
final pic comes close to Samsung might
be the company we originally started
using the power user term for because of
their Galaxy Note series the note 8
redeems the sins of the note 7 while
harkening back to what made the line
great putting the best possible pretty
much anything into one device that also
rocks a stylus the s-pen is basically
one-of-a-kind in terms of what it brings
to the smartphone experience adding its
own features on top of what is already a
feature packed version of Android by
Samsung and not to even mention the
great design of the phone that lends
itself to even more features via the
edge UX because of that curved infinity
display the note 8 also adds a secondary
lens to the camera package in this case
a zoom lens that lends itself to
Samsung's own version of portrait mode
and this all just scratches the surface
of what Samsung tries to make their
phone do some might say that the Galaxy
slides dangerously into redundancies due
to its many applications that mayor
Google's own applications even bigsby
sits alongside Google Assistant in the
very same device and you can press the
dedicated button to get that or hold the
home button in order to trigger a Google
assistant but putting quite literally
everything into one device is the reason
why a power user became a thing and
despite a couple of previous attempts to
regain the love of the power user the
note 8 has done so in spades and the
best part is that these are only 5 of
the devices that we've seen this year
there are still a wide spectrum of
smartphones that you can choose from
with good specifications and reliability
to last you throughout even all of next
year and with all of that choice in the
Android space you can pretty much take
your pick and as long as you know what
kind of user you are you might be able
to find the smartphone that you've been
waiting for content creators workaholics
media consumers and those simply looking
for the best of the best
many of their needs met this year making
us proud to say welcome back to the
power user as always thank you guys very
much for watching and we hope you
enjoyed this video about the return of
the power user keep it tuned to Andrew
authority for even more including
content from all over the spectrum and
you can also head over to andrew
authority calm for the latest news
features and reviews you can also use
the android authority app available in
the Play Store so that you can keep up
with it using a nice-looking and easy to
use application and then when you're
done with all of that head on over to
