next event here in Shanghai China and
they had a brand new phone that they
wanted to show off called the vivo neck
stool display edition so effectively
this is pretty much exactly what it
sounds like you've got the primary
display on the front of the phone and
then on the back of the phone you have
another display that you can use for
things like taking photos or even
playing games so earlier this year with
the original vivo next you had this
little selfie camera that popped out of
the top of the phone but this year they
want to make it so you don't need that
to happen at all there's no mechanical
part at all now you can just use the
screen on the back of the phone and use
the primary shooters that you would
normally use to take regular photos kind
of as selfie camera so they're better
cameras anyway and you're going to get a
better image since you can just turn the
phone around see yourself and take two
selfies so there's definitely a few
other uses for this screen on the back
of the phone but obviously the main one
is going to be the camera when you're
taking a photo of someone they can
actually see the photo before you take
it so you can align the photo and they
can also see it which makes it a lot
easier to pose themselves if you're like
trend take photos for Instagram so
another use case that they showed off
with this extra screen is gaming so
usually when you're playing like a
first-person shooter game it's kind of
weird to just use two thumbs to be able
to shoot and move around but since you
have another screen on the back of the
phone you can actually use that screen
as kind of a trigger so you can use the
extra fingers you have to tap on the
back of the display and use it to shoot
and do a lot of other actions in the
game so now because you have two
displays you've got two different ways
to unlock your phone depending on which
display you want to unlock first so in
the main display just like on the last
next you've got the in screen
fingerprint reader which is probably a
little bit better than it was earlier
this year but on the rear display now
you can use the three cameras in the
back of the phone to use face unlock so
you're getting three cameras on the back
of the device there's a 12 megapixel
main shooter that's made for regular
photos there's a 2 megapixel low-light
camera that's made to get a lot of
low-light images and actually is used
for a lot of videography and then there
is a time of flight sensor which is
pretty much exactly what it sounds like
it shoots dots at your face to create
this depth map which is used for face
unlocks so if you don't want to use the
in screen fingerprint reader on the
main glass panel then you can actually
use face unlock on the rear it's
probably the other main feature here
besides that secondary screen is ten
gigabytes of RAM which makes this like
the third phone on the market right now
to head 10 gigabytes of RAM but vivo
says that they are actually able to take
a better advantage of this Ram that a
lot of other people there's some special
software algorithm that they're using
that lets apps take more advantage of
the RAM and just not close as often so
besides that you're still getting the
snapdragon 845 just like you did with
the original necks and you're just
getting one storage variant it's a 128
gigabytes there's no expandable storage
here it's going to cost 4,998 RMB which
is about seven hundred and thirty
dollars and if you want to get it now
you can pre-order right now or you can
go buy it on December 29th in mainland
China they haven't announced
availability or pricing yet for Europe
and the US but that will be coming later
so that's pretty much it for the next
dual display Edition it's not that
different you're just getting that
secondary display on the back which is
pretty cool honestly I think there's a
lot of features that can be enabled by
this will definitely be having a review
coming in the near future as soon as we
can get our hands on an international
unit so stay tuned for that and make
sure you stay tuned to the website and
ruther calm because of course we're your
source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
