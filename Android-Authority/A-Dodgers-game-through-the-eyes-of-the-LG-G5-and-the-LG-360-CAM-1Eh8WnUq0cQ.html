we're on our way to Dodger Stadium bring
my dad with me and we're going to have
VIP seats to watch the Dodgers actually
Cardinals at Dodgers is the way you
should put it and all of the videos and
photos that you're seeing in this video
we're taken on the lg g5 NB 360 and here
we are taking a look at the LG g5 once
again we've done a lot of extensive
testing on the g5 s cameras and you will
be able to see some of the 100 crop so
you can see what the quality is like but
this is a super sunny day while cloudy
at first but it became sunny later on so
a lot of these pictures should look
really nice the main thing I wanted to
showcase during this video is how fun
the wide-angle lens is and with the
front facing camera you do get some
pretty good quality but that beauty mode
is still pretty aggressive from there
however we are taking a look at Dodger
Stadium through the eyes of the LG g5
but I'm also going to get my hands on
the LG 360 cam so you can see some 360
shots as well but the thing is this
video will not allow for 360 videos
you're gonna have to take a look at
another video on the YouTube channel and
the link will be available in the cart
and the description below alright here
we are finally right field
reserve level
now for the purposes of this particular
video as we're just taking a quick look
at the LG 360 cam and the LG g5 at
Dodger Stadium you'll see that these
spherical 180 degree videos are what you
get when you take the footage straight
from the SD card that is in the LG 360
cam all you have to do is then process
these videos by transferring them over
to the phone and the software inside of
the phone will make them actual 360
videos it's a little bit tougher when
you get it onto a computer if you don't
do that step first but we'll get more
into that in the 360 cam video itself so
even though this video is basically
using the LG g5 cameras as a sort of
vlogging rig we are still going to be
showing you these pictures and you
already saw in the previous wide-angle
video that in the lower light shots
especially in this indoor area it was
already starting to suffer in terms of
quality but the thing is that wide-angle
lens is able to capture so much more
than any conventional lens on any
smartphone and of course we were able to
get onto the field which was an
incredible incredible moment and yes I
will show you what this looks like from
the 360 cam this is what a 360 picture
looks like before you even get control
of it
she's got that regular view and with the
view like that I had to take the
wide-angle lens
turn the phone around and take a picture
and it's able to capture so much that
you don't have to worry about getting
yourself into the shot even if your arm
might look a little bit weird so the LG
360 cam was proving to be a fun tool to
get 360 video but it's also pretty
portable especially since it comes with
its own case so I couldn't resist just
having the camera set up and ready to
take a lot of 360 video of where we were
on the field level of the Dodger Stadium
but even though we got into our seats
there was something missing so as is
usually kind of customary in these
videos here are your foodie pics this
particular sandwich is captured quite
well and the bunt is actually very
detailed of course I use the wide-angle
lens for this particular shot just to
give you a look at this nacho behold
it's in a Dodger hat but if you do zoom
into the actual chips themselves you'll
find that the color is pretty nice still
done quite well even if it's a little
bit warm for this lower light situation
but things still look pretty crisp
time
- Brooklyn Dodgers
so it turned out to be a very fun game
even if the Dodgers lost but it was at
the starter game that I remembered how
much fun the LG g5 is now the main
camera does a great job already with
good colors and really good detail but
it's that wide-angle lens that really
adds to the experience is its quality
quite as good as the regular shooter not
quite as much especially in lower light
situations you're going to find that the
wide-angle lens is going to suffer a
little bit more in lower light
situations when compared to its more
conventional counterparts and obviously
that is because it has a lot more to
capture with less megapixels to do so
but that doesn't mean that it's not very
fun to use yes the warping in videos due
to the optical image stabilization does
seem a little bit off-putting at first
but when you turn that phone around and
use that instead of the front-facing
camera in order to get videos and even
selfies for that matter they provide a
very unique look that really just adds a
little bit more of that fun factor to
videos vlogs like this type and of
course to pictures and speaking of fun
factor that's really the best way to
describe the LG 360 cam it's videos
still leave quite a bit to be desired
especially in terms of quality but the
reason why is because you're taking
these two spherical images and stitching
them together and then zooming very far
into them in order to create the 360
image that can be controlled on YouTube
and even Facebook editing the videos
from the 360 cam requires you basically
to move it over to the LG g5 first which
is a long process and then you can put
them into your video editing software of
choice that said however it's pretty
easy to use even if it is still pretty
rudimentary and that leads me to my main
point about the LG 360 cam it is
definitely first stage this is the first
iteration of many of these 360 cameras
and we're excited to see where they go
from here a more comprehensive review of
the LG 360 cam will probably come a
little bit later but until then you can
enjoy the video that I put together of
all of the 360 footage that I got with
the 360 cam add a link that is available
in the card over on the top or in the
description below so as always thank you
guys very much for watching and I hope
you enjoyed this feature focus on the LG
g5 s cameras and the LG 360 cam which
means an appearance in this video and of
course you can see the 360 video
link down in the description like I just
said keep it into Android 34 even more
about the LG g5 and beyond because we
are your source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
