Hindy the android authority app guy it's
Friday and you know what that means this
week we have a lot of Android wear stuff
to talk about which is pretty awesome
along with more android app news so
let's get started first up this week
some Android L style stuff has been
brought to nova launcher it seems like
nova launcher is always on the forefront
of this kind of stuff fame and this
latest update nova launcher now has el
style full reprieve use app animations
search bar and the drawer icon along
with some boilerplate bug fixes and
performance improvements with this
update and some tweaking you can get
more Android L in your life without
having to download the preview look next
up Google Wallet got to partake in
Google's latest Wednesday update
unfortunately the new update is for us
residents only it brings gift card
support it allows people to request
money from other Google Wallet users it
allows you to send money using your
debit card and it now supports Spanish
yes a US only update for google wallet
includes language support for several
other countries don't ask why because we
don't know but we do know that these
other features are pretty cool and they
help broaden the wallet experience and
now for some Android wear news a new
application lets you have a watch face
that looks like it came out of Star Trek
yes this is actually news it's a fairly
simple design and aside from the looks
it really doesn't do anything else it's
a good conversation starter between you
and other Star Trek fans and it just
looks really cool installing it as easy
there's an application which will have
linked in the written companion below
just install that to your smartphone
while your watch is paired to it and
boom it'll show up under your watch
faces really easy stuff here this last
week it was announced that Google music
would be rolling out to six new
countries the countries in question are
bolivia chile colombia costa rica peru
and the ukraine this increases the
number of people in South America who
can use the service dramatically and
that makes sense in South America is one
of the fastest growing smartphone
markets right now if you live in these
countries and you can't access it yet
just be patient because the rollouts
take a week or so to reach everyone in
our last bit of news this week there
have been some new rumors circulating
that stay that amazon instant video is
finally coming to regular Android
it's currently available for Kindle Fire
Services and even some other platforms
on Android but not for Android itself
for some reason popular rumours are that
Amazon is worried about a platform wide
launch and how it would hurt kindle fire
sales however even so a new rumor claims
that a release is imminent now it's
important to look at the sources here
according to the sources this news
apparently came from Russell Morris who
is the marketing director at amazon
instant video apparently amazon had a
Christmas shindig in July to go over
what they'll be doing over the upcoming
holiday season yeah that sounds a bit
weird me too so like all rumors we'll
just take it with a grain of salt for
right now the good news is that eminent
means pretty soon so we won't have to
wait too long to see if this rumor pans
out so wants to see some trending
applications as usual if you want to
check any of these applications out you
can find the links in the briton
companion which is in the video
description below yes friends commander
is back here on the Google Play weekly
show and it's because of a big update
that makes it even better using the
accessibility API that Google provides
the commander devs have updated their
application to work offline and you
don't have to use the phrase take a note
anymore that means using google now you
can with and without internet access
tell Google now to simply turn bluetooth
Wi-Fi etc on and off and it'll do just
that Google Chrome for Android got an
update this last week as part of
Google's update Wednesday it's rolling
out in stages but the update includes
the return of doodles to the new tab
page various bug fixes and performance
improvements and a couple of security
fixes including omnibox spoofing and
same origin policy bypass fixes the more
secure it is the more awesome it is so
we're really happy about this update
okay so this next app is really cool
what it does is allows you to use your
Android wear devices sort of a
viewfinder for your camera phone yes
that means it mirrors what your camera
sees on the watch itself the
applications for this are limited only
by your imagination one fun trick is to
set up the phone to look at a pot of
water and then you can go back to
watching TV or something and use the
watch to see if it's boiling it's free
and open source but it is a little bit
buggy but you should still check it out
if you're ready to hate life again we
recommend that you try out timber man
this is one of those easy to grass but
hard to master titles that is
frustratingly addictive and difficult it
has already been likened to flappy bird
in that regard even if the gameplay is
really nothing like flappy bird it's
free to play with ads but you can get
rid of them for a buck if you so
last and certainly not least is the
where mini launcher app by using this
application you can have a standard app
drawer on your SmartWatch just like you
do on your smartphone which is
apparently something that isn't a thing
yet already the only real complaint is
the hot spot for this application is the
same as dismissing notifications but
other than that people seem to really
like it and it's free once again I'm Joe
