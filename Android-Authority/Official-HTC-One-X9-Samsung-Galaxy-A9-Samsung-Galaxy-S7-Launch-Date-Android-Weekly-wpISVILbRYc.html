domain.com yes we do have news about the
galaxy s7 a 9 and HTC X 9 but perhaps
more interesting is the fact that the
Sultan of search is creating its own
messaging app not just to communicate
with other human beings but to
communicate with Google BOTS for those
of you who have fond memories of
chatting it up on AOL Instant Messenger
the Sultan of search is rumored to be
developing a new messenger service to
compete with Facebook's messenger and
whatsapp and one of its primary features
is an army of bots that will let you get
in on the chatting action even if you
don't have any friends in addition to
alleviating your painful loneliness
these bots will hunt and fetch
information for you google says the goal
is to make finding content more
conversational and natural the alphabet
own company is relying on their
impressive artificial intelligence
research to make these BOTS both dynamic
and adaptive for instance you might ask
one for a dinner recommendation it may
suggest a steakhouse near you but if you
decline on the basis that you're a
vegetarian the bot will remember this
and avoid referring you to meat heavy
establishments in the future now this
could be really interesting for two
reasons one it not only allows Google to
leverage their search capacity but it
allows us to personify our digital
assistant now you may scoff at that
because it's been done less and less
with Google now but Siri Wow people love
to personify Syrian gives Siri qualities
like sassiness cleverness humor and all
those wonderful things think about the
possibilities could be interesting and
we've received more confirmation that
the galaxy s7 is comin soon real soon
like early March according to China
Mobile the Samsung Galaxy s7 will land
in China sometime in March along with
the Huawei p9 The Wall Street Journal
also recently published lots of
information about the Galaxy s7 s launch
including mention of late February
unveiling right around the Mobile World
Congress as usual the current generation
of the Galaxy s6 was announced on March
1st and went on sale in 20 countries
more than a month later on April 10th
perhaps the sales of the galaxy s7 will
begin a little quicker this time round
and the Galaxy a9 is official as of
right now we don't have the entire list
of specs though the ones we do have are
pretty
we the Galaxy a9 sports a six-inch
AMOLED display that's 1920 by 1080
resolution a newly renamed octa-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 to processor 3
gigabytes ram 32 gigabytes of on-board
storage and a microSD expansion slot up
to 128 gigabytes and dual SIM card
support it also has a 13 megapixel rear
camera with oh is 8 megapixel
front-facing camera a pretty big 4
thousand milliamp hour battery and
support for Qualcomm's quick charge in
typical samsung fashion there's also a
home button Mountain fingerprint sensor
that brings along support for Samsung
pay it will also ship with Android 5.1
lollipop I know you're thinking Jace
what lollipop no marshmallow well I
don't know for certain but an educated
guess would be that during the testing
phase of the a9 only lollipop was
available and now if they have to
install marshmallow that's just gonna
delay the launch of the device but
marshmallow I'm sure is coming very soon
and also official is the HTC One X 9 the
HTC One X 9 has been officially
announced in China powered by an
octa-core MediaTek processor the 1 X 9
is a premium smartphone that doesn't
command a premium price tag equipped
with a 5.5 inch display the One X 9
features a good-looking design that's
been combined with a metal unibody the 1
X 9 sports media attacks high-end Helio
x10 processor which is comprised of
eight cortex a53 cores clocked at 2.2
gigahertz the 64-bit chipset is paired
with power vrg 6200 GPU clocked at 700
megahertz it has 3 gigabytes of RAM 32
gigabytes of internal storage The One X
9 has an ultra pixel front camera great
for low-light conditions and selfie
lovers turn the device around and you're
greeted by a 13 megapixel camera that's
armed with OAS capabilities and 4k video
recording there's also support for raw
image capture which Sirius mobile
photographers are sure to appreciate the
One X 9 comes with a large 3000 milliamp
hour battery which HTC claims can last
for about 15 hours of voice calls over
3G 10 hours of high-definition video
playback 40 hours of uninterrupted music
playback support for fast charging is
also present which is said to be 30%
faster than charging with a regular
five volt and one a charger clearly the
lines between flagship and mid-tier
devices are blurring what do you guys
