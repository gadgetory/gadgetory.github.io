hindi from android a30 comm and it's
that time of year when google starts
giving us presents we all now have
android p and it's time to take a closer
look the first thing we'll look at are
some of the UI changes as per the norm
there are no major league changes this
year but rather some colourful tweaks
here and there to improve or otherwise
optimize the UI to start with the
startup screen and experience is a
little bit different than it was before
it does all the same stuff that it used
to do but it just looks a little bit
different it's not a huge deal but we
thought we'd mention it
notifications got just a little bit
better now messaging applications can
show the last few messages in a
conversation in case you want to
continue it directly from the
notification rather than opening the
full app it also now shows stickers and
things like that the improvements here
basically put the entire application in
your notification shade and honestly I
wouldn't be shocked if they went the
distance with that idea eventually the
settings menu received yet another
overhaul from last year the icons are
more colourful and the whole thing is a
little friendlier to look at in addition
the quick settings also have more
colorful and rounded icons the launcher
actually does - in fact the whole UI
looks a little more colourful and fun
all around some may wish for a more
professional UI but frankly the
technology world could do with fewer
stick shoved up their rear ends frankly
I like it some other UI changes include
the removal of the orange color when you
turn on battery saver and addition the
volume slider now sits on the side of
the screen instead of on top and this is
likely to improve usability on devices
with a notch but we'll discuss the notch
more later the power menu rests there as
well and it now includes a new
screenshot button we hope that one makes
it a production cuz that would rock the
biggest new UI feature is support for
the oft ated but often imitated not the
OS lets you play with the notch cut out
I suspect so that people like me can
make these videos and actually show you
what it'll look like and for that I say
thank you Google in any case you can
simulate the notch if you really want to
although I'm not really sure why any of
us would since 2018 is probably going to
be the year of the knotch it's good that
Android people actually support it
here's hoping that all those phones
actually do get Android pee there
are a myriad of smaller things as well
such as a unified fingerprint scanner
dialogue changes to controls while
casting video and minor improvements to
ambient display there are some bad
things though root users and non-root
users alike will lose the ability to use
substratum theming in Android P since
stock Android has no theming of its own
yet that decision kind of sucks there
aren't nearly as many big new features
this year as there were in the last few
years we don't have multi window or
picture and picture level stuff to play
around with this time around
and it seems like Android P is really
dealing more with under the hood stuff
security and UI changes thus there
really aren't any huge new features but
there is at least one feature worth
talking about Android P now lets you
rotate your screen on a use by use basis
even if your rotation is locked you
rotate the screen and a little button
pops up on the navigation bar at the
bottom press it and the whole screen
will rotate for you this feature is a
tad buggy in the developer preview but
we assume it'll get better over time
it's a small thing but it's so nice to
have now like we said it's not a good
year for big new software features the
majority of things this year are taking
place in the UI under the hood or in
regards to security it's not that big of
a deal though since we've all been
complaining about all of those things
for the last few years as per the norm
these days the majority of the changes
are going to take place under the hood
where we can't see them but companies
can use them to make their phones better
or more useful there is a giant list so
we'll talk about the big ones and then
maybe a few others but we'll have the
list of all of them linked up in the
video description below
perhaps the biggest under the hood
change comes with dual camera supports a
new API let's devices and applications
access multiple cameras at the same time
given how dual cameras is now a thing
that is for real here to stay
it's good to see Android P keeping the
OS updated for new technology in
addition a host of new video and image
codecs are going to be included those
worried that their phones might not
support the latest and greatest stuff
shouldn't worry because Android P should
add all of the popular new stuff like
the hei F format that one day may kill
off the JPEG along with continued
support for the vp9 streaming video
codec there is a new API for indoor
positioning and Wi-Fi round-trip time
this lets your phone connect to multiple
Wi-Fi hotspots inside of a building so
that it can better tell you where you
are within that building
Google says that the device will measure
its distance between three nearby access
points and then determine the position
based on that it should actually be
accurate within one to two meters and
that's honestly impressive a couple of
other new API is include a new image
decoder API for bitmaps and drawable
stuff as well as a new animation API
that includes improvements to Kotlin and
art as well consumers won't deal with
these directly but it should help
developers make better looking
applications that do more things and
that's always good news some stuff from
previous versions of Android received
updates and improvements as well
notification channels can do a few more
things and there are also a couple of
new do not disturb priority categories
for those who really want to customize
that doze mode gets another round of
updates and optimizations for even
better battery life and autofill is
getting some improvements as well
accessibility navigation tooltips
dialogue a neural network API and window
changing details are all in the mix as
well again we have all that linked up in
the video description below if you want
to learn more about that stuff Google
security measures have been pretty big
over the years the start of monthly
security updates was Google's idea and
last year we got Google Play protect
which is basically an antivirus that
Google runs from within Google Play this
year we're getting some more awesome
stuff with Android pay for starters
Android pay will block access to sensors
microphone and camera to applications
that aren't currently active that means
no applications can passively listen or
turn your camera on in the background on
one hand this is great because it means
no applications can spy on you we would
like to see how this affects anti-theft
apps like Cerberus however where it may
need to engage the camera remotely to
take a picture of the thief we assume it
won't mess with that functionality too
much Android pee does a few other small
things to improve security as well it
will now fake MAC addresses when you
connect to public Wi-Fi so that you
can't be tracked so easily
additionally it'll do a better job of
protecting your unique Device Identifier
improve sensitive data transactions and
even warn us the consumer when we're
using old apps that aren't on the latest
ap is since those could present security
risks and performance issues Android P
also enables encryption of locally
stored Android backups people will need
their pin password pattern etc in order
to restore data from these encrypted
backups finally Android P will block
cryptid HTTP traffic by default and that
should help security out quite a bit
however applications do need to be
updated to the latest SDK before that
becomes a real thing otherwise they will
perform as they always have it's
important to keep in mind that this is
the first developer preview of the year
that means a lot of this stuff is up for
grabs in terms of changes in removal and
it also means that there will certainly
be more changes and improvements coming
down the line as the OS matures this
really is a developer preview of Android
P meaning that it's for developers to
make their apps work with the OS before
it becomes standard according to Google
the next developer preview should come
in early May and that should bring more
stability and improvements to more are
coming in June with the third developer
preview finalizing the api's for the
fold release there will be one more
Developer Preview sometime after July
but before release in quarter three of
this year thus if you find that Android
P just isn't good enough yet
you really don't have that long to wait
in our testing we ran into the usual
array of small bugs and issues but
nothing so bad is to affect pure
usability we of course wouldn't
recommend using this as a daily driver
because it is an alpha and alphas have
all kinds of nasty little surprises that
even we may have missed if you really
must use it we recommend familiarizing
yourself with how to roll back to Oreo
first just in case you need to otherwise
this is it folks this is Android pee so
far we have a bunch of articles on the
topic linked up in the video description
below and we do have some more videos
coming through the pipeline we'll keep
you updated as Android pee matures as
for the name your guess is as good as
mine at this point I totally wanted it
to be Android Pi but the easter egg
makes a good case for Google going with
Android peppermint if you want to wager
a guess leave us a comment and tell us
what you want it to be oh wait I almost
forgot this is what the Android pee
Easter Egg looks like ok now I'm done
and that about does it for this one
folks don't forget to Like subscribe and
ring the bell to get the latest android
authority videos as soon as they come
out because we are your source for all
things Android as always thanks for
watching everybody and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
