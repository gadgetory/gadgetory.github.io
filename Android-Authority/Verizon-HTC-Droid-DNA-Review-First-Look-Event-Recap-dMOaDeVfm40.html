from android authority while it is
technically the morning while I'm
recording this it still feels like night
to me and earlier today I was in New
York City for the verizon HTC droid DNA
event if you've been following us for a
while you've probably heard a thing or
two about this phone before even if you
didn't know it see before it was known
as the droid DNA in the u.s. this phone
was known as the HTC j butterfly in
japan according to a Qualcomm
representative I spoke to today the
version we're getting here is basically
exactly the same only it's on the
verizon network and has a different name
to take a quick look at the specs the
HTC droid DNA has a 5-inch IPS LCD
display with 1080p resolution and a
pixel density of 440 pixels per inch
it's powered by the latest and greatest
Qualcomm s4 Snapdragon s4 pro chipset
with a quad-core processor clocked at
1.5 gigahertz the droid DNA features two
gigs of ram 16 gigs of internal storage
and one thing that has quite a few
people worried a 2020 milliamp hour
battery with all those pixels to power
were curious to see what the battery
life on this will be like during
real-world use name another feature
you'd like to see and chances are pretty
good that the droid DNA has it NFC 4G
LTE wireless charging Beats Audio
Gorilla Glass too jellybean there's an
awful lot packed into this little guy
now I'll be honest before I saw the HTC
droid dna's 1080p display with my very
own eyes I really doubted that I'd even
be able to see the difference between
720p and 1080p on such a small screen
and a lot of the times this can be true
with the HTC droid DNA with certain
sources however the screen is incredibly
crisp and detailed and just like that
I've
really become a 1080p believer
especially moving into the future when
we start to see more true 1080p sources
become available the HTC droid DNA will
be released on November 21st for 199
dollars 99 cents with a two-year
contract from Verizon the device is
exclusive to verizon so don't hold your
breath to wait to see it on another
carrier now we'd like to know what do
you think of the HTC droid DNA are you
drooling over that 1080p display or
cringing at the possibility of low
battery life let us know in the comments
this has been Christopher walk for
android authority and as usual we would
absolutely love to hear your comments on
this video as well as your comments on
the other videos on our channel thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
