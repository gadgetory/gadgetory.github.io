Authority what's going on everybody I
hope everybody had a wonderful holiday
but we are right back at it with the
Samsung Galaxy round this is of course
the curved display version of the
Samsung Galaxy line and because of this
curve there are a few new functions
inside of the phone however before I get
into those which is what this video is
about I wanted to just remind everybody
that's a lot of the functions - S Pen
functionality for obvious reasons does
make it into the galaxy Ram like hand
gestures and air views and smart pause
and smart squirrel and things of that
nature so everything that was originally
introduced in the Samsung Galaxy s4 does
make it to here so those are all options
you have with this phone but what does
this tilt mean in terms of functionality
well that is exactly what we are here to
find out as you can see here I have the
Samsung Galaxy round just sitting on my
desk waiting to be used or in this case
tilted and we'll go ahead and just jump
right in with the first function that
you probably already know about and that
is the tilting quick glance just put
your hand right here on the corner and
you will on the side rather and you'll
see your notifications as you tilt the
screen and it'll stay there as long as
you have it held until you just like go
and it disappears now it is a nice way
to do that however there is that small
pause there so it's up to you whether or
not that is enough time in order for you
to get to your information now the next
function that we have is really just on
the lockscreen quite literally we'll go
ahead and unlock the phone and you'll
see how is this is really just an
aesthetic feature turn on the phone and
you'll see the ripple effect which makes
the idea that there is water in there
however if you tilt the phone one way
it's as if all the water comes over to
that side that's pretty much it now that
we are in the OS the next function that
is available to us is for changing the
track in the music player now
unfortunately much like many other
Samsung features this will only work
with the built-in music player at least
as far as I can tell because I tried to
do it with Google Play Music and it
definitely was not working there so what
we have here is the Samsung music player
the TouchWiz music player and I'll go
ahead and press play and you guys
couldn't enjoy a cover
of Drake song there you go now what
you're supposed to do here is have the
phone in a locks state and it's from
here that you can tilt the phone just
tap the side in order to make the track
change now that was going previous so
I've already played the track and you're
supposed to really get a tilt into there
but not for too long and not for too
short of a time the same thing goes for
a tilt over to the right all right and
then the final feature that is available
you don't even have to have the phone on
a table as a matter of fact you're going
to be holding down on a picture or a
video and by tilting the phone a certain
way you will be able to see what other
pictures or videos are in that same
folder it's my laptop there so you just
hold in the center or anywhere in the
frame and then when you tilt there you
go you get the other albums and pictures
that are available so there you have it
just a really quick look at the Samsung
Galaxy round and some of the new
features it brings in due to that
tilting body so as you can see there
aren't really too many new functions
that are available but they do give you
a little bit of a choice a couple of
them are purely esthetical like the
ripple effect on the lockscreen however
a couple other ones are quite useful
like the tilting in order to get a quick
glance at your notifications so there is
some usefulness to be had here but of
course it is ultimately up to you
whether or not those new functions are
better than the ones that were already
introduced or even if they're all useful
at all such as usually the dilemma when
it comes to current Samsung devices as
