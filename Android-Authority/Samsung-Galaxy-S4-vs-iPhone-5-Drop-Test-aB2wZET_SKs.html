with Android Authority
we're here in Hong Kong you know what
time it is it's time for some drop in
we got the galaxy s4 here brand spanking
new for y'all
we got the iPhone 5 the near bulletproof
device let's see what happens when we
let these guys go
so let me briefly explain to you how we
do this we're gonna be doing it like we
always do okay from the hip from the
chest from the head
it's very simple life is random so we're
gonna be dropping these devices like
that for you let's see how they hold up
when we travel
it's drop test hands pocket test iPhone
I thought held up real mass just a
little bit right here not so bad
that's for pocket test
the s4 just fell directly on its back
there's no damage to the periphery of
the bezel no damage to the display
looking good guys
Chester of chess iphone5
yep iPhone 5 still in great shape we
know it's a really really well-built
device just a little bit of damage to
where it has the point of impact here
but as we can see no cracking to the
display whatsoever galaxy s4 chest drop
down it felt virtually on the back
because we can see plastic holds up
really really well nothing on the bezel
that I can see nothing on the bottom
yeah plastic versus metal debate
continues guys it's still a great shape
iPhone 5 head drop test
so as we can see yeah you know it was a
really hard impact actually dressed here
on the top also on the side but as we
can see it I was still fully functioning
the iPhone 5 really really great quality
device working great still in good shape
guys the Galaxy s4 has been really
really lucky so far so now we're gonna
drop it straight from the head here we
go the truth moment of truth
there we go oh no oh obviously the point
of impact right here poor galaxy s4
didn't hold up so well but it was a
really really hard impact just to the
top you know who cares really about the
rest of the stuff the display shattered
obviously still functional so don't
worry about it
sadly it's smashed okay guys so that's a
wrap
we got the galaxy s4 Corning Gorilla
Glass 3 we got the iPhone 5 now we go
forget this is totally random this is
entertainment and you know we take this
seriously big props to my man mark
