we're at Pep com digital experience here
darcel a cuvette with android authority
we're digging deep for you guys we were
just on our way out but we had to stop
by and check on nectar now they have
some really really innovative stuff now
think about owning a smartphone or
tablet what is the number one thing that
is always on your mind battery life it's
like a mortgage it's like a virus
haunting your mind now this gentleman
here he claims to have a solution a
solution that's going to be able to
extend your battery life to infinite
levels but I don't know what I'm talking
about I'm gonna pass it over to him and
he's going to elaborate well thanks a
lot so this is the nectar mobile power
system a revolutionary device that is
going to eliminate that anxiety and that
worry about running out of power because
in this device you have two weeks to a
month of power always available always
with you you never have to look for a
plug and worry about where you're going
to get your next charge from it's a USB
charger like you may have seen USB
battery charges but the difference is
instead of one or two charges with this
again two weeks to a month of power the
key is the tower cartridge or nectar pod
is what we call it and each of these
pods has enough energy in it to power
your phone for two weeks to a month and
it's really simple to use you just take
the pod insert it in when it's done you
can recycle it and pop another one in
and let me give you a demo of how it
works it's really simple just like any
USB charger there's a lot of technology
in here but we make it simple for the
user so all you need to do is plug in
your cable get out your smartphone
that's in need of being charged I
disagree with your choice of phone by
the way plug that in yeah sorry about
the phone yeah and it's a shower change
it we do have some android phones over
here which we could demo if you come
back to the booth the battery lights not
good on that one anyway so just bringing
it down into the real world specs I have
this you buy a power pack here I said
8400 milliamp batteries my samsung
galaxy note 2 has 3100 my lap yeah now
you were telling me before that this has
how many 55,000 milliwatt hours just
blows my mind plenty of power so again
you never have to worry about where the
next charge is coming from no more
hunting for plugs
you have all the power you need with you
wherever you are wherever you go
whatever you need to do on your phone so
the technology itself this is the fuel
is the butane is you've mentioned just
like a cigarette lighter very safe
approved to take on aircraft so you
don't have to worry about it I've got
about three million air miles of using
my device on aircraft so it's no problem
great first product because there's two
billion devices out there that have a
battery problem and can be charged with
USB and this is just the beginning soon
we'll be taking the technology and
embedding it inside of tablets and
phones and all your consumer electronics
well I really have to hand it to you so
when is you said this is going to come
on the market when you can start
ordering it as of now tomorrow morning
goes on sale and will be shipping early
summer roughly the price point can you
give us through 99 okay for the device
and then nine ninety nine ten bucks for
the cartridge for two weeks of power so
you know the price of a couple of
starbucks coffees and you have all the
power you ever want that's right well
maybe we could collaborate and review in
a couple of giveaways what do you say
can maybe we can work on that weekend
thanks very much everybody I really want
to say thank you very much Ken for your
time thanks a lot i supposed to be ever
taken time to stop by the booth i would
be shaded it out guys android authority
here reporting live from CES 2013 we're
digging deep for you guys enjoy the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
