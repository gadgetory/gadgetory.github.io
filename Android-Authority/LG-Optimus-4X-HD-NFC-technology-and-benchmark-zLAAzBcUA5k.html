show you the utility that is used to do
that we use our LG tag plus now during
our LG tag plus we have our few user
profiles we have car mode office mode
sleep mode and user mode and we can edit
any one of these and we can simply clear
a tag now these tags hold little bits of
information they hold a few kilobytes of
information to program your phone to do
a certain task and to wipe them clean
see our chip back here we just simply
tap tap time to clear this is no longer
the office mode tab this is just a
regular NFC tag can program it to do
anything so we'll go to our user mode
set up the settings so when I tap this
tag do I want the sound to be on do I
want the GPS to be on I'll go ahead and
do that I will have it turn the Wi-Fi on
and I'll have it turn the gps on and we
can also start an application we want to
launch so I'll tap the a droid zip route
and we will start our applications we
can write on the tag so now that tag is
written so if we have our phone bring it
to our home screen bring our tag into
play now it opens our Android zip did
some stuff with our sound turn down the
Wi-Fi and turned on the GPS so that's
the functionality of the NFC tags and LG
is really pushing this technology
because a lot of the Android 4.1 art
phones are using the same thing so now
let's test the processing power of the
NVIDIA Tegra 3 will just go ahead and go
to our quadrant standard and run a
benchmark now what a benchmark does is
it actually test your CPU your 2d
graphics your 3d graphics as well as
your memory and our benchmark is over as
you can see here we have our results our
device got a 5019 score which is just
incredible you can see it beat out the
HTC One X as well as the Asus
Transformer Prime and phones like the
Galaxy Nexus are all the way down here
usually clocking around 3,000 in some
sort of score but this is an incredible
score the NVIDIA Tegra 3 really did a
good job of performing see here we have
a 12,000 and 44 scored for the CPU
that's really high
we have a very high benchmark 5019 that
is a very very good score guys if you've
got more questions or you want to pick
this phone up I suggest checking it out
