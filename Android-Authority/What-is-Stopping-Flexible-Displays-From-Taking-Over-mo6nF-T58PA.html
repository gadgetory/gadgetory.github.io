display revolution for years now so
where are they even Uriel's impressive
flexible color display with a 0.01
millimeter thickness and less than one
millimeter rolling diameter that was
unveiled way back in 2014
still hasn't appeared in a fully
flexible commercial product as dr. Leale
told us it's quote a high investment
area and no one has experiences out in
products for flexible displays yet
because no one is making enough of them
there are many different materials
semiconductors conductors insulators and
barriers that you have to combine into a
very thin film if you change a single
material you probably have to change
other materials as well to make
everything compatible so it's not just
one single innovation and that makes
sense but he also claims that it's not
only the materials it's the
corresponding processes device design
circuit design and product design all
that is new also but I know what you're
thinking you're thinking Jase come on
we've seen flexible displays floating
around the tradeshow for two years now
why is no one put a product together yet
in one word it's volume volume is key
we've had discussions with different
manufacturers before and they've all
been really interested in flexible
displays but if you don't have large
volumes even if the technology is very
interesting they can't take the risk on
a new project this is why Roy ole has
raised over 200 million dollars in
capital to start its own production
facilities in China for flexible display
panels so when can we expect to see a
smartphone with a truly flexible display
I can't say exactly when that will
happen to dr. Liu but he did say that we
can expect something new from his
company this year for more mature
products perhaps a few years and it's
not all about foldable displays either
folding and unfolding is just the first
step in the future you'll be able to
roll displays up like a pen and unrolled
it to have a much larger screen it's an
exciting future to be sure but one
that's always been just out of reach but
dr. Liu is optimistic once we get larger
volumes many opportunities will open up
he's not worried about the market the
market is there this is why they're
scaling up production so what do you
guys think what are the
uses for flexible and foldable displays
how can you see this affecting you and
your device let me know in the comments
below I will be reading them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
