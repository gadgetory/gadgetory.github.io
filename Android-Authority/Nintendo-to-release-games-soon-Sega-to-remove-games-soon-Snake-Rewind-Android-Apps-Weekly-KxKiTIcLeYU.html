brought to you by the new york times
hello buggin ladies and gentlemen I'm
Joe Hindy the android authority I and
welcome back to Android apps weekly Sega
is taking games down and Nintendo is
releasing them let's talk about it
Corbin Davenport has made headlines
before by getting emulators to work on
Android wear and he's added again this
time he used a mini vMac to emulator and
managed to get the old macintosh to OS
running on android wear as you can guess
it's buggy and terrible but it does work
and that's awesome earlier this week
Google announced that they are going to
shut down editing in map maker this
comes in the footsteps of the now
infamous edit that showed an Android
peeing on an apple this decision is
likely to prevent things like that from
ever happening again Sega made an
announcement that they will be removing
games from the Play Store that do not
meet their standards it's really just
some housekeeping but some believe that
the games aren't good enough all others
believe that the games aren't making
enough money we don't know which games
are getting candid just yet the google
play store got a new feature this week
developers can now allow users to
pre-register for applications and games
that aren't out yet if you pre-register
you'll get a notification when that app
or game becomes available there are a
few titles using it already and this can
help generate buzz for their new content
in our last headline this week Nintendo
has announced that they will be
releasing five games by the end of 2017
with the first one coming this year we
have no clue what kind of game it's
going to be but Nintendo did say that
they were not going to port old games to
mobile I guess we'll see how this pans
out when the first game gets released
for even more Android apps and games
news updates and releases don't forget
to check out this week's newsletter
which is linked in the video description
below there you can find the full range
of stuff that happened over the course
of the last week if you're so inclined
you can even sign up with your email
address and we'll send you the
newsletter to your inbox every single
Friday so you can stay up-to-date ok
folks is take a look at the apps and
games that made a big splash this week
herocraft Z is a new RPG released by end
games it features decent graphics
powered by the unity 3d engine a full
campaign mode
the ability to assemble and build your
own team there are some online
components as well that include a PvP
arena you can collect over 50 companions
with various ability it's a premium game
through and through but it is free to
play and it doesn't look half bad after
a few weeks of waiting the highly
anticipated snake rewind game is now
available on the Google Play Store as
you heard this is a revamp of the
classic snake game that adorned the cell
phones of old and the mechanics remain
largely intact the controls are a bit
wonky as they rely on position based
tapping and there are n app purchases
which feels a bit weird but overall it
feels like a positive experience and a
good source of nostalgia with a cheap
price tag bleep is a new messaging
application from believe it or not
BitTorrent the idea here is privacy
messages are stored on user devices and
not in the cloud like usual while every
message sent is encrypted and the
encryption keys are also stored on user
devices and not in the cloud there are
various ways to sign up the UI isn't
half bad and you can invite people using
your public key is similar to blackberry
messenger if you need privacy this is a
great way to do it but do beware of
those release day bugs wild bleep
focuses on security trumpet totally
doesn't the idea of this photo messaging
application is that photos you sent show
up on the recipients device above the
lock screen they can then interact with
it if they want to or swipe it away and
go back to using their device it's a fun
premise especially if you love sharing
photos with people of course I can see
this going very badly if you know
someone who likes to take inappropriate
photographs in any case it's totally
free and worth the shot just beware of
those release day bugs last up this week
is a game called see beard which is a
new game that saw some moderate success
on iOS our own andrew grush liking the
game to a mixture of Zelda win maker and
animal crossing and it totally feels
like a Nintendo game it features
colorful cartoon graphics with a lot of
content for you to do and plenty of
other features it's been noted that in F
purchases are a tad heavy but with a
little bit of patience you can get past
that obstacle it's free to play and it's
available right now thanks again for
watching this week's show everybody but
let's get down to some serious business
the New York Times recently went through
a lot of trouble to overhaul their
application included in the massive
update was a complete design overhaul
that follows
standards of hollow and material design
and it does look really good add to that
the world-class news coverage a few good
features like Twilight mode and the
ability to customize your news reading
experience and you have an application
that's definitely worth checking out it
is subscription-based but you can try
out the application for free and read a
few articles every month without buying
anything so it can't hurt to try it out
we'd like to thank the New York Times
for their support of Android apps weekly
