authority and LG's latest addition to
its G Series lineup is playing it much
safer this year but it's also pushing a
few boundaries on what the future of
smartphones should be at the same time
knowing what's on the smartphone horizon
for 2017 LG is going to be facing some
stiff competition so let's go ahead and
find out if the g6 has what it takes to
gain LG some much-needed traction in
this first look so this is the LG G 6
and no it's not modular anymore but
after the g5 more-or-less became a
failed modular experiment I don't think
this was all too surprising of a move
instead LG is taking a more conservative
approach with the g6 and following the
current smartphone trend which is if you
haven't guessed it is metal and glass
pretty much every flagship smartphone is
made of metal glass or a combination of
the two and with the g6 you have a metal
frame which chamfered edges sandwiched
between two pieces of gorilla glass it's
a combination that we've seen many times
by now and while it's not the most
inspiring design it still has some of
LG's more iconic design features like a
rear mounted power key and yes for those
of you who are wondering the g6 does
come with a headphone jack there's a
couple of things that change with this
new design and these changes are huge
first off because this sealed in design
you're no longer getting a removable
battery but at 3300 milliamp hours you
are getting one of the largest batteries
LG has ever put in one of their phones
secondly although you're losing the
removable battery this new design has
allowed LG to make the g6 ip68 dust and
water resistant and what's how valuable
this feature is starting to become to
even the most average of consumers I
think it's a trade-off that is
completely worth it
where LG is really pushing boundaries is
on the front the bezels on this phone
are crazy thin not only on the side but
also along the top and bottom it's got a
5.7 inch screen but when you hold it
you'll have a very hard time believing
that this is a 5.7 inch smartphone it's
surprisingly easy to use in one hand a
lot of that also has to do with a
screens new aspect ratio it's a quad HD
screen with 18 by 9 or 2 by 1 aspect
ratio if you simplify it which makes the
screen taller and narrower allow you to
more easily
wrap your hands around it this new
aspect ratio also means that if you
split the screen in half width wise
you'll get two perfectly symmetrical
squares and LG has tweaked their new
interface to take advantage of this
you'll notice that many of LG stock apps
have been updated to follow the natural
guidelines or proportions created by the
two by one aspect ratio and even
elements like the new lockscreen and
wallpapers were designed with this
aspect ratio in mind the screen has
built-in HD our support for brighter
sharper and more brilliant colors and
both Dolby vision and HDR 10 are
supported here so you'll be able to
enjoy movies and TV shows from streaming
services that offer HDR content like
Netflix or Amazon Prime video you might
have noticed the corners of the display
are also rounded to sort of match the
rounded corners of the phone itself and
while the rounded corners are a nice
aesthetic touch it actually does serve a
practical purpose usually when you drop
a phone the majority of the time it
tends to land on a corner and having the
corners of the display rounded off
allows the stretch of the impact to be
better dispersed which helps improve the
phone's overall durability and reduces
the odds of getting a shattered screen
the g6 does have wireless charging in a
hi-fi deck but unfortunately these
features are region specific the u.s.
model is going to be the only version
that gets wireless charging while the
hi-fi DAC will be limited to select
Asian market and LG's reasoning for this
is that they tend to include features
based on consumers wants and needs in
each particular region so for example
the US has a very high demand for
wireless charging hence why the US
version gets wireless charging but the
other regions including Korea do not
there's a dual camera system on the back
with one standard and one wide-angle
lens but unlike the g5 or V 20 where
there were two different resolutions LG
has made both cameras the same
resolution for the g6 so ultimately what
you have here is two 13 megapixel
cameras which means you won't be losing
any resolution when switching between
cameras and LG has also improved the
transition between the two cameras and
made it noticeably smoother 13
megapixels is a step down from the 16
megapixels that LG was using previously
but LG said the reasoning behind the
reduction in megapixels was in favor of
getting rid of the camera bump but this
sacrifice and resolution didn't result
in bigger pixels and the aperture still
remains the same
previous LG phones at F 1.8 so although
we don't know just yet how it's going to
perform in low-light it is a concern at
the moment the camera app itself did get
a little bit of a refresh again this is
another one of LG's apps that got
updated for the two by one aspect ratio
and LG has leveraged the extra
horizontal space by allowing to see
multiple previews of photos that you
take in instead of just the one photo
that most smart phone cameras typically
let you see one of the biggest changes
to the camera is that LG has brought
manual video recording to the g6 which
means you no longer have to wait for the
V series if you want manual video
control inside it's got your typical
flagship specs will be snapped during a
twenty one four gigabytes of RAM and 32
gigs of internal storage there is a 64
gigabyte version as well but this is
another feature that's going to only be
available in certain Asian markets but
all models do have the micro SD card
slot with support for up to 2 terabytes
if you need the extra storage
some people might be disappointed that
it's not running the newer Snapdragon
835 but LG made it pretty clear to us
that they're not trying to win the spec
race anymore and instead are focusing on
trying to deliver a smooth and optimized
user experience which they feel is more
important to consumers it will be
launching with Android nougat and just
like LG does every year they've updated
the GUI for the g6 it's got a refreshing
new look with natural and vivid colors
they can see throughout many of the app
and new set of included wallpapers LG
has also updated the icons to make them
all the same size and more uniform
you'll notice that they are all now
rounded squares to complement the
rounded corners of the display and other
elements like the background of a folder
and pop-up menus all have rounded
corners to match the g6 also comes with
Google Assistant on board which is
really good news so you no longer have
to buy a pixel if you want a phone with
Google assistant and this also makes the
g6 the first non Google phone to be
running Google assistant this has been a
quick hands-on look of the LG G 6 for
more on the g6 check us out at and
