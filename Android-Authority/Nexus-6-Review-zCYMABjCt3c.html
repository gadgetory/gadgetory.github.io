that are available today there is one
line that Android purists look toward
the most and it's the Nexus after some
fears that the entire Nexus line was
going to be scrapped a new bigger larger
and overall greater Nexus appeared and
it just might be one of the most
anticipated yet polarizing releases of
the year hey it's Josh regard from
Andhra Authority what's going on
everybody and here is my full review of
the Nexus 6
the Nexus has grown up literally into a
large form factor device that directly
rivals the many we've seen released this
year design-wise we have a phone that is
akin to a very large new Moto X this is
Motorola's envisioning of a Nexus device
after all with the button layout all on
the right side a distinct curve on the
back that also provides curves to the
metallic sides two grills on the front
how's the phone speaker and the dual
audio setup some might be surprised to
find no LED notification light here
anymore this is for a specific reason
that we'll get to in the software
section the large 5.9 six inch panel
manages to keep the bezels pretty
respectable and is covered by a 2.5 D
glass for that subtle rising curve all
around elements on the top and bottom
are centered and the lines of the
metallic frame make for a really slim
profile the optics for the camera the
dimple for the Motorola logo that is
more reminiscent of the original Moto X
and the large landscape Nexus logo all
adorned the back this hard plastic
doesn't get smudged too easily
especially in this white edition and
that signature moto curve tries to help
with the ergonomics but that's when we
get into the handling at first hold this
phone simply felt too big but I realized
that was in hindsight afterall the
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is the same size
pretty much as the Nexus 6 but it did
not get the same reaction as this one
did when I unboxed it and actually found
out why I realized that it wasn't
necessarily the size of the phone but
its materials the hard plastic on the
back does tend to slip around a lot as
does the metallic frame which actually
doesn't have a very uniform size due to
the curve that this phone has so for
those of you out that have larger hands
and then the Nexus 6 will feel more
normal to you that's perfectly fine but
for the rest of us there's more to
contend with with this phone than just
sighs it also has to do with what
material it's made of all in all though
the Nexus 6 is simply exquisite taking
Motorola's updated design language and
bringing it to the Android purist just
be wary of its handling experience and
the whole reason why the phone is so
large is because of the display a five
point nine six inch display adorns the
then aptly named Nexus 6 and gives it a
large screen experience it doesn't even
stop there because the quad HD display
thus brings 2560 by 1440 resolution and
493 pixels per inch for some real
sharpness simply put this screen is a
beast and its viewing experience is
indicative of that due in part to the
AMOLED construction colors remain vivid
and bright throughout without going too
overboard and having all of this real
estate in order to play games and watch
Netflix or YouTube definitely mitigates
the handling experience viewing angle is
also all look quite great and in broad
daylight the screen manages to remain
quite viewable we've said before that
quad HD doesn't quite blow away 1080p
displays personally I think that I would
have had just as much fun with 1080p on
here but even if it's not an upgrade
that is so easily noticeable it is still
highly appreciated and all the work and
play that screen allows is powered by
the best processing package available
right now the Snapdragon 805 with the
audrina 420 + 3 gigabytes of RAM it's
obvious that Motorola and Google were
going all-in with this phone and it
shows in all aspects thus far
coupled with the optimized and
beautifully designed Android 5.0 smooth
doesn't even begin to describe how well
this phone performs only when I was
going at an incredibly rapid pace and
loading certain functions like the
camera out of nowhere did I find a
little more extra loading time but for
everything else the Nexus 6 excels with
the new recent apps screen also logging
your tabs in Chrome the list can get
enormous and yet the speed didn't let up
one bit in hardware the Nexus does
remain true to its more bare-bones
nature providing all of the needed tools
for connectivity but for going mainly
the addition of a microSD card slot
larger 32 or 64 gigabytes of storage are
available options however while versions
of the Nexus 6 will be available via the
major carriers in the US this unlocked
version perfectly took my sim cards from
both AT&amp;amp;T Mobile call quality was
standard ly good in my main testing on
the t-mobile network with calls coming
in nice and clear on
ends and the front-facing speakers are
good to use for a speakerphone
experience speaking of those two'll
front-facing speakers they are here in
specific grilles on the front making for
a good stereo experience that is very
welcome on the nexus I wouldn't say it's
as good as the sound coming from the HTC
One phones but it is almost as high on
the quality scale clearly beating out
any of the rear or side mounted speakers
from other competitors
large phones tend to bring longevity but
unfortunately for the Nexus 6 the 30 to
20 mili-amp power unit is only capable
of providing average performance screen
on time never really got past the 5 hour
mark making a full day of work
definitely possible but never really
going past that with heavy usage you can
pretty much expect that amount of total
time especially if you're constantly on
the phone when you taper off your usage
while you can probably get a longer
amount of time given the standby time
but it never really gets close to the 2
day mark even the redesigned battery
usage area knows when the phone will
conk out and it knows it's not going to
go for a long time usually adding up to
about 12 full hours on a single charge a
battery saving mode can be activated to
turn off all of the major power sucking
features when in standby mode but that
is a trade off for a phone that should
be going the distance but only gets
about halfway there
thankfully the new trend of fast
charging has made it to the Nexus and
the Motorola turbo charger comes
standard with the phone in about 15
minutes the claim is that it will get 6
hours of battery life that was kind of
right if I had the phone off during that
charging time when the phone was on
during a charge it took longer than that
though I will admit that the time to
charge the phone definitely is shorter
than compared to other normal chargers
still it's a handy but unfortunately
totally necessary tool to have and it
means bringing the larger plug adapter
break with you in order to take
advantage of it if there was one place
that the Nexus has always had a bit of a
hole it was in the camera quality the
Nexus 4 simply wasn't a good performer
and the Nexus 5 received only a somewhat
better upgrade but now there are quite a
few great cameras in the market and if
the Nexus 6 wants to compete it has to
step its game up and with a 13 megapixel
shooter at F 2.0 aperture sporting
optical image stabilization
it seems poised to do so the camera app
is the Google camera that came out a
little earlier this year which keeps
things pretty simple with just a few
modes for panorama and photosphere but
adds in the lens blur D focusing feature
along with an enhanced version of HDR
the app is not that hard to use by any
means but a few better design choices
could have helped mainly the ability to
activate video via an extra button
rather than swiping the menu over and
selecting the mode and then you have to
go into that very menu just to access
the settings 4k video recording is
and bring some nice-looking video
panorama was mostly good experience but
some of my photos weren't stitched
together too well and photosphere is a
novel but ultimately not always used
mode at least for me but you want to
know about the image quality in a
nutshell it's a huge improvement I still
remember the first picture that I took
and reviewed in the photos gallery that
was surprised at how detailed and sharp
the photo was without going too hard on
the processing indeed your focal point
will have a very good amount of detail
to it and as far as colors go there's
still an extra bit of saturation but it
keeps the picture from straying too far
from being accurate hdr+ actually does
what it's supposed to do by capturing
all the dynamic ranges and putting them
together for a compelling shot tapping
on a dark point in the photo to up the
exposure can blow out the lighter parts
of the scene and HDR plus solves that
problem as such it's not a mode you
would have on all the time as plenty of
situations don't call for its usage and
thus will yield a photo just like in
normal mode it's a mode best used
outside where the daylight is mixed with
all the dark shadows it creates
low-light shots are actually quite
decent with the low aperture able to
capture some nice shots
unfortunately the flash isn't much help
as it harshly illuminates the subject
this is one of those concessions that I
would say hdr+ actually helps even
though it's not really made for this
situation all in all the camera is a
refreshingly pleasant surprise in the
Nexus 6 and I continue to be impressed
with it after pretty much any photo or
video that I take and finally we have
the software the crux of the nexus
experience lollipop is our new 5.0
flavor of android and it brings
optimizations atop a new look called
material design and in short it is one
hell of an update let's start from the
bottom up the lockscreen has been
reworked into a version of the new
notification drop-down allowing you to
interact with your notifications from
there by swiping them away or double
tapping them to activate you can swipe
up to unlock and to the left or right
for phone or camera respectively once
you're into the home screen is the usual
trope of having Google now as a screen
to the left returns but Google now gets
even flatter with its cards falling in
line with the material design it's when
you get into the app drawer and then all
of the folders that things get pretty
interesting you see this ripple effect
that reveals and conceals just about
everything in a fluid motion and what
the Nexus 6 is power they're all smooth
and make for beautiful eye candy
transitions permeate the entire Opera
system now making for what feels like a
seamless experience in and out of
applications all notifications have been
made into a stacking set of cards tap
the top again one time after this and
the quick toggles come up and then in
the recent apps screen there has also
been a reworked cascading series of
cards though now they also include any
tabs that you have open in chrome while
it's a nice way to get back to any of
these pages I did get overwhelmed from
time to time looking for one if I had
too many open the ambient display is a
new way of looking at your notifications
via a minimized version of the
lockscreen
that comes on when picking the phone up
unfortunately it just isn't as reliable
as the Moto display especially without
those infrared sensors on the front and
I was hitting the power button more
often than I feel I should have been
with this feature on this is obviously
Google's way of making up for the lack
of an LED notification light but even
though I haven't really paid attention
to LEDs on phones like this and quite a
long time ambient display is still an
implementation that needs a few more
improvements before the change can be
more compelling the only thing that
makes me miss the notification light is
how lollipop handles blow battery States
if you have the power saving mode set to
turn on when hitting critical levels the
top and bottom bars turn red this is
just simply jarring and honestly it was
pretty annoying to me as Android
continues to really strip away the
extras and get back to a really
simplistic place the small details are
what really made me happy and the quick
settings tapping the words Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth take you to the settings page
the battery icon was moved up top to
save some space and hitting the mobile
network icon shows you your data usage
even if sometimes the quick heads-up
notifications will cover my video or a
game they weren't gross offenders and
don't stick around for too long and as
this design permeates throughout the
different google apps
it looks like material design will help
make many more experiences better I
really like what material design is
bringing to Android 5.0 and as such I'm
a big fan of lollipop but I can see what
some people are saying if they believe
that this direction of Android is
somewhat an oversimplification
nonetheless you know how I feel about
that kind of direction after all
lollipop keeps things simple and thus
keeps it fast and finally we get into
what might be the main point of
contention for the Nexus 6 as the base
32 gigabyte version of the phone comes
in at a whopping six hundred and forty
nine dollars and the 64 gigabyte version
adds another 50 that price is pretty
steep for plenty of users as many of you
have already sounded off your opinions
but for all of the premium you get in
this device it actually isn't too far
from hitting the mark this becomes
clearer when you consider its
competitors namely the Samsung Galaxy
Note 4 that matches it in plenty of
aspects and then comes with a
replaceable battery and the S Pen or the
iPhone 6 plus Apple's answer to the
large phone space that Google is now
squarely a part of and so there you have
it the Nexus 6 it's clear that this is a
massive improvement in the Nexus line
with the bigger but higher resolution
display and all the power underneath a
better camera experience and all of the
steps taken to make lollipop the best
version of Android that we've seen yet
but in the time that I was using this
particular device I couldn't help but
think of yet another car analogy there's
the case of the road car versus the
supercar the supercar is the blazing
performer the one that you jump into
when you want the best experience
possible
instantly driving the thing but what it
lacks is often exactly what keeps you
from using it literally all the time
namely gas mileage sure you might be
able to fill it back up on the fly that
isn't always ideal and for all the
flashiness it might have the supercar
isn't the most practically designed
vehicle to bring especially in places
where its size can be more of a
hindrance than an advantage and then of
course there's the price for plenty of
people the supercar is more of a dream
than a reality within reach the Nexus 5
was like a high-end road car affordable
but then again not quite there in being
absolutely super the Nexus 6 is much
closer to that and as Google's way of
going all-in with Motorola and establish
its place in the Android Kingdom like
many people who look past their supercar
in practicalities if you look past a few
flaws of the Nexus 6 you'll have a phone
that is sleek is low on compromises and
can go from 0 to 100 real quick
