next big thing is I don't know but I can
tell you what it's not gonna be it's not
gonna be a smart phone the next big
thing in my mind is a product that
creates its own category and then
becomes the leader in that category and
today I want to talk about a possible
candidate meet Myatt skin it's a smart
underwear range featuring integrated
sensors to monitor your body's heart
rate activity posture and even your
hydration levels and temperature the
product provides haptic notifications
meaning the module will let you know
when it thinks you need a break or your
stress is too high
via Bluetooth the module will work up to
five meters from your phone it's
available both on iOS and Android and
provides a 24 hour battery life
achieving all-day monitoring on a 5 hour
charge but you should also know that
they do provide wireless charging which
improves the situation a bit and you can
also trust that over time just like
smartwatches battery life will improve
significantly over time so why oh why do
I get so excited about new categories
because it affects how we look at new
technology and that's why we're here
right I mean you and I live in a bit of
a bubble we get excited about the new
phone that's possibly gonna have a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack or the new
oneplus device that's gonna have the
latest Android update really it has
fewer and fewer impacts on fewer and
fewer people but a new category
potentially could have massive
disproportional impact on much of the
world look at McDonald's for example
great example not only did they invent
the drive-through and made hamburgers
and fries popular shakes popular
playgrounds in restaurants popular they
are the company that has the most
influence on meat in North America you
know why because they purchase more meat
than any other purchaser in North
America so they have a say on how your
meat is produced for people who never
shop at McDonald's that's a crazy amount
of influence they don't just make the
most money they have the most say
on how things happen in our society
Apple for example makes 90 percent of
the markets profit that doesn't mean 90
percent of the market share
we know Android dominates that but they
make 90 percent of the cash
Samsung being the behemoth that they are
in the smartphone market is a distant
second to Apple it's true how much
farther is LG and HTC think about that
there is a massive advantage to be first
in your category so the smart thing is
not to chase the number one person in
your category it's to create your own
category promote the category and be
number one in that category so Myatt
skin why are they candidate let's talk
about that I was reading about this
company and also listening to keynote
speeches by their CEO Tony Shaheen and
the man has vision Tony must have read
the 22 immutable laws of marketing
because in his keynote speech given a
year and a half ago he talks about why
he chose this category of textiles
specifically smart underwear why well
everyone wears underwear people buy far
more underwear and socks than they do
smart phones or computers
it's a massive multi-billion dollar
market it's also something that is close
to the skin right it's a very practical
thing if you're trying to make some sort
of smart clothes to monitor your
biometrics you want it to be tight to
your skin everyone wears it it's easy
you can wash it those modules are
removable so you're not worrying about
washing the module in the wash lots of
practical reasons why it was chosen it's
also a sexy thing to market smart
underwear now some of us may brush this
off as being a little bit of a gimmick I
mean who needs smart underwear
I don't need my temperature monitored I
don't need you to text my wife when I'm
feeling stressed if I feel stressed and
I want support for my wife I will let
her know but think about the
possibilities when it comes to health
care specifically those who don't have
the agency to care for their own health
if you've ever been responsible for
caring for a very elderly family member
there are advantages to being able to
monitor
those biometrics when you can't monitor
them yourself very closely they also
have other products they've been demoing
that not only monitor their biometrics
but can actually actuate or stimulate
muscles pretty cool think about the
possibilities for physiotherapy muscle
recovery also what came to mind for me
was newborn babies to help monitor
babies who are in their crib when they
can't be supervised you can monitor
essential information I know lots of
parents would like that I would have
liked it
when I was a new parent so let me know
in the comments below what you think the
next best thing could be a leader in a
new category it doesn't have to be
wearables it could be just general
internet of things or something
completely different I would love to
hear it in the comments below or on
Twitter like me do you like ultra-thin
phone cases if so you just need
protection against everyday wear and
tear and our sponsor has super-thin
cases price just right for all major
phones you can go to minimal case calm
