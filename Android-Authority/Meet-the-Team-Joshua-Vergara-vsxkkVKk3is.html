Vergara and as a lot of you out there I
keep asking even now in the beginning
you used to ask if I was just Filipino
in general but now it seems the question
is I might have
Filipino let me clear it up for you I am
full Filipino and I will tell you this
right now I am definitely proud to be
Pinoy as for my next fact well there's
something missing hold on a second
ah they're much better one thing about
me that you will definitely see more
often my videos is T and you probably
see it in the background of some of the
videos already but the bottom line is
Josh V loves is T from the work that I
do with the videos and the writing on
the website I think it would be clear
that my hobbies are writing photography
and videography let's talk about the
writing for a second when I was in high
school I actually wanted to be a print
journalist and unfortunately newspapers
aren't necessarily that big anymore so
the new media was where I had to go at
least for me on the creative side of
things I actually performed spoken word
I wrote and performed spoken word one
quick story about that when it comes to
spoken word I really just focused on
open mics I wasn't really a competitive
slam poet but I will tell you that one
time I did compete in two in a poetry
slam without even knowing it I went to a
great show down in San Diego and I
thought it was just an open mic but once
they got onto the stage I realized well
it's a poetry slam and a poetry slam is
where you take the poems that you write
and you perform them and people will end
up rating them in the audience well I
went up there and I had two poems in my
back pocket so I just went ahead and
performed them to the best of my ability
I was just really happy to be on stage
and I didn't really expect to place at
that slam but I almost did I came in I
think fourth place at that slam and if I
was third place I would not have only
gotten a cash prize but I would have
moved on to the later competitions the
higher echelon competitions which was a
pretty big deal so poetry has been a big
part of my life I have not been able to
write lately but I do hope so I hope
that I will be able to get back to that
creative form of writing and maybe once
in a while on my own personal channel
I'm going to show you a few poems of my
own love is not reserved for just one so
I pull you in wrap my arms around and
feel the heartbeat feel the heart
because of that one solitary moment
well I'm racing with the same love I
show a mama ma Baba my brother my sister
my friend my girl my unborn children and
that on March 1 disease because that's
all the same and that's for you I mean I
know you very much together we may not
have much of the past but I hope you any
one of you you see the way I do
does it not be a blast and I refuse to
let past chance pass after that let's
move on to photography well when it came
to photography I just randomly bought
someone randomly bought my first camera
which was a panasonic lumix gh1 and I'm
using the gh4 now so you could say that
I'm a big lumix fan and I just started
taking photos with the kit lens I got a
couple of vintage of Canon lenses I
started to play around with and it was
from there that I start to just take
photos every now and then and post them
on places like Facebook and Flickr kind
of a simple story when it comes to that
but it did lead me to one of my best
friends who saw my photos and said I had
the eye and they wanted to bring me on
to help them with weddings it was a
wedding photography studio that my best
friend Brian made down in San Diego with
a couple of his buddies they taught me a
lot about the video side of things
because that was where I was put and
video became one of the things that I
really got into video has always been a
big part of my life as well even more so
than photography because as I grew up I
had one of those little flip cams that I
would use to just document I always
loved vlogging if you go if you go look
on my personal channel here on YouTube
you'll find a couple of interesting
videos not only do I have a some of my
own personal vlogs that we're know we're
just kind of simple having fun like the
Costco challenge eyes are seeing right
now where I tried to eat ten dollars
worth of Costco food at the food court I
miserably failed but we moved on from
there and I started to dabble in
podcasting I created my own video
podcast called talking and cursive and
it was just me my best friend CJ my
cousin and best friend Micah and the
three of us would just get together as
the intro says the showing we're a few
buddies get together we may or may not
have a few drinks today is May not but
the end result is as always we talk in
cursive it was honestly one of the best
experiences I've ever had because it was
just really fun to be able to come
together with two of my best friends and
just talk about
whatever and this one of my favorite
formats when it comes to the new media
and I really hope that I'll be able to
not only bring that in the future to
let's say Android Authority if the stars
align but also bring back talking in
cursive in some capacity and be able to
host my own podcast just to have some
fun of my own and to be able to share
all of that with you alright so the next
fact about me is probably a bit of a
cliche especially for someone like me
who is a Filipino but I love food I
wouldn't necessarily call myself a
foodie but I do love trying out new
things and being from SoCal born and
raised
I definitely love me some food trucks
and here are some food here's some
footage of what I did about a week ago
little over a week ago to celebrate my
25th birthday so all of you who greeted
me happy birthday thank you guys very
much
and yeah I went with my best friend
another one of my best friends to the
DTLA night market and this is just a
quick look at all the things that I did
there everything from the food to even
some art that I picked up there's
actually another reason why I wanted to
talk to you about the night market and
that's because I want to extend an
invitation to all of you if you happen
to be in the SoCal area specifically in
the wonderful 6:00 to 6:00 then I invite
you to come and hang out with me at the
6:00 to 6:00 night markets at the San
Anita racetrack to not only just be able
to meet me have a drink with me eat some
awesome food with me but you know even
though it might be a month late you can
probably just celebrate my birthday with
me as a result you'll be able to come to
the Santa Anita racetrack there's a
small admission fee you can head over to
the 6:00 to 6:00 night market calm for
more details and if you guys want to
come and meet me you can find me I will
tweet out where I will be during the
show but I'll likely be at the huge cup
of boba that they have at the center of
the entire market so I hope to see some
of you guys there and if you come by
well let's go have some drinks together
eat some food and have some fun you can
meet me Josh a regard of Android
Authority speaking of Android Authority
let's go ahead and move on to how I even
became a part of all of this and it
might feel like I've been here for quite
a while because of the sheer number of
videos I've done because of all of you
who know me now as a part of Android
Authority but truth be told I've only
been here about a year and a half two
September's ago I had just gotten off a
job working IT support for a big
financial company and before that I did
tech support at my school for four whole
you
and it was somewhere in the middle of
that time with my school doing tech
support for students and faculty that I
did a commercial for for my from from my
office and it turned out to look really
good it was using my lumix gh1 and one
of my colleagues and also my boss at the
time said you kind of have a knack for
this maybe this could be something
you'll do in the future well sure enough
a few years later I found myself looking
for a new job and I found the
application for Android Authority a few
hours later Darci likova himself the one
of the founders of Android Authority
went ahead and called me it was really
within a few hours that he called me and
just said I saw your application and I
knew I just had to talk to you the
moment I saw it and sure enough he was
calling me from Hong Kong if I remember
correctly he had just got done filming
one of the now-famous
a drug test that we did that year and he
said yeah we want to see what you can do
so they put me on a couple of videos and
my first ever video if you look back at
it and awesome footage of it right here
for you man I was really green at the
time I really wasn't anywhere near where
I am right now in terms of my
cinematography and my presentation
skills but it was the Nexus 7 top tips
and tricks and at the time that original
Nexus 7 was a big deal and I just gave
my thoughts on it and what things I
would do with my tablet that I feel like
all of you guys should be doing with
yours that video did pretty well and
from there I went on to do my first ever
review and it was on the lg optimus G
and it was the sort of spiritual
Brethren of the Nexus 4 that came out at
the same time and I absolutely loved
that phone that is honestly one of the
my favorite phones that I've ever had
the pleasure of dealing with and one day
I'm gonna get my hands on that phone
that way I have a nice momento of the
time that I became a part of Android
Authority and for all of you who have
followed me since then thank you and as
they say the rest is history so we
finally get into what I would call my
life's philosophy and it basically goes
like this the next moment is only a
moment away and essentially what that
means is well no matter what you do in
your life there's always more to come so
do what you can to be a part of this
moments while being ready for the next
one
and the way that I say it might seem a
little bit sort of roundabout ish but
that's the point of the phrase it's
because there's so many different
meanings to it if the next moment is
only a moment away then why should I let
myself get caught up in this moment no
matter how negative things are if the
next moment is only a moment away then I
should cherish the moment that I have
right now with all the positivity it has
because it'll be fleeting and just as
just as soon as I entered it it will
leave me if the next moment is only a
moment away then I should become
prepared for the next moment and do what
I can to make the next moment exactly
what I needed to be or want it to be but
also the next moment is only a moment
away then there's nothing I can do about
that so I just have to accept the fact
that these moments are coming and I must
be a part of them as best that I can
take from it what you will but the next
moment is only a moment away is what I
live my life by and one of my favorite
aspects of it aside from the fact that
it's multifaceted is that well I'm only
human and I may or may not really
succeed in following my own life's
life's philosophies but that's okay
because even if I fail in this moment
guess what the next moment is only a
moment away so with that I will go ahead
and end this first video of mine and
this meet the team segment that we will
have periodically as you already know
I'm Joshua Vergara you're watching
Android Authority and I want to just say
one last time thank you for being there
and I know for a fact that I really feel
like I have a home here at Android
authority and I view all our brothers
and sisters with me here as we all sort
of Traverse this world of tech and try
to make sense of it all and I I really
just want to say thank you for being
there because there are plenty of
moments in the last year and a half
where all of you have shown your
gratitude for me and I want to make sure
to return the favor because without you
guys I wouldn't be here living one of my
dreams when I was in high school I
wanted to be a print journalist but I
also wanted to write about technology
and now not only am i doing that
it has afforded me many firsts in my
life being able to make my first youtube
video that was at least you know very
successful and then moving on to
traveling the world
going to CES for the first time MWC
going to Beijing for four random phone
releases and then going to Aoife in
Berlin just 2013 was an awesome year and
it only has been getting better from
there and my time with Android Authority
has been some of the best times in my
life and I just want to extend my
gratitude not only to the wonderful team
that work with me here everyone for the
bosses to the to the riders to the
fellow youtubers Joe Jace Kevin the tech
ninja and of course lon um I just want
to give my thanks to all of you because
you all get to watch it and you all get
to lend your support by watching our
videos and and telling us what you think
and just being there with us and I
wouldn't have it any other way so from
the bottom of my heart thank you and I
want you all to know that we're going to
be here for a while I know that I hope I
will be and I will continue to bring you
the best that I can whether it's on
Android authority or through my own life
on my own channel and I hope that you're
there with us so cheers to all of you
and remember the next moment is only a
moment away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
