against anything to stand up straight
I actually I usually just I usually use
my business card I mean dude that'll
fall over as I'm gonna be interacting
with this because I'm gonna need to come
around or we could just put the award
right here and put it against it can you
get I entered Authority I put it right
here
well we might talk about how it's a best
of CES so it might be worth putting it
here like maybe we could do it and that
I leave ya outside then you can see the
front of it hopefully doesn't slide oh
yeah yeah we do have to be done just a
little little peace
we tape it to the back or something
this is a live shot or tape delay or
it's gonna be live on gun - yeah
you
yep
t-mobile's only carrier we're talking
oMG GSM networks so I think it forgot
blocked for GSM networks yeah yeah she
mostly had to like blade and stuff
you
hi everybody this I'm David and I am
here with Razer today because they won
our best of CES award and we just wanted
to talk about the new project Linda as
well as some other projects that they're
announcing some new partnerships so why
don't you tell me a little bit about
project windows yeah definitely so this
is the concept we're showing off at CES
2018 it's project Linda and basically
what we've done is we've taken our razor
smartphone and added the versatility of
a laptop to it by docking it into the
touchpad area using it as a touchpad in
its most basic form but our real concept
is lighting up both screens and having
unique content on both screens so you
could have user interface down here if
you're playing a game you could get your
score your inventory yeah if you're
doing creative work you can get tools
down there so a really innovative way to
use the Android platform in a laptop
format yeah I've noticed you guys have
done that before with the original blade
Pro it had the separate keys and all the
separate screen on the side so you can
do websites and stuff can you kind of
interact with different web sites on
that screen too so yeah our vision is
really to be able to do anything with
that screen so whether it's taking parts
of an application and bring them down
there like tool sets or galleries or
having a complete separate application
running there so if you're playing a
game maybe of a YouTube walkthrough
video running on the small screen though
the possibilities are really limitless
when you unlock the potential of both
devices yeah are you are you planning on
maybe making any sort of partnerships
with different app makers like Lightroom
or
I don't know different apps that would
work well on the razor phone well you
have something going on the laptop yeah
we have an extensive history of working
with different developers on a lot of
different projects we definitely are
very open minded and welcome everyone to
develop for this kind of platform so we
expect you know developers out there
that have those great apps to really
embrace the idea of having a whole
second screen that they could take
advantage of right right and I wanted to
ask you when we actually went to do our
hands-on I think I forgot does this use
those speakers at the razor pro because
I know that that's a huge feature okay
so it does yeah so that was one of the
benefits of using the razor phone for
this device is it's such a great
platform to start from not only does it
have the Qualcomm 835 and eight gigs of
ram in the beautiful hundred and twenty
Hertz ultra motion display we have that
amazing speaker of stereo speaker set
there sounds awesome in the phone and
sounds awesome in project Linda okay
yeah can you talk a little bit about the
specs of project Linda you know it's not
just a docking station mmm it's got some
it's have its own components as well
yeah so you know obviously keyboard and
screen are the most visible ones but on
the inside we've got a battery in
project Linda and that acts as a power
bank charging the phone while it's
docked so the idea is why you're working
you're gonna walk away with more charge
than when you start it on the phone
right we also have internal storage so
if you want to backup the phone to an
offline device you could do that or if
you want to offload content apps that
you're on coming to use in the mobile
platform you could do that as well so
keep some music or different movies that
you want to stream off your phone yeah
awesome I don't I see you've got a USB a
port and here in a USB C port yep so do
peripherals like mice or hard drives are
they gonna work just as well yes
definitely anything basically any USB
device that android supports it's going
to work just fine with Project Linda
we've plugged a new on numerous things
into it including our new Mamba hyper
flux and Firefly hyper flow wireless
power my mouse and mouse pad work
beautifully right out of the box no need
to do any type of tweaking or setup
interesting okay so I know that that's
not directly associated with Android but
with the Mamba hyper flux and the hyper
flex pad do they connect over Bluetooth
or is that so you can plug in the
mousepad and then you can just use the
mouse exactly yeah so it's you know for
the power delivery its inductive
charging to a capacitor that's in the
mouse so no need for a battery makes the
mouse super light great for FPS games
and then the wireless transmission is
done via a proprietary 2.4 gigahertz
right and then if you do want to just
take it on the go you can unplug from
the mousepad plug into the mouse and you
have a wired mouse Wow nice do you see
anyone using mice and keyboard in mobile
games cuz I know that at least with
professional shooters and that kind of
stuff on desktop you have a huge
advantage of it using it might come out
something keyboard look do you see
people interacting with it in that way
in games like there's a lot of new RTS
games that are popping up right now yeah
definitely I think a lot of developers
are open minded for a supporting mouse
and keyboard yeah and why they might
design it for touch the ones we talk to
they're really open minded to letting
users play the way they want to play so
if they want to hook up a mouse and
keyboard they want to support that yeah
yeah that's interesting because then you
can kind of take the entire RTS
experience and really get hands down
with it on your computer
totally so I think something that a lot
of people are a little nervous about is
like can I really use my phone while I'm
using this laptop like why would I move
my entire phone into a laptop what are
you doing to make sure that you can
really handle all of the features of
your phone but in a laptop perspective
yeah so what we wanted to do is add a
lot of functionality but we also want to
be conscious to not take away
functionality from the phone so for
example communication if you're doing
voice or visual calls we have a webcam
built in the top with the dual array
microphone if a call comes in it'll pop
up just like it does on your Android
device you can accept it on project
Lynda you could quickly undock and take
it on the handset or start on one and
then undock and mid call and continue on
the end so so it will come right out and
it'll just transfer you yeah it's super
easy to dock and undock we take a look
at that now a little demonstration so up
here this is the dock undock button we
press that to disengage the phone simply
pull the phone out of the chassis here
we got a nice soft material so there's
not a lot of metal on metal and then
when you want to put it back in you just
drop it back in
and hit the button there in lights right
up there comes right back to the sentier
desktop so what you're seeing there is
senti Oh desktop it's an app available
in the Play Store we've worked with them
to modify it a little bit for this
project but what's great about it is
this brings as desktop familiarity to
the Android operating gasp them so you
get you know ability to launch a menu of
applications two fingers scrolling alt
tab to switch between apps splitting
windows all that supported really
smoothly with that overlay yeah I
noticed that this kind of overlay is
very different a lot more like Windows
you know when I in my video a lot of the
comments for oh I think it runs Android
like I don't really want to use
something in a laptop form factor to run
this Android cuz we've seen in the past
people that try to make tablets into
laptops yeah and they really don't work
very well because Andrew it just isn't
really optimized for a computer you know
so when I saw this you know it looks a
lot like Windows yeah so I think a lot
of people are probably going to latch
onto that yeah we wanted to make that
transition really smooth for people yeah
I'm so for people that are familiar with
Windows but they also know Android kind
of the best way to merge those two and I
think sentía has done a great job with
that application and do you unlock the
laptop the same way you don't lock your
phone I say the same yes so we've got
the power button fingerprint sensor
available so if you register your thumb
might be the easiest way to get to it
when we're sitting in front of it
that way you're opening the lid and also
unlock in the exact same time nice so
how far back do you guys conceptualize
this because I mean you only came out
with the razor found a few months ago
it's already got a lot of good press
it's a really great phone how long ago
do you start thinking about this laptop
because I know that you guys probably
plan it pretty far ahead for these CES
projects yeah I don't know the exact
start date of the project but definitely
started ahead of the phone launch yeah
we've been working on it for we
staunched at November first a man
working on it well before that I think
we also had a leg up in the sense the
design idea of our phone and our laptop
is very similar yeah they both are cnc
aluminum they both have similar edges
and lines to them so getting it to look
and feel like they were born together
was was you know naturally easy the
engineers would probably kill me for
saying that it was easy for me hard for
them I'm sure yeah well it's very
beneficial because I know that you guys
the same metal as the razor blade on top
so you're you're pretty much just
sticking in a missing piece yeah exactly
yeah so talk anymore pricing and
availability we don't have either of
those set right now so what we're doing
out here is we wanted to show off this
concept we got it to a point where it
was you know refined enough that we
could bring it out to the show start
getting some hands-on feedback it's
actually the first time at CES we've
ever taken a concept prototype put it on
the show floor for general attendees to
get hands-on with they get feedback
fryer right oh yeah but for people to
use up there I remember last year what
was the project project Valerie Valerie
she was behind a big piece of glass yeah
yeah that one we limited the hands-on
experience to just you know partners and
press mainly on this year we wanted to
widen the net a little bit and get more
feedback from the rest of the population
at CES right and it's been a tremendous
success I can't tell you how much
awesome feedback we got really helps us
refine this product and hopefully bring
it to market so yeah I've got to say
like it's one of the most refined
prototypes I've ever seen you know from
you guys from anyone thank you so I'm
really excited about this product
personally one last thing a lot of
people worry worried about the longitude
e of the product like you know there's
gonna be a razor phone to eventually
probably okay I can't say that but you
know yeah but how are you going to deal
with being able to put in a second look
you know theoretically a second phone
because phones are year-over-year
different you know yeah so I think it's
definitely something we'll need to be
conscious of you know should project
Linda develop into a commercial product
we'll need to be conscious of that
roadmap decisions for the phone in the
future I can't speak towards future
product development but what I will say
is take a look back at our blade history
for that that product line in the five
plus years we've had it we've done very
subtle modifications to the overall
design of it you know
can't say that'll hold true for the
razor phone but we'll definitely be
conscious of the threat right the
chassis have stained very similar and
all of the all the blades over the years
great well this is fulcrum all right I
just wanted to make sure yeah so we've
got chroma running on there we've got an
Android chroma configurator we're
calling it app that gives you a lot of
similar functionality to synapse in
terms of customization yeah I'm not as
deep on the number of layers you can go
but you can get reactive effects motion
effects static effects and really
customize each individual key with 16.8
million colors can this run the full
Razer synapse application so currently
we don't have a full version of synapse
for Android but the chroma configurator
thinks the most critical one for that
project okay because other than that
there's really not about a lot of other
things the phone already has a game
booster on yeah um so that's already
kind of taken care of from the phone
side so just when we brought it to
project lindo is really taking control
of the chroma lighting there I needed to
add in yeah and you're looking to put
this at 120 Hertz as well right yeah
ideally we'd want to replicate the
experience from the phone display which
is 120 Hertz Ultra motion display onto
here so we'd want to make a
touch-enabled 120 Hertz quad HD
resolution great well do you want to
talk about any of the other
announcements that you made here I know
that I wrote a story yesterday about how
you are partnering with Philips you kind
of get the chroma experience which i
think is really cool because you put
those bulb throughout your house you're
totally immersed in that game you know
over watch your ultimate ability comes
up and your entire house turns orange
you know I can't think of a more
immersive yeah it was really exciting to
see how chrome was really evolved and
spread across not only our product line
