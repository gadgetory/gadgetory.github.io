to choose the right tools for the job
and to learn only the skills you really
need to build the kind of app that you
want to make I believe that the best
tool for Android game development is
unity it makes the whole process so much
quicker and simpler so much so that in
this video I'm going to show you how you
can get something up and running in just
seven minutes so unity is a game engine
that means it handles things like the
physics and controls it provides certain
assets for you ready-made it basically
makes the whole process of creating a
game much simpler so you can focus on
what makes the game unique and on the
assets and on the design and that unity
handle of the more advanced code
you only need very little code to get
started with unity and what you do use
you can find tons of guides and
references online to help you through
that said unity is still very powerful
very flexible and C used by a lot of
professional developers in fact many of
your favorite games from the Play Store
were probably built using unity way to
try and make a game in Android studio
you need to learn Java you need to
understand classes and libraries you
need to create the physics engine
yourself so you're handling things like
gravity and collision whereas unity does
all that for you makes it so much easier
while still being as powerful as you
could need even as a professional
developer if you're someone would like
to create an android game but you think
maybe it's too difficult it involves too
much code then I hope this videos gonna
demonstrate just how quick and simple
and easy the whole process can be I'm
gonna really run through it though so if
you want to slow things down and
understand what each step does then
follow the link in the description down
below as you'll see though the process
really is very simple you don't need any
prior knowledge and as long as you've
got unity and the Android SDK installed
on your computer already then you'll be
good to go okay so seven minutes let's
go so the first thing you want in any
game is probably play a character so
you're gonna open up paint or whatever I
mean obviously there's better tools to
use for this foot this is all about the
morality and the easiest and quickest
player character to make is
a square with a face full of attitude
this guy you're gonna take squarey
and you're gonna drop him into your game
like that so he's a sprite we also need
some platforms for him to walk on so
drag your platform into your game in the
exact same way cool thing is look you
can drag and reshape this so if you copy
that and then paste it you can make as
many as you want
select your player character squarey and
then you gonna open up up here on the
right the inspector and then the
inspector you're gonna say add component
physics 2d rigidbody 2d so this is
basically 2d physics for your character
what we're gonna do is we're going to
drag the camera onto squarey like so in
the hierarchy these along the top here
are controls that you can use to decide
what you want to do with your game
objects and that one's used for moving
stuff around if we place it right on top
of squarey
then it kind of makes more sense cuz you
can click play and now he's in the
center of the screen so anything that's
a child of anything else will follow
that thing around anyways enough talk
work okay so it selects query the
problem you can obviously see here is
he's falling through the ground so we
want to add another component and this
time we're going to add physics 2d box
Collider 2d I'm gonna do the same thing
with the platform here add component
physics 2d box Collider 2d once more and
if we copy these now then we'll also be
copying over that new Collider and the
new physics okay so now click Play and
hey that's starting to look more
promising okay now the next thing we're
going to do is create our first script
so that we can actually start
controlling what happens in this game
but don't worry it's very easy so first
of all go down to your assets folder in
the project window here and you're gonna
right-click anywhere and say create
folder script now with that open right
click and say create c-sharp script
and we're going to call this player
controls
okay so double-click on that and it
should open up the visual studio for you
here all right this is your first script
you'll see there's already some code
here I'm going to reference here because
I'm not no mister remember however I did
write the reference so it doesn't feel
like cheating alright so what we're
doing up here is we're going to create a
new object of the type rigidbody 2d like
I say don't worry too much about this
you can learn as you go it's gonna be
that same rigid body that is attached to
our player character so in order to move
our character all we need to do is say
RB which is the new rigid body which
refers to the rigidbody attached to our
player velocity equals new vector2
and that's a point that has two axes and
we're going to say one that seems like a
decent speed to start with and then RB
velocity y okay so now open back up
unity click on your player like that and
then go to add component just as you did
before and this time we're gonna say
scripts and then there you have it you
have your player control script that you
made click play
we should speed along well speed along
is a strong word but yet is he's
certainly moving make that three and
then we've three times as quickly yeah
that's challenging we want to open up
our script again okay and then we're
going to say during our method if input
get mouse button down index zero
then I'm gonna BRB velocity will why
robbing be blustery equals new vector to
the velocity X and then we'll make that
three so the player clicks the mouse
whilst the game is running then he
should move upwards now we I know you're
thinking you're saying Adam there isn't
a mouse click on Android but that's the
cool thing because a mouse click is
equivalent to tapping anywhere on the
screen bear with me
we're just going to type out some
variables and you don't need to worry
about what these mean
I will explain it all as we go
on ground so our boolean are true or
false statement equals physics 2d
overlap circle ground check dots
position ground check radius what is
ground and I'm going to add one more
thing here which is and on ground now
we're going to create a new empty game
object and we're gonna call that check
around and this is an invisible object
that we're gonna use to see if there's
an overlap to see whether or not we're
hovering over the ground of course we
want it to move as square emu so just
like the camera I'm gonna drop it
underneath square e so that it becomes a
child and now for clicks query you
should see that's in the script we have
some new options and the ground check is
a transform and take a check ground and
drop it in to ground check then I set
the radius to 0.1 we want it to be nice
and small and then now we're gonna
create our new layer mask so select your
platform and up here in the inspector
you can see it has the option for layer
and you're gonna go add layer and then
you're gonna make this layer called
ground if you click back to the
inspector you can now select ground as
your layer okay so now go back to your
player and then the last public variable
what is ground you're gonna set that to
your new layer as ground now fingers
crossed it should work unless we've have
gotten something something's on the
ground you can click click and he'll
jump when he's not on the ground he
doesn't jump there you go and that is
the basis of a fun little game and if
you follow my advice at the start this
video and you went through the
installation process and set up unity
and the Android SDK you should now be
able to test your game on your Android
phone and it's quite a great feeling
when you see it come to life on your
device ok so it's something pretty basic
but it's a great foundation to build
upon and there's not that much more code
necessary for handling things like
enemies collectables next levels and
tilt controls once you've done that you
can just focus on designing your
different graphics and dragging them
dropping them into the scene
