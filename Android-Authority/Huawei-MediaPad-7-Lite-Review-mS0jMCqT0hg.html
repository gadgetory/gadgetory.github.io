authority you're tuned into the android
authority channel on youtube android
tablets come in many sizes ranging from
as small as five inches tears largest
10.1 inches
among the various tablet sizes the seven
inch sure is still the most favored and
into that seven inch for market huawei
has unleashed the huawei media pad seven
light an entry level tablet intended for
light and casual use on the go what does
this huawei tablet have in store for us
let's find out one of the things I like
most about this tablet is its
combination of an aluminum unibody and
some hard plastic components the result
is a two-tone theme for the back and a
rock-solid build the tablet this looks
solid and feels solid someone actually
told me that I could use it as a hammer
I haven't tried that yet but it sounds
possible the front is bare and is all
black no physical buttons only the VGA
front camera is here at the corner for a
light and entry level tablet I was
expecting the media pad 7 light to have
only the basic slots and buttons but
Huawei went full monty anyway all of
them are on the right and bottom sides
here's the power button volume rocker
micro SD card slot SIM card slot
headphone jack micro USB port and
microphone hole the left and top sides
don't have any slot or button the front
panel is encased in a white frame made
of hard plastic which extends to the top
and bottom edges of the backplate they
look like envelope flaps the back itself
is mostly matte aluminum giving the bag
and air of elegance here's a 3.2
megapixel camera and the loudspeaker
grill this backplate is non removable
the seven-inch display uses IPS LCD
technology with 1024 by 600 screen
resolution effective density is only 170
pixels per inch the display looks good
and usable enough for reading or
browsing though colors tend to look
washed out and images don't appear
exceptionally crisp this is Android 4.0
0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich running here
unlike other manufacturers that
we modify Android for their gadgets
Huawei did very little modification or
skinning so most of the interface looks
and behaves just like stock Ice Cream
Sandwich I particularly like the taskbar
which she can hide by tapping this arrow
with that out of the way I get a bigger
screen to make it reappear just swipe
upwards from the bottom this feature can
be handy when you're playing games or
watching movies currently when someone
talks of like tablets I'd expect at
least dual-core processing the Huawei
media pad 7 lights idea of light however
a single core 1 gigahertz cortex a8 CPU
thankfully accompanied by 1 gigabyte of
RAM
there's also 8 gigabytes of internal
storage with about 6 gigabytes available
for the user the internal storage can be
supplemented with up to 32 gigabytes of
microSD storage with that hardware
configuration it is normal to expect
jitter and stutter and lag in many areas
don't expect the tablet to provide
smooth and seamless performance that
will make you giggle and grin this is a
light tablet even the 3.2 megapixel back
camera cannot be reasonably expected to
produce shots that can wow anyone but
the photos and videos it captures are
good enough for general use the same
general observation can be made of video
playback on this tablet I'm quite
impressed by the volume of the
loudspeakers one nice thing about video
playback using the default player is
that it can be controlled with swipe
gestures you can also lock the video
screen during video playback to prevent
accidental touch based adjustment of
volume or brightness but the thing that
I liked most about this tablet is that
not only does it have 3G connectivity
but also lets me use the tablet as a
phone I can make phone calls I can
receive phone calls though the sound
comes out of the loudspeakers at the
back so I suggest using headphones for
phone calls as for the battery according
to the spec sheet it is 4100 mAh lithium
polymer used moderately or casually this
can last 6 to 8 hours and some the
hallway media pad 7 lightest get enough
for casual to moderate use it is an
entry level tablet with specs and
performance that match
like branding the build is strong and
solid enough for use on the go the
display as expected is great enough for
reading browsing like gaming and the
occasional movie overall performance is
acceptable enough that is if you're
willing to ignore lag and stutter in
some areas judged on its own merits it
is actually an okay tablet especially
for newcomers to the 7-inch Android
tablet seen what about you what's your
take on the hallway immediate pad 7
