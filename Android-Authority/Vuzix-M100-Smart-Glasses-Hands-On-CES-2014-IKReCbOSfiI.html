by Toyota we're at CES 2014 in
showstoppers I'm Darla kuvaev Android 30
I'm here with Anne Queen guzik's and
he's just given us a pretty cool
demonstration so what do you think is
the long term plan for musics with this
particular product you mentioned it is
running on Android that's correct yes so
we will continue to evolve this product
but we also have several other products
we're evolving around the same sort of
things so this this will maintain as a
monocular device I see well we also have
a binocular device to eye device as well
that we that we'll be announcing for
these motors right now a lot of the
consumers that you talk with don't have
an idea of what they want to do so
what's going to happen here and the way
it's going to evolve is that the
industry folks that we are working with
people that work at those companies are
going to see how the devices are used
and they're gonna come home and they go
you know what if I had an app that could
do this I would get these for my home do
you consider this particular product to
be competitive to Google glass we had
you know yes yes and that in that it
does a few things differently yeah and
because we're we've been around since
1997 we actually know how the technology
will interact with the way people will
use it so for instance one of the big
differences is that we have a digital
see-through box okay and as you just saw
yeah you know it's very bright you can
see everything on there there you can
read it you can't do that a goonie if
the Sun hits it the wrong way or if
you're a surgeon with the bright lights
looking down at your patient and also
the patient data disappears your host I
see so is the patient yeah yeah
absolutely
so that's why we've taken a lot of that
expertise we have over the years and
built this device with it yes
some of the other differences is that we
don't have to be connected to the cloud
that's an option yeah we can run things
locally here if we want to because again
if you're a doctor you have HIPPA
regulations that prevent you from having
your data go outside to authorities or
if you're a large company like Amazon
you don't want Google to have your
information
no no so you want to make sure the
device works in your environment and
that you don't have to change your
business dealings to do something so
you've been doing business since 1997
and we have obviously sold quite a few
these units is sustainable this is
brand-new yes I know but in terms of how
many augmented reality sort of units
primarily we're looking at medical or
military we actually in 1997 we started
with the military yeah so we did a lot
of night vision night vision stuff you
know but in 2004 we started shipping
consumer products and those were
basically binocular 3d types of glasses
augmented reality glasses theater ya
know cinematic experience entertainment
exactly so that was sort of things yes
yes maybe you can give an Android
authority one for free showstopper CES
2014 and once again thank you to Toyota
for sponsoring our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
