D and Samsung's Galaxy a line is
designed to bring many characteristics
of their flagship smartphones and a
package made for the more
budget-conscious crowd but is this 2016
refresh the budget smartphone to get
this is the Samsung Galaxy a7 the best
way to describe the design of the Galaxy
a7 is to call it a much larger galaxy s6
because well for all intents and
purposes that's exactly what it is it's
a little bit more rectangular in shape
than the s6 but otherwise it feels
pretty familiar it may not be packing
the same power but it definitely has the
look and feel of a high-end phone you've
got glass on the front glass on the rear
and a smooth chamfered metal frame that
rounds out along the top and bottom but
flattens out on the sides the same way
the s6 does these flat metal sides
helped out quite a bit with the phone's
grip despite being made predominantly of
glass which we all know is a material
that can tend to make a phone feel
pretty slippery glass is also pretty
atrocious when it comes to deterring
fingerprints so expect to clean this
phone often unless you have the white
version where it's not as noticeable
because this is a budget device you
won't find everything that a typical
high-end Samsung phone offers the a7
doesn't include Samsung's signature
heart rate sensor on the back for you
fitness buffs although I don't imagine
this being much of a deal-breaker for
too many people
the a7 does however still include a
fingerprint scanner built into the home
button which works quite well and it's
the same touch and hold method that we
saw on the s6 and note 5 the setup
process is a little long compared to
some other phones but once you have it
all set up the fingerprint sensor is
accurate reliable and generally pretty
fast at unlocking the phone everything
else is in its typical location for a
Samsung phone you've got the capacitive
recent apps and back keys flanking the
home button the power button on the
right side volume buttons on the left
and along the bottom is the 3.5
eliminate headphone jack micro USB port
and single firing speaker the speaker is
nothing special but it gets the job done
it's not going to compare to
front-facing speakers or anything like
that but it's decently loud and produces
a clean and clear sound without
distorting even at higher volumes on the
front of the phone is a fairly large 5.5
inch display which is becoming a more
and more common display slides and
smartphones these days so you are
dealing with a decently sized smartphone
here if you're used to a smart phone
with a five and a half inch screen size
or larger you'll instantly feel right at
home and these super thin side bezels
definitely make one-hand usability a lot
easier in typical Samsung fashion this
is a Super AMOLED display so obviously
you're getting those super punchy colors
deep inky blacks wide viewing angles and
it's bright enough that outdoor
visibility has been a non-issue it's got
a resolution of 1080p with a PPI of 401
which still looks perfectly fine to my
eyes despite quad HD being the new
standard everything from web browsing
reading text watching videos and playing
games still looks very sharp and crisps
so I have no qualms about the display
whatsoever and it's generally a very
pleasing screen to look at the internal
specs are pretty run-of-the-mill for a
device of this caliber you've got a
Snapdragon 615 inside with three gigs of
RAM and performance is par for the
course
it runs reasonably well for the most
part and handles web browsing
multitasking and graphically intensive
games just fine but the phone does
suffer from the occasional animation
stutter throughout the interface when it
does happen it's quite noticeable and
due to the slower chipset the scrolling
lag from Flipboard back to the main home
screen that plagued the s6 is even more
apparent on the a7 the phone fortunately
doesn't come with a lot of bloatware
pre-installed to slow things down any
further and on first boot there's
surprisingly only a pages worth of apps
but this is most likely due to the fact
that the a7 only comes with 16 gigs
internally thankfully the a7 does have a
micro SD card slot built into the SIM
tray for up to an additional 128
gigabytes and with only 16 gigs of
storage odds are you will most likely
need one as far as network connectivity
goes there are several model numbers of
the a7 floating around out there none of
which are made for the US so you will be
missing out on those LTE data speeds you
will however get HSPA+ which was
perfectly fine for the majority of my
usage but if you absolutely have to have
those LTE data speeds you're not going
to get that with the a7 at least not in
the States on the plus side battery life
on the a7 has been extremely good it's
got a hefty 3300 milliamp hour battery
inside and this phone easily last a good
full day with normal usage and even into
the better half of a second day before I
had to put it back on a charger never
did I ever find myself having to
recharge this phone midway through the
day and the screen on time easily
surpassed the 4-hour mark sometimes even
five the a7 doesn't have wireless
charging which isn't a huge deal but it
does have fast charging which really
comes in handy for charging up such a
large battery pack and if Samsung can
get the battery life right on the a7
hopefully this means they'll be able to
do the same thing on the upcoming s7 one
of the biggest complaints on samsung
smartphones last year with the camera
bulge and while the a7 doesn't
completely eliminate that the protruding
camera lens is significantly smaller in
comparison to the s6 and note 5 and from
an aesthetic standpoint it definitely
looks much cleaner it's a 13 megapixel
camera with optical image stabilization
F 1.9 aperture and the majority of the
camera experience is the same as what
you would find on Samsung's flagships
with just a few minor exceptions
there's no 4k video recording no YouTube
live streaming capabilities and no HDR
auto there's no HDR toggle on the main
camera interface either which makes
switching back and forth between HDR and
auto mode a little slower and more
cumbersome than I would like you do
however still get the very convenient
DoubleTap of the home button that was
first introduced on the s6 to quickly
open up the camera the images that the
a7 produces are honestly mediocre at
best and well it scenarios you can get
some decent looking shots but in high
contrast or brightly lit situations
you're getting a lot of overblown
highlights crushed shadows and the a7
doesn't seem to exhibit the typical
Samsung image processing with the
vibrant colors or sharpening which makes
a lot of the photos look really dull HDR
mode does provide for a much more
balanced shot and as a slight boost in
color but without HDR audio you will
have to remember to switch to it as the
camera automatically defaults back to
auto mode each and every time the camera
is launched in medium to low light you
can really start to see the noise
creeping in
details begin to look extremely soft
colors are lacking and you're getting
those same overblown highlights as you
would in daytime shots the a7 s camera
is one of those cameras that simply just
gets the job done but it's a far cry
from what Samsung is typically capable
of the software experience is pretty
standard Samsung the a7 is running
TouchWiz on top of Android lollipop
5.1.1 and it's exactly what you might
expect from a typical Samsung phone it's
the newer version of TouchWiz that we
saw on the note 5 with the squarish
circle icons which I personally like a
lot better over Samsung's previous icons
but otherwise the general look and feel
and feature set of TouchWiz is
practically all the same Samsung didn't
really dilute TouchWiz at all on the a7
mini or getting a software experience
that's pretty much identical to
something like the s6 you've got multi
window for all your split-screen
multitasking needs useful motion
gestures like swiping your palm across
the display to take a screenshot a
one-handed mode by a triple tap of the
home button and of course the wonderful
Samsung theme store to me this is still
hands-down one of the best features
implemented into TouchWiz and if the
blue / green TouchWiz colors just aren't
your cup of tea the theme store is a
definite lifesaver there's tons and tons
of themes to pick from now including
ones to make things feel a little more
like stock Android and if you slap on a
third-party launcher in the process
you'll hardly notice that it's even
TouchWiz the Galaxy a7 is Samsung's
higher-end budget smartphone for the
year 2016 but compared to many other
budget Android phones on the market it's
not exactly cheap especially if you're
trying to import into the States you can
find it going anywhere between four to
five hundred dollars through online
retailers but at that price you're
better off considering devices like the
oneplus X Nexus 5x the Moto X Pierre
honor 5x or even the Nexus 6p with these
devices you're potentially getting a
phone that's much more powerful and you
don't lose out on LTE the galaxy s7 is a
pretty solid smartphone from Samsung and
brings many things that made their
flagship smartphones grey into a much
more affordable package but it's far
from a bargain and considering how much
the budget landscape has changed Samsung
may have to rethink a few things if the
a7 is going to stand a fighting chance
