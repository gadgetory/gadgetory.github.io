domain.com look what we found
high-quality images of the HTC One X 9
samsung isn't the only company with a
few leaked renders floating around some
new 3d mock-ups of the HTC One X 9 have
just appeared online these renders give
us a good look at all sides of the
device and some of them stack the X 9 up
against the a9 for comparison HTC looks
to have overhauled its home button
layout once again suggesting that there
may not be a fingerprint scanner
included in this model the rear camera
also shifted over to the top left on the
phone's back rather than being centered
in the middle as is the case with the a9
and m9 for better or for worse these
pictures only serve to further the
blossom discourse that has begun
asserting that HTC has quote copied the
Huawei Nexus P or even than Lenovo fat
plus while that ultimately may be for
the individual to decide the Taiwanese
company has made a point to remind us
that it actually started the whole metal
casing trend it's also worth pointing
out as some have commented that the HTC
did have a periscope bar by the camera
module some years ago with the HTC One V
now if you've been keeping up with the
general tech news you may have noticed
that Asus and LG have taken a swipe at
Apple on Twitter for their latest
so-called smart battery case that
doesn't look very Johnny I've asked
starting with Asus the company has left
right into comparisons between its own
Asus zenfone max which packs a whopping
five thousand milliamp hour battery and
the combined battery life of Apple's
iPhone and smartphone cases on its own
the zenfone max boasts longer video
playback and Internet use than the
combined iPhone products as a
substantially longer amount of talktime
37 hours versus 25 hours but LG
preferred to poke fun at the design of
the smart battery case which definitely
isn't the most attractive product that
Apple has ever created with the line
quote no bumps just goosebumps on
to describe its v10 flagship accompanied
by the hashtag the hump
the combined battery capacity of the
iPhone 6 and battery case is said to be
around 3000 492 milliamp hours which is
a little longer than the LG SB 10 3000
milliamp hour cell however you have to
wonder how many customers will be
willing to compromise on the iPhones
often praised design for the extra juice
priced at 99 bucks the smart battery
case certainly isn't the cheapest
battery boosting accessory either do you
have any thoughts on Apple's case yes
