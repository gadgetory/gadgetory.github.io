baddest Android phones of 2017 and is
probably the most highly anticipated
comparison that you've all been waiting
for so let's get right into it
this is the LGV 30 versus the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 starting off with the
specifications the LGV 30 and Galaxy
Note 8 are packing the same snapdragon
835 processor and GPU the only part
where they differ is the RAM the note 8
has 6 gigabytes of RAM whereas the V 30
has 4 but I don't feel like this extra 2
gigs of ram really gives a no AAA
performance edge at least not in normal
day-to-day use both of them run very
very smoothly whether you're launching
apps multitasking web browsing or
playing games I haven't had any
performance issues with either one
they're both very fast and reliable
phones for anything that you want to do
battery life on the V 30 and no AAA are
pretty comparable as well they have the
same size 3300 milliamp hour battery and
I can easily get through a full day on
either one with four and a half to five
hours of screen on time regardless of
how light or how heavy I use the device
they both also offer a pretty similar
set of hardware features most
importantly they both come with a
headphone jack but you've also got
expandable storage via microSD ip68
water and dust resistance wireless
charging and they both come with
fingerprint sensors on the back but the
V 30s fingerprint sensor is definitely a
lot easier to use since it's centered
along the back and more comfortable to
reach with an index finger and the fact
that it doubles as a power button is a
nice bonus the note a fingerprint sensor
is an improvement over the s8 with it
being slightly more recessed and farther
away from the camera but you can tell
this is just a band-aid solution until
samsung figures out something better
there's other methods of unlocking the V
30 and note 8 if you'd rather not use
the fingerprint sensor such as space
unlock and in the case of the note 8 you
also have the iris scanner which works
just as well as face unlock but it's
going to be a little more secure there's
a couple of things on the note 8 and the
V 30 that differentiate these phones
from one another and that's ultimately
what's going to influence a lot of
people's buying decision with the note a
it's all about the S Pen and how much
you value what it can do this is
obviously what has always made a note a
note and what the s-pen you can of
course jot down notes
not waking the entire display create
drawings translate sentences annotate
screengrabs and send gifs to people with
samsung's new live messaging feature
it's also just great as a tool that
provides more accuracy and precision
than what you can get with just your
finger what makes the p30 special or any
of the previous v-series phones is its
focus on audio photography and superior
video capabilities the v30 comes with a
high-five quad DAC for a rich audio
listening experience especially if you
have a pair of high impedance headphones
which will allow you to get the most out
of it but this quad DAC also means that
you can record high-quality audio files
and get better quality audio with less
Distortion when recording video the
other thing that differentiates these
two phones is the camera experiences and
picture quality is a pretty important
factor when it comes to deciding between
smartphone cameras but with the V 30 and
no 8 there's a little more to the
decision making process they both offer
dual cameras but with slightly different
approaches the V 30 has a 16 megapixel
main sensor with F 1.6 aperture and
optical image stabilization and a
secondary wide-angle lens at F 1.9 the
note 8 comes with two 12 megapixel
sensors that are both optically
stabilized the main sensor is a standard
angle at F 1.7 and instead of a
wide-angle lens for a bigger field of
view Samsung opted for a secondary
telephoto lens that offers 2 X optical
zoom which means you can zoom into
subjects without any loss in quality
Samsung's camera also lets you take
photos with a depth effect for that nice
blurry background which is a feature
that's pretty common on a lot of
smartphones with dual cameras but it's a
feature that LG hasn't bothered to add
to their cameras even though they've
been doing dual cameras for a while this
may sound like a cop-out statement but
whether you prefer wide or telephoto
it's really going to be up to you they
both have their own use cases but for me
personally I prefer a wide-angle lens
since I find it to be more useful in a
bigger variety of situations and to me
wide-angle lenses are just a lot more
fun to take pictures with both cameras
are pretty neck-and-neck when it comes
to quality they're great outdoors and
great in low-light and after using both
cameras the only difference that I
really noticed is that samsung's camera
has much better dynamic range it's less
likely to over
expose and blow out highlights and you
get a lot more detail in dark shadowy
areas but in terms of just overall
sharpness color and detail they're both
pretty excellent cameras where the
VIII's camera really stands out is on
the video side of things the V 30 has an
extensive amount of manual video
controls and this year LG has taken it
to the next level by offering the
ability to shoot in log format which can
later take into post-production and
grade the footage to look exactly how
you want the V thirties camera is really
the closest thing that you'll get to a
DSLR or mirrorless camera inside of a
smartphone taking a look at the V 30 and
note 8 from the outside they're made
from the same materials but they feel
pretty different in the hand you've got
two phones made mostly of glass but the
note 8 has a more boxy and angular look
to it whereas the V 30 has rounded
corners of sides and resembles the SAS
design a lot more than it does the note
8 the boxy shape and flatter sides of
the note 8 helps out a lot with the grip
but the V 30 definitely is the prettier
looking phone and feels a lot more
comfortable in the hand if you care
about one hand use the V 30 is much more
manageable since it isn't quite as tall
as the note 8 when looking at these two
phones from the front they both look
pretty similar you've got screens that
practically go edge to edge and super
thin bezels all the way around
typically Samsung smartphone displays
have been far superior to LG's but with
the V 30 LG made the switch back to OLED
which is a technology that Samsung has
been using on their smart phones for a
long time and this new display on the V
30 stacks up extremely well the
Samsung's the V 30 has a 6 inch quad HD
P OLED screen which is still an
active-matrix OLED display but LG just
calls it plastic though LED it's easily
the best screen LG has ever put on a
smart phone its vibrant colorful with
deep dark blacks and overall very
pleasant to look at the no takes display
is slightly bigger at 6.3 inches but
it's every bit as gorgeous after all it
is a Samsung display and we just expect
it to be a good screen you can't really
go wrong with either one because they're
both incredible looking displays for
pretty much anything from web browsing
watching videos playing games and they
even support HDR content in the software
department they're both running Android
newgate at the moment with their
respective software skins next to
Samsung's UI LG is a little more on the
super colorful
cartoony side it's a big improvement
over older versions of their UI but
Samsung's experience definitely feels a
little bit more polished with cleaner
animations and a more muted color scheme
feature wise though they're both pretty
similar you've got always-on displays
that show notifications and are highly
customizable with different clocks and
images there's a new feature on the v30
called the floating bar which replaced
the secondary display from the v10 and
b20 and it gives you quick shortcuts to
apps contacts meaty controls and
essentially offers a lot of the same
functionality as Samsung's edge UX for
ai assistants the v30 relies solely on
google assistant but with the note 8 you
have google assistant and Samsung's own
bixby that does add a little bit of
redundancy but there are some cool
things that it can do like asking to
change the screens brightness or
download an app that makes it pretty
useful at times so that about wraps up

the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 what do you
