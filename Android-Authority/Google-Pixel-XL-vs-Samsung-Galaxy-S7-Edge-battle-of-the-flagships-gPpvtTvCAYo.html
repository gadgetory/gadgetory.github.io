authority and how does the best that
Google has to offer
stack up to the best from Samsung this
is the Google pixel XL versus the Galaxy
s7 edge the pixel XL is arguably one of
the hottest Android phones on the market
right now and it's the first smartphone
that is entirely under Google's control
it's also the first phone that Google is
very serious about selling to the masses
and its price tag puts in direct
competition with Samsung's s7 edge and
Samsung is a company that definitely
knows a thing or two about selling a lot
of phones aesthetically these two phones
share a lot of the same materials but
they look and feel completely different
what the pixel excel you have what is
basically an all metal unibody design
with the exception of the glass window
on the back there's no question here
that the build quality is top-notch and
is exactly what you would expect from
Google but there's no denying that it
looks a lot like the iPhone and the
pixel also looks quite generic in
comparison to Google's previous Nexus
phones which always had a very unique
appeal to them much of the generic feel
of the pixel stems from the front and
the empty bottom chin and if you didn't
know this was a pixel phone you'd be
hard-pressed to figure out what this
phone was just by looking at the front
with the s7 edge you have a design that
is much more flashy and eye catching and
ever since Samsung made the switch to a
glass and metal design they've done a
really great job of refining this design
in a relatively short amount of time
with a smooth metal frame and that
curved edge glass on both the front and
the back it's one of the most
comfortable feeling phones that you will
ever hold but this mostly glass design
also makes it feel very slippery in the
hand and very hard to keep clean from
finger prints even though the s7 edge
has been on the market for quite a few
months now the engineering that went
into its design is still pretty
incredible the pixel XL and s7 edge
share the same 5.5 inch screen size but
due to the curved glass and small top
and bottom chin the s7 edge is
significantly shorter and narrower than
the pixel XL and it really makes a huge
difference in how these two feel in the
hand in terms of their size the 5.5 inch
display on both the pixel and s7 edge
are using Super AMOLED technology with
quad HD resolution and these are by far
the two best displays you can get on a
smartphone right now they look
absolutely gorgeous they're sharp
vibrant and outdoor visibility is not an
issue on either
one watching videos playing games and
browsing the web all look fantastic on
these screens and because they're super
amoled you're also getting those inky
deep blacks superb viewing angles and a
high contrast ratio the big difference
here of course is that you're dealing
with an entirely flat screen on the
pixel whereas on the s7 edge you have
curves along the edges and besides
allowing Samsung to make the phone
smaller these curved edges also come
with some software benefits you can
swipe inwards from the edge for
shortcuts to a bunch of useful things
like apps your favorite contacts the
weather sports scores and a whole lot
more
Samsung also take advantage of the
AMOLED screen by giving the s7 edge and
always-on display feature that can
display the clock calendar and
notifications with the pixel XL you have
the latest Snapdragon 820 one chip and
four gigs of ram and performance on the
pixel XL is easily the best we've ever
seen on an Android phone it really goes
to show what Google is capable of doing
when they have control of both the
hardware and the software obviously
having the latest Snapdragon chip and
pearce stock Android helps a lot here
but this phone rarely ever skips a beat
the animations and transitions are
consistently moving at a fluid 60 frames
per second and it has excellent touch
response which makes the whole
experience feel even more snappy on the
s7 edge you have the Snapdragon 820 and
the same four gigs of ram and
performance here is also quite good you
will notice some slight hiccups and
frame drops more often you would on the
pixel but generally it's still very fast
and has held up well since its release
they both support Vulcan natively which
means you're going to get much better
graphics and gameplay with Vulcan
supported games and if you're a big
mobile gamer these phones are both
perfect for it you'll find fingerprint
sensors on both of these phones with the
pixels being on the back and the s7 is
on the front embedded in the home button
there's pros and cons to the placement
of both so it's really a matter of
personal preference but they are both
very accurate and fast to unlock I will
say that I do personally prefer the
pixels fingerprint sensor a little more
simply because I don't have to press it
down in order for it to start unlocking
there's a few benefits on the s7 edge
that you won't find on the pixel XL with
the pixel you don't have a micro SD card
slot like you do on the s7 and will have
to rely on the phone's internal storage
or the cloud the pixel also does not
carry the same ip68 dust and water
protection of the s7 it is IP 53 but
this only protects the phone from light
dust and sprays of water
and it's not meant to be fully submerged
in water another feature that the s7
edge has is wireless charging and while
google has included wireless charging in
some of their Nexus phones in the past
they unfortunately chose not to include
it for the pixel phones some people may
not care about either of these features
but these are important to you the s7 is
the better option as far as battery life
goes these two phones have some of the
biggest batteries we've seen on flagship
Android phones this year you have a 34
50 milliamp hour battery on the pixel XL
and a 3600 milliamp hour battery on that
sub edge if you're looking for Android
phones that easily last all day the
pixel XL and SM Edge definitely offers
some of the best battery life you can
get on an Android phone right now I
consider myself a pretty heavy user
since I do like to do a lot of mobile
gaming music streaming and YouTube
watching on my phone and if these phones
can last my personal usage all day then
I have no doubt they can make it through
a full day for those of you who don't do
these things on your phone as often the
biggest advantage that Google made
device has and always will have is in
the software with the pixel XL you've
got Android 7.1 nougat which brings a
lot of new enhancements and you're also
getting some exclusive pixel phone
features like the pixel launcher and
Google assistant we've already covered
nougat pretty extensively in previous
pixel videos we're getting all the usual
nougat features like the revamp
notifications direct reply multi window
support dough's on the go and because
this is 7.1 you're getting some
additional features like the long press
of apps to bring up a contextual menu
and a reboot option of course with the
s7 edge you have Samsung's usual
TouchWiz interface which is still
currently on Android marshmallow it'll
surely get updated too nougat eventually
but it's hard to say exactly when that
will happen even though this isn't
running nougat you already get a lot of
what nougat brings with TouchWiz like
editable quick toggles multi window
support a reboot option and a ton of
other useful features that are specific
to TouchWiz like Samsung's game launcher
and a large collection of customizable
themes with the cameras you have a
twelve point three megapixel shooter
with f 2.0 aperture and electronic
stabilization on the pixel XL and a 12
megapixel F 1.7 aperture lens with
optical image stabilization and very
fast dual pixel autofocus technology on
the s7 edge as far as features go
samsung's camera app offers a lot more
controls and setting
whereas Google's camera app is much more
simplistic and doesn't offer a ton of
features or mana controls what really
matters the most is how these cameras
perform and picture quality is a
complete toss-up between these two
sometimes the pixel takes the better
shot and other times the s7 takes the
better shot one thing's for sure though
is that if there are two cameras
battling for the number one spot as the
best camera on an Android smartphone it
would definitely be these two they both
take excellent photos with great detail
color and sharpness I would say that the
pixel is better in high contrast
situations in terms of controlling
highlights but the s7 is much better in
bringing out details and dark shadowy
areas so depending on what you're
looking at in these photos
you could easily flip-flop back and
forth as to which one looks better in
low light is where the difference is
between these two cameras become a
little more obvious what the pixel xlu
how much more bloomie highlights when
compared to the s7 and some of this does
have to do with the halo effect that the
pixel phones have been suffering from
but hopefully this will be fixed when
Google releases its software update
you'll also notice that the noise and
the pixels low-light shots are much more
prominent and that's because Google's
image processing doesn't do a whole lot
of noise reduction on the s7 the noise
reduction is very aggressive and this
does make the noise a lot less
noticeable but it causes the overall
image to be much softer with less detail
while on the pixel the detail and
sharpness remain intact it's sort of a
matter of picking your own poison you're
either going to have more noticeable
noise with better detail or softer noise
with less detail so what smartphone is
the better choice well for me personally
the s7 edge is the more well rounded
smartphone here it has a more unique and
distinguishable design comes with extra
hardware features like microSD wireless
charging and ip68 dust and water
resistance and Samsung's TouchWiz while
very different from stock Android has
continually gotten better the biggest
advantage that you get with owning a
pixel or any previous phone sold from
Google is the guaranteed and timely
updates in a clean stock Android
experience while the pixel XL is a
fantastic smartphone in its own right if
Google had just added a few more key
features it would have really put this
phone over the top as always thank you
