rumors surrounding the HTC u12 plus are
accurate it is going to be a geeks phone
according to Evan Blass who spoke with a
person familiar with HTC's plans the u12
plus sports - 8 megapixel selfie cameras
and a 12 and 16 megapixel combo around
the back the fingerprint scanner is also
found around the back though it
thankfully occupies its own space below
the cameras reportedly below the two
selfie cameras is the u 12 pluses 6 inch
LCD panel with wqhd plus resolution if
you squeeze the phone out of frustration
over the lack of AMOLED you will trigger
HTC's second generation edge sense
software even though we don't know yet
how it differs from the first generation
edge sense the feature lets you launch
apps and shortcuts by squeezing the
sides of the phone under the hood
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and 6
gigabytes of RAM reportedly power the
you 12 plus the phone offers 64
gigabytes or 128 gigabytes of expandable
storage through the microSD card slot
and a 30 420 milliamp hour battery
somewhat average for today's big phones
now if these specs sounds familiar it's
because the HTC custom ROM developer lab
Toofer hinted at those not too long ago
lab Toofer also suggested that the u12
plus runs Android re o renter to the box
and features HTC's face sense presumably
a facial recognition feature now you
might be thinking if there is an HTC u12
plus maybe there's also going to be an
HTC u 12 but probably not seeing how the
rumored u 12 was codenamed imagine it
could be that HTC wanted to focus its
resources on one flagship smartphone
instead of two so when do we expect to
see the you 12 plus well we were
thinking in April but now we're
expecting late April early May but HTC
if you're listening take your time
produce something that matters what do
you guys think about the you 12 plus let
me know in the comments below or on
Twitter
