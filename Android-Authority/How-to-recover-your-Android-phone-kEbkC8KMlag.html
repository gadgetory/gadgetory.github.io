while talking to someone on the phone
did you bring your house keys gosh the
house keys so you stopped at the bench
sit down check your bag and place your
phone on the bench
ah keys are here and you go on your
merry way but wait aren't you forgetting
something else I don't want to be in
that situation do you but it can happen
even to the best of us and if it happens
to you will you be able to recover your
Android phone what can you do in such
cases
how can you retrieve your phone or at
least prevent the finder from accessing
your data hey there welcome to Android
authority I'm mark today I'll share some
tips on how to recover your Android
phone in case you lose it an answer
prevention is worth a pound of cure
right after you acquire your Android
phone the first thing to do should be to
set up basic security your phone's
built-in security features can save your
hide if you ever lose your Android phone
there are four basic security measures
that you can use SIM card lock if
supported by your phone screen lock
phone owner information
and phone encryption first activate SIM
card lock to set your SIM card lock go
to settings security setup sim card lock
the SIM PIN is like a passcode for your
sin your phone will ask for it every
time you power on your phone provide the
wrong code and you won't be able to use
your sim input the wrong code many times
and your sim will lock you out until you
provide an unblocking code
so always memorize your SIM PIN the
default SIM PIN code is usually provided
by your network carrier but to be safe
change the default pin to something else
next activate the screen lock method to
set this up go to settings screen lock
you can choose slide which is not secure
at all but very easy to use at the very
least choose pattern lock which provides
medium security for the greatest lock
screen security choose password lock
which requires a combination of letters
and numbers when you choose a secure
screen lock method you'll need to input
the pattern pin or password to unlock
the phone I also recommend providing
your contact information and setting it
to be shown on the lock screen you can
do this in settings screen lock owner
info at the very least provide your name
email and alternate contact numbers the
info you provide here just might prove
to be precious if a Good Samaritan finds
the phone you've lost in the part now
let's talk a bit about the fourth
security measure called encryption in
simple terms encryption garbles your
phone data in such a way that nobody
nobody but to can understand or decipher
so this is another layer of data safety
in case you lose your phone to use your
encrypted phone you need to enter the
pin at boot up time however I notice
that phone encryption is not uniformly
present in all Android phones to check
whether your phone supports it try going
to settings security or try going to
settings storage now that your phone is
safe from an authorized use your next
big step is that of backing up your
phone data
never underestimate the usefulness of
backing up your data trust me there are
numerous ways to backup your data you
can use custom recovery to make nandroid
snapshots or use backup apps such as
titanium backup or use cloud-based
backup services or use manufacturer
providing software such as samsung kies
or HTC Sync or even copy files to your
PC the old manual way I won't discuss
any of those methods here but whatever
backup method you choose always keep
backups of your data and backup your
data regularly and most recently
released phones running Google Android
you should be able to backup most of
your data to your Google account just
look for the backup and reset menu on
the settings page and enable the option
for data backup to Google servers you'll
need to specify a Google account for use
as backup account if you want you can
also enable the automatic restore
feature so that app data and app
settings will be restored on your phone
when you reinstall a previously removed
app again I emphasize always backup your
data and make it a component of your
phone security plan with that done let's
now talk about how to prepare your phone
in a way to make it easier to recover
when it gets lost we're not talking here
about merely miss placing your phone
inside your house or at the office we
are talking here about the possibility
of losing your phone at the place where
someone else could pick it up and choose
to keep it or choose to return it
the best preparation for such events is
to install phone finder apps or phone
tracking apps to help you locate your
phone some of such apps lets you lock
your phone remotely so that the finder
can't use it you can even wipe all data
on your phone through remote commands
I'll share with you some of such phone
recovery apps if you own a Samsung
Android phone you're in luck
Samsung has graciously included a mobile
finder feature aptly called find my
mobile go the settings security and
check if your phone has this feature to
use find my mobile you need to sign up
for a Samsung account and login to it on
your phone you also need to turn on
mobile data on your phone so that you
can remotely manage your missing phone
through the web interface or if you
prefer you can use mobile security and
track
apps in this category of apps some
reliable and noteworthy names include
mobile security Suites from lookout AVG
and avast of special mention is the
mobile finder app called where's my
droid you can read more about these apps
in this video's companion article on
Android Authority for now I'll talk
briefly about two apps that I personally
recommend first let's take a quick look
at avast mobile security this is
primarily a mobile security app it has
an add-on module called anti-theft that
enables features useful when you ever
need to locate your phone this module
needs to be downloaded and installed
after you install the main app one of
the awesome things about the vasts
anti-theft feature is that it offers
security features for both rooted and
unrooted phones aside from that the
anti-theft component of Avast is hidden
from the app drawer that way an
unsuspecting phone thief won't become
alarmed by its presence when setting up
the anti-theft component you'll be asked
to set in a vast pin to bring up the
anti-theft app just call the Avast pin
using your phone's dialer in case you
lose your phone you can use a vast
anti-theft to remotely communicate with
your phone via web-based interface
through which you can track your phone's
whereabouts market has lost erase phone
data sound off a loud alarm on the phone
and many more or if the web interface is
not a viable means you can send remote
commands to your lost phone through SMS
for instance there are commands for
locking your phone marking the phone is
lost setting off an alarm and more for a
full list of commands go to help SMS
commands within the anti-theft app a
vast anti-theft app has a lot of
features ranging from simple to advanced
you'll actually need some time to get to
know the apps features but believe me
it's worth the trouble the other mobile
finder app that I recommend is where's
my droid unlike Avast Mobile Security
and other similar apps this one's a pure
phone finder app the app developer
recommends keeping your phone's GPS
always on so that the app can report the
phone's location properly locating a
lost phone with where's my droid is done
purely via SMS you can send SMS commands
through where's my droids web-based
interface however not all countries and
mobile outbreaks
are supported by the web-based interface
if the web interface isn't viable you
can send the SMS commands in the usual
way via SMS but from another phone using
commands or attention words you can
instruct your lost phone to ring even if
it's on silent mode reports its GPS
location take a photo using the back or
front camera lock the phone screen with
a four-digit pin unlock the phone or
wipe all phone data you can even use
custom commands for instance this is the
default SMS command to instruct the
phone to ring you can change this to
anything you want and when you need to
use the new custom command or attention
word to execute the needed function on
your phone Avast Mobile Security and
where's my droid are just a few of the
many mobile security and phone tracking
apps on the Google Play Store there are
others too such as AVG Antivirus
security and lookout security and
antivirus as always I encourage you to
check them out and select the one that
suits your needs most
just remember to install one immediately
long before your phone falls into the
wrong hands the best way to minimize
loss is to prepare for disaster there's
no 100% guarantee that you will be able
to recover your Android phone if you
ever lose it in this video I shared to
you how to set up your phone properly
and securely and install phone finder
apps
these are ways to race your chances of
protecting your phone data and finding
your phone when it gets lost I hope you
