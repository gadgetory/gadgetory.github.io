finally made it onto our doorstep and we
were super excited to pop these boxes
open and finally get started using these
new phones now while LAN is going to be
taking care of the Nexus 5x I have the
pleasure of working with the larger one
made by Huawei we've only had these
phones for a couple of days but we do
have quite a bit to tell you about them
so it's Josh of regard from Android
Authority what's going on everybody and
here are the first 48 hours with the
Huawei Nexus 6p we will talk about
unboxing the device for a little bit now
when you get past the lid you get
straight into the actual phone with the
USB type-c cord now this court has the
same plug on both ends which makes it
reversible which is kind of nice but the
plug adapter which you have to use in
order to fully take advantage of fast
charging takes the USB type-c as well
which means that if you want to take
advantage of full fast charging
on-the-go you have to have these
particular peripherals with you now
luckily in the box there is actually a
version of the USB type-c cord where one
end of it is of a normal USB plug so you
can actually charge this with the
peripherals that you might have already
there are a couple of extras when you
lift the phone out of the box including
a free 90-day trial of google play music
which is really awesome oh but it's only
for new customers only which means we
can actually get into describing the
device itself and we'll start off with
the design you have a metal body all
around a metal construction and the
materials just feel really nice on this
device you have the Nexus logo in
landscape on the back which is something
we've always loved about the line the
new fingerprint reader that uses Nexus
imprint which is available in Android
marshmallow and that black bar on top
and of course underneath that bar there
are a lot of bits and pieces that are
under there like the camera the flash
and the laser autofocus but ultimately
it's a very nice looking device and
getting over to the sides you have the
full button layout on the right side and
the sides also are pretty flat which
makes it easier to grip especially since
a 5.7 inch device right here is a little
bit tougher to handle if you're not used
to phablet devices but on the front you
also have the dual front-facing speakers
and with this 5.7 inch screen this is an
Amal
construction it does already look pretty
amazing so we already have a good time
with this device and the handling though
it may not be as easy as any smaller
devices out there does get helped by
some flat aesthetics that give it an
easy way of gripping without too many
problems moving into the display we have
here a 5.7 inch quad-hd display of an
AMOLED construction and because it is
AMOLED we already notice over the last
48 hours the higher saturation in plenty
of the colors especially when we're
going through all of our icons right
here and even this background here with
the map and this green and blue contrast
right here has been able to show is that
this AMOLED screen is a nice addition
for the Nexus 6p especially when it
comes to media consumption and any
gaming that we were able to do on here
it has pretty much been able to do
everything with flying colors so to
speak which brings us into performance
and really the experience here has been
going swimmingly we in the first couple
of hours started to install all of our
applications sometimes all at the same
time just to make sure we got all of our
essentials and it was only around that
time that we actually experienced a
little bit of stutter but that's par for
the course for pretty much any Android
device when you're installing or
updating your applications on mass and
then after that today was the day that I
put a lot of heavy usage on here by
using the camera a lot most of the time
I would just double tap the power button
as you saw I did there just now in order
to power it up and then lock the device
and then do it over and over again
sometimes within just seconds of one
another and the phone was able to
perform really greatly even despite all
of that only one time did I notice that
the camera app just sort of crashed when
I was trying to open it up and close it
a bunch of incessant times but that was
the only time that we noticed any apps
crashing on here for the basic daily
performance thus far we've had a great
time on here in the last 48 hours with
the Snapdragon 810 backed by the audrina
430 the package that you can expect will
provide a lot of great performance on
here a couple of tropes from the
original Nexus 6 do come back here like
the front-facing speakers which Huawei
has done a pretty good job of making
them sound pretty nice I have to put
some real extensive testing on them with
a lot of different forms of media but
thus far they're an enjoyable experience
and a lot better to have them pretty
much any side or back mounted speakers
out there and of course you have the
fingerprint reader
the back now that circle on the back is
where you're going to land usually your
index finger and putting the fingerprint
into the phone is actually a really easy
experience you just keep tapping on the
back until it is able to register your
fingerprint after that the phone is able
to not only wake but also unlock itself
automatically when you put your finger
just on the back there and it makes for
a very easy way of getting into the
phone without much fuss at all now
moving into the battery we do have to
remind you that having the USB type-c
cord is something you're just going to
have to be used to if you're out and
about and you have to charge the Nexus
6p or even the 5x for that matter and
you only have micro USB charging cables
around you kind of at a loss because you
have to have the correct plug for this
phone and even then using fast charging
on here you do kind of have to use the
included plug adapter and even then I
was I had to take maybe about two and a
half to three hours in order to get this
battery to full charge from completely
dead granted we are using a larger
battery here at 30 450 milliamp hours
but I will still give you my full
battery testing results a little bit
later in our full review because over
the last couple of days I've really been
putting some heavy usage on the Nexus 6p
really I was only able to get about
three hours of screen on time which
isn't great for a larger battery but the
other thing that I have to tell you is
that the optimizations in the settings
for things like screen brightness
turning off auto brightness and also
turning on all of the app optimizations
that doz needs to use was something that
I just had neglected so I need to make
sure to have those on for the rest of
this week before I bring you my full
review now we can talk about the camera
and Google is saying that a new sensor
in the Nexus 6p and the 5x will provide
better light capturing capabilities and
thus make quality overall that much
better the camera is easy to get to by
just double tapping the power button
right here and it gets you straight into
the camera which is nice and we'll go
through the interface just real quick
you can already see probably around
there that you have hdr+ up here that is
available in auto and you can also
always turn it on or off but it is also
available for the front-facing camera if
we hit this button right here the button
is still available at the top for HDR
plus and you can always go Auto on or
off now going back to the rear facing
shooter it's 12.2
pixels at least if we go into the
settings that's what we get for a four
by three aspect ratio and you're going
to see a mixture of those photos along
with sixteen by nine photos which is
more my aspect ratio that I like to use
but those are at 8.3 megapixels
now video also includes 4k video
recording at UHD now as far as extra
modes go we have photosphere panorama
and lens blur and that pretty much does
it for what is mostly a very auto camera
interface in the Nexus 6p now going
through the actual camera samples you're
going to see here that the camera
actually provides a little bit more
saturation in the colors but the details
are actually all really there I actually
had a great time bringing this as my
main camera on a hike and I'm actually
just wanted to use this phone as my
vlogging camera I left all my other
cameras behind and just wanted to use
this for the test and during the hike I
had a really great time just looking
through all the pictures and having some
fun with it what I really love the most
about it aside from the fact that the
camera actually provides a lot of detail
in the photos is that when I got into
the video I was able to do 120 frames
per second and 240 frames per second
slow-motion video which actually turned
out really nice had this waterfall that
you're seeing here it makes it really
fun and when you're going into the
gallery it's pretty easy to find the
point where you want the slow motion to
start and even then the detail has been
pretty nice and the videos look really
awesome especially in the 4k but I used
1080p as well in both modes provide a
lot of great quality of course we're
going to do things like a camera
shootout and compare this particular
camera to other flagships but so far we
were pretty happy with what we've been
getting out of the camera of the Nexus
6p which brings us finally to Android
6.0 marshmallow now this fingerprint
powered version of Android brings a few
new options into the interface and we're
going to start off with the aesthetics
but the app drawer is where you're going
to see the first big change because it
is now a vertical scroll now that
vertical scroll is something you kind of
have to get used to if people were used
to the paginated view from side to side
then this is going to be a bit of a
drawing change but what's nice about it
is that now there's a line of
applications on the top that provide
your most used applications now
change as you use other applications
from time to time and even though we
would have liked two lines of those on
the top we do like that the first four
up there are still ones that pretty much
get us to where we need to go app
permissions are a big thing in Android
marshmallow this time around and they've
been showing their true colors over the
last couple of days already installing
new applications and the Play Store
still bring you the same prompts that
tell you everything that the app is
going to do but when you're in the
application and you actually want to
access a particular part of the phone it
will ask you for example when you're
using Instagram then and you want to get
into the camera it will ask you if you
want to access the camera and then
finally there is now on tap now we
already have an extensive video on now
on tap and also even a video on Android
marshmallow that Joe Hindi did so you
can see that in the description below
now now on tap over the last couple of
days has been kind of useful it's not
something that I've used all the time
yet I have to do more extensive testing
on it but I will say one thing real
quick about it using now on tap actually
kind of eliminates the swipe up from the
home button that got you to Google now
now what you have to do is hold the home
button so that now on tap activates and
then that bar on the bottom that says
Google is what you click in order to get
to Google now from any other application
it's not that big of a deal it just adds
a little bit of extra time mostly
addresses and maybe some topical things
and really it's been pretty good in
those situations but don't expect now on
tap to work in every single aspect of
your phone no matter where you are and
so there you have it kind of a
rapid-fire look at our first 48 hours
with the Nexus 6p we're actually really
impressed with everything that we see
thus far from the design to the great
camera so far which we're going to do a
camera shootout with then of course the
nice performance underneath with Android
marshmallow at the helm with the
Snapdragon 810 really everything about
this phone kind of does screen premium
and that is why you have the P in Nexus
6p and really the premium price is
something you're going to have to kind
of swallow at 499 dollars for the base
model you're going to pay a pretty penny
for this but it is still less than
plenty of the other flagships out there
still it is a little bit of a higher
price for an unlock device that does
work on all of the major carriers which
is nice as well so it is able to be used
in a lot of different situations and
this just might be one of the better
flagships available and of course with
at the helm they're getting a lot of
exposure with another Nexus device that
we just might fall in love with so I
really want you guys to stick around and
our full review of the Nexus 6p and the
Nexus 5x you can stay tuned for lawns
review of that will be available
probably within the next week or so and
we'll definitely be putting all of our
testing on these phones we're really
excited to be able to use them and
honestly it's really nice to have
another Nexus device that this time
around might be providing the overall
experience that we've been waiting for
from the great Nexus line so keep it
tuned to Android authority for all of
that great coverage and don't forget to
