Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to another episode of
Google Play weekly this week we're going
to talk about not one but two
applications that were brought back from
the dead the death of all of the swing
copter clones as well as the fate of
twitch without further ado let's get
started first up this week we have some
good news because rocket player has made
a triumphant return to the google play
store a couple of weeks ago it was
pulled for unknown reasons we did reach
out to the developer but could not get a
full reason as to why this happened
thankfully it doesn't matter anymore
because the issue has been rectified and
rocket player has been returned it to
the google play store if you want to
pick up the application it's free in the
Google Play Store so here's a fun fact
when swing copters first came out it was
the 63rd search result when you search
the Google Play Store for swing copters
now all those clones are dead thankfully
google has taken steps to keep this from
happening anymore a report out of the
Guardian states that Google has taken a
more active role in curbing the clones
of dog new ins laid spiral game we don't
know if Google is being more proactive
or if people including dong himself
simply filed complaints on the other
applications that can be argued but at
the end of the day it doesn't really
matter that much the clones are gone for
now so earlier this week amazon scooped
up twitch for the amount of nine hundred
and seventy million dollars this comes
as a shock because pretty much everyone
was primed for Google's I'm going to
take over we all assumed it would
somehow be integrated with YouTube and
it seemed like a match made in heaven
then Google backed out and Amazon made
the purchase and that all took place in
the same day according to twitch
everything will remain as is for the
time being a lot of people seem to be
upset but they didn't screw up
comiXology so who knows maybe this could
be a good thing a new study that just
came out shows that mobile usage on the
web is higher than desktop usage the
surprising part of the report is that
people aren't using that many
applications after Facebook YouTube in a
handful of google apps the stats drop
off dramatically and is almost
exclusively whether social media and
media streaming based a lot of pundits
have made a lot of predictions but
frankly none of this surprises me the
things that get the most mobile data are
the things that fit into the Venn
diagram of being insanely popular and
insanely data hungry it would be nice if
people tried more apps though
last and certainly not least the squeak
t-mobile has added a few more music
services to their music freedom
promotion and people are mad at them
about it okay so here's the deal
t-mobile has officially added Songza
rdio grooveshark blackplanet and radio
paradise the problem apparently is that
they haven't added google play all
access yet some people have attacked
t-mobile due to net neutrality concerns
but frankly this is a promotion and not
a permanent thing so I think a lot of
those arguments are unfounded it does
suck that all access isn't there yet but
it will likely be added sooner or later
so I think we must exercise patience
rather than lashing out so who wants to
see some trending applications as usual
if you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the print and companion which is in
the video description below first up
this week is locket lock screen you may
remember this as the application that
let you click on ads make money but they
have since changed their tune their new
app is a lock screen replacement
application that shoots news directly to
your lock screen it's pretty well
designed and works well even though it's
in beta it's also free which is nice
google news and weather was brought back
from the dead this last week and with it
came a huge update first and foremost
it's now available in the Google Play
Store free of charge it's also received
a huge UI update that brings the popular
card you I into the mix it's rolling out
right now so it may still read is
incompatible for some people otherwise
check it out pushbullet got an update
this last week that seems pretty
innocuous except for one big thing with
this update you can now reply to text
messages directly from your computer
instead of just seeing the notifications
this practically doubles the usefulness
of pushbullet and the application is
free to use so why not right lockable is
an application lets you put a lock
screen on your Android wear device it's
a fairly simple premise and lets you do
things like have a pin on your wear
devices so you can keep it secure the
app is free to use but to get the pin
and pattern unlock you'll have to pay
for it using in app purchases last up
this week is an update to nova launcher
along with the usual bug fixes and
performance improvements you'll also get
several new app drawer transitions to
let you customize your app drawer just a
little bit more the transitions are
circle slide up zoom and fade which are
pretty much self-explanatory if you're a
nova user already the update should be
rolled out by now
