launcher from iOS where you put most of
your important apps on the main homepage
from there you use the universal search

web searches find contacts and various
other activities there is also a spot
where you can quickly check out widgets
it's not all that different from Google
now launcher but it's a good alternative
if you don't use Google now or if you
want something more minimal it's also
completely free to use for now

apps that Google released this last
month this one focuses more on VR and
360 degree video experiences and
includes a ton of locations that you can
check out you'll be able to take part in
tours of these environments or you can

pourcel track is a nifty little
application that helps you track
packages this is most useful if you ship
a lot of stuff to other people or if you
receive a lot of packages from various
places it's draped a material design and
it's quite easy to use all you have to
do is tell it which carrier you're using
and the tracking number and then it does
all of the rest the free version is
functional and the pro version adds some
features such as getting push
notifications for tracking updates a
barcode scanner and syncing between
devices PlayStation view mobile is the
mobile application for Sony's new
television streaming service it comes
with three pricing plans which include
55 70 and 100 channels respectively the
channels range from standard TV fare
like NBC AMC Cartoon Network and others
along with lesser-known channels like
machinima and epics the application is
having a rough start but feature updates
should get rid of most of the problems
the app itself is a free download and
you can get a free trial if you want to
check it out the Swift emoji is the
latest application out of swiftkey and
the first since Microsoft bought them
earlier this year this is a keyboard
that tries to predict which emoji you
want to use and when you want to use
them it puts emoji at the forefront so
you can find them more quickly and
efficiently otherwise it's a pretty
standard
board application for now the app
supports only English although we
wouldn't be shocked if more languages
came out in the coming months for now
it's also totally free wiser is a
screencasting application that allows
you to cast your Android devices screen
to your desktop or laptop the way it
works is that you install the
application and then you install the
chrome extension after a little bit of
setup you'll be able to see your screen
directly on your computer screen you'll
also be able to interact with it using
your mouse and keyboard it's definitely
good enough to use for apps and even
play some games the app is free while
the chrome extension has a pro version
that you can buy and that about does it
