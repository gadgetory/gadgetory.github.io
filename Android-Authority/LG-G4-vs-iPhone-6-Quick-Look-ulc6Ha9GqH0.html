the LG g4 versus the iPhone 6
while many major OEMs are ditching
plastic many of them are favoring metal
or glass unibody designs but the LG g4
takes a different route the g4 comes
with the leather backings that we are
now all seeing ever since the leaks and
there is a stitching in the middle and
the leather backing is come in a bunch
of different colors but if you aren't
swayed by this new material choice you
can get some highly finished plastic
designs including a black titanium
finish or even a white ceramic finish as
you can see here that for this
comparison we managed to get our hands
on the black titanium finish version the
g4 even sports a subtle curve a little
bit like the G flex 2 but definitely not
quite as curved but it will benefit from
the durability that was afforded the
flex line but aside from these changes
much of LG's design language remains the
same the iconic rear power and volume
button setup returns with the g4 and the
front of the phone once again is greeted
by an ear bezel this display compare
that with the iPhone 6 as Apple
continues its recent legacy of
minimalist unibody metal designs
offering the familiar single home button
on the front with an integrated
fingerprint scanner like the g4 this
iPhone 6 is not a major departure and
design from its predecessor though the
display size took a sizable hike upward
and the aesthetics have been further
refined probably the main design Q that
differentiates these two phones is the
fact that the g4 has a removable back
and that means that against the iPhone 6
it does have a replaceable 3000 milliamp
hour battery unit and expandable storage
so both the g4 and the iPhone 6 are
premium devices in their own right but
ultimately comes down to personal taste
as to which phone is the more attractive
one to you large screens have been par
for the course in Android but with the
latest iPhone Apple has finally caught
up offering a 4.7 inch IPS LCD display
with a resolution of 334 by 750 on the
iPhone 6 and the 5.5 inch iPhone 6 plus
offering a 1080p display while the
iPhone 6 and 6 plus providing adequate
viewing experience for those that
subscribe to the bigger is better
philosophy when it comes to displace the
5.5 inch quad HD quantum display of the
g4 is certainly a more impressive screen
the resolution in size
maybe the same as found on the g3 but
thanks to the quantum display technology
LG is looking to meet the DCI standards
of general television and cinema and is
hoping to create an even better color
spectrum through its display compared to
plenty of the other flagships available
including the iPhone 6 display
experiences on both devices already look
quite great with the iPhone 6 bumping up
the screen size and resolution much to
the delight of Apple users when compared
to Android but the g4 already has a quad
HD display that has been further
enhanced with even better colors with
the quantum construction and the IPS
construction has already been
well-regarded from LG performance
between Android and iOS is always a bit
of a hard comparison because the two
ecosystems require very different things
the iPhone 6 will feature a 1.4
gigahertz a8 chip with just one gigabyte
of RAM which doesn't exactly impress in
the world of Android for 2015 but has
been more than enough to provide a solid
iOS experience and plenty of Apple users
are happy with it but for the LG g4 you
get a snapdragon 808 with 3 gigabytes of
RAM now the 808 might not sound quite as
impressive as the a10 that was using the
G flex 2 but LG worked very closely with
Qualcomm to ensure that the 808 was as
optimized as possible for the g4 the
result is a smooth Android experience in
lollipop obviously that really does kind
of surpass what we saw in the G flex 2
when we had our hands on it in terms of
other hardware features the iPhone 6
comes available in 32 64 and 128
gigabyte flavors with no expandable
storage the g4 on the other hand comes
with 32 gigabytes but is further
augmented by a microSD card slots now
the LG g4 has a replaceable battery
thanks to the phone's removable back
which LG claims can get close to 20
hours of talktime and of course as it is
replaceable you will be able to have
spares on you when you need it
the only real glaring difference between
these two is the omission of a
fingerprint reader on the g4 but we will
also mention that LG has told us that
the g4 in association with Qualcomm has
one of the best GPS sensors available
using a combination of all of the
sensors in the phone the GPS signal on
the LG g4 is supposed to be one of the
most accurate of
available nonetheless however both of
these phones offer quite a bit in the
hardware department with the g4 one
upping the iPhone 6 mainly because of a
couple of those features the removable
battery and the expandable storage that
you don't really find on too many
flagships today Apple tends to shy away
from the specs and megapixel race that
is usually found in Android but it's 8
megapixel rear shooter on the iPhone 6
and 6-plus happens to be one of the
better performers out there the iPhone 6
plus camera also benefits from optical
image stabilization but ultimately the
camera is a little bit modest on paper
but does perform quite well however the
LG g4 offers a much more noticeable
upgrade over its predecessor jumping
from 13 to 16 megapixels but more than
just megapixels the LG g4 also offers F
1.8 aperture this time around the LG g4
also offers OAS technology that has been
bumped up with a wider spectrum and a
color spectrum sensor that will analyze
scenes to help achieve the right white
balance automatically and accurately the
camera apps show a lot of differences
here as the iPhone camera is pretty
simplistic with swipes in and out of the
different modes on the viewfinder but
the LG g4 also comes with a very robust
manual mode that includes everything
from even a histogram to manual focus to
the ability to shoot in raw and JPEG
format simultaneously and even-aged a
complete white balance gamut
stay tuned for a full camera comparison
between these two when we put them
together for a much longer versus
segment Apple users will swear by their
iOS 8 which is found in the iPhone 6 and
6-plus
that now brings improvements to the
iCloud Apple IPE improved notifications
and a new health ecosystem iOS receives
a lot of this positive attention from
its fans for its ease of use it's quick
updates and the hardware software
optimization that Apple puts into its
products obviously it's a little too
early to talk about LG's quick update
prowess but LG has put a lot of effort
into optimizing their software while the
GUI looks very similar to what we saw in
the G flex 2 for example lag and stutter
are now at a minimum and we can pretty
much give the credit to the close
relationship with Qualcomm Envy
Snapdragon 808 that has been optimized
for the g4 needs LG has also added a few
new features including an
hands calendar that can save captures
from pretty much anywhere on the phone
to your dates and also a powerful
gallery app that among other things will
group photos into memories categories
it's also worth mentioning that LG has a
very close relationship with Google and
much of what you find in the LG g4 will
mirror a Nexus like experience and so
there you have it for this quick look at
the LG g4 and the Apple iPhone 6 we're
obviously going to be putting these two
devices against each other again for
much longer form versus but we want to
give you a short look at it right now
stay tuned for even more at the LG g4
launch event here in NYC and stay tuned
for even more from Android Authority</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
