original android hangout show on google+
I'm derrick rose and I'm Scott Anderson
I'm Dan Charlton I'm Johnathan Franklin
and we are joined this week with
Sebastian DeWitt from doubletwist
Sebastian is the creep or decrease the
chief creative officer for double twist
he has worked for companies in the past
such as Apple HP t-mobile HTC Sony EA
originally from the Netherlands he's
been featured in numerous Dutch
newspapers for international design he's
a frequent speaker at major design
events he's led workshops he's basically
a design badass it sounds like so Thank
You Sebastian for joining us to talk
this about double twist and the new
magic radio service that you guys
unveiled about a week ago yeah thanks so
much reverence I think you guys it's
been fun talking to a lot of people
online that I drove into a gadget the
comic to the bridge come within some
point even and well let's say this one
will be low I'm sure this will be a lot
more pleasant than that it's been really
fun to positive real never ever look at
the comments yeah the comments
especially there's a youtube comment so
you guys watching on YouTube right now
we only want to see good comments cuz no
comments about my cat if you should my
cat smashed and she always jumps up in
the chair during the show you know I try
to keep her out of that the people love
it so you know the internet loves cats
right so you know we don't mind it all
right so like I said you guys uh you
guys been around for a number of years
uh is it music service for for Android
and recently you pushed out magic radio
and magic radio is a music discovery
service a platform that allows you to
stream music to your favorite android
device so Sebastian can you tell us a
little bit more about magic radio you
know how it how it differs from what
else is out there on the market you know
like such as you know Spotify or Pandora
things like that
sure so we started magic radio initially
because we felt like we were at a really
good spot with a player that you know
you could your existing library you know
tiny to itunes or would be a player with
the files you have but like everybody
else you know i enjoyed using Spotify or
Pandora for all the music don't have on
my desk I don't want to store like I
don't even give so we want to really get
into that game sort of seemed like the
natural place for us to go and one of
the biggest frustrations I have my wife
uses bendera all the time and when she
plays madura it just it seems like the
same closest keep repeating over and
over again and it's actually because
their libraries it's pretty small and
magic radio we we partnered with a
catalogue ever that's conservative
politically be big like we both million
small talk easily several 10 more than
pandora so that that already gives us a
big edge on them and we we also try to
obviously were not like a huge flavor
weekend like elbowing huge deals like
giving people practically a little bit
music with ads but we also wanted to
make something that if I co a bad pre
experience so we begin people you know a
970 a limited trial without any ads then
you can play so like a small fee per
month it's for continuing that yeah and
then the fee actually that's what three
ninety-nine a month that's very very
reasonable yep yeah and some people are
giving us flat because it's you know you
have to sign up through google wallet to
start a trial but it's actually the only
integrated you're in a good way like it
doesn't automatically cancel some people
say oh you know that's kind of tricky
behavior door trying to like weasel this
any money but we want to make it easier
to camp out of it look right now Google
Wallet subscription api's are just not
easy at all so we're going to add
whatever working on that with Google as
well but for now it gives it really
really solid experience if you like it
it's perfect if not yeah you know what I
am I tried out it's actually not that
bad i mean it pops up into a web browser
for for google wallet and you you click
to two buttons i mean you click buy you
know it's
not that bad i do it is yeah it's really
not bad I can't believe you guys are
getting complaints about that i mean i
didn't have same problems at all yeah
that's good alright so we are the big
things oh sorry things i wanted to
improve on Pandora and Spotify actually
as well one of my major issues with that
was simply sort of knowing what you want
to listen to but the door itself usually
really want to pick a certain artists or
you know you have to start a station a
very limited criteria and with Spotify
you kind of build wrong playlister
they're doing radio now which is nicer
but it's still a little bit sometimes
you just kind of feel like a certain
mood or you want to have a certain you
know genre and say and we really wanted
that to be such a part of like our first
part of the product so I know as always
with soph rights with the arts pick what
you put in that first version but for us
is the tricky part was getting food base
stations and genre base stations right
in the first release so we have that I
really like that yeah so I stick to
cheat I picked a in a mood station you
know because I'm not used to seeing you
know play music by mood so I thought
that was pretty neat so I picked the
mood epic you know cuz I was like why
not you know that it's supposed to be
music sort of pump me up right and well
oh you know I can't remember do you guys
remember what was that first song that
popped up when I was playing that it was
a movie is from a movie Titanic well
Titanic was my fake was won over that
really wasn't a pump up that was what
was the first one oh I don't remember a
bit but it was it was like a pump up
well yeah we were getting ready it was
it was epic music I liked it offical I
mean it was that most of the development
that went into it like there was a lot
of thinking behind the scenes of how to
accurately describe and portray a mood
and you know yes how did how did you
guys come up with the mousse it would
for the different you know kinds of
music
and I think we lost him oh let's see
that that's what happens sometimes you
know with with live broadcasts you just
never know what's gonna happen such as
your developer losing connection and
freezing but he's back hey your your
back but you're muted right now is not
unmute whenever you join of a hangout it
automatically meets you pepper too far
to the right this is all part of the
deal he'll be back you'll be back so so
anyway so we'll talk about magic radio
for a second so your use oh sorry guys
hey that's fine you know live broadcasts
always have hiccups from time to time
you know you never know what you're
gonna get and every once in while Google
throws us a hip a hiccup as well and
it's always fun whenever I get
disconnected like in the middle of a
rant it always happens I'm like yelling
about something something and boom like
I'm in the middle of I complain about
something or really on a roll and just
get disconnected so yeah just like yeah
so well I don't know if you caught when
I was asking before you got disconnected
ah but i'm just wondering did a lot of
the thought process go into how to
portray a mood through song choice on
how to accurately you know portray a
mood with song I'm sorry could you beat
that you broke up a little bit uh like
portraying the mood so I did a lot of
the I did a lot of work go into that
yeah yeah I really did it's really funny
too because it's the most hilarious
testing you can have you know we had
this persistent problem that we had a
roulette relaxation base station it
would not stop on inserting Swedish
death metal you know for some people i'm
sure that's super relaxing but we could
change up the criteria a little bit so
it doesn't do
anymore and we managed to get that down
what it says it's also you know kind of
difficult you have to work with
different parties like we have echo nest
7digital and these other providers and
you know people that provide the music
to us and a lot of the cool data to make
those moon base stations so it's a work
with them to get those kind of things
resolved so if you still find some some
death metal in a relaxation equation
then we're working that's pretty funny
this you going along it is it's really
you know really really calm and
everything that all of a sudden you know
just move that meddling it's good
because you know to test if you just
pretty much all use it day to day yeah
we phone any ideas on what but yeah
you'll have that as you said she gets
you guys first version it's only going
to get better with time you know
definitely and the more people who use
it the better our data set gets well in
this case it would be a cadets dataset
as well okay um does leveraging do you
leverage off of the good being that you
have the unique advantage of kind of
combined people's own native music and
do you leverage that into predictive
servers to yeah that's a huge thing for
me that's those one of our major
annoyance Spotify it integrated into my
itunes library because i keep my music
in itunes but then it's sort of like a
dead part of it it is important
permitted i'm going to make any
suggestions i ended up just going to
last that event to finding artists and
it sort of manually like entering its to
spotify to see if they were on there or
not and putting the playlist and making
clothes stuff i may like or not if you
already have music and doubletwist we
actually make a station of music you'll
love very likely or music you want to
discover like music you that's way more
sort of out there but we think you might
like and there's such a wealth of data
there that you can even actually working
on back there right now we can take an
existing playlist and tell us hey Bob I
want to destroy society nope can we do
that and that's that's really nifty mean
to we're just scratching the surface
there we tried to degrade as well as we
could and there's already some cool
stuff in there but possibilities are
still pretty pretty promising so it's
pretty cool and they said you guys are
definitely unique compared to you know
to pandora or
Spotify because you offer this is a
recap here you can create a station
based on an artist a song the album
genre mood which is which is fun or or a
search term it is so it gives you a
variety of choices yeah yeah you can
even base it on any kind of a word you
want that you could say you can stick
you know put some pretty funny two terms
in and see what comes back but for now
it's really useful for state music
festivals you know Coachella's coming up
so we made that like the default one of
the default statement that you have
right now to see you know a flexible
that really is and then you have the
ability to purchase the song as well I
um now what what service does that go
through is is that go through your own
store your own service order to go
outside it goes to yeah so that we on
one sided SAT but we don't have for our
music store the other side I cannot like
believe to imagine the kind of headaches
involved with that so read right now
we're using 7digital for that they've
got a really good quality during free
tracks that are usually the lowest price
that we should be tight so this seems
like the best you know person to partner
up good good and we sort of ahead Scott
did available just in the u.s. because I
know that I'm in the US but uh how about
people across the sea yeah it's
currently only available in the US were
trying to negotiate you know with our
content partners to see how far we can
bring that you know two people and stuff
but yeah well it's kind of hard
apartment shoulder we're trying really
hard to being out of the US but for an
out something it's yes yeah with the
Google products and you know everything
we always hear you know us first and but
it's good to hear that negotiations are
you know do you think that was talking
about do you think that is your your
biggest hurdle for licensing and legal
challenges is trying to get content
available overseas yeah it's so tricky I
mean it's a you know it's no no miracle
of a lot of people don't want to get
into this stuff because it's legally so
tricky and we've already even with these
great partners that we have fun to be
pretty pretty challenging but we're
doing everything we can like I said you
know we're don't have a giant
corporation elbows to elbow or salsa to
market
Oh char so besides legal legal mumbo
jumbo you know uh what are some of the
technical or design difficulties are
hurdles that you guys had to cross how
to get by to launch this once we got
really well integrated with with echo
nest and their data set it kind of
became a big challenge design-wise to
figure out what I we could show this
amount of flexibility and we could push
all the possibilities into one small
package that would be overwhelming
people and I think we did a pretty
decent job at that one of the things we
pushed around at some point it's used to
have all these icons for different
stations we could pick and now we let
people sort of more type and then we
suggest what you know what what comes up
so you could say let's see magic and it
would suggest oh you want to submit make
a station out of animal magic which is
an album by potable one of my favorite
artists or do you want it you know based
on magic carpet ride by step wolf or and
I limitation on based on the magic food
or are you you know whew there's there
so many possibilities that it was pretty
tricky to make that yeah not
overwhelming apart from that just make
it work across obviously differ i give
android devices that are out there and
testing it all of those over that period
of time you know you want a radio
station to work for longer than just two
tracks so our typical test process
definitely like draw out a bit nice cat
by the if she's in her spot oh now the
youtube comments are gonna start coming
hey what about for a hardware
perspective I mean what all does it take
to run hun internet radio service I
can't imagine it's it's easy yeah to be
honest I'm not the perfect person to ask
that we've John are you know resident
attacker awesome engineers also CEO of
the company did a lot to optimize to as
many devices as possible I sadly can't
provide very insightful commentary about
what it really takes for a device to be
good for streaming i more meant that the
back end of you guys
hosting servers running all this and
stringing down are you renting space
from you know an Amazon or Google type
cloud provider or you run your own
massive data set at this fortunately we
don't have to worry about that too much
thanks to our content providers the only
thing we have to do we sort of creepy
requests and you know intelligently tell
their servers to stream it to our use
more the middleman on the actual
provider yeah nice all right so so I
have a question for you that I think is
more up your alley it's more of a design
question being being an Android show and
being the guys that we are we we like
hollow apps we like Android apps that
are of the holo design I'm sure you're
familiar with that right now the
doubletwist app is is not a a hollow app
is there a reason that you haven't gone
that way is are there plans to hollow fi
if that's a word the app in the future
what you know where where do you see
that ever happening oh yeah doubletwist
actually initially was very reluctant to
adopt although because you know we we
started on the Android platform really
young we were there since version to you
know making a solid out for the
marketplace boom well anywhere I
remember using it back on my incredible
back in 2010 I I remember when when
airplay came out I was one of the first
people I I I think I got it when it was
an in Baden got it for free before you
became a purchasable a piii used it
years ago I remember all remember those
days that's awesome and you know we got
pretty close to google and you know not
to their discredit because i realize
exactly why they went that way they're
telling us hey you know you should
really try and avoid little bit more by
our guidelines you guys a match design
but you know it's not quite following
the direction we want to take platform
and every time they did that six months
later they would come up with designer
kind of flipped with their old one
because they were still certain places
I'm find the look and feel of their
platform and which made us a little bit
you know well very thankful that we went
with this sort of design director who
chose we made our own visual language
which looked you know native that was a
native enough like it good and it felt
good it didn't flop place they also
didn't feel completely in place but it
was you know solid make for a good
experience now right now I feel like
Android has really kind of found its
visual identity it's good we've waited
it out a little bit and you'll be
delighted to know that I'm actually
working on a really really nice updated
visually doing that much more in line
with hollow laughs and I'm not gonna lie
it looks it looks a lot better you know
it's awesome really simple it's really
clean very nice and yeah it just took us
you know some time to make sure that
that's the direction we was going but
also since we were just focusing so much
making new products we're working on a
really cool secret new desktop thing at
the same time as well so yeah yeah that
that that's cool because you know as
android fans you know a lot of people
are gonna you know that they're not
gonna lie kappa like all I don't want to
run double twist because it looks like
looks like iTunes you know give us
something that looks different so that
that's cool you guys have that coming
out of the pipeline so the green happens
like that it brings up an interesting
argument and since you actually have the
statistics it seems like a lot of
developers of seeing a lot more in terms
of purchased applications and people
that pay it seems like the four point oh
and up users in terms of adoption of
those type of applications tend to be a
much higher percentage then even the
gingerbread ones even though the
platform's about half and half right now
is that what y'all are singing to out of
your specified the subscription service
and things like that or yeah definitely
without going into too much detail
because i don't have the statistics
right in front of me I know from what
I've seen in tustin stats that pass that
they're a much better good for a pleco
that I work monetizing you know they're
they're just people who tend to I think
use their device more than old Pete you
know and also i think the throwing
faster devices absolutely more more
often than not it's a little bit easier
to consume content we got something
that's not lagging around yeah yeah
mostly muslims are newer or feature
phones now so
they're equivalent Lee yeah totally so
it's it's it's hardly surprised but it's
really good to see that and especially
once we see that curve if you know
adoption going up for that platform in
that market segment expanding we're
really happy to see people having you
know enough trust the platform to buy
apps and makes us happy we got into it
so early you know to become a bad let's
associate with its application so if you
guys are watching live on youtube or
google+ you have any questions about
double twist magic radio for Sebastian
go ahead and drop a comment and we're
we're watching them will relay the
question to him and he'll try to answer
it for you epley um so he tell us a
little bit more about how magic radio is
going to be integrated into the magic
play platform yeah for sure um for one I
mean a little bit about you know magic
play to begin with we have we now set at
Mobile World Congress since essentially
we saw airplay and I really did hear
like like whole concept is you have this
video here and need pass yet you know
well you hack if you have an iPad you
know exactly I works yes they get like
three different dongles a daisy chain
into each other and then I don't think
the audio is working yet let me give
this other thing and plug that in over
here and it doesn't work at all and then
mayor places you check this you took
that in a boob it's on your screen it's
really nice when I first thought I was
like oh that's awesome in the end of
course there's a whole set of deal on a
complex abbreviations that the promising
to same thing when in reality don't work
that well and we we partnered with all
come to make something that really go
standard that really really work very
well for that and we're trying to like
right near that and use it extensively
in our app now for magic radio just like
pretty much anything else in our app we
want to google for pulling with magic
planche you know we really want to limit
the abstraction of what can you play
anything on and help you play anything
on something and magic video fits into
that as well very easily to type it over
magic play to a device called supports
it if you just play a right to your TV
yeah
awesome let's see if we have any
questions in the comment tracker oh we
have a question about it is it coming to
Australia and Canada I think that that
goes back to licensing issues that we
were talking about earlier definitely um
as far as countries go you know I'd say
Europe and Canada are probably are
easiest first ones it's not that we
don't love Australians interested is
really cool i was in melbourne you know
last year super super cool country but i
think it's really going to be a little
bit more tricky but we're trying really
hard ok a couple of other questions from
viewers uh what do you think is your
biggest struggle in making these apps
and you're actually getting people to
adopt them um I think I think it's been
tricky to convince people this is a
general acting like it's not limited to
Android I think it's tricky to convince
people that it's worth buying a nap or
spending money enough that's one of the
reasons where our base product is just
free and really good regarding that our
free product has progressively gotten a
few more like little pop-up saying hey
you you know you could upgrade and we're
actually even getting rid of that
because that's you know that has been
absolutely hurting us it's it's it's a
tricky market up there you know you have
to really prove your worth they even
then people will still start and playing
me charge a dollar for it what has been
you know a lot of like an office full of
people's hard work for like six months
so that's that's a major challenge to
simply convincing people that you're
worth money and establishing that trust
is huge let's say second when its
remains with Android and gets a bigger
problem over time it's just design it
for so many devices and making sure you
get a really good experience in each I
wrote a blog post about it at some point
and it's it's a really really tough
battle but we hope to actually share
some insight to be gained in our testing
and our design optimizations and
engineering optimizations that we've
learned in the last few years with
people in our on our new blogs and as
well done do you think that that fight
will continue to get easier as people
dot more version the newer versions of
Android or do you think it was kind of
get the same as you know the newer ones
come out and they stay at like ice cream
sandwich or jelly bean when we're
already at you know Android sixer I I
hope to see you consolidate a little bit
I mean pretty selfish reasons as a
designer I see less and less display
technologies that makes me really happy
you know Samson social including co-led
but if we have something only have two
different panels of you know display
panels out there that already you can t
helps me but I also think that we will
see manufacturers getting better at you
know updates and stuff but it's a
competitive market out there and you
have to you know gain a competitive edge
and I think the market will serve
regulate itself in that sense it's a
hope I mean you know in the meantime
we're just doing our best we can to just
make it work everywhere no I think at
least for me and probably some of some
of our viewers and listeners part of the
reason that I originally used
doubletwist years ago was because of who
one of the founding uh guys for the for
the company is um DVD John media yeah so
uh I don't know if everyone knows who
that is but he's responsible for years
ago decrypting descrambling the
copyright protection on DVDs I mean it
was pretty big deal we go ahead and just
Google DVD John and you'll find out all
sorts of neat stuff but uh I that was
the whole reason that whenever
doubletwist launched back in two
thousand six I think yeah that's the
whole reason i downloaded and start
using i was like huh it's pretty cool
all right i knew that guy is you know so
that so for all the tech geeks out there
that know who that is that that's that's
a reason right there to give it a try
you know that's true and we've always
sort of kept that as one of our ideals
you know what kind of like the small guy
trying to fight the big big force at
some point in a way we put a really big
banner on the saxes guapas laramie ave
downtown over here certain like they're
big developer event was really amusing
to see everybody freaked out over that
i'm sure it was very angry phone calls
being made by outfits people that day
that's hilarious you're right the
original doubletwist app used to
i think i think the term was liberate
music from the apple itunes uh yeah what
was in balti oh that's hilarious alright
so a couple more questions from our
viewers is the magic play going to be
free included in the description price
or is going to be like an equalizer
where it's a couple of bucks in-app
purchase well no magic plays is
completely free it'll be free for a free
product that lead free for anything out
there pretty much we're trying to make
because we love the idea of airplay so
much except the fact that it's limited
to only Apple devices were trying to
make something won't really work
everything out there without having to
worry about paying any fees to any
company whatsoever it's just worth money
very nice another question is where do
you see total twist in five years what
do you expect to come in and be doing
then how do you think things will change
since then well perhaps in five years
we'll finally have a tablet app hey when
a you know what whenever wherever you go
Hollow you could work get in there yeah
actually I'm secretly may or may not be
sketching us of something but given the
pressure to Google's been giving us
something it's all that you know that
that's good you know you gotta go you
gotta go hollow you know definitely so
yeah if I here's what we're adults with
having more hollow ass having a you know
we were really like we're in magic play
for the long run you know we we want to
make it we're considering things like
you know perhaps we couldn't bring it to
the web well again this is I can't
promise anything because there's lots of
technical and licensing yada yada behind
it but I really like the service I would
love to see you in different places
we're working on completely making a new
product to the desktop so for windows
and mac was a really cool set new set of
the apps coming that worked really well
and honestly just really building on our
strengths you know I mean we made a
little alarm clock app at some point it
was really nice and it was really cool
to see through section to that as people
said there were two types of comments
you saw and one was why would I spend
money in an alarm app when my phone
already does it other people said well
doses make it really nice apps and this
one was no exception it's definitely
like worth the buck
and that was really cool and you know
made a stink hey we can definitely a
future make apps that sort of extend
naturally from our player or if you know
do like one thing do it right and I
think will will definitely like build on
our strengths and try it sort of create
more things that make people's lives or
fun or easier also so uh you know you
love those YouTube comments you know so
apparently they think this is like a
cross between like you know reddits like
ask me anything so you have questions
like you know how'd you grow that
mustache and it's a good time yeah we
have another question about so you know
what did you have for lunch today you
know me this isn't an ask me anything
guys I mean it could be but they're not
bad questions just you know pick your
battles and times so we do have a
relevant question I don't know if you're
privy to this uh so how do artists get
paid through the the radiative service I
mean that might be a question more for
your content provider than that's
actually super good question I I would
love to ask our cons of provider about
that but as far as I know it's very
similar to the way that Spotify base
their artists through video systems at
the door phase it I think they're all
connected to an artist interest
organization that actually measures such
an artist based on radio and pays them
out of a certain amount that all these
companies face it's fun it's a really
complicated rear thing which is actually
one of the reasons why we have to limit
the amount of skips you can do in our
app because otherwise a lot technically
considered ratio anymore I'd rather use
a very varied look you know specifically
written laws in the US that you know
could optimize for this and I'll try and
figure it out up so they be fun they're
taking a reddit AMA on it or something
there you go so you know level let us
know if you'll do it if you're gonna do
an ama see if you do that then you'll
have to answer the questions about what
you had for lunch how'd you grow the
mustache you know things like that Oh
usually there's something about like
duck-sized horses and horse I stocks in
there as well so you know reddit
all right so uh any other questions dan
I'm not seeing any I don't see any other
comments now okay well I have a question
about the the Google+ kind of the new
API that was released the social plugin
um you're gonna integrate that into your
app at all I know that you're getting
you know kind of pushback google for
hollow but i mean if you like it i could
see that i'm currently listening to
hears it to google plus yeah it's really
funny actually because we introduced the
sharing feature at some point and really
want to integrate Google+ and be
confident like hey how do we do this
city said oh you can't we're trying to
push your platform here guys so uh uh uh
well you know what it was 30 minutes
anyways you know that's about the
halfway point to where we wrap things up
with Sebastian so if he froze again
that's some good timing oh hey look
who's back yeah you froze again for a
second I was just saying that you know I
think we have any other questions uh I
don't have any and looks like the users
don't have any other questions so I
think we're gonna wrap up but but you're
back um you haven't you have any
questions for us anything else you'd
like to add about anything we didn't
cover any plugs for anything oh I mean
not awfully much again I really
appreciate you you guys having us I know
you yeah you know uh maybe you can give
us some since you used to work for Apple
we know you can give us some apple hate
you know if you have any of that yeah I
mean it's just you know I'll tell you
one thing whatever kind of radio product
Apple comes out with you'll soon see
that you know by the time they get in
shape for that will have something so
much more awesome built out of double
twist that very cool people switching to
android for anything you gotta get down
when they have their developer
conference and hang another banner up
and let them know what's right that's
great all right Sebastian well thank you
very much for joining us and talking to
us about magic radio and doubletwist we
greatly appreciate you having you on the
show thanks
okay um let's move on to some Android
news of the week let's uh let's talk
about what Eric Schmidt said you
recently so for a while now a bunch of
android fans and chrome fans have been
reading in 20 things you know the
speculating on things have been released
speculating on some code found and
everything saying that we think that
chroma andhra were going to marry
somehow and Eric Schmidt said this past
week of the big tent in India that the
Chrome OS and Android merging rumor is
false it's not going to happen and he
did say that they're gonna have more of
a commonality which to me sounds like
what we've talked about on the show
might happen all along either you know
that commonality is that going to be
chrome OS will be able to run or just
chrome itself will be able to run
android apps or android will be able to
run html5 apps you know through chrome
one of the other of that that's my guess
chrome will be the window the browser
will be the window and that's I think
that's that commonality cuz you didn't
say although it's never gonna happen he
just sit on yeah they're not merging cuz
that's that's just silly oh you might
pick and choose yeah certain features so
that's well that's my take on that you
guys have anything to say about that
cherry picking and just pick some
features that you know work well in a
mobile setting and ones that you don't
work well on a laptop setting well we
know we know uh Chrome's coming or not
crown we know Google now is coming to
Chrome we know that that commonality
definitely will happen in the near
future yeah so that's a mobile feature
that you know will come to the desktop I
think it'll be interesting on the
desktop I don't know how much it's going
to be you know giving me location-based
information when I'm in the same spot
about your your Chromebook that you
carry with you and your regular notebook
running chrome that you take mobile you
know its mobile it's not always sitting
in the same spot
agreed agreed I I agree with I think
people get their hopes up a little bit
too much about what they're going to see
converge and that don't really get what
chrome OS is about but if you merge in
Android in the dalvik VM on top of
Chrome OS and merging all the
conventions that come along with Android
all you did was turn chrome OS into
Android and you negate all the
advantages like having a really low
resource really secure operating system
for web technology so if anything I
would say it being the other way around
where it may be Chrome OS brings the web
to Android but not that's the only way
they can really deploy everywhere
including windows and mac and linux its
thing and that one might makes make more
sense since you know Android is leaps
and bounds more popular than Chrome OS
is only a little bit all right so so
let's talk about Google keep real quick
we haven't heard of this google cheap
you haven't heard of Google keep it just
you know blew up the the interweb this
week you know from whenever it appeared
for 10 minutes and then disappeared and
then you know two days later was
released and that's in the web was all
the rage talk about Google keep and if
you've been in the cave or you're not a
Google fan uh Google keep is Google's
note-taking app you can access it at dr
google.com / keep or you can download
the android app and and use it and I I
think it's awesome for somebody that
wants to keep all their data on one
ecosystem you know with Google you don't
have to now use a third-party app such
as Evernote or Springpad you know you
can use it you can use you know Google's
own solution and it's pretty awesome it
allows you to record notes with audio
you can say note hi you know remember to
bring home eggs or something you know it
and it'll transcribe it and put it in a
note for you as well as save it save it
in an audio format you can play back and
listen to later you can do lists you can
take photos and add them to a photo note
um or as well as a regular note to just
just random text
and you can rearrange them you know if
you have a note that's an old note but
it's still relevant you can drag it up
to the top you know it you can color
code your notes I and it's simple I like
it I used to take notes with Google Docs
I just never really liked Evernote and
taking notes with Google Docs sucked
because now I have 400 different you
know note docs every once in a while I
go back in and try to consolidate them
in the OneNote doc I just know but this
is neat i've been using it so what do
you guys think about note let us know in
the comments and then you guys here in
the Hangout you know have you used it do
you like it I haven't used it yet but i
think it's it's smart for google to do
it's one of especially as they are
increasingly competing with office or
trying to compete with office it's one
of the holes as compared to office they
needed something that could compete with
OneNote I definitely see them going
forward and probably coming out with
something similar to vizio as well that
would be interesting cause I mean I use
visio in in my eight to five job a lot a
lot of businesses do and realistically
then you can you can almost replace
excel with google spreadsheets you can
pretty much replace word with give them
there and now what about Microsoft
Access can we just get rid of that whole
thing I'm just pretty much killed access
any red no longer really a database
program or a platform for developing
SharePoint applications yeah so and you
know I from from a design standpoint
since we're talking about design with
Sebastian earlier you know I i love it
because it's a hollow app and it's well
evernotes a hollow up as well but it's
just a very clean simple simple app yeah
and that's what I really like about it
it's clean simple it operates a lot
better in my opinion then Google+ when
you open up Google+ posts and tablet
it's not as quick as the note be nice
further Google+ have to have it's very
simplistic you got the swype decide to
delete or archive I like the annotations
and it saves your actual tidbit of audio
that's pretty cool one thing i don't
like about that is
uh if you could enable an option to just
record audio that'd be cool and you know
cause like non-stop happen what so you
see you you would like to save the audio
note but don't transcribe it or for the
transcription if it does jose like a dot
dot dot if you hear some silence that'd
be pretty cool um you know but mostly
for the audio file I'd like to be able
to NFC share notes somebody you know
let's say you're out and about and you
took notes on something now no maybe
you're in class I don't know it or
whatever you used it to jot down a few
notes and then afterwards you want to
share it to your buddy you just NFC you
know NFC send them the note I think that
would be interesting but uh I've had
John course I'm a little bit lazy with
most about note-taking relates to taking
screenshots of stuff or saving a website
for later so I would honestly like to
see almost a kind of like a pocket kind
of thing where you could leave loose you
know share your website and the
note-taking app actually parses the
website for you to read offline later
all right I think that would be neat so
such as on google plus you know instead
of sharing to your bookmark circle just
or i read it or Mairi it later circle
you know you click a button and it sends
it to to keep young keeps it for later
how about adding a picture from your
gallery you can't do that you have to
take a picture from your camera that's
annoying then then just uploaded for
from the desktop oh it's yeah to work a
rest up party has actually in Drive yeah
there's no link alright so let's talk
about a leak this week with the google
play store um droid-life got a hold of
an APK this week that featured a
completely revamped UI it's a little bit
unfinished you know some things still
need to be ironed out but it's
completely different it it's even more
Hollow
then the current play store it's very
simple very minimalistic and the colors
and the categories all match the play
webstore the actual website and you know
pictures are much better in higher
quality the images are better it's just
a very very much needed and gorgeous
redesign sebastian have you seen it um
no I guess I didn't have I'm gonna give
you a link and I wall Derek keeps
talking about it because I'm curious to
see what a developer's standpoint think
so you know the place were because it's
where people you know go to get their
content and get your app well the fact
that it looks more like the actual web
store it's a seamless you know
integration re Nia no matter where
you're at if you're on the web app or
you're on the Android app it looks
similar and that's nice you know that
way people don't get confused but one
thing that that's funny is I saw people
saying that it reminds them of the old
school like pre I don't know ICS days
place or you know like back on like
gingerbread they say reminds them of
that will see it does a little bit
really like how so how do you how do you
think that ever mind I mean I I just
don't see it it does but you know it
doesn't really good things about the old
one where like if you go to install an
app it doesn't take you to this you
thank you for downloading this other
person's out which is kind of useless to
the developer and a google but i have no
most beings just eliminate redundancy I
mean it promotes more shopping I mean
that's why they do that yeah um I like
the cards though yeah it's very google
now astic you know and that makes me and
that makes me think right so we got
google nail which is you know getting
well it's improving it's becoming a very
contextual platform on its own you know
we have glass which is has google now
type cards and now we have you know a
newly redesigned to Google Plus which
the you know their cards they look like
cards that on your profile
come on the iOS Google Maps app is that
way yeah so these things are moving into
a hollow card type design so if Google
Play is designed that way the leaked
version i'll i'm wondering you know what
we're gonna see with android come io are
we gonna see a new change in the design
here kind of like an ocean back by like
Sebastian said you know they get
comfortable with something than six
months a year later you know baby
changing already will be my luck you
know doubletwist pushes out that
beautiful hollow app and then Google
releases the next version android it's
like okay now now this is how our design
and stuff no gradients your load design
guidelines but I you know it's still
hollow APIs just has more much more card
cardenas to what good if I could say
anything I think that you know what I
really love about google now like first
time i thought i was like wow this is
this is beautiful this is gorgeous what
i really like about it is it's less
intimidating because it just doesn't
look as dark and like as you know i
don't know foreboding graphic i guess it
looks a bit more human yeah it's very
very simple design like i really like it
that you can brace things into
digestible chunks instead of huge bear
have to go through so the whites in the
greys it's nice yeah in the swiping
action that just makes it amazing for
everything because it's very playful Oh
we'll talk about another app update and
we'll stop talking about apps cuz after
I was born to continue to talk about it
for long periods of time so google
currents um now has the ability to play
podcasts which is awesome I mean that
functionality kind of existed before but
it was nowhere near what it is now um
you can play apps it pops up in the
notification to just deposit and fast
forward and so forth so it's now a
podcast app so those of you that you
know we're looking for a Google podcast
app and you used to use listen which was
which was just horrible you can you can
now use a now use current stuff or
podcast we don't have it in there yet
cold our design
yesterday to to get that in there and so
probably later tonight or maybe even
tomorrow morning we'll have our our
podcast being able to be played through
currents as well maybe you'll be
listening to this right now through
currents hello from currents um alright
so uh let's talk about some apple rumors
dan ah so Apple is rumored to be pushing
a new flat design for iOS moving forward
getting rid of their screw school
morphism they make everything look like
wood and leather and ugly design
philosophy and moving towards a much
cleaner simpler you know matte colors
straight lines what some people might
call tiles or cards or go windows or
android so look for Apple fanboys to the
very near future be telling us all that
Apple invented this design trend rather
than just followed along on it oh they
don't do that no no never um in some
hardware news and video went out to brag
about the next two generations of the
tegra chip why the chips code-named
Logan and Parker's that be the Tegra
five and six um they're bragging a lot
that I don't really believe at all
because they like to brag and never
actually compete any of the things they
brag about so they're telling us now
that the Logan check the Tegra five will
be available in early 2014 that's
roughly the same time that the Tegra 4i
will become available the same one that
they promised in less than a year over a
year ago well you remember early 2014 is
literally a year from now yes reporters
were I they promised at CES last year
not a couple of months ago at CES in
2012 in January they said later this
year we will be putting out the I Sarah
500 modem yeah that's not going to hit
the shelves until early 2014 so I don't
really buy their promises of Tegra five
and twenty four
teen because they haven't shown that
they can meet any other timelines I
don't believe they're going to do it
this time when that chip does come out
though they're saying it's going to be
based on their new cal per GPU form our
architecture so it should be pretty
powerful it's going to have see you da
compatibility GPU is going to have
opengl 4.3 compatibility out of the box
and then the parker chip which would be
the the tiger 6 is going to be on an
even newer maxwell platform so and it's
also going to be a 64-bit ARM so that'll
be a 57 or 54 chips so it should be a
pretty advanced chip but don't hope for
it to come out for another two to five
years well that that's cool to look
forward to because in two to five years
I mean you know Qualcomm probably have
like the god mode out or something I
mean you know Qualcomm will be rocking
some aprm 360 that they're launching
later this year that's going to make the
I 500 look like a worthless piece of
crap does what it says a lot more
Hardware races is vibrant right now yes
yes it is and Nvidia likes to brag a lot
in that race and struggles to actually
yeah didn't Qualcomm put out a piece
this week basically saying don't believe
everything you read look at statistics
look at numbers just because somebody
says they're awesome doesn't mean
they're yeah awesome yeah pretty much
what does it tell you about a videos
confidence with tegra 4 saying it's not
on the market yet and there I'll get the
next two chipsets it's still months away
and all they can do is brag about the
next generation that's over a year away
that is not an impressive it'll be we'll
be good to go in many years there's no
the other thing became like well they're
promising this chip for a year plus from
now nobody wants to buy the one that
they're promising in a month or so so so
it may take a long time to get these
new processors out there who knows when
they're going to be asked but let's talk
about something that is actually out
there that should have been out there
months ago such as the verizon galaxy
nexus 4 point to point to update that is
now live whoa this is celebration yeah
rise rise you guys got the update out
there months after everybody else got it
out there well that i mean the the gsm
version you are no longer for updates
behind Android you are now up to date
that's awesome you know but in verizon's
defense the past couple months they've
updated there's tons of funds Bob right
now there is no defense they've updated
a lot of phones they have that you know
that the original droid razr maxx the HD
droid razr HD as well the droid charge
got an update if derek this isn't
something that's in their defense this
is basically saying oh gee they woke up
one day and realize that manufacturers
have left updates pending their approval
for the last six months and finally
decided to do there nobody said if the
droid charge is in the update q ahead of
the galaxy okay what's his email from
from build bought at google com from
four months ago exactly the fact that
they're doing them all in this mass like
this just makes it look that they like
they said on them because i don't know
they couldn't get it together or fell
asleep or float so those part of their
job those of you that a Down little bees
so those of you that downloaded the
leaked version of android 4.2 point2 for
the verizon galaxy nexus a couple days
ago or who couple weeks ago um you don't
have to do anything it's nothing it's
nothing new it's not a new leak or me
it's not a new build of android so if
you're already on that you're good to go
you don't have to worry about if it's
been there for at least two weeks well
it's been there for a lot longer than
that yeah so so you're good to go you
now have android 4.2 point2 so you can
do awesome things like dashclock uh uh
check it out and then put them on your
your lock screen and see the awesomeness
that is dashclock i love it my droid DNA
can't do that but when extra seven can
I hate the droid you know what I'd say
it every week so I'm gonna say it again
the droid DNA is an awesome piece of
hardware I just don't like sense HTC
made a very good quality phone this is a
good they always do bali phones than
they were there so it's a it's a very
good phone a lot of people love it I
just like stock Android and I know I
know I bought a phone hoping it would
get stock Android and that's my fault
hate me I'm bad so let's let's talk
about some more android update so so uh
John and I were talking about the Droid
Charge got an update uh this week and
it's it's got a head scratcher I mean I
i yes it is I don't really understand oh
so they didn't get jelly bean they
didn't get ice cream sandwich what
you'll be happy to know that you got a
backported ICS feature into your
gingerbread release you now have a face
unlock and photo editor Congrats so
instead of getting a platform update you
just got you know an additional feature
you didn't get no butter no renderscript
or anything like that you can face a lot
now you can get no butter verizon is
trolling you officially mad yeah for
samsung or both the job charge you know
uh that that that's just that's a phone
that had so many issues as much as
people used to flame the Thunderbolt I
can see why they did not update it
because they're like if they got
something that's halfway working their
practice it no just leave it along yeah
it's okay she's like yeah seriously
don't even touch it with like a ten-foot
dough on it don't touch it don't even
look at it cross-eyed yeah so jelly bean
is now being pushed out for the droid 4
which is great because they know a lot
of people like a buddy of mine Chris
Jenkins here on google+ he
was so excited when that phone came out
because he has real big man hands I
guess and he he needs a keyboard he
can't a pullout keyboard a physical
keyboard he can't do soft keys so he
will for the longest time he's like I
want LTE I want dual core and I want a
keyboard and when that phone came out he
was extremely excited so those of you
that fit that criteria you now have some
butter how'd you say that Scott but I've
got no butter but actually now they do
remixed that before you go on Derek
touching back on the video stuff for a
minimum of our youtube viewers asked if
anybody's announced me phones using the
Tegra 4 so far the only manufacturer to
announce that they're making phones with
that ship is ZTE and China out of China
yes a value manufacturer out of China
which basically means ah here in the US
you won't see that gonna be your yeah
yeah yeah that's pretty much what that
means and maybe bring it have ltd
compatibility of any form whatsoever so
it's not going to be distributed in a
phone sold in the united states in a
harley now yep currently now whenever I
spoke with ZTE at CES you know they gave
us the same as wall way they said you
know hey we're trying to work with you
as carriers were feeling we'll get
pushback we'd love to release so you
phone the u.s. yada yada yada so they're
trying to do it that was a Tegra 4
though yeah talking about the
manufacturers as a whole yo know I know
they're trying to break in the US but
they aren't gonna be able to do with a
phone with tegra 4 because the American
carriers aren't going to sell the phone
if it doesn't have LTE so in the those
of you that are that are rocking the
droid 4 you'll be happy to know that it
looks the same is the razr and razr maxx
jelly bean update which is good because
they're the jelly bean update you know
removes all that crap that you don't
need such as bloatware and motorola apps
that
aren't needed when Google Apps exists to
do the same functionality so Dan my my
resident hardware guy and my resident
carrier news guru we have any carrier
news to talk about this week yeah so
t-mobile pushed out an update for the
galaxy note 2 which most notably enabled
LTE on the device that is their first
LTE or enabled device courageous yes
that is their first LTE enabled device
they're still saying that LT is not
available but will be coming soon they
are having a press conference on I think
it's the 26th maybe the 28th when
they're also going to start selling the
blackberry z10 which they have said will
be an LTE enabled device on their
network so the note 2 and the blackberry
z10 are the first two LT enabled devices
on t-mobile and presumably they will be
flipping that network on on the 26 or
soon thereafter so hopefully we'll be
seeing LTE coming from t-mobile very
very quickly they're still promising to
cover 100 million people by mid-year so
expect to see them lighting up tons of
markets over the next three months um
AT&amp;amp;T is also releasing some new plans
for high data usage don't get too
excited though because if you want 30
gigabytes of data for your family plan
it's gonna cost you three hundred
dollars a month plus thirty dollars per
phone on the share plan you can bump
that up to 40 or 50 gigabytes for an
extra hundred dollars each so if you
need 50 gigabytes a month of mobile data
for you and your tablet and your spouse
and tablet and your plethora of children
that are using lots and lots and lots of
data you can get that for a cool five
hundred dollars a month now we have some
verizon news it isn't on the show Doc
that I that came out that way I think we
need to talk about there's actually two
tidbits of Verizon information to bit
number one is verizon came out with a
messaging app for tablets and for the
desktop
why so well according to the video when
my when my girlfriends are out shopping
for wedding dresses and I can't make it
I can still text them from my tablet or
my desktop which one you know it was
just remembered that not everybody uses
google voice yeah oh yeah exactly not
everybody uses google voice um if you
did use google voice you could you could
do that but if you don't use google
voice because you're on verizon and it's
well we'll need to get into them that
but google voice on verizon I know you
can but I'm saying that they make it
they make it harder to port your number
and everything and to use the to use the
google voice voicemail it's not
integrated it's really not that hard yes
i did all i did it really isn't it I
know he looks a little bit rather not
exactly harder to port your number out
if they're making it hard to port your
number out please call your Congressman
because the reason that it's hard to
port your number at how is because
people that have grandfathered in data
plans they've been on the service for a
while and they want to transfer the
number to google voice Oh see what
you're complaining about is they're
making it hard for people to want to
port their numbers out not that they
make it actually difficult to do yeah no
it's very simple to do you can do it in
a few seconds but when you do that it
cancels your account and create a new
account for the new number doing so you
lose your grandfather and data plan
which many people don't want to do so
it's it's it's hard to come to terms
with how above
Brown no Derek God nice to have you back
yeah no that was interesting it said my
data connection was lost you know
Sebastian had that problem earlier
tonight well anyway so so verizon now
allows you to send text messages from
your tablet group text messages and you
can do it from your desktop tool if to
do that you install the app or go to my
verizon what my verizon's web portal i
have not tried it yet um all the other
one record you've been able to send text
messages from your desktop with just
about every carrier via their website
for quite some time yeah and you've been
able to deal with verizon as well but
but reading them you know you weren't
able to do that um the other tidbit of a
verizon news just on a personal note
here in it's like it's a personal
triumph I now have LTE where I live
officially hooray for Derek while you
were out of the Stone Age I know before
the LTE was only partially covering my
town because it was a tower from a
mountain that was getting a larger area
so it was like kind of shaky I mean I
had it at my house but basically if i
left my house went actually into town I
didn't have LTE but now the towers in my
town have actually been upgraded we've
gotten taller they've gotten big their
big-boy pants on and I now have LTE all
over my little town of 11,000 people so
I just know verizon you're doing stuff
good you know keep it up keep using you
keep giving us LTE um I guess that's it
so to Scott do that wrap up then let it
roll um butter you ain't got no butter
