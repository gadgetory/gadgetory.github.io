Authority what's going on everybody and
we're taking another look at the LGV 20
now the OGB 20 that we were able to play
with in Berlin Germany during Eva 2016
has already gotten a lot of coverage
here at Edra 30.com and one of the final
things that we did was compare it to the
LG v10 we had in our pockets now the LG
v10 from last year might have been
somewhat underrated it did provide a lot
of power user features on top of the
great camera package that had all of the
tools needed for great photography and
videography so of course we have the
next evolution and in the V 20 a number
of things might be the same but there's
plenty to be excited about the v10 and
the V 20 still have 5.7 inch displays
which are pretty much the reason why
they are larger devices and they both
come in a quad HD resolution underneath
the surface the iteration forward is
kind of small when it comes to
processing because the Snapdragon 808 of
last year has been bumped up to this
year's Snapdragon 820 not much of a
surprise there especially if the V 20 is
supposed to be a high-end flagship it
should have the Snapdragon 820 after all
where we do see a pretty radical change
is in the design the v10 last year was
pretty much widely considered one of the
more unique looking phones after all it
was one of the few phones that still had
removable backing and this one was made
of plastic take that out and you get to
the replaceable battery and the microSD
card slot
now even then a metal frame around the
device gave the v10 a bit of a unique
look compared to other devices and it
still had that design language where you
had the power button on the back with
the volume rockers flanking it
fast-forward to the LGV 20 which now has
a full metal design some people have
already said that what made the v10
somewhat unique in the design department
was lost in translation to the V 20 but
we still think it's a wonderful looking
device it'll look somewhat and
definitely feel a bit like a nexus 6p
due to its size and that full metal
construction but it has the same
military-grade protection that the v10
had and that's due to metal that has
been recycled from airplanes one thing
you can do still is remove the backing
by pressing a small button on the side
to release that metal backing and it's a
very sturdy feeling piece
metal we even put the v-22 a drop test
and it wasn't until we got to our final
drop from very high up right onto its
face that something actually broke and
no surprise here it was the screen
getting underneath all of that surface
level stuff we get straight to the
changes in the hardware and one of the
first things that changed was the
battery capacity you're not getting a
whole lot more in the LGV 20 you have
3200 milliamp hours as compared to 3,000
but you also get the change to quick
charge 3.0 in that now USB type-c slot
and now the LGV 20 is also a phone made
for audiophiles because it has a quad
deck installed compared to the V 20 this
is going to be a big leap forward
especially for people who really want to
get an awesome audio out of their smart
phone but that means we can finally get
to the cameras and the v10 was the first
to have a dual lens setup on the front
that is still kind of the case in the
LGV 20 except on the V 20 you get a
wide-angle lens that is then cropped in
when you want a more narrow field of
view the v10 had a pretty powerful
camera on the rear coming in at 16
megapixels at F 1.8 aperture which is
still what you get on the V 20 but now
the V 20 camera has an extra friend
taking a cue from the LG g5 there is now
a wide-angle lens at 8 megapixels and F
2.4 aperture that can bolster the
experience for rear camera shooting and
on top of that you still have all of the
manual controls for video that made the
v10 so popular in the first place and
they continue in the V 20 with
enhancements on top like steady record
2.0 which takes optical image
stabilization and adds in even more
powerful software stabilization so if
you have really shaky hands the V 20 has
got your back not to mention the ability
to record lossless audio and have all of
the different controls to change the
gain and also the directional mics so
that you have all of the tools needed to
create some of the best videos that you
possibly can we're going to put a lot of
these features to the test in future
videos where we use the V 20 as a main
camera and you can already see one of
those here in a vlogging with a
smartphone video that we already did in
Berlin here at Android or comms YouTube
channel and finally when it comes to
software we have the obvious change
from the v10 to the v20 we now have
android 7.0 and the v20 is the first
phone that will be widely released to
have Android nougat now there are other
changes involved as well as the software
that LG creates is now less and less a
part of the overall experience in the
v10 you had a lot of LG enhancements
let's say like even the qslide
applications and their version of the
dual window but in the LG v20 it's
basically Android nougat with a few
little enhancements put on top LG has
really dialed it back and allowed
Android nougat to be at the helm even
their dual window has been replaced by
new gits own built-in multi window it's
overall a more streamlined experience
because it's moving closer to a stock
version of Android that you may already
be familiar with if you have a nexus and
already got Android 7 there's still a
bit of time left until we get the final
units of the LG v 20 but in comparing it
to the v10 we are really excited to see
what changes were made going forward
while still retaining a lot of what made
the v10 such a great device the V 20
just might be the phone that you're
waiting for if you are a power user that
enjoyed the v10 from before so keep it
tuned to android authority for even more
about the LG v 20 and remember to stick
around and see all the coverage we
already did on the V 20 at Berlin
Germany at Aoife 2016 and then you can
stay tuned for even more on it and
beyond because we are your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
