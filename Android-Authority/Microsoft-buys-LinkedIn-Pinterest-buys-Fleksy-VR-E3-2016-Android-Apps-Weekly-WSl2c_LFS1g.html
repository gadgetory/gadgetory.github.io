Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to Android apps weekly this
is episode number 145 so let's get right
into it earlier this week interest up
and acquired the crew from flexi
keyboard unlike when Microsoft bought
Swift keep interest is swallowing up the
development team from flexi which means
the keyboard will likely get fewer
updates moving forward for now we don't
know for sure what will become of flexi
keyboard but right now it's not looking
good during e3 2016 it was announced
that Pokemon go would be released this
July at the very latest more information
was also released about the optional
wristband which will cost thirty-five
dollars at launch some other details
have been revealed like the fact that
you'll have to walk a bunch to make eggs
hats just like the regular Pokemon games
and you'll have to go to gyms in order
to battle people the hype is high and
we'll see how it goes next month a study
was released this week that showed app
download numbers to be down by a
dramatic amount in the United States
this could be caused by a number of
factors but the most likely ones are
that they already have these
applications and don't need to download
them or they're comfortable with the
applications they've already got the
conclusion seems to be that this is just
the app market becoming more mature but
that's not necessarily good news for app
developers Microsoft had a busy III this
week but one of their major
announcements was the release of
Minecraft realms this allows you to buy
servers directly from Microsoft to play
Minecraft and also includes
cross-platform support between mobile pc
and gear VR we imagine that consoles
will be included later on top of that
mod support is apparently coming soon as
well microsoft also announced that they
intend on purchasing linkedin for twenty
six point two billion dollars linkedin
is the social network known to be used
by professionals and a ton of people
even use it to host their resume we
don't know how these two companies are
going to work together or if it will be
like SwiftKey where they remain separate
but the boards on both companies voted
unanimously so it's probably going to
happen soon or even more of the latest
android apps and games news check out
this week's newsletter which is linked
in the video description below there we
have a ton of info that we didn't have
time for here if you would like you can
sign up for the newsletter using the
form in the written companion which is
also linked in the video description
below and we'll send you the newsletter
straight to your email every Sunday okay
folks let's take a look at the absent
game that made a big
flash this week as usual if you want to
check out any of these apps or games for
yourself you can find those links in the
video description below whether mate is
a new simple weather application that
shows you the basic weather info at a
glance it's not feature heavy like many
others so should do well if you're
looking for something quick that just
tells you the weather it has material
design a minimal interface and it's done
up in the miui 8 style of design as well
it's a solid application but it is new
and some issues are still being worked
out the developer has also expressed
that the widgets and notifications are
coming in future updates the NHL
playoffs may be over but that doesn't
mean you have to stop enjoying hockey
hockey hero is a new top-down hockey
game where you must dodge defenders get
to the paint and score a goal you won't
be playing full hockey games which is a
bit lame but you can unlock all of the
standard NHL teams and it's not a bad
way to kill a few minutes it features
8-bit graphics and sound along with
arcade style controls it's a free
download and the in-app purchase
strategy isn't too bad with rhapsody vr
is a nifty idea where it provides a
platform for artists to host in stream
360 degree content that general ideas
that you'll be able to watch live music
performances in 360 video the app should
work with Google cardboard or just
holding your phone and it's not a wholly
different concept than what Coachella
did earlier this year on YouTube the
application is having some problems with
its design and performance so it may not
be worth downloading right now but keep
it on your radar in case they decide to
clean it up and make it nice the heroes
of loot is a retro style dungeon crawler
where you pick two adventurers and then
go kill some stuff and collect loot the
main premise of the game is that you're
trying to find the loot King's lair and
grab the ultimate loot yes I know Lutz
there are four total playable characters
each with their own sets of strengths
and weaknesses and there are a variety
of quests to go through and loot to grab
unlike most dungeon crawlers these days
this one is a pay once game with no
in-app purchases the Xbox has rebranded
their Xbox SmartGlass application and
are now calling it simply Xbox the
update came earlier this week and while
it's not a complete redesign there were
visual and functional tweaks made to the
application to make it more in line with
a Windows 10 version of the Xbox app
you'll still be able to do a bunch of
things like respond to messages and see
who's online and you'll be able to see
activity feeds and access a controller
to control your xbox the only thing
missing is the ability to voice chats
and
it's free if you want it and that about
does it for this one folks if you want
to keep watching we have gary's review
of the sony xperia x linked up there on
the screen and indeed video description
