Authority and with the galaxy s7 edge
fresh on store shelves those of you with
the s6 edge may be wondering is it worth
the upgrade well that's what we're about
to find out in this comparison of the
samsung galaxy s7 edge vs. the s6 edge
so the galaxy s7 edge is not a complete
redesign from last year's s6 edge it's
more of an evolutionary upgrade so
you're going to notice that they look
pretty similar they're both made of the
same glass and metal construction which
means they're both slippery in the hand
and crazy fingerprint magnets but the s7
edge is slightly bigger due to having a
larger display despite the size
difference the s7 edge is actually the
more comfortable phone to hold the s6
edge is definitely easier to use in one
hand because it's a smaller phone but
the prominent chamfers on the s6 edge
makes the phone feel sharp
whereas on the s7 edge Samsung has
pretty much rounded off every angle
including the backside for a much better
in hand feel and it is by far one of the
best feeling phones I've ever held the
button layout is pretty much identical
to the power button is on the right
volume rockers are on the left and the
signature Samsung home button is up
front and on the bottom is the headphone
jack microUSB port and the single bottom
firing speakers so it's pretty familiar
Samsung through and through both phones
have built-in fingerprint scanners
integrated into the home button that
worked pretty well but the s7 edges is
noticeably much faster at unlocking and
ultimately more accurate they also both
have heart rate sensors on the back but
perhaps the most notable improvement to
the design of the s7 edge is the much
smaller camera bulge which looks way
better than the large protruding lens of
the s6 edge the biggest difference
between these two phones are a couple of
hardware features that you may not
notice right away just by looking at
them but they're features that Samsung
had before got rid of last year and now
they're back again so the first
difference is the s7 edge is ip68 water
and dust resistant which the s6 edge
does not have you can't really tell that
from the outside since there aren't any
flaps covering any of the ports but
that's because the ceiling is all done
from the inside this doesn't mean that
you should go throwing your phone in a
lake or anything but it does have
practice
uses like protecting your phone in a
rainstorm the occasional spill or the
one that has happened to everybody at
least once in their lifetime dropping it
in the toilet
the second huge difference is the
comeback of micro SD card expansion
again this is another difference that
you can't spot between the s7 edge and
s6 edge from the outside instead of
adding a separate tray for the SD card
slot Samsung created a hybrid SIM tray
which is just a fancy term for having
the micro SD card and SIM card in a
single tray so last year to make up for
the lack of an SD card Samsung offered a
128 gigabyte model but since microSD
card expansion is back on the s7 edge
there's only a 32 gigabyte version this
year with support for up to 200
gigabytes of extra storage to store all
of your photos and videos on the front
of the phone the s7 edge has a 5.5 inch
display over the five point one inch of
the s6 edge they're rocking the same
2560 by 1440 resolution which makes them
both very sharp looking displays but if
you consume a lot of content like games
and YouTube videos the s7 edge is
definitely the more enjoyable display
due to having the extra screen real
estate
they're both AMOLED as you would expect
from any typical Samsung phone so you're
getting those inky deep blacks
supersaturated colors and wide viewing
angles other than the size there isn't
much of a difference between these two
screens and it's just a matter of
personal preference if you'd rather have
a large screen for a better media
experience or a smaller screen for a
better one-handed usability these our
flagship phones after all so inside
they're packing the latest and greatest
specs or in the s6 edges case the latest
and greatest at that particular point in
time the s7 edge ships with 4 gigs of
RAM and will be powered by either these
snap during a 20 or the Exynos 88-90
depending on region the version that I
have is the Snapdragon model and it's
extremely fast as far as multitasking
gaming and jumping in and out of apps is
concerned you do notice some typical
stutters or quote unquote Samsung lag
from time to time especially when
swiping through home screens but
otherwise the experience is really top
notch and that aggressive RAM management
that has been an issue with Samsung
flagships in the past doesn't seem to be
much of a problem on the s7 edge the s6
edge on the other hand is running on
three gigs of RAM and Samsung's own
Exynos 7420
which is the only version of the phone
that you'll find since Samsung's opted
to purely use their own processor last
year that isn't a bad thing though
because the 7420 was one of the first
processors to use a 14 nanometer process
and is still a beast of a processor
despite being a year old at this point
and going through several updates the
phone is still very responsive and fast
with most things like multitasking and
gaming general navigation isn't quite as
fluid as the s7 edge especially within
the touchwiz launcher and you're also
not getting as good of RAM management
either but this is still a very
respectable phone in the grand scheme of
things when it comes to using it on the
daily the s6 edge its biggest problem
had to be the battery life and when
comparing the battery life to the s7
edge it's not even close s7 edge all day
no literally all day is how long the s
of an edge actually lasts and it does it
with ease too especially when it's
packin a much larger 3600 milliamp hour
battery over the 2600 milliamp hour
battery of the s6 edge the s6 edge was a
struggle to get through a full day
unless you really limited your usage but
if you do a good amount of gaming or
YouTube watching you can pretty much
forget about making it through the day
without recharging it at least once or
twice both of these phones do come with
wireless charging and fast charging
which shouldn't be alternatives to bad
battery life but rather complementary to
good battery life in the s7 edges case
Samsung got it right but with the s6
edge you're going to find yourself
taking advantage of these features more
often than you would like take a look at
the cameras the s7 edge features a 12
megapixel F 1.7 lens versus the 16
megapixel F 1.8 lens of the s6 edge
initially you may be thinking isn't this
a downgrade and on paper it may sound
like it but megapixels don't determine
everything when it comes to image
quality the actual sensor and image
processing is also very important and
Samsung chose to go with fewer
megapixels on the s7 edge in favor of a
larger pixel size for better low-light
performance the s7 edge is also
utilizing dual pixel technology that
allows for much faster autofocus in all
lighting conditions this applies for
both photo and video and you can really
see how much faster the s7 edge focuses
over the s6 edge while the s7 edge is
practically instantaneous
is the s6 edge is much slower and drifts
in and out of focus before finally
locking on to a subject as far as image
quality goes if you're just looking at
these photos at face value you won't
really notice too much of a difference
they both take great-looking photos with
vibrant colors and plenty of detail but
the s7 edges photos are ever so slightly
warmer and if you zoom in and pixel peep
you can see that the s7 edges photos are
a little bit more aggressive with the
over sharpening in some cases like
low-light for example where details tend
to get muddy or soft this extra
sharpening actually helps a lot in
preserving some of the detail the SM
edge also does a slightly better job at
handling highlights and when taking
macro shots you can really see how much
of a difference the F 1.7 aperture of
the s7 edge makes over the F 1.8
aperture of the s6 edge in terms of a
brighter photo and a creamier bokeh so
with the software both the s7 edge and
s6 edge are running on Samsung's
TouchWiz interface but the s7 edge has
the latest Android marshmallow whereas
the s6 edge is still stuck on lollipop
at least this Verizon model is anyways
you'll also notice some aesthetic
changes within TouchWiz going from the
s6 edge to the s7 edge there nothing
major but little things like the cleaner
blue and white color scheme in the
notification shade and the new animation
and transition effects makes TouchWiz
feel a little bit more polished over
previous versions most of this doesn't
really make a huge difference because if
you're really unhappy with the way that
it looks the beam Store is available on
both devices to tweak and customize the
look and feel of TouchWiz 2 exactly how
you want it the biggest difference is
the new features that the s7 edge is
packing the first one is the always-on
display this takes advantage of the
AMOLED screen by lighting up only the
necessary pixels to show you the clock
calendar or an image it can show
notifications too but only from samsung
apps at the moment so the functionality
is pretty limited but since it doesn't
make much of an impact on the phone's
battery life it's not a big deal if you
leave it turned on secondly the edge
features that were first introduced on
the s6 edge are revamped and much more
useful now it's wider to allow as many
applications to be stored and for more
information to be shown such as stocks
sports scores and weather through what
Samsung calls the edge panel
there's also a new task edge that lets
you create shortcuts to common tasks
such as creating a calendar event
setting an alarm or even taking a selfie
the s6 edge is currently missing a lot
of these features but when the s6 edge
first came out it didn't even have an
app's edge and that eventually came
through a software update so it is
perfectly possible for Samsung to bring
a lot of these features to the s6 edge
later down the road so at the end of the
day if you're a current s6 edge owner
contemplating an upgrade to the s7 edge
asking yourself if it's worth it
the answer is it's totally worth it it's
got a much more refined design a larger
display and improved camera and faster
processor and most importantly it's got
great battery life
I think the improved battery life alone
makes this phone worth getting so do
yourself a favor and make the jump
because I think you'll be plenty happy
that you did as always thank you guys so
