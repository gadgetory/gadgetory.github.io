today I'm here to talk about the Sony
experience said three plus now Sony
seemed to play a different game to the
rest and this occasion is no different
this is essentially the Zed 4 but
branded as a Zed 3 + here in the EU so
if you were to look at the device you
wouldn't say much as change from the
previous is ed 3 now this isn't a bad
thing as Sony have some of the best
designs despite the way it tends to feel
in the hand the phone's exterior houses
all the normal things you'd expect to
find all the buttons feel great
producing a nice solid click apart from
the standby button it has a sense of
looseness to it what is to note is the
button that's dedicated to the camera
shutter this is fantastic and we don't
see enough of this simply it changes the
way I use the phone to take pictures and
what's best is that I can half press to
focus awesome one of the things that
makes this a Sony phone is the way that
it looks and handles its sharp angular
and like something straight out of 2001
these are things that people will both
love and hate about this phone but it is
absolutely distinct and feels unlike
much else the body contains a metal trim
but the inclusion of a glass back is a
questionable one as nice as it is
there's a higher risk of damaging the
device not only that it's extremely
slippery you have to be careful as it
nearly slipped out of my hand quite a
few times and also on various surfaces
that I had it on the phone is smaller
than most flagships these days and as
nice as the design is it doesn't feel
all that great in the hand I prefer the
roundness of other phones such as the
oneplus one the other slight oddity is
the SIM card tray getting it out
involves yanking it out with your
fingernail and if you're like me and you
keep it trim
it's going to be a pain otherwise you'll
have to get something else like a pin
finally it's a small addition but one I
like and that is the lanyard loop
not enough phones have this so the most
important technical stuff that you need
to know for everyday use is that the
screen is a 5.2 inch 1080p IPS panel
which Sony claimed to have 130 percent
srgb coverage which is through their
triluminos technology it also contains
the x-reality engine which analyzes the
image and adds contrast saturation
sharpness and more I don't use this as
it's a bit heavy-handed other specs
worth noting are the Snapdragon 810
processor 3 gigabytes of RAM expandable
storage up to 128 gig and the 2913
milliamp battery there's a 5 megapixel
front facing camera and on the rear
there's a 20-point 7 megapixel camera
which contains an eczema RS sensor which
is capable of shooting 4k this is all
wrapped up in the IP rating of 65 and 68
making it dust and waterproof but
remember it's fresh water only so a
pretty good spec list you might be
thinking and it is especially when you
consider the phone only weighs 144 grams
and comes in at 6 point 9 millimeters
thick using this phone is pretty much
the same as any other decent SPECT phone
so like any other flagship it ticks the
boxes and contains the latest and
greatest SOC the CPU is split with four
cores running at 2 gigahertz and the
other four at 1.5 it has adequate RAM to
deal with a number of simultaneous tasks
Windows and pretty much anything you
decide to throw at it in my usage the
phone never skip to B although there has
been one standout issue that I've
experienced time and time again and that
is the heat mile or does this phone get
hot just browsing the net made the phone
hot but do anything strenuous like using
the camera and you're looking at really
high temperatures in no time at all us
experiencing temps of up to 70 degrees
Celsius easy overall it's been a
pleasure using it but compared to most
flagships and even some mid-range phones
the difference isn't as great as it once
was
sony are trying to do a commendable job
here and what
makes their phone special is the
software the best things about using
phones from Sony is the integration with
all of its services besides the design
and quality this is a next best thing
especially since the PlayStation
integration you have all of the custom
apps such as music videos social life
etc which ties into one of the services
so there's definitely something to find
an app that I'm quite fond of this life
log introduced a while back this
essentially catalogs and quantifies your
life if you let it it will give you data
ranging from your calories and steps to
how much time you spend socializing
watching videos playing games that sort
of thing unfortunately in typical Sony
fashion it's not as deep as it could be
and there's a little help about how it
all works if you have a ps4 you'll
definitely love the inclusion of remote
play you can use your phone to stream
your games and it works pretty well with
a decent Wi-Fi connection although I
wouldn't play any FPS is or anything to
make it better though you can pair your
DualShock 4 to your phone as a
controller overall it's a great
inclusion which I guess no other phone
can really match all of this is wrapped
up in Sony's UI which over time
I have grown to find acceptable there
are some logical inclusions such as the
smart call which allows you to answer
the phone by bringing up to your ear
rejecting it by turning it over but
there's also the ability to theme
there's a customizable app drawer and
lots of other stuff so it's not all bad
nowadays almost all of us end up using
our phones as our primary imaging
devices the z3 plus includes a twenty
point seven megapixel shooter with an
eczema RS sensor technical details aside
taking photos with this phone physically
is a dream I love the dedicated camera
shutter button with a half press to
focus looking at the images though it's
nothing too special photos look good in
adequate light but fall apart completely
in low-light or when you zoom in however
the colors are accurate and there
doesn't seem to be too much
post-processing going on
the camera software is one of the better
implementations I've used and comparing
to stock Android it's light years ahead
there's a manual mode for both imaging
and video which offers you some but not
many controls for adjustment there's a
bunch of novel modes such as a sound
photo time shift video and all that
stuff it's easy and it's fun should you
need it the z3 plus records 4k video now
let's take a minute the whole notion is
pretty incredible and completely
mind-boggling that is when it works
recording in 4k lasted the best of 20
seconds before it had to stop to cool
down well anyways however in good light
the picture is fantastic detail is there
and the phone doesn't continuously hunt
for focus and to aid the shooting you've
got software bass is called steady shot
which like previous phones works great
mind you this is at the cost of a
cropped image though some of you may
know that I mainly use my phone to
listen to music I personally like how
Sony seemed to be one of the very few
manufacturers to pay attention to audio
the z3 plus continues this with the
support for high res audio basically
this allows native support of high
resolution audio formats that are
encoded and sampled at higher rate sony
include various audio enhancers such as
clear Audio plus surround effects and a
plugin to help compress audio match the
quality of high res however I'd stay
away from these as they tend to change
the soundstage a bit too much it's also
worth noting that besides the HTC One
the z3 plus is one of the best phones
I've used for audio all of this is
nothing without the battery life to
support it and this will obviously
differ depending on your usage with
heavy use the phone struggles to last a
full day giving me roughly 3 hours of
screen on time with lighter use I could
get much further and so could you
Sony include a number of battery saving
options in addition to androids owned by
personally refused to use any of these
unless I have to because I really don't
want to sacrifice my experience so here
we are at the end of the day I'm not
really
or what to say about this phone it takes
a lot these days to really push a
high-end smartphone without doing
something completely different
unfortunately I don't think Sony will
ever do as well as some of the other
companies now that's a shame because the
products that they put out find fans
really really big fans and that is for
good reason
their products are fantastic it just
doesn't tend to be for the mass market
and if Sony are ok with that then they
could capitalize on the niche
highlighting things such as the high res
audio and the IP certification there are
some issues with this device but they're
all ones that could be fixed via
software updates so if you're invested
in the Sony ecosystem then this phone
could be great for you if you're not it
still is a great smartphone overall it's
just that there might be more
competitive options out there for the
same feature set anyways thanks for
listening guys let us know what you
think down below and if you have any
questions let me know on twitter at
trembling water or even on google+ take
it easy
and i'll see you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
