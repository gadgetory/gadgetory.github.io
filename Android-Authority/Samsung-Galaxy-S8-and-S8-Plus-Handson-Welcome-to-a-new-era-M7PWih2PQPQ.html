with the latest in their Galaxy S line
bringing a familiar but further refined
body that is even edgier than ever it's
Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody
and this is the Samsung Galaxy s8 and
the Galaxy s8 plus there are two
versions of the newest Samsung device
and the names no longer used the word
edge making it clearer than ever that
the curved display is the Galaxy calling
card moving forward the edges have the
usual tropes like the edge UX or any of
the features at the edge brings to the
table
however it's less about that and more
about how these curved displays defy
logic
the Galaxy s8 crams a 5.7 inch screen
onto a body that feels much smaller than
that leads on and the curves come down
to meet the hand better than ever
however for the Samsung Galaxy s8 plus
it manages to cram in a 6.2 inch display
onto a body that feels kind of decent to
handle in one hand and a few things had
to change in order to make this happen
mainly a resolution ship 229 60 by 1440
for an aspect ratio of eighteen point
five by nine and the galaxy s 8 plus
manages to get a little bit taller
rather than wider in order to
accommodate this change another change
comes in the removal of the hardware key
yes this is actually happening folks the
hardware home button is now gone by the
wayside and even the Samsung logo at the
top is gone as well
on the back now is the fingerprint
reader and while it doesn't feel too bad
on the SI the SI plus makes it feel
awkward because you have to reach for it
and the change towards more display mean
soft keys which means a navbar and
customization speaking of software
delays addition to the galaxy suite of
apps is a whole new layer of assistance
called Bigsby Bigsby is a little bit
like Samsung's version of Google now and
voice search and it can be triggered
with yet another hardware change a new
button underneath the volume rocker our
time with Bigsby only really showed the
splash screen where contextual slides
are shown including new stories and
calendar entries however further actions
are available especially with voice
input which we saw in a demo functions
here included changing the brightness or
taking a selfie and a new layer to the
camera is available now as well as
Bigsby can use the camera to scan not
only words so you can translate among
dozens of different languages we can
also find product in
formation for pretty much any item we
plan to spend a lot of time with big
speed to see what it offers and to see
if it's truly a new layer of assistance
or just a redundancy because you still
get Google assistant built-in and all of
this is housed in a water-resistant body
that we were almost aggressively invited
to dunk and that body protects a bevy of
hardware bits that users have come to
expect a 10 nanometer octa-core
processor that Samsung is not really
telling us clearly if it's the
Snapdragon or the latest Exynos which is
probably going to mean it's a mix of the
two four gigabytes of ram expandable
storage a headphone jack thank goodness
every sensor in connection type possible
and a 3000 milliamp hour battery for the
s8 and 3500 milliamp hours for the SI
plus the camera is also quite familiar
with 12 megapixels on the rear and 8
megapixels on the front F 1.7 aperture
for both what we were told however was
that the cameras have gotten better
post-processing so the picture should
have an enhancement but it's more on the
software side than just on the sheer
specs so Samsung strives to make changes
in just the right places even if it does
mean a shift and familiarity gone are
the Samsung logos the tactile home
button and flat panels in our Bigsby and
its new button a shifted fingerprint
reader and screens that simply don't
quit there are more capabilities that
can be unlocked using the Galaxy S 8 and
s 8 plus but you have to use their
various tools in the Samsung ecosystem
like the gear 360 and Samsung decks
Samsung decks blows up the already large
home screen to literally desktop size
with a lot of features built in all of
these different pieces will be covered
here at Android authority and we
encourage you to check out those pieces
of content and video our first look at
the Samsung Galaxy s8 makes us really
