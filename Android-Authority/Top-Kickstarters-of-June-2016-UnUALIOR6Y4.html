peek into the future of Technology my
friends from wearable subwoofers
to the 2016 version of The Clapper this
is top Kickstarter's of the month
hello everybody I'm crystal Ora and June
seem to be the most exciting month when
it came to Kickstarter projects and this
first project is something I've been
dreaming up for a long time the idea
comes from attending a concert you know
that feeling you get when the bass at a
concert just slaps you in the chest and
vibrates your soul it's such a great
feeling and probably my favorite part of
attending a concert now what if you
could capture that concert energy and
bring it along with you as a wearable I
was waiting for somebody to invent a
wearable bass vest that you could wear
but the company low felt came up with a
better idea called the bass let the bass
'let is a world's first watch sized
subwoofer for your body using a whole
new technology for sound you'll now
literally be able to feel the music as
the baselet delivers the beats and bass
lines directly to your wrist this
bracelet is completely silent to the
outside world but despite the size
you'll feel as though as you're
surrounded by the sound it looks very
similar to a watch and you can see wear
it around your wrist and what's cool
about it is you can easily remove the
strap to the baselet so it can be
replaced with any other 24 millimeter
watt strap so you can create your own
look the baselet will work with anything
that has a 3.5 millimeter jack you just
connect the sender here between your
headphones and the device playing the
music strap on the wireless baselet and
that's it the baselet will effortlessly
recreate bass frequencies down to 10
Hertz right to your wrist it'll be
interesting to see just how strong these
bass recreations will feel if they will
translate further down or up and just to
your wrist low felt was seeking about
fifty six thousand dollars for the bass
lid and even with over twenty days left
to go they have received over two
hundred thousand dollars so it's coming
and we can expect the bass led to start
shipping in December of this year next
we have knocky knocky is a smart little
device that essentially makes any
surface smart is based on the idea that
home automation although it's meant to
make our life simpler actually can be
quite confusing and unfortunately just
makes things more complicated well what
if there was a device that can snap on
to any already existing piece of
furniture that you have in your home and
transform that piece of furniture into a
touch interface that's exactly what naki
does let's say you place knocking onto a
table
well now that table will respond to your
touch well more so your knock now when
you knock on that table anything can
happen you can have your TV turn on or
your lights could turn off maybe a text
could be sent from your phone or music
could start playing or perhaps you could
snooze an alarm the possibilities are
endless doesn't this remind you of the
clapper from years ago well the problem
with that and other things that are
meant to automate the home is that
there's just too many factors that can
disrupt these signals like claps and
even voice well a knock has certain
frequencies and vibrations to it where
naki is smart enough to understand real
knock signals and filter out random
vibrations so naki can work even under
high activity surfaces naki can trigger
multiple different things depending on
how many times you knock for example one
not can play a song two can skip three
can raise the volume and four can lower
this is all possible with the naki app
that communicates to different devices
using Wi-Fi
if Nike comes to market it'll cost about
99 dollars
so how good is it looking for Nike well
their Kickstarter is just about up and
they were only seeking a pretty low goal
of $35,000 but 8,000 backers later they
have raised over 1 million dollars so
yeah hockey is going to become a reality
and once again we can expect to see it
in December of this year next we have a
project that me and my friend Charlie
here can really relate with it's called
go bone it's an all-day play toy for you
and your dog that connects to your
smartphone pulse Pet the careers of go
bone we're heartbroken at the fact that
so many dog owners can work almost 40 50
or even 60 hours a week without really
having any time to play with their hairy
little friends and that's actually
pretty alarming because dogs need
exercise to release their energy and
free their minds or else all that energy
could store up and translate to behavior
problems this is especially the case in
shelters where dogs can be alone in a
cell for days weeks and even months
without any real interaction with
anything not even a toy and a big goal
of pulse pet is to use the go bone to
bring out a dog's personality and
establish a healthy mind to help those
dolls and shelters become more adoptable
go bone is an L
tronic toy that entices your dog to play
by moving around on its own keeping it
active all your way you can put some
food inside tap on it and it'll start
moving around and thanks to the app that
is hooked up to you can have it move in
any way you like
go bone can move a certain way depending
on how large your dog is how much it
weighs and how old your dog is to ensure
the most fun experience the app also
allows you to maneuver the toy manually
and even play certain games like a
gesture based fetch game or even
hide-and-seek now I know a lot of you
are probably thinking crystal if you
give that toy to that beast over there
he's gonna rip it apart in a heartbeat
and expose a dangerous electronic
components inside well fortunately
enough the go bone can come apart very
easily so if certain components like the
rubberized tires or middle section
become too chewed they can easily be
replaced Pulse pet also says that their
mechanical engineer has been designing
rugged military products for years to
ensure that go bones electronics will
always be safely enclosed this project
is about to finish up any hour now but
pulse vet has already well reached their
goal with the $176,000 pledged over
their original $60,000 goal next we have
something you may have heard of before
is called nope but this month we have
the sequel called nope 2.0 the original
nope product was also found on
Kickstarter a while back and it was a
huge success it was a magnetic privacy
shield for cameras found on desktops
laptops mobile phones and tablets but
this time around is even more simple
elegant and easier to use we've all
looked at the webcam staring at us on
our laptops and at least once thought is
someone watching me and as silly as that
question sounds the answer could very
well be yes someone is watching you and
if that creeps you out and makes you say
nope well that's where nope 2.0 comes
into play
nope 2.0 is a very thin product at only
11 millimeters thin that magnetically
hooks onto a camera for any device it's
so thin you can still easily close your
laptop when needed well just like the
first version of nope nope 2.0 has
already been a great
and even with over 40 days to go the
creators were only seeking 964 bucks but
they have already received $26,000
lastly we have something called oh six
by fingertips lab oh six is a small
little dial that you can put anywhere on
a desk onto a steering wheel or even
around your wrist its purpose is to free
your eyes and allow you to keep looking
at the world around you while still
interacting with your smart devices like
phones tablets and computers it connects
to a device of your choice let's say a
smartphone via bluetooth and from there
just by turning the dial you can browse
operate and toggle between virtually any
app while your eyes remain on something
else like the road or even when you're
walking the phone could be in your
pocket but you can still read text
browse Twitter or make phone calls all
thanks to the OU six using speech
feedback oh six also provides an open
API platform to send and receive data
and commands to its sensors so future
apps will be able to work with this
physical dial it seems like a great way
to be able to access any area of your
phone just by a touch of a dial and
listening while your eyes remains
focused the oh-6 Kickstarter campaign
will be up on July 3rd but already
fingertips lab has reached their
$100,000 goal with one hundred and forty
thousand dollars pledged so that'll do
it for this month's episode of top
Kickstarter's of the month
lots of interesting things here so let
me know your thoughts in the comments
below do you think any of these were
just silly or are you pretty excited for
them please leave a like if you enjoyed
