peek into the future of technology my
friends from wearable subwoofers to the
2016 version of the clapper this is top
Kickstarter's of the month
hello everybody I'm crystal Laura and
June seemed to be the most exciting
month when it came to Kickstarter
projects and this first project is
something I've been dreaming up for a
long time the idea comes from attending
a concert you know that feeling you get
when the base at a concert just slaps
you in the chest and vibrates your soul
it's such a great feeling and probably
my favorite part of attending a concert
now what if you could capture that
concert energy and bring it along with
you as a wearable I was waiting for
somebody to invent a wearable base vest
that you could wear but the company low
felt came up with a better idea called
the base let the baselet is a world's
first watch size subwoofer for your body
using a whole new technology for sound
you'll now literally be able to feel the
music as the baselet delivers the beats
and bass lines directly to your wrist
this bracelet is completely silent to
the outside world but despite the size
you'll feel as though as you're
surrounded by the sound it looks very
similar to a watch and yes you wear it
around your wrist and what's cool about
it is you can easily remove the strap to
the baselet so it can be replaced with
any other 24 millimeter wat strap so you
can create your own look the baselet
will work with anything that has a 3.5
millimeter jack you just connect the
sender here between your headphones and
the device playing the music strap on
the wireless baselet and that's it the
baselet will effortlessly recreate bass
frequencies down to 10 Hertz right to
your wrist it'll be interesting to see
just how strong these bass recreations
will feel if they will translate further
down or up and just to your wrist low
felt was seeking about 56,000 dollars
for the bass lid and even with over 20
days left to go they have received over
two hundred thousand dollars so it's
coming and we can expect the bass led to
start shipping in December of this year
next we have naki naki is a smart little
device that essentially makes any
surface smart is based on the idea that
home automation although it's meant to
make our life simpler actually can be
quite confusing and unfortunately just
makes things more complicated well what
if there was a device that can snap onto
any already existing piece of furniture
that you have in your home and transform
that piece of furniture into a touch
interface that's exactly what naki does
let's say you place knocking out to a
table
well now that table will respond to your
touch well more so your knock now when
you knock on that table anything can
happen you can have your TV turn on or
your lights could turn off maybe a text
could be sent from your phone or music
to start playing or perhaps you could
snooze an alarm the possibilities are
endless doesn't this remind you of the
clapper from years ago well the problem
with that and other things that are
meant to automate the home is that
there's just too many factors that can
disrupt these signals like claps and
even voice well anak has certain
frequencies and vibrations to it where
naki is smart enough to understand real
knock signals and filter out random
vibrations so knock you can work even
under high activity surfaces naki can
trigger multiple different things
depending on how many times you knock
for example one not can play a song to
can skip three can raise the volume and
four can lower this is all possible with
the naki app that communicates to
different devices using Wi-Fi if naki
comes to market it'll cost about ninety
nine dollars so how good is it looking
for naki well their Kickstarter is just
about up and they were only seeking a
pretty little goal of 35 thousand
dollars but eight thousand backers later
they have raised over 1 million dollars
so yeah hockey is going to become a
reality and once again we can expect to
see it in December of this year next we
have a project that me and my friend
Charlie here can really relate with it's
called go bone it's an all-day play toy
for you and your dog that connects to
your smartphone pulse pet the creators
of go bone we're heartbroken at the fact
that so many dog owners can work almost
40 50 or even 60 hours a week without
really having any time to play with
their hairy little friends and that's
actually pretty alarming because dogs
need exercise to release their energy
and free their minds or else all that
energy could store up and translate to
behavior problems this is especially the
case in shelters where dogs can be alone
in a cell for days weeks and even months
without any real interaction with
anything not even a toy and a big goal
of pulse pen is to use the go bone to
bring out a dog's personality and
establish a healthy mind to help those
dolls and shelters become more adoptable
go bone is an
chronic toy that entices your dog to
play by moving around on its own keeping
it active all your way you can put some
food inside tap on it and it'll start
moving around and thanks to the app that
is hooked up to you can have it move in
any way you like go bone can move a
certain way depending on how large your
dog is how much of ways and how old your
dog is to ensure the most fun experience
the app also allows you to maneuver the
toy manually and even play certain games
like a gesture-based fetch game or even
hide and seek now I know a lot of you
are probably thinking crystal if you
give that toy to that beast over there
he's going to rip it apart in a
heartbeat and expose a dangerous
electronic components inside well
fortunately enough the go bone can come
apart very easily so if certain
components like the rubberized tires or
middle section become too chewed they
can easily be replaced pulse pet also
says that their mechanical engineer has
been designing rugged military products
for years to ensure that go bones
electronics will always be safely
enclosed this project is about to finish
up any hour now but pulse pet has
already well reached their goal with the
176 thousand-dollar pledge over their
original 60 thousand dollar goal next we
have something you may have heard of
before is called nope but this month we
have the sequel called nope to point out
the original nope product was also found
on Kickstarter a while back and it was a
huge success it was a magnetic privacy
shield for cameras found on desktops
laptops mobile phones and tablets but
this time around is even more simple
elegant and easier to use we've all
looked at the webcam staring at us on
our laptops and at least once thought is
someone watching me and as silly as that
question sounds the answer could very
well be yes someone is watching you and
if that creeps you out and makes you say
nope well that's where nope to point no
comes into play nope two point O is a
very thin product at only 11 millimeters
thin that magnetically hooks onto a
camera for any device it's so thin you
can still easily close your laptop when
needed well just like the first version
of nope nope two point O has already
been a great success and
with over forty days to go the creators
were only seeking 964 bucks but they
have already received twenty six
thousand dollars lastly we have
something called 06 by fingertips lab 06
is a small little dial that you can put
anywhere on a desk onto a steering wheel
or even around your wrist its purpose is
to free your eyes and allow you to keep
looking at the world around you while
still interacting with your smart
devices like phones tablets and
computers it connects to a device of
your choice let's say a smartphone via
bluetooth and from there just by turning
the dial you can browse operate and
toggle between virtually any app while
your eyes remain on something else like
the road or even when you're walking the
phone could be in your pocket but you
can still read text browse Twitter or
make phone calls all thanks to the 06
using speech feedback 06 also provides
an open API platform to send and receive
data and commands to its sensors so
future apps will be able to work with
this physical dial it seems like a great
way to be able to access any area of
your phone just by a touch of a dial and
listening while your eyes remains
focused the 06 Kickstarter campaign will
be up on July third but already
fingertips lab has reached their
$100,000 goal with 140 thousand dollars
pledged so that'll do it for this
month's episode of top Kickstarter's of
the month lots of interesting things

comments below do you think any of these
