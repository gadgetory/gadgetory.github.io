jam-packed day was about to begin and we
had our first day with Huawei at their
headquarters in Shenzhen China now the
campus sections in China was a little
bit far away from our hotel and once we
got there we found out that a couple of
kilometers in one direction and a couple
of kilometers in the other direction
comprised what was going to be the
entire campus but in our case we were
going to what was called an experience
centre where obviously while we had a
lot of different types of presentations
already catered to the visitors who are
coming to there and for us we were of
course called the distinguished media
guests this particular leg of the tour
really made one thing clear to us
Huawei's history in telecommunications
is really one of their calling cards
when it comes to what they're trying to
do in the smartphone market now we got a
lot of different presentations showing
us basically not only what they're
hoping to do in the future but what they
have already done for people around the
world in order to bring cellular
networks and also mobile Internet to the
masses one such demonstration that
showed what Huawei is hoping to create
for the future was this small cell on
demand these are small boxes repeaters
basically for mobile networks that will
allow for places like underground
Subway's to get mobile Internet access
for all of the people who might be in
that particular network making it easier
for everyone to keep a signal rather
than lose it and then of course there is
the 5g idea now we have 5g pretty much
coming over the next maybe two or three
years at the latest and Huawei's
envisioning of the 5g network stems not
only from the speed of mobile networks
but by the Internet of Things the idea
that the 5g network will be able to
control billions of different things
across its own networks like streaming
4k videos in a seamless way with
hundreds of gigabits being uploaded and
downloaded at once we did finally make
it over to the device section now
Huawei's ascend mate seven have
front-and-center placement but the honor
series was also there as well the
general area just looked like a booth
from one of the trade shows like CES or
MWC or Aoife but we did get a little bit
more insight into the honor series which
is going to be considered a somewhat
separate brand from the huawei ascend
series and like I said
already the honor 6 plus is the phone
that I'm using right now and a review on
that will be coming pretty soon one part
that's interesting that you can kind of
see in the background already is right
next to this device area was a
Polynesian break room it's a place that
we wanted to try out for ourselves to
see how Huawei takes a breather from
their work but unfortunately we weren't
able to sit down in there and have a cup
of coffee to be shown even more of what
Huawei has or is looking to do we took
another short drive out to another part
of the campus where our we were going to
be shown quite a few other iterations of
their mobile networking and what it
could do for people what really caught
our eye was this patent wall which has
hundreds upon hundreds of different
patents from different standards across
the world not only in Asia but also from
the US and even the European Union all
of the different patterns that allow
them to create the devices that they are
able to make never have we seen
something like this where it is pretty
much all out in the open for you to look
at but we weren't able to take a look at
a lot of data center and cloud computing
solutions here while we also has a very
high stake in the server business
including clouds and a lot of the
technology not only from mobile but also
to the data storage and the data
consumption is done in different areas
across the spectrum including military
as you can see here and we also got a
look at what might be the future of
banking with this automated ATM that
does not only the automated teller
systems but also even everything that a
regular bank would do we then settled in
for what was going to be the room that
we will call home for the next day and a
half where we will conduct all of our
interviews with the various high-level
representatives there and a couple of
those interviews did happen a little bit
later in that day which you will see in
the upcoming clip but also in full
interview maybe around 15 minutes
snippets of the hour-long interviews we
did if you make something know more if
they're hard for them to check if you
make something house they excellent they
were like to share if you make the true
difference
they were like to ship so we need to
make something how say we say make it
possible when you to make something
looks to impossible possible maybe we
are not doing them well now but we need
to do it later
step by step every product we need to if
you remember how many were say the S&amp;amp;P
was limited smartphone and ascent made
to the biggest smartphone and ascent the
t1 the most powerful smartphone and the
ascend mate is the best luxury
smartphone it's some stupid word we are
using but it's really we want people
know this is different and also not only
this thing this matter there's a lot of
Technology not a company showing up what
they can do but think about it you know
for example like I have a two arms or I
have three legs that doesn't mean it's
like a really true value to our consumer
you don't need that so is we don't want
to do to that kind of gesture what we
are focusing on right now how we can
deliver the true value to our consumer
that's our really main area so since p6
we're not really addressing that like
whoa finish no but we try to you know
provide a compact as much as possible
but not just for showing out that wolf's
thinnest thing
no stessa already almost tears you know
before concentration so you know today I
can do tell you our really main focus is
all about the true value the
philosophies behind the various devices
like the ascent mate7 and even the P
series and the Honor series we're all
par for the course here and they were
all parts of our discussion that you can
see in the interviews that I will have
available for you for consumption over
the next day or so you can also take a
look on the side there for the first
vlog style video that we had there and
then the final vlog savio that comes
right after this with our next day going
over to Shanghai in China to take a look
at the
quarters of Huawei make sure you stay
tuned for the rest of those here in
