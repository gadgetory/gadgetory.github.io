handy the Android thority app guy
everyone cares about the weather it
determines whether or not we should be
carrying an umbrella or a jacket or be
hiding in the lowest part of our house
so today we're going to be taking a look
at the best weather apps for Android
first on our list today is the Weather
Channel the venerable authority on the
weather at least on TV is number 9 on
our list
sadly the Weather Channel app used to be
a lot better but recent updates have
scaled down the functionality quite
offence it still delivers the weather
and radar but that's really all you can
get out of it these days the app took a
left turn and started doing some social
achievement points thing that half of
the people liked and half of the people
don't like it's still a great weather
app with some solid widget options but
it may be a little too much pizazz for
some people 8th on our list is a nifty
little weather app called radar now if
you don't want the fancy apps with the
potentially bloated features then you
want radar now it contains a simple
interface that shows you the radar in
your area and weather upon request it
really is a minimal app there are no
screens to swipe there were things to
look at just a big old radar waiting for
you when you open it to use the weather
click the cloud button at the top and
it'll show you the weather there isn't
even a widget so if you want something
small and out of the way this is your
best bet
next up is a weather service that we're
all pretty much familiar with called a
key weather it's a well-known and
generally trusted service for the most
part and the app isn't all that bad
either it comes with the standard
features like radar hourly forecasts
weekly forecasts and more you can also
pay to remove the ads the app is very
hollow centric so for hallo Yolo fans
you will be pleased the widgets are no
different you can get a desk clock style
widget if you prefer and there is also a
dark and light holo style widget you can
add as well overall it adds up to an
above average experience for weather
fans number six on the list is a capable
weather app called weather Pro it's a
pretty functional app with a nice
interface and has most of the features
that you could ask for this includes a
large variety of weather charts radar
daily forecasts and a whole lot more the
widgets aren't bad either ok so here's
the thing with weather Pro on its own
it's a perfectly decent paid weather app
however there are a few services that
the app makes you pay a premium to use
that's right it's a paid app that makes
you pay a second time for features so it
may very well have been a top three
weather app but we'll never know now
because paying for features twice is a
really bad idea into the world of
Android WeatherBug elite qualifies as a
relic it's been around since the good
old days of Android 1.5 and 1.6 and it's
still around today the impressive part
is that it's still among the best
weather apps out there has all your
standard features like hourly and weekly
forecasts and even radars the widgets
for WeatherBug elite are actually really
nice and are definitely the apps strong
suit the background and text on each
widget is customizable so you can fit it
to any theme it's always been a good app
for Android and it seems like it will be
for a long time
number four on our list is called and I
hope I get this one right el medio
whether for our friends were more
interested in international weather this
is a great app to start with you can
look up and save locations across the
world for quick reference the only
downside is it isn't as feature heavy as
some of these other ones in terms of
widgets it's not necessarily a weak
offering but it's far from being as
strong as some of the others on this
list there is a clock widget in a small
weather widget one of the fun little
features in this app is the ability to
report on the weather directly from the
app so if it's inaccurate or needs an
update you could do it personally
those'll first in our top three is Yahoo
weather it's been a long time since yeah
who has been a top three and well
anything but their weather app is
actually pretty decent
it was also updated very recently and
now touts a new and slick interface with
a few new features is it better than it
was before oh yeah the improvements are
too numerous to list here so we'll
outline just a few its added features
like daily forecasts maps wind and
pressure precipitation and sun and moon
phases it's not too much different from
what it used to be but it's still way
way better
number two is from a name pretty much
everyone already knows of course we're
talking about go weather from the people
who brought you all of those other go
apps this is a solid weather app that
delivers at least the basics and what
you need for weather where go whether
really shines is the theming you can get
widget themes and app themes to make
your weather look how you want it to
look the premium version brings an extra
widget and some extra features including
the theming but the free ones work just
fine as well it's one of the best if you
need to theme your weather and it also
works really well with go launcher
and here we are the number one best app
on the list and it's weather local
forecast also known as one weather this
weather app is simply put beautiful it
has everything you could possibly need
it has radar forecasts weather by the
our weather fun facts every time you
open the app and just a general
awesomeness that surrounds it it's all
wrapped up in a very nice interface and
it even has really nice widgets these
include a clock widget a fashionable
little circle widget and a few other
widget options you can pay to remove the
ads but it's otherwise free to use
really couldn't find much to complain
about with this one if you look at the
leaderboard you can see all these apps
and how they stack up as usual it's how
they were rated in the Play Store and
not our personal ratings so there is no
bias here to check them out use the
links in the video description this is
truly one of the most varied apps that
we've done you have your basic minimal
weather apps your full-featured weather
apps and even a few apps with some
unique and fun features like go launcher
steaming or weather local forecasts
weather fun facts
