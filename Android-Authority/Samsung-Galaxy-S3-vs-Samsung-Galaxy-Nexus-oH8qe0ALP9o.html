clayton with android authority calm
today going to bring you a head-to-head
comparison of the brand spankin new
samsung galaxy s3 vs. the OG samsung
galaxy nexus now i have the unlocked
version the international version of the
samsung galaxy s3 then I've got the cdma
verizon version of the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus so before we dig too deep into
these two phones we'll just go over some
of their specs the galaxy s3 being a
little newer is going to come out on top
in this area but I will just go through
it for the heck of it so to start off
the Galaxy Nexus has a four point six
five inch Super AMOLED display and the
resolution on that is 720 x 1280 p and
the galaxy s3 has a four point eight
inch Super AMOLED display also with a
resolution of 720 x 1280 now we do have
a difference the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
has 316 pixels per inch so you get a
nice clear image and you get a clear
image on the samsung galaxy s3 as well
but it's only three hundred and six
pixels per inch so there's about 10
pixels per inch more on the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus but the samsung galaxy s3
is made out of corning gorilla glass now
the Samsung Galaxy Nexus has one
gigabyte of RAM and so does the galaxy
s3 but the Galaxy Nexus is running a
dual-core 1.2 gigahertz cortex a9
processor the TI OMAP chipset and the
gs3 has a quad-core 1.4 gigahertz cortex
a9 with designers chipset now I've got a
case on both of these phones but I'll
just pop them off so we can get a good
look at what these look like in all
their glory there and a low battery on
this thing is let us take this out and
take the Galaxy Nexus out of its case so
as you can see here these are our two
phones they're just about as thick as
each other at the top of the Galaxy
Nexus at least then the bottom of the
Galaxy Nexus gets a little bulbous
because I am running a extended battery
get into that in a minute anyways this
is our top view on the galaxy s through
we have our
phone jack on top we've got that on the
bottom of our galaxy nexus and our micro
USB port is on the bottom for both our
volume rockers on the same side we've
got the up and down of course and so is
our power button but the Galaxy Nexus
has our three pin dock connector right
there anyways if you see we'll turn this
up like this if you can catch that the
Galaxy Nexus does have a curved glass
screen so it's not the corning gorilla
glass but it is curved it's really nice
a sexy look there anyways on the back of
the Galaxy Nexus we've got a 5 megapixel
rear facing camera with a maximum
resolution of 2,500 92 by 1944 pixels
and then on the back of the samsung
galaxy s3 we've got an 8 megapixel rear
facing camera with a maximum resolution
of 30 264 pixels by 20 448 now they both
record in 1080p and they both have LED
flash the front-facing camera on the
galaxy s3 is a 1.9 megapixel capable of
720p video capture excuse me and the
Galaxy Nexus is a 1.3 megapixel also
capable 720p within these two phones
we've got a 1750 million battery in the
Galaxy Nexus i am going to be extended
with the original battery seven hundred
and seventeen hundred and 50 milliamps
and the samsung galaxy s3 is a 20 100
million battery so if we're running the
stock battery configurations on each
phone the galaxy s3 will beat out the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus okay so both of
these devices are running the Android 40
Ice Cream Sandwich operating system the
Galaxy Nexus is pure vanilla Android
it's the pure AOSP Android Open Source
Project build there's no carrier overlay
there is no manufacturer overlay but the
galaxy s3 has the TouchWiz overlay by
Samsung so it is unlock both of these
phones as you can see here the icons and
the soft keys are in a little bit of
different place on each the soft keys
are all available on screen for the
Galaxy Nexus and then we have our
physical home button as well as our
capacitive menu and back buttons now on
the Galaxy Nexus we can open on Reese
apps by pressing the recents button and
of course swipe to remove and then we do
the same just by pressing the home
button and holding on the galaxy s3 but
with the TouchWiz overlay we get to
access the task manager and also we can
just choose to remove all clear our
memory that way now being that these
devices are each the Android 40
operating system the only difference is
in the user interface are going to be
due to the galaxy s3 running touch with
so from the home screen will just go
through some of the basic software
features of each of these devices we've
got our status bar drop down
notification bar here and on the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus I do have it rooted so
there are some external toggles extra
you know aftermarket stuff and on the
galaxy s3 we have our TouchWiz themed
toggles and whatnot but on each device
we can easily access the settings by
simply pressing the two settings menus
within the menu we have our noticeable
differences in touch wiz with the
colorful icons over here as compared to
the grey and blue usual user interface
of the android 40 Ice Cream Sandwich
operating system we have our Wi-Fi
options are bluetooth we do have data
usage on both of course basically exact
same thing and we can go down i have my
rom control because this is a rooted
device the galaxy s3 has rooted as well
but i don't have a custom rom running
right now we've got our sound display
storage options now one thing I do like
about the Samsung Galaxy Nexus is that
you can change the devices brightness
simply by pulling down the status bar
here and you can just control it like
that now with the samsung galaxy s3 I
have a complaint that there is no master
brightness control we can go to our
brightness here and change it like that
but if we were to go to a web page we
would have to change the brightness
right here through brightness and colors
so I'm changing the brightness on the
main screen of the device or through the
settings menu does not change the master
brightness of the device don't I saw
just go through some of the rest of this
stuff we have our power saving feature
on the samsung galaxy s3 that we're
lacking on
Galaxy Nexus we can view our battery
statistics how long they've lasted and
whatnot what's been using the battery
basic features of the Android for dot 0
Ice Cream Sandwich operating system we
have our developer options on both which
allows us to select 2d hardware
acceleration whatnot if we go to the
about device we're seeing that we run
Android for dot 0 dot 4 on each of them
okay so we'll just open the camera on
each of these devices unable to use
flash but anyways we'll just go and
we'll see which one can actually take a
photo faster the Galaxy Nexus was
originally marketed to have zero shutter
lag which it holds true to that see all
those are pictures I'm taking right now
and I take them just about as fast both
extremely fast now if we go to our
settings on the Galaxy Nexus we have our
scene settings we've got our white
balance um options there and then we can
set it manually right here and we have
our flash mode but that's basically all
we have besides the picture size and
whatnot we have a lot more options on
the samsung galaxy s3 such as like
self-portrait we have our single shot
shooting mode we can also put that into
HDR burst shot panorama which was one of
the features on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
ever exposure value we can choose
whether or not we want auto focus macro
or face detection we have our this is
actually another way to access those
options we have our front facing cameras
of course on both and then during video
recording on both of these devices we
can take pictures simultaneously so from
the video recorder and we are recording
the video on the Galaxy Nexus we simply
tap the screen taking a picture and then
we simply tap the picture icon on the
galaxy s3 anyways that was the camera
you guys the Galaxy Nexus has pretty
nice pictures for 5 megapixels but the
galaxy s3 has better quality with its
eight million pixels
okay so we'll just do a browser
comparison now both of these basically
have the same browsing features but the
TouchWiz overlay on the samsung galaxy
s3 does make a slight difference anyways
we're on Google with both of these and
when we pull down we can access our URL
bar as well as our bookmarks and our
tabs now I'm the Samsung Galaxy Nexus we
have our options and our menu right here
and I also have the soft key for it so
we bring those up we have the option to
refresh bookmark saved to bookmarks
across the desktop site basically all
the same stuff over here because if we
have some brightness controls we can
access our downloads so we can print and
create our new windows and bookmarks
from here anyways when we open up our
tabs on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus we can
just add like that click our tabs
utility and they come up in this fashion
sort of like the recent apps and then on
the samsung galaxy s3 we add them and
they're in a page utility kind of like
how they are on the HTC sense now
anyways we scroll through like this
Samsung Galaxy Nexus we go up and down
and to remove a tab we can simply swipe
it to the left on the galaxy s3 we must
press the little minus button there
anyways they're basically the exact same
you know they each have the labs under
the developmental settings is that labs
and I'm here we have our labs and we can
use our quick controls on each go back
to our webpage and now on each we can
bring our thumb in access the new tab
our tab manager new window bookmarks and
menu same with on the galaxy s3 same
thing so the browser is basically the
exact same guys you're not really going
to get that much varied in browsers
unless you're running an extreme overlay
now the TouchWiz is not that extreme
basically keeps true to the android open
source project browser now anyways just
some final thoughts on these two phones
of course being the vanilla Google
flagship device the Galaxy Nexus does
have massive developer support and a lot
of the features of the galaxy s3 have in
fact been ported over to the Galaxy
Nexus already can check out our video on
the gs3 add-on pack for
Galaxy Nexus and of course you can
overclock the Galaxy Nexus to a stable
1.4 gigahertz and that brings it to the
same speed as the galaxy s3 the galaxy
s3 is quad-core and you can also
overclock this I have in fact been able
to get it stable e up to eighteen
hundred megahertz 1.8 giga hertz you can
see i do that right now and i can scroll
all the way through there's our 14
megahertz i'll just set it at 1500
megahertz okay so another thing to keep
in mind guys is that the Galaxy Nexus is
available in the gsm unlocked version
it's also available for sprint and
verizon in the US and that's going to be
the case for the samsung galaxy s3 but
we'll probably see a dual-core variant
in those models but this is the gsm
unlocked version the gs3 is a better
phone spec wise but they're both very
very good phones are very capable
they'll outperform a lot of users needs
and we're both just really nice they've
got pretty similar specs except for the
galaxy s3 has a better processor and the
galaxy s3 is newer but both of these
phones are hits they're great devices
their Android so I would check one of
them out pick one up you guys they both
work fine so stay tuned android
