official launch of the oneplus 2 and
though we're all excited to finally see
in action we thought it would be good to
revisit the oneplus one especially since
it was my daily driver for a time when
this one was first released it was
considered and called the flagship
killer but that was then and this is the
oneplus one now much of what made the
oneplus one so appealing when it first
came out was its price for high-end
specifications and 64 gigabytes of
storage
$350 was considered an absolute steal
when the one was first announced and for
the most part it continues to be the
many units we see out in the wild attest
to this as the oneplus one became the
phone for the savvy Internet user mind
you not always the phone geek but mainly
the people who at least knew how to seek
out the best bang for buck in the market
the invite system was of course a big
source of frustration for users as the
barrier of entry was pretty stacked
either you want an invite or we're lucky
enough to have a friend who was lucky
enough to have a few to spare this isn't
an issue anymore with the one now
available for a discounted price and for
immediate purchase sure it can be argued
that both of these otherwise positive
moves are too little too late in the eve
of the new oneplus device but at now 299
dollars we do think that the one remains
one of the most compelling inexpensive
offerings available now now my personal
device which was bought not long after
the full review was released has held up
pretty well there are some scuffs on the
sides because I dropped it a couple of
times but really nothing too drastic has
happened to it and while sandstone black
was a great material choice and really
differentiated the device I just
couldn't resist when the bamboo backing
was made available and the bamboo
backing was made available for a pretty
nominal price but it still required
invites in order to get one now it might
be a running joke with oneplus these
days to talk about invites and sort of
laugh about it but it really did become
kind of tiresome especially for us
normally users but that said the refresh
in look for my oneplus one was very
welcomed and the story has actually been
kind of similar for all the parts
underneath everything from the display
to the performance has been solid
providing exactly what a high-end
smartphone of 2014 was expected to I
still play some intensive games enjoy
plenty of media on the 5.5
1080p display and get some good shots
with the 13 megapixel camera though the
performance and viewing experience don't
fall behind by much it's in the camera
that I found myself wanting a bit more
and the current new flagships have
brought a sort of great revolution in
this regard so the one definitely feels
a little bit dated especially here but
one of the biggest gripes of today's
high-end market is pretty much blown
away by the oneplus that's 64 gigabytes
of storage that you get for such an easy
price makes up for most of the
shortcomings that this phone might
actually have and the software by
cyanogen has since been updated to 12s
based on lollipop and it's a worthwhile
upgrade that brings all that sandwich
and mod fans Pyne over some real
customization tools the same gestures as
before and every little feature
originally afforded the one with
material design making it all look
better oxygen OS though was born from
the ashes of oneplus his relationship
with cyanogen and it was an alternative
that turned into a necessity and it got
off to a pretty decent start but not
only is it based on an earlier version
of lollipop it is also about as stock
and Android build as it can get which is
both a good and bad thing because stock
is always great but oxygen still feels
like it has a way to go to really
differentiate itself from the pack which
kind of brings me into what I think
makes the oneplus one still relevant
even until today the Snapdragon 801
that's found in here is obviously not
going to be as fast as the 808 or the
a-10 that we're going to see in future
devices but I would argue that back when
this one first came out it provided a
benchmark to what an inexpensive device
should feel like and now today we have a
bunch of those whether or not they're
powered by the Snapdragon 615 or they
have a lot of software optimizations you
can get a pretty reliable device for
some $400 sometimes even sub $300 and I
would argue that to be oneplus one while
they did not start this trend definitely
shined a bright light upon it and now
because the oneplus one specifications
pale in comparison to this year's new
high-end flagships considering the one
as part of the inexpensive but reliable
smartphone tier feels best and there's
always a market for these kinds of
phones the oneplus one won't win any
contest against the Samsung Galaxy s6 or
the
LG g4 but that's the job of the 1+2
whose new oxygen OS and supposedly
different but still disheartening
somewhat invite system will undoubtedly
pose some challenges for it instead the
oneplus one can be best considered the
phone you get when you need to save some
money but you can be certain still that
the phone you get will perform to a
daily standard sure it has had its share
of controversy but when taken in a
vacuum the oneplus one mostly continues
to succeed at what it was meant to
providing a great smartphone experience
without breaking the bank so you might
be able to snag one right now and I
would almost recommend that you do so if
you've waited until now because we never
know what's going to happen to this
phone once the oneplus 2 comes into
existence for all we know the oneplus
one might fade into obscurity but we
certainly hope that it won't because
even if it's not the flagship killer
anymore at the very least it can stick
around and become the affordable phone
killer instead as always thank you guys
very much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this look at the oneplus one now
I still think it's a very compelling
device especially at its current price
point and the fact that you don't need
invites to get it anymore
if the oneplus 2 is going to dominate
the high-end market like it hopes to
then the oneplus one can probably
dominate everywhere else because it can
come out on top over the other
inexpensive phones that might still come
at a higher price point than the 299
that you need just to get the one and
even then the specifications on here are
even better than some of those somewhat
more expensive budget devices so it's
kind of a no-brainer when you think
about it the oneplus one is also a phone
that I bought for people in my life
because the entry point into a good
Android experience has been very low and
oneplus is the company that has
pioneered that but we are still excited
for the oneplus 2 and we're only days
away from its launch so make sure you
keep it to two Android authority for all
of the best coverage including the
coverage I will have of the oneplus 2
when it finally came up makes it into my
hands and then even more after that

things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
