part of every aspect of your life
they're not moving into the automotive
realm hey it's Josh freghar from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
behind me is a 2015 Hyundai Sonata
equipped with a navigation system that
now has Android auto installed now quick
disclaimer we do have two versions of
the Hyundai Sonata in this video the
silver version is the one with Android
auto but virtually the same car was also
sent to me in a white edition that
didn't have Android auto about a month
prior and I got to familiarize myself
with all the features already built in
before Android auto was installed so
let's go ahead and jump into the car and
get started now one of the other things
that we have here is that the phone has
to be connected via USB you won't be
using any Bluetooth here on on Android
auto or even with the navigation system
that ends up getting paired to it what's
going to happen is you're going to pair
your phone to this particular system and
here you'll see that it's going to
happen via the Android Auto app which
can get in the Play Store of course now
you are going to get some apps for
Android auto and like Android wear what
happens is when you have particular
applications installed on your phone it
will already have the code in place in
order for the integration to Android
auto to happen but here is the
beginnings of the Android auto
integration you have basically what our
let's say Google now cards here and it's
going to show you everything that is
available we've seen calls the weather
where I am right now and if you have
searched for any particular locations
using Google or Google now let's say it
will show up here automatically so you
can easily just press any of those
particular cards and you'll take you
straight to there for example I have a
flight tomorrow at 9:40 a.m. and already
knows that from my Google now now a lot
of the Google now functionality that
you're probably used to won't be showing
up here but all of the location-based
cards will probably do so here but let's
look at the media first we're going to
jump over to the media real quick and I
do have a number
of applications already installed for
media applications like google play
music I Heart Radio NPR 1 and pocket
casts now it's from here that you'll get
a number of different functions
underneath the surface so if we go to
google play music I already have some
music that's going to play and then what
else is going to happen here is when you
go to the top left you'll have a menu
area and you can always look at your
recent playlist turn on the radio or
even just go to the listen now option
and you'll get a number of different
places in order to start up some nice
music for your drive now let's go to the
left a little bit we can always go to
our calls and the calls are really easy
to get through any recent calls we'll
always be at the top and your starred
contacts are going to be below it so
you'll have a lot of easy access to
everybody here you can also go into the
menus here and you can dial a number you
can look at your call history and just
access your voicemail there as well
but of course you can always go to the
top here on the right and like in Google
now you can say that you want to call
somebody pretty easily call this person
call that person or even send text but
the texting capability I want to show
you is replying to texts because a
heads-up display will come up a little
bit later and you'll be able to respond
to it in a very specific way which is
pretty nice then finally let's go to our
directions here maps will open up and
you'll have because I'm in Park the
ability to type in any location that I
want to go to but from here we also be
able to go here and go to suggestions
and categories to be able to find all
the different places and of course have
traffic always at the ready so you can
see just how long it's going to take for
you to get somewhere so that right there
was a look at what Android auto looks
like in your navigation system
especially here on the Hyundai Sonata
now we're going to go ahead and put this
car into drive and get moving a little
bit and I'm going to use the Voice
Actions on here in order to get us to
one of my favorite places the sign I
need them all Santa Anita mall
here is Westfield Santa Anita and their
Santa Anita mall we'll go ahead and just
say it's about ten minutes away from
where I am right now I'm gonna go ahead
and get moving why don't we go ahead and
get some of the voice stuff out of the
way as well oh hey just testing the
phone call on the Android auto stuff
oh no no too bad
so that phone call went off without
really much of a hitch and as you heard
me say I'm having her send me a text
message you're going to see how we're
going to integrate a text message into
this the heads-up notification comes up
at the top and when you click on it
here's the message you have not a
charger so if I don't respond then my
phone is dead but you know where I am
silent face with smiling eyes but me
closes at 6:00
I can migrate rewards and cheese or
something I will be at Starbucks across
the street take your time
Android Auto you can press the voice
button and say look like so it says that
you can press the voice button on the
top right and then when you hit reply
the last thing that it talked about in
this case this message for my girlfriend
will be what it replies to reply this
internet connection isn't reliable right
now but you can try again later so you
can already see that there's a little
bit of frustration there Android auto
obviously relies on the connection of
your phone so if your phone is out of
commission or it doesn't have a good
connection to the internet it kind of
ties the hands of Android auto itself
reply what's the message okay sounds
good just driving around and I'll pick
you up later
got it
here's your message okay sounds good
just driving around and I'll pick you up
later do you want to send it yes
sending message and there you go you
send the actual message via the use of
your voice and it will guide you through
everything of course the whole point is
that your hands are going to be on the
steering wheel and everything is done
via your voice so you're not fiddling
with any keyboards or anything via your
phone or even on the actual Android app
screen here on the navigation system and
that all makes a lot of sense and it's
actually really really preferred to the
alternative of you know being unsafe
which kind of brings us to the final
point of this video really trying to see
if Android auto is actually that much
better than any systems that are already
in place and now I have been reiterating
that statement a lot it's because
honestly I don't really know what the
answer is to that yet if you go to the
media and I'll go ahead and just
disconnect my phone from the USB just so
we can illustrate this if you have your
phone connected via bluetooth to this
particular navigation system then if we
hit media right here we actually have
our access to this particular screen and
of course you have the integrations with
the steering wheel which is always nice
those are built into the navigation
system nr tapped into via Android auto
so you'll be able to use all those
controls in either situation now I will
admit that the nav the screen here for
Bluetooth audio it's a little bit better
on the Android auto side of things
because the integrations allow you to
change the application that you're using
so if I was listening to this music
right now but I wanted to switch over to
a podcast I can do that using the menu
buttons down at the bottom and then
selecting pocket cast for example for
NPR one really when it comes to calling
people that'll be pretty easy to do you
want to sort of be able to text anybody
using the built-in Hyundai
not a system but that should be okay you
will be able to still call people tell
them what you need to tell them texting
is definitely not something you should
be doing while you're driving anyway
whether or not it's via voice or even
using your phone which is the worst case
scenario and then that way Google now is
a little bit better using Android auto
in order to text people to respond to
them so that's kind of nice and as long
as you're pretty good with Google now
you'll be pretty good at texting via
Android auto and finally navigation as
we kind of move over I'll hit this navi
button right here I hate to say it but
there are more options in the Hyundai
Sonata side of things than in the
Android auto side of things Android auto
obviously taps into your Google centric
searcher searches and it really relies
on all of those search results in order
to give you the contextual sort of
suggestions in order to tell you where
you need to go or help you get to where
you need to go but in the case of the
Hyundai Sonata they have a system in
place that has maps and everything you
can always update the maps via SD cards
that are up here on the corner and you
can always update the information the
information is there
you know whenever you need it you don't
have to rely on a phone connection in
order to have everything available here
if I wanted to do a local search like
let's say let's go to Old Town Pasadena
it will be able to search for it via a
Google search because there's a 3G
connection here in this car it doesn't
necessarily need to rely on your phone
but if your phone was already connected
via bluetooth on here you could use that
connection as well but even then the
maps are built into the car and you'll
be able to go to Old Pasadena pretty
easily without the need of using your
actual phone or even your voice because
I was able to do that typing method
right there while I was at a stoplight
just now and then once you have a set as
a destination you could just it says
destination it will tell you where you
need to go
there is traffic on your route
so though you can already see that
despite the fact that I'm really doing a
bad job of following directions right
now it is able to recalculate it's a
pretty quick navigation system and there
really aren't that many problems using
what's built in here already when it is
already kind of this good so it begs the
question is Android auto really
something that you should be clamoring
over to get into your cars honestly as
I'm driving around right now I'm really
not all that sure because well there's
nothing really wrong with Android auto
it's just that for years now we've had
car manufacturers looking to catch up
with the life of the smartphone really
trying to create their cars as a place
for the smartphone to call home and for
all of your media and all of your
navigation and all of your infotainment
let's say to really help you on your
drive so all of these car manufacturers
have been putting a lot of thought into
the systems they put into here which i
think is a nice reason to see that
Android auto is just an add-on on top of
that if you really do want the Google
ESCA way of doing all of these things
then it's available for you you just
have to get that app installed on the
navigation system you already have but
if you're already having a great time
with your navigation system I kind of
don't think that Android auto is
something that should replace what is
already here it is really just an extra
it's something that is available if you
want to look at Google Maps rather than
what already as you can see here looks
quite nice and gives me the information
that I need in order to get there and if
media is a big thing for you then the
media that the integrations that are in
Android auto are pretty nice and you'll
be able to move among the different apps
that are available but until there's a
little bit more polish on there and if
maybe you can use bluetooth with this
rather than having to be connected via a
USB
perhaps I will give it a little bit more
of the edge but currently I really do
enjoy what the Hyundai Sonata already
has to offer and if you're going to add
Android auto on top of that and that's
your prerogative but for me if I didn't
have one
yet I had the other and still be okay in
either case as always thank you guys
very much for watching and I hope you
enjoyed this review of Android auto the
version you're seeing in this video is
pretty much going to be the same as it
would be found in all other car
manufacturers as well and that is a nice
feature of Android auto but the main
argument in this video is whether
Android auto as an overlay to existing
infotainment and navigation systems is a
true replacement for what's available I
don't think it's a true replacement but
it is a great skin on top of what might
already be available and it also adds
some key functionality like media app
integration and texting via voice which
for those of you or who are really into
Android will really enjoy having these
tools on the road but nonetheless keep
it tuned here for future coverage of
Android auto as it gets updated maybe
with a little bit more polish and even
more applications baked in but until
