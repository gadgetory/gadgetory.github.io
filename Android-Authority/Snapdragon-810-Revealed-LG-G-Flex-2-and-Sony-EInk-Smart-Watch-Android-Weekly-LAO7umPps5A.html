about next-gen technology in the years
to come like digitize clothing and
mysterious virtual reality but what
about the next gen just right around the
corner like the next gens snapdragon so
Qualcomm is issued developers a
reference smartphone and tablet that
demonstrates the capability of their new
Snapdragon 810 the Snapdragon 810
developer smartphone is a 6.2 inch of
behemoth packing a 2560 x 1600 display
it also comes with 4 gigabytes of RAM
3020 milliamp hour battery a 13
megapixel dual flash rear camera and a 4
megapixel front-facing camera capable of
1080p 120 frames per second recording it
also has a fingerprint scanner on the
back the handset also features a huge
array of sensors 8 megaphones a micro
HDMI slot that supports 4k displays and
ultra sound emitter it has plenty of
toys for developers to play around with
now Qualcomm's reference tablet is also
nothing to sneeze at it features a 10.1
inch UHD 4k display that has a whopping
3840 x 2160 16 9 aspect display it has 4
gigabytes of RAM the same camera set up
as a smartphone and a decent-sized 7560
milliamp hour battery the tablet also
features a similar range of sensors but
also comes with dual 3d ir gesture
cameras and front-facing stereo speakers
now before you get a hot and bothered we
need to remind you that those are
referenced devices for developers
they're not for users just yet they
allow developers to create applications
to see with that great snapdragon 810 is
capable of now for those of you who are
big fans of the LG G flex its successor
is expected to launch this January 2015
at CES
details about the new device are scarce
for the moment but according to persons
close to the matter the G flex 2 will be
a major upgrade over its predecessor the
device is said to feature a
high-resolution plastic-based oled
screen full HD most likely in a smaller
form factor the self-healing coating
will make a return on the LG G flex 2 in
an improved form so do you guys think
this is actually a gimmick or a somewhat
flexible display is actually a useful
feature I know for people like me who
prefer one-handed devices some people
have said that because the device curves
a little bit it's easier to do
one-handed device on a larger screen
what do you think now sony has always
been known for its well-designed
sleek-looking devices but apparently now
they're coming out with a SmartWatch
that uses a Inc a spokesperson from Sony
confirmed that the company is working on
a project named fashion entertainment
which is researching potential
electronic paper or ink application for
fashion products the FES watches the
group's major prototype at the moment
which uses electronic paper to change
the entire watch design based on input
gestures currently the watch comes with
24 different user selectable patterns
but the project was kept under wraps and
pushed through crowdfunding to gauge
initial interest without attaching the
sony brand name the FES watch passed its
fundraising goal of 2 million yen or
seventeen thousand dollars u.s. in just
three weeks and has already secured 3.5
million yen now sony claims they see
applications for en could not just on
watches but on all of our clothing
further deepening and making far more
interesting the wearable race now
Samsung knows one thing if you really
want to commit to something you want to
make a connection work what do you got
to do you got to put a ring on it Oh a
new patent application has appeared this
week potentially giving us a glimpse of
what might end up being one of samsung's
new upcoming smartwatches what makes
this particular pattern so interesting
is that it shows a round watch operated
by a ring around
face now to be clear the innovation in
the patent is displaying a daily agenda
on a circular interface divided into
slices rotating the ring is just one of
the proposed ways to edit entries from
that agenda alright guys my name is Jace
thank you for watching and you know what
you can check right there are thank you
to you for reaching 1 million subs it
just happened earlier this morning when
I was shooting this thank you so much
Josh did a great job at editing this
thing it's really really tough but up
here you can watch other android
authority shows I shall see you next
week on Android weekly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
