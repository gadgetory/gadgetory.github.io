away from android authority here now
we're looking at one of lenovo's latest
smartphones and what makes this device
unique is that it's actually powered by
the Intel medfield processor now this is
a 1.6 gigahertz processor created by
Intel it's got a 4.5 inch 720p display
it's running currently android 2.3 with
the highly customized overlay provided
by Lenovo and actually I've been using
the device for about 20 minutes and it's
really responsive so maybe we can expect
some good things from Lenovo and Intel
together it's on par with any of the
latest Android devices obviously it's
got high-end specs the thing
unfortunately that seems to be its
Achilles heel so far is that it is
really really thick if we compared to my
galaxy s2 while we're here then we're
looking at a big difference in thickness
as you can see I mean it's nothing too
substantial it's still is packing a 720p
display a megapixel camera 1 gig of ram
other than that it's got HSPA
connectivity it has a bit of a grooved
sort of industrial feel to it it feels
really good in the Hat actually it's
just a lot thicker than I'm used to the
device I think it has potential to be a
quite a success permitting they can slim
it down but it is still a reference
design that I know they're going to be
making some changes before goes on the
market but it is an Android device and
it is one of the first power by Intel's
new processor medfield so we're gonna
have to see how it does anyway this is a
android authority my name is Darcy lack
of a we're reporting from CES 2012</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
