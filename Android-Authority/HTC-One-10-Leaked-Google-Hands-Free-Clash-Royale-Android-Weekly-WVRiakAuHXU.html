brought to you by atlassian build what's
next so we've now found these supposed
images of the HTC 10 so what's the
verdict for a phone that was once
considered the best designed Android
smartphone regardless of what its final
name is the one thing we know for sure
is that HTC is gearing up for a somewhat
radical departure and design moving away
from the looks of the HTC One m9 we've
already seen a number of fuzzy images
showing off the device but today we get
our hands on a few more images from on
lakes which was immediately followed by
a detailed press render as expected the
new HTC 10 removes the boom sound
front-facing speakers in favor of a
design that's more akin to the HTC One a
9 especially on the front side taking
the place of front-facing speakers as a
front-facing fingerprint scanner built
into the phone's HOME button which is
flanked by two capacitive keys on the
back is a fairly minimalist design
though the chamfered edges help give it
an extra bit of flair from the front to
the back and even it's somewhat curved
looking design we can't help but feel
this phone seems a bit like an odd mix
of Samsung and HTC's design language
with perhaps a tiny bit of moto ask
shape thrown in for good measure in
addition to the new images on leaks also
unofficially confirmed a few things
about the specs namely that will see a
five point 15 inch quad HD display a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor with
an Adreno 530 GPU 4 gigabytes of ram a
12 megapixel main camera and a USB
type-c for charging that said these are
prototypes specs so the final model may
differ slightly well I'm underwhelmed
let me know what you think in the
comments below now let's talk Google's
hands-free and it's not android pay it's
a little bit different when Google was
teasing its hands-free payment method
last year we didn't really know what to
make of it the service allows users to
pay at retailers and restaurants simply
by mentioning that they'd like to quote
pay with Google hands-free is an app
that runs on Android 4.2 and up when you
set up the app you'll create an account
and link a credit card or debit card to
it upload a photo of yourself and now
you're good to go when you walk into a
hands-free supported store restaurant
the app interfaces with the cash
register via bluetooth and Wi-Fi so when
you say that you'd like to pay with
Google all the cashier has to do is
verify that you are who you say you are
via the photo you've uploaded no cards
no cash and you don't even have to pull
your phone out of your pocket you just
take the items and go transaction
processed pretty cool all grand chief
but we have to be cautious when it comes
to security in these types of situations
especially because Google's not giving
us any details about how they're going
to secure the transaction but it's a
very limited test roll out just in San
Francisco and it is completely separate
at this point from Android pay so we'll
keep you up to date now this is normally
Hindi speed but I got to talk about my
new addiction clash Royale and I be
ponen peeps following the huge success
of clash of clans the game developer
supercell has released a new strategy
game to the google play store and it's
called clash Royale and it's a real-time
multiplayer game that stars the Royales
the aim of the game is to knock the
enemy king or queen from their towers on
the other side of the field in doing so
you win trophies and crowns which room
turn will earn you rewards new cards and
upgrades of your existing cards the game
takes place in real time so you will
need a steady internet connection to
play this keeps getting interesting
though as you'll be able to battle
against players who all around the world
with different strategies and different
cards you'll also challenge your
clanmates and friends to private duels
if you're not keen on battling in random
battles now I really like this game
because it's a great balance of being
both a casual game and a good strategy
game not a lot of games strike that
balance just right but you have to be
very careful and thoughtful about what
cards you play at what time and manager
elixir intelligently and if you care to
you can find a clan on clash Royale
called Fallen Empire if you find a
player named palette and pop yours truly
challenge me i'll be your huckleberry
