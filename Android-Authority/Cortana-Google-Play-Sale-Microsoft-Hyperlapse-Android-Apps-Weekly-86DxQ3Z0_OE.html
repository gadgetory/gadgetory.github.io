quickly show is brought to you by turtle
tumble Logan ladies and gentlemen I'm
Joe Hindy the android authority app guy
and welcome back to Android apps weekly
let's jump right into those headlines
hulu is a great service that has always
been given lackluster reviews because it
makes you pay for things and then makes
you watch advertising in a recent report
it appears as though hulu is
entertaining the idea of adding a new
pricing tier that we remove all
advertising we hope this is something
that actually happens a panty released
their stats for how well the google play
store and the apple app store did during
the second quarter of 2015 most of the
stats are pretty much the same as
they've always been but a few surprises
remained including video streaming
making a larger impact on revenue thanks
to cord cutting a new humble bundle is
out now with eight awesome games
including a few Metal Slug titles you
can donate the minimum and get five
games or beat the average which is just
under five dollars and get all eight
games plus whatever gets added later
it's a great way to get some games and
give to charity Google Play is tossing a
huge sale that involve some really big
time games at a really cheap price they
include the room to photonica Republic
hit man go monument valley and xcom
enemy within for far more than fifty
percent of these are some amazing games
and you should definitely check them out
late last week the long awaited Cortana
for Android was leaked and we managed to
get our hands on it it is a very early
beta so it doesn't perform all that well
yet but we imagine it'll get better by
the time it's released we got our hands
on it and you can see that video linked
in the video description below for even
more Android apps and games information
don't forget to check out this week's
newsletter which is linked in the video
description below then we'll have all
the headlines updates and new releases
that we didn't have time for in the
video if you want you can enter your

Friday also don't forget that we now
have a twitch channel we are going to be

Dead by Telltale Games and Sunday and
Monday will be playing something totally
new don't forget to check that out that
link is in the video description below
ok folks to take a look at the apps and
games that made a big splash this week
as usual if you want to check any of
these applications out you can find
those links in the video description
below forsaken world is a new MMORPG
with some really decent graphics and
some fun mechanics at its core there
isn't much that others don't offer but
it does have some
my unique things like mounts the
graphics are quite good in the result is
a game that is quite large other than
that it works pretty well aside from
some released a bug so do keep those in
mind if you decide to try it out Cody
formerly known as XBMC has finally hit
the google play store for the masses
after years and years of waiting this is
version 15 which brings 4k support along
with all those other features that we
already loved about Cody for those who
don't know this is a very powerful media
player application that manages
practically any media file in your
library and also comes with a ton of
third-party plugins for additional
content it's worth a shot especially for
those of you who use your devices to
hook up to your TV slugterra dark waters
is an action-adventure shooter where you
must avoid obstacles kill bad guys and
solve puzzles to make it through the
various levels the game comes with 13
levels currently and there are even dual
arenas to play in it's a tap to play
game which isn't preferable for an
adventure game but you do have to move
around quite a bit it's a fun little
time waster that is free to download
right now with dragon ball z dokkan
battle is a new title out of Bandai
Namco and as the title suggests there
are a ton of Dragon Ball Z things there
it's a hybrid game that's part board
game in part fighting game with a little
bit of puzzle game thrown in for good
measure it is heavily based around the
story not unlike the TV show so there
will be a lot of dialogue it's free to
play and it's pretty decent especially
for Dragon Ball Z fans Microsoft
hyperlapse is a camera application that
got a lot of press not long ago when it
was released in beta essentially this
application takes a ton of pictures and
puts them together in a time-lapse video
this is one of the more unique ways to
create memories on Android and it's just
a lot of fun to use it exited beta this
last week and it's now available for
everyone and you can find that link
below it's definitely worth a shot
turtle tumble is a fun little puzzle
game that is a variant of mini golf you
must complete levels and help Ollie find
his family it's a simple game with
Google Play game services easy mechanics
and tons of content that is totally free
to unlock if you have the patience it's
playable by all ages but it's especially
great for kids thanks to its colorful
graphics and adorable animal characters

the Android apps weekly show once again
