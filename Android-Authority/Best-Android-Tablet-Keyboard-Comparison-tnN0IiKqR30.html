is clayton youngberg representin in
direct authority calm today we've got a
comparison between a few of the best
tablet keyboards on the Play Store so
today we're going to be checking out the
adapt X tablet beta keyboard the float
with split tablet keyboard swiftkey
three tablet and then the thumb keyboard
for and all of these have awesome
features specifically native to each
that the others don't have and the check
out what makes them better than the
other and maybe decide which one comes
out on top so let's check out the adapt
text tablet beta as you can see here we
have an awesome split layout where we
can use our thumbs for each side we've
got our text prediction up here on the
top and also place that under the
keyboard if we want to view the quick
settings here's our automatic text
replacement features we've got our
experimental handwriting module right
there on the bottom left corner we can
choose a sort through our numbers we
have one through six on the left and
then five through nine and 20 on the
right and hit two pages of different
punctuation go back there anyways we'll
go to our quick settings before we type
anything here we can choose our
languages layouts and suggestion control
the languages is where we choose through
our default download and languages
layouts we can either choose the full
keyboard of the split keyboard we can go
through a suggestion control which I
moves a suggestion bar above or below
the keyboard like I said then we'll go
into our settings where we can
personalize our suggestions we can learn
from different social accounts like
Facebook or Twitter my dictionary the
addon manager layouts once again we have
our handwriting module enabled auto
correction is enabled the automatic text
replacements are really also the feature
where we can type in an acronym a
three-letter acronym and it will come up
with a sentence more or less we can type
in a AR it comes up with android
authority rules then we have our basic
app stuff like check for latest version
help and support and then share so let's
get back into the typing aspect of the
keyboard and check this out anyways we
can type in android and once we type in
a nd are we actually can choose android
now the more you type these certain
words the more it learns and then since
i've already typed Authority in the past
we can simply click authority that was
pretty quick we can also try our
experimental handwriting module now I've
found sometimes that you can use regular
shorthand writing and then some
cursive works best so I'll type in an
eye which actually came up as a d once
again and as you see if you type in the
just put in the line it does not really
get the eye that's once again a D and as
far as an experimental feature but we
will just type it in for the heck of it
the oops it's the best boom so it
obviously it obviously knew that I was
going to type in best after thee because
it's learned a little bit anyways I just
check out some of our other quick
settings will move our suggestion
control below the keyboard that's really
cool if you want this in the ease of use
down here but basically guys that's the
adaptec tablet beta we've got a bunch of
different themes we can put on here
we've got downloadable languages we got
all night text replacement handwriting
our navigation instead of the
handwriting where we can use our arrows
and that's basically it guys into our
next one now which is these floating
split tablet keyboard what's cool about
the floating splints got its got a bunch
of different layouts so as you can see
here it's just a regular layout we could
use our fingers to type not quite ideal
for a tablet in my mind but we can still
kind of move this around which is
awesome we can resize it and another
awesome thing we can do is press this
little button we have our split
interface with our numbers here in the
middle our settings are located here
with our multicolored directional pad
and then we have our punctuation this is
a universal punctuation button
throughout all of their themes or voice
controls are smilies anyways if we press
once again we can actually have these
movable if we press this this actually
just moves them up and then we can bring
them back and then we can actually
individually move them if we tap this
little cursor and bring them around
which is really awesome because then you
can actually set them exactly where you
want wherever you're comfortable holding
the tablet these have text prediction as
well so we'll just type in something try
and type in the same sentence android
we've got that one Authority is
of course the best and we click so
awesome that did a great job we did our
typing test there will actually go into
our settings now check out a few other
things you've got our prediction
settings our appearance setting where we
have multiple themes we can choose from
now whenever we click our appearance
settings we can click our keyboard theme
and what this is actually going to do is
put us any other orientation but bear
with me because we can just check some
of these out we've got all sorts of
different themes here we even ever aqua
blue and go back now I enjoy this one so
I'll just go ahead and keep it on there
press ok back to a bunch of other
settings we have we have a show number
keys row hints on shortcut keys portrait
mode split key width the height and the
width we can change the differences in
height and width we have our different
vibration modes are long press options
are key volumes under the Fun Factory we
have our keyboard theme once again we
have our font selection our
capitalization mode we can choose our
character size or font size choose our
font color our background color our key
color the action key color this is a lot
of customization involved in the
floating split tablet keyboard is we'll
go to our prediction and completion we
have all of our different autocorrect
autocomplete auto capitalization
double-spaced and certain period just
like a lot of different keyboards once
again our languages this also has just
as many as the adapt X but it fails to
have the industry specific but there are
plenty of plenty of languages so anyways
that's a really awesome keyboard if
you're looking for the most
customization you can get move on to our
next one now so our next one will be the
swiftkey 3 tablet now along with the
adapt FX tablet beta swiftkey has done a
major improvement with the swiftkey
three including user interface as well
as some more functional features as you
can see here we are having to split
interface with our numbers here in the
middle and we have our text prediction
bar up here on the top we'll get into
our settings before we do a typing test
we long press the swiftkey of key there
we were settings we can share the
keyboard we were supporting their voice
input so wonder our settings here we
have our languages and layouts the bunch
of different languages
is none of them being industry-specific
unfortunately there are personalizations
we can learn from Facebook much like the
adapt X can choose the theme of our care
excuse me keyboard cobalt holo dark
light neon pumpkin we have our advanced
typing styles and settings we can choose
what we do with the space bar such as
the insert period just like all the
others we have our staffs would show us
how much more accurate we are by using
the swiftkey tablet keyboard how to
videos support and about the keyboard
and as we'll go back try our usual
sentence android now the cool thing is
the reason these are all predicting like
this is because best because they're
important and stored in the native
dictionary the actual dictionary for the
samsung galaxy tab and each of these
keyboards is accessing the dictionary in
order to get the best experience
available anyways the themes are really
cool and our numbers when you have a
full thing of numbers as well as some
punctuation there more punctuation there
and then back to our ABC and we can
choose our different layouts just by
selecting that the smaller one and what
not so that's awesome that is the
swiftkey three tablet now we're going to
go to an old classic the thumb keyboard
for by being soft now the thumb keyboard
for was actually one of the very first
keyboards that utilize this split
function for the tablets so I've always
remained a little bit true to it even
though it's just as good as the rest of
these all these stand up to each other
anyways we'll try our sentence on the
thumb keyboard and then we'll go into
some of the settings well don't start
off with thee will go to Android and
this actually is not important from the
dictionary we're going to have to choose
Android nope and if you look over here
there is no authority
authority is the best so one of the
downfalls of the thumb keyboard is that
it exit actually did not access the user
dictionary pre-installed on the galaxy
tab on all the others actually had the
android authority is the best all come
up in their suggestions in the
prediction bar but not the bean soft
thumb keyboard for anyways we'll just go
into our settings here we can choose our
different layouts just like that get our
full layout there and then our split
once again we'll go into our settings
actually this is not our settings as our
numbers we've got our punctuation as
well we've got our numbers here or
navigation with our arrows just like
that go back there and then in order to
go to our settings we have to click the
thumb keyboard and then the little
settings slider now this doesn't have
too many settings it doesn't have as
much as the others and they're not a
categorized in little menus like that
but would you ever sound setting this
haptic feedback we have our themes that
we can choose a honeycomb our ice cream
sandwich the iPad wood glass gingerbread
nuance balloon to once read honeycomb
city a bunch of different themes if we
go all the way through here we can just
keep going very cool ways we'll go back
we have our background we can choose a
custom background custom colors font
size keyboard dimensions colored key
blocks we have our different layouts or
secondary symbol options or voice input
options or long press options we can use
our contacts and we can buy Graham
suggestions where we use previous word
to improve suggestions which we have
clicked so that's usually a given when
you're talking about text prediction but
that's not one of the features you can
choose with the thumb keyboard anyways
you guys I want your opinion on which
one you think is the best now we all had
our pros and cons the adapt X with a
bunch of our languages we had our
floating split with our customizable
layout if our swiftkey with the awesome
themes and then the user prediction help
and the accuracy settings and then we
have our thumb keyboard which is it
which was the original split keyboard
layout but fails to have his good as
prediction as the others anyways guys
check them out for yourself if you got
tablets and stay tuned with Android
