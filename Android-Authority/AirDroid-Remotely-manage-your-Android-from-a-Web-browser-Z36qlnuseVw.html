Authority Android devices make lives
easier especially because of their
portability even while on the move you
can communicate with contacts organize
your contact lists manage apps
manipulate files and more yet managing
your Android devices can also easily get
in your way if for example you're
working at your desktop computer and you
need to frequently pick up your phone or
tablet to reply to text messages in this
video I'll talk to you about an app that
can help you carry out your device
management duties more easily the app is
called AirDroid in the next few minutes
I'm going to show you around the apps
features and show you how it works
AirDroid is a remote device manager in a
nutshell it lets you manage your Android
over-the-air all you need are your
android device with AirDroid installed
at least a wireless local area network
connection but preferably with
connection to the Internet and a web
browser on your desktop computer
what no wires needed yes no wires needed
no need for extra software either
everything is done through your web
browser once you have everything ready
it's time to connect to your phone from
your web browser you can use AirDroid
with or without an AirDroid account but
I strongly recommend signing up for free
so you can enjoy more app features
including the find phone feature which
can be very useful if you ever lose your
phone after signing up or logging in you
will see the apps main page and its
three main tabs named connection tools
and recommends the tools tab provides
several handy functions and shortcuts
for viewing storage and memory
consumption managing apps handling local
files managing running tasks setting
Network and tethering preferences and
more the recommends tab offers a list of
useful apps recommended by the AirDroid
team at this point our main interest is
in the connection tab which is where you
manage your AirDroid connection but
before proceeding you might want to
visit the settings page first to turn
off power saving mode and to enable keep
screen awake
these can improve air droids
connectivity but can also drain power
you may want to keep your device plugged
in or docked while using AirDroid back
at the connection tab you will see the
grey URL box and the scan QR code button
down here open any of these web
addresses on your web browser to connect
to AirDroid on your device if your
Android and your Web browser are
connected to the same local network
you'll see two addresses in the gray box
like this the first one shows the URL to
err droids web interface and the second
one is your phone's IP address on your
local network the feature is available
to you will depend on the type of
AirDroid connection that you use there
are three types of connection modes
light LAN and remote first let's look at
light connection mode you can use this
mode even without an Android account to
connect and light connection mode just
open in your web browser the local
network IP address provided by ear droid
when you see the confirmation dialog
appear on your device tap the accept
button to create the connection once the
connection is established you will now
be able to see the AirDroid web desktop
interface in Lite connection mode you'll
only be able to do basic tasks such as
contacts and SMS management advanced
features such as defined phone feature
are not available in Lite connection
mode if your device and computer are on
the same local network and you want to
use more than just the basic AirDroid
features try land connection mode first
log into your AirDroid account through
the app on your device then connect in
LAN connection mode by opening web
AirDroid comm on your desktop browser
then on your Android device tap the scan
QR code button and point your device's
camera at the QR code displayed on the
AirDroid web page the connection will be
created once the QR code is canned and
verified or instead of scanning the QR
code you can manually login with your
username and password using the web form
when you connect in LAN connection mode
with your account you'll be able to
enjoy additional AirDroid features such
as fine phone and multiple desktop
switching what if your device and
computer aren't on the same local
network can you still manage your device
with AirDroid you certainly can just
connect in remote connection mode the
procedure is the same as that for
land connection mode except that your
device and computer are on different
networks open web dot AirDroid comm and
your desktop browser then scan the
displayed QR code using your device's
camera or sign in using the login form
in remote connection mode some features
such as a camera and call features are
available to premium subscribers only
although the same features are available
for free in land connection mode also if
you have a free account you can get a
monthly data transfer limit of 100
megabytes but if you go premium you'll
get one gigabyte of data transfer limit
monthly now that your air grid
connection is ready you can now start
managing your Android device on your
computers web browser to manage the SMS
messages on your device click this icon
to open the messages window here you can
read compose send forward or delete SMS
messages right on your PCs web browser

multiple contacts and perform group
actions on them such as sending a group
message saving the selected contacts
into a group or deleting the selected
contacts if you want to quickly compose
a message or call a contact just click
these buttons beside the contacts number
as far as calls are concerned you can
use AirDroid to remotely dial a number
on your Android device this is the
button for that just type the number on
the dialpad and click the call button or
click the message button if you want to
send a message instead when your Android
device gets an incoming call a call
information window appears on the
AirDroid desktop interface showing you
the caller's name or number

message to the caller you can also view
and manage your call logs through the
AirDroid web desktop interface just

limitation of the remote camera is that
it won't like you zoom in or out of your
photo subject it also won't let you

are more AirDroid has other useful tools

device settings this last shortcut is
for signing out of AirDroid another
useful feature in the AirDroid web
Desktop is the find phone feature it
works like an anti-theft app that can
help you remotely locate your lost

properly you need to set AirDroid s
device administrator with fine phone you
can lock your device remotely or even
