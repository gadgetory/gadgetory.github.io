products on an Android lovers channel
while traditionally when Apple makes a
move like this it has a significant
impact on the rest of the market
including you and me so when Apple was
asked why did you remove the 35
millimeter headphone jack
they said this it was holding us back
from a number of things we wanted to put
in the iPhone it was fighting for space
with camera technology and processors
and battery life and frankly when
there's a better more modern solution
available it's crazy to keep it around
said Dan Richie Oh Apple's senior vice
president of hardware engineering now of
course the counter-argument is that
demand for a 35 millimeter headphone
jack is far higher than any new
technology you're going to put in that
tiny extra space no what do you think
what I think is that most people are not
clamoring for more wireless headphones
at least not for the most part but Apple
is trying to create a new product
category you see we won't just see more
wireless headphones we'll see wireless
speakers other wireless accessories that
take advantage of this technology now
UTech history buffs should know that
Apple has a long history of abandoning
what they consider old technology and
for the most part the rest of the market
has followed suit that's the power of
being the dominant leader in a market
now it hasn't always gone smoothly an
apple tends to really push the envelope
and they sometimes do it in ways that
limit the options of their most loyal
consumers so when we talk about other
Apple products like the MacBook Pro for
example I love my MacBook Pro because I
use Final Cut Pro and going back to
Windows is just is just painful I hate
it so I'm really bought in but if I
today want to buy a new MacBook Pro I
have to pay another almost $3,000 and
the MacBook Pro is only marginally only
incrementally better than the current
Mac Pro I have from 2013 that's kind of
crazy that makes it really hard to be
loyal to Apple so Apple has a fine line
to walk and really maximizing their
profit and still keeping Fanning the
flames of their most loyal consumers
I'll write its prediction time I'm going
to make a prediction again
I've been pretty good with my
predictions in the past I'm going to
predict based on what we know that yes
most of the smartphone industry will
follow suit but usually with options I
don't think the Sony's and HTC's and
Samsung's of the world are going to piss
off their loyal geek audience by
completely removing the headphone option
but we're going to see some changes in
this area for sure I think it's safe to
say that pretty much everyone hates day
to day admin work that's why our beloved
