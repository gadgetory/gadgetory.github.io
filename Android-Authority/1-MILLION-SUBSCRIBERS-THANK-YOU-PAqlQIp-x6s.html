subscribers and now less than a year
later we're back again ever tell you

that's just a testament to how awesome
you guys are as a fan and we're going to
keep doing our best to make great videos
listen to your suggestions and trying to
be the best YouTube channel we can you
guys are driving the ship so I want to
say thank you for that now my most fond
memory of being with android authority
is they've actually going to the droid
turbo event that was my first event for
android authority and you know i was
able to just look up and and take a step
back and say you know what all this is
happening because of people's interest
in phones and that goes back to you guys
you guys are excited about phones and
you guys enable us to make this content
and have fun and actually living out a
dream that a lot of people wish they can
do and this is what we do guys and
hopefully we're doing the best job we
can if not let us know we'll try our
best to be even better next year so we
finally hit a million subscribers and
and milla subscribers that's a lot of
people so I just want to quickly take
some time out to say thank you to you

thank you for watching thank you for
subscribing thank you for all the
feedback to you guys leave us on our
channel whether it's a thumbs up or a
comment and regardless of whether it's a
good or bad comment we appreciate the
feedback nonetheless and obviously this
would not be possible without you guys
watching us so thank you again and for
you guys that don't know I am one of the
newer YouTube Android 30 members not the
newest but I still am definitely still
one of the newer guys here I started
back in march or april of this year so i
haven't been here for too long but i
have been here for quite a while now and
I really enjoyed my time here making
videos for you guys and hopefully you
guys have enjoyed it as well and as far
as my favorite moment here so far
android authority i would have to say
it's my G watch our video simply because
I spent a lot of time on that video
really trying to make it look the way I
wanted it to look and hopefully you guys
saw that and appreciated that and it
seems like you guys did because as far
as I know it's been my most viewed video
and also my most thumbed up video so far
here at Android Authority so thank you
guys for that and hopefully we will see
you guys around for the next million
hello again everybody Joe Hindy here and
um thank you thank you very very very
much I did some stats searching before
doing this video and I found that there
are still at the time of the making of
this video anyway still less than a
thousand YouTube channels that can say
that they have a million subscribers and
we're one of them and you know when you
look at the idea that you most YouTube
channels only have you know a couple of
people that run them that makes you know
us you know this group of people right
here you know we're in the top probably
5,000 people to work for a YouTube
channel that has a million subscribers
and you know when you think about that's
that's not a lot of people and that they
get to wake up in the morning and say I
work for a YouTube channel that has a
million subscribers and it's just a
tumbling it really is so thank you
everybody for subscribing you know we're
all trying to do better we're all trying
to get better and you know we're all
trying to do these things that you know
bring you news and the reviews and all
that stuff and it's really humbling that
so many people want to be a part of that
my turn do you guys know what it's like
to pour hours of energy and effort into
a youtube video that ends up getting
only seven views five of which are from
your mom yeah I've been there been there
more times than I care to admit but if
you keep going you keep struggling and
continue to pour in that type of focus
and effort you get to become part of a
great team a team that has created the
best source for all things and right on
the planet and arguably one of the best
tech channels anywhere and I am deeply
grateful for it because these guys they
mean business they don't goof around
two years ago when I started here at
Android authority I was this former tech
support analyst jumping into the world
of blogging for the first time thinking
that I was going to write about
something that I really enjoyed and back
then I didn't even do this whole thing
that you guys were so used to me doing
now and we had seventy five thousand
subscribers a few months later I ended
up going to mobile world congress with
darcy and bogdan our lead editor and
that was the first time Darcy told me to
get in front of the camera and present
at a trade show at that point we maybe
had double that and then later that year
we got 300,000 subscribers and Darcy and
argh they were able to join me in my
family and celebrating that milestone
and you can actually see that video here
at the channel you can see how even my
parents are in the background and we're
all just celebrating that milestone fast
forward to another year later and here
we are at 1 million subscribers two
years ago I would not have even imagined
it just didn't come to mind that
something like this was going to happen
maybe it was inevitable maybe some of
you would say so but it didn't really
matter to me I just woke up every single
day grateful and happy to be able to do
what it is that I do and that all of you
enjoy it and now there are 1 million of
you who do and really from the bottom of
my heart on behalf of everybody you've
already heard everybody say thank you so
much for being a part of Android
authorities journey thank you for
sticking around and thank you for
subscribing and for watching all of our
videos it's been a wild ride and I've
had honestly the best last two years of
my life because of what I do and because
of this family this this this group of
people I can call my family called
android authority so just a quick toast
from everybody thank you again and
here's to the next milestone for us and
for you
1 million subscribers 1 million
subscribers thank you so much from the
bottom of my heart I can't begin to
thank you enough I remember back in the
day when we start and Roy thority
working on a 10 inch netbook running on
the money didn't have a job maybe
reaching 50 people 100 people a day it
was very humble time you know and we
worked hard every day to deliver you the
best we possibly could now where we
stand today we have incredibly talented
team brilliant videographers like Joshua
like land like Joe with his apps Kevin
and many others we travel the world
scouring for the latest mobile
technology we have great relationships
in industry but honestly we would be
absolutely nothing if it weren't for
your support every time you visit a
video every like every new subscription
everything we do it's so appreciated by
you guys and I can't begin to thank you
enough I wake up excited every day I
don't really sleep a lot there's a lot
of Android devices i think this around
4,800 them right now a lot of people
visit us and we're very humbled we're

clock doing whatever is necessary to
deliver you the best videos the best
content and all things android so from
the bottom of my heart and from everyone
