authority and Sony's latest flagship
goes head-to-head with LG's latest
flagship this is the z5 premium versus
the LG g4 these two devices the first
thing that you're gonna notice right off
the bat is how different they are in
terms of their design but the z5 premium
are looking at a metal and glass design
and it's the same iconic design that
we've seen in previous Sony devices so I
say clean rectangular slab with metal
around the sides and glass on the front
and back which does kind of make it a
little bit of a fingerprint magnet
but the biggest change with the design
is in the power button it's no longer a
circle anymore and it's actually a wider
button and this reason is to accommodate
for a built-in fingerprint scanner and
the fingerprint scanner in my short time
with it actually works extremely well
it's very fast and it's also very
convenient because it's built right into
the power button where your thumb
normally sits so it's actually a very
smart move by Sony the g4 on the other
hand is entirely made of plastic or a
combination of plastic and leather
depending on which backing you decide to
go with but it still feels great in the
hand it's also very comfortable to use
due to that slightly curved body both
devices feature 5.5 inch displays but as
impressive as the quad HD resolution is
on the g4 the big story here is the 4k
display on the z5 premium which makes it
the first phone in the world with a 4k
display and this results in a whopping
PPI of 806 which is totally insane
there's no denying that the z5 premium
has a very impressive looking display
but there's definitely going to be a lot
of debate as to whether 4k on a
smartphone is necessary and what the
impact is going to be like on battery
life both of these devices are being
powered by Qualcomm chipsets so the
Xperia z5 premium comes with a
Snapdragon 810 with the Adreno 430 while
the LG g4 comes with the Snapdragon 808
with the audrina 418 but both come with
three gigabytes of RAM and performance
is really good on both the g4 is very
smooth and fluid and the same thing can
be said about the z5 premium
so you're not gonna have any sort of
performance issues on either one of
these devices no matter what it is that
you're trying to do for storage you're
looking at 32 gigabytes of on-board
storage on both along with expandable
storage up to 128 gigabytes for the g4
and 200 gigabytes for the z5 premium as
far as any extra goodies are concerned
the z5 premium now comes with a
fingerprint scanner integrated into the
redesigned power button on the side the
button and scanner are ideally placed to
make it easy to unlock the device using
your thumb and is a pretty nice
implementation compared to the more
traditional placements up front and on
the back also available on the z5
premium is dust and waterproof
capabilities which you don't get on the
g4 so if you care about that sort of
protection the z5 premium is going to be
the one you want to go for now as far as
battery life goes the g4 is packin a
3000 milliamp hour battery which is user
replaceable and also comes with quick
charge the Xperia z5 premium comes with
a 30 for 30 milliamp hour battery which
is a pretty large battery but it's also
non removable and we also have no idea
what sort of battery drain we're gonna
see due to that 4k display with the
camera you're looking at a 16 megapixel
F 1.8 aperture lens on the g4 and a 23
megapixel sensor on the z5 premium the
g4 has already proven to have a really
great camera especially with DSLR like
manual controls and the ability to shoot
in raw and JPEG simultaneously the
camera on the z5 premium looks promising
especially when you consider Sony's
track record with camera sensors so on
paper it sounds like it's going to be a
pretty exciting camera the Xperia z5
premium is running on android 5.1.1
lollipop with Sony's Xperia Y which
keeps a mostly stock Android experience
but there are some slight customizations
like these small apps for easier
multitasking and the PlayStation
integration which is really great if you
are a gamer the g4 is also running
lollipop and comes with the very
familiar GUI interface and it hasn't
changed all that much and many of LG's
features have been retained ranging from
the useful features like knock code and
multi window to the not so useful like
smart bulletin and smart notice but
there you have it guys this has been a
quick comparison of the z5 premium
versus the LG g4 both of these devices
are very different but they're great in
their own way so definitely let us
down below which one you prefer and also
stay tuned for the rest of our IVA 2015
coverage there's definitely a lot more
to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
