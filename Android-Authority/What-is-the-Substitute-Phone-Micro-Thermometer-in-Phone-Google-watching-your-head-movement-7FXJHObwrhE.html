with a solution to help us with our
smart phone addictions or as my wife
calls it my appendage if you found
yourself using your smartphone a little
too much
an Austrian designer named Clemens
Schilling err might have a product to
help you break the habit Schilling er
has created a series of smartphone like
tablets which he's appropriately calling
substitute phones inspired by this
compulsive smartphone checking idea each
of these features are different
arrangements of inset beads for you to
move your fingers across some of which
emulate a specific smartphone gesture
like scrolling up and down a page
unlocking a device pinch to zoom to
recreate the feeling of using a modern
handset when you have the urge to do so
so the substitute phone isn't intended
to be a fun replacement for your device
it's intended to be a coping mechanism
to deal with its absence you see with
the alarming regularity of reports
suggesting that smartphone use or
excessive smartphone use is linked to
mental health issues like depression
maybe this isn't such a ridiculous idea
after all
what do you think no here's something
interesting I thought this was pretty
cool have you ever wondered what it
would be like to have a thermometer in
your phone the South Korean tech company
known as crucial tech has reportedly
developed the world's first micro sized
thermometer sensor module for
smartphones this according to the Korea
Herald is able to measure a person's
body temperature in just 0.5 seconds
using a connected application the module
makes use of an integrated micro
electrical mechanical system and is said
to be able to measure the temperature of
humans or objects presumably animals -
between minus 40 and 200 degrees Celsius
of course the sensor is also implemented
in such a way that the smartphone's
natural temperature doesn't interfere
with the measurements taken now just
think about that for example that means
that the CPU in a smartphone which
normally heats up pretty fast after
extended use would not affect the
readings on this micro thermometer how
would that work
well we don't exactly know just yet
however it is based on touchless
technology users don't actually need to
come into contact with the sensor to
measure their temperature this could
help lower the risk of infection and why
the number of possible applications
compared to more traditional
thermometers the Korea Herald doesn't
mention when we might see such
technology implemented into smartphones
this is only the first sensor of its
kind and may take some years before we
start to see it in a commercial context
if that ever happens well if you didn't
already feel that mother Google is
watching you they really will be
watching you soon the patent uncovered
by patently Apple describes a sort of
hands-free system that essentially opens
a laptop for you it starts by pushing a
touch-sensitive pad this then activates
one or more motorized hinges that stop
once the screen is in the correct
position needless to say the complex
system somehow isn't done though the
patent also describes a series of
ambient light and camera sensors that
track the user's face by doing this a
laptop could theoretically adjust its
display based on the user's position
that's right
you might one day have a laptop that's
following your head movements well
whether you think that's spooky freaky
are really cool I think you're gonna
have to just accept it it's gonna be
very commonplace in the next 10 to 15
years so said mister Broudy why well
because we have the vast worldwide web
and it's
exabytes of information that we're
looking at through these tiny little
screens it's like looking at the
beautiful universe through a keyhole
it's ridiculous
it doesn't work so when the Internet of
Things kicks up you're gonna see
everything that has an isp address which
is pretty much everything have some sort
of display screen right your windows
your refrigerator door your car
windshield the road itself can give you
information it can tell you what the
road conditions are up ahead where
there's an accident where you can get to
a detour and it can be catered just to
where you're going
HECO we have the beginning of this
technology already it's just not very
scalable just yet everything around you
is gonna have an isp address it's going
to be giving you
information and taking it in at the same
time that my friends is freaky now my
audience is smart so smart that
sometimes you're inspired by a business
idea and then you try and get the name
of that business in a domain name and
your next prospective customer is
searching your business name and they
assume you have the dot-com and if you
don't you're giving your business away
to the one who does that's the power of
a.com now why is that exactly well no
domain name extension tells your story
with the same degree of trust as a
dot-com or dotnet domain name.com and
dotnet domain name extensions inject
credibility and your online presence and
who doesn't want to be credible and
don't forget you get 15% off when you
use our coupon code Android when you
think domain names think domain.com
