Thor T and welcome back to another
episode of camera 360 where we attempt
to break down a smartphone camera in
three minutes give or take now our goal
on this show is to highlight some of the
most important aspects of a smartphone
camera that we think you should know and
we try to do it in a very short and
sweet fashion now if you guys are
interested in a more in-depth analysis
you can always check out the written
version of our review which will always
be linked in the description below with
all of that out of the way let's get
into today's episode with the assists
zenfone 6 so one of the most unique
things about the zenfone 6 is it's
motorized flip camera mechanism which
allows it to use one set of cameras for
both front and rear-facing photos
removing the need for a dedicated front
camera which is pretty awesome the
primary camera is the very popular 48
megapixel Sony MX and it's paired with a
13 megapixel ultra wide camera the
camera software is not all too different
from other smartphone camera apps the
camera shutter button is at the bottom
flanked by the image preview and camera
rotation button switching between the
various different modes can be done
simply by swiping left or right across
the viewfinder one of the zenfone 6 is
most unique modes is the motion tracking
feature which locks onto a subject and
leverages the motorized mechanism to
follow the subject as most smartphones
cameras tend to do these zenfone 6
performs pretty well in daylight
conditions skies exhibit an attractive
blue hue and images come out looking
very natural and lifelike there is some
sharpening going on in post but you'll
only really notice it when you zoom in
and pixel peep the camera also does well
with color reproduction there vibrant
enough that images don't look washed out
but far from appearing oversaturated
these zenfone 6 definitely treads more
on realistic color tones the main sensor
has no problems at all with capturing
tons of detail subjects appear nice and
crisp but so does the surrounding
background zoom in to this photo of the
grassy Bank overlooking the sea and you
can make out every single blade of grass
and even the details in this bench
that's pretty far away are still easily
visible landscape shots look great
especially with the wide-angle lens
there's a tiny bit of distortion at the
far corners of the frame but nothing
that is Strax from the overall picture
dynamic range and color production are
also quite good on this lens and it
never struggled much with exposure or
white balance portrait mode on the
zenfone 6 is about average most of the
time it does a decent job with
separating the subject from the
background and creating a convincing
look but it doesn't always do a perfect
job with edge detection and sometimes
blurs out parts that should still be in
focus low-light photos from the zenfone
6 aren't spectacular but they look fine
the night mode does a solid job of
lifting shadows and taming highlights
but images do have a distinct softness
to them and they look slightly over
processed now because of the flip
mechanism your rear cameras are also
your front-facing cameras so you're not
losing any quality here which is great
you can pull off some shots with natural
bouquet and wide-angle is extremely
useful for group photos or just fitting
more scenery into the frame to really
give people a better sense of your
surroundings the wide-angle lens does
make your arms look a little lanky but
it's a small price to pay the zenfone 6
is capable of recording 4k video at
60fps from the main sensor and it
produces good results the video is
smooth and the camera is quick to react
to changes in exposure and quick to find
focus considering the fact that the
camera flips around it's pretty great
for vlogging purposes overall we gave
the ESU's n phone 6 a score of 7.2 it
works great in most conditions and
having a primary camera paired with a
secondary wide-angle lens makes this an
extremely versatile setup for photo and
video especially when you factor in the
flip mechanism if you want a more
detailed breakdown of the soar and the
zenfone 6 s camera make sure to check
out the written review linked in the
description below thanks for watching
and stay tuned for the next episode of
camera 360</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
