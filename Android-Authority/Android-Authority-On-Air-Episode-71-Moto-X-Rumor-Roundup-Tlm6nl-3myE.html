original android hangout show on google+
I'm Derek Ross I'm Scott Anderson and
I'm Johnathan Franklin this week we're
going to hit up all the rumors
surrounding the Moto X a lot of stuff
happened over the past week we're going
to talk about Android 4.3 some new
droids are heading to verizon wireless
we have some leaks on those some other
device news with a routine ramen some
glass stuff and uh all right so so let's
get started so as you know this isn't
our normally scheduled show normally on
Thursday nights but Thursday was the
fourth of July so we are we were out
partying or out drinking or eating lots
of food or family plans or whatever so
here we are Sunday night John did you
have a have a good fourth of July doing
the exciting I did mostly the latter I
eat a lot of food there you go you are
to you how about you Scott just got back
from up north and had a lot of food got
a lot of Sun and had some fun with some
water toys I can tell that you got a
little bit of Sun you're looking a
little bit you're looking a little bit
more red than usual little bit yeah I'm
not a pasty white like Casper the ghost
but you know yeah you know I got a
little bit of sunburn myself on my back
at the beach I was on vacation this past
week but everywhere else I tanned up
real nice so it wasn't that's not that
bad I came back from vacation with a
little bit of headgear so we'll talk
about that a little bit alright so
Android 4.3 Scott when we find out this
week so basically report service that
with 4.3 google plans to introduce more
stocks stock apps into the Play Store so
the keyboard is the most recent
introduction to the Play Store camera
people dialer mms launcher if you're not
on sense you can still make it look like
stock so it's it's rumored that more
apps could come so so right now you know
camera the stock camera app isn't there
but we know we can steal that APK from
the Play edition phones and put it on
almost any phone you know and we know
that the stock launcher isn't there the
stock text messaging app isn't there you
know the stock people app isn't there so
this rumors true like you were saying if
you have a sense phone or a TouchWiz
phone you basically download all of the
core you know Google stock Android apps
you could have a you know an HTC phone
completely running you know HTC sense
rom but besides uh you know notification
toggles or you know the settings pretty
much everything looks and functions as a
stock android phone you know 40 for
argument's sake you know for a cosmetic
standpoint now I'm not that familiar
with it but could they essentially
replace the Settings app mmm oh how
about you John it made it really hard
because almost stuff in settings is very
specific to yeah I personally like if
you look on a samsung phone you've got
the settings and then you've got their
gesture controls and you got the s-pen
controls a lot of that stuff kind of
hard coded into because that would be
the one really underlying thing that you
know is a big part of your device that
you know would be off if you were to
notification shade would be another one
which would be kind of complicated but
you know the Gazette's system UI yeah so
there isn't more apps then it'd be
pretty easy yeah so if you're on Android
for not to and want the new google apps
you can just install them and maybe wait
for them because they do it in a roll
rolled out stage which we've come to
love and kind of get angry about but uh
people post APK so that's nice you know
and you know what if google actually
does this this is a way for them to take
back you know control of android because
you don't have to wait for another app
another core app to be updated by a new
android version number you know you know
what if that's all really android 4.3
is its breaking out every single Android
corps app and just a few under the hood
changes you know so 4.3 is releasing all
these app to the masses you know if 4.3
is truly that and they release all of
the most as many as it's not of the
stock apps as they can and you know just
do incremental bug fixes and performance
updates I'd be a happy camper um I don't
know about you guys would you guys be
satisfied with that is a 4.3 update or
would you guys want a hawk um you know
4.3 is we saw a little bit io there some
framework you know enhancements that be
welcome but if your phones running good
right now I don't think you've got any
reason to complain you know a lot of
like 4.2 you know with a lot of the
versions caused performance issues for
people and that's kind of the stuff you
don't wanna you know some OEM s are
better than others pushing up haze but
if you're just kind of decoupling all
the core apps away from the operating
system that's really the stuff most
people care about anyway this software
features you know that's the stuff
they're buying phones for now is not
really the version number as much as
what the phone can do anyway so yeah um
so yeah chainfire has taken leaked
android 4.3 builds of the galaxy s4 to
talk about a little bit last week and
got super user working on it already
that's nice so you know I mean that's no
surprise but it's a it's nice to know
that super user whenever 4.3 rolls out
as long as the leaked you know edition
of the s4 doesn't it isn't missing any
major changes or something you know a
lot of the leg work is already done yeah
so before we move on to the next topic
if you guys have any questions about
glass for anything you want to post them
in the comments dirt my answer then
later and if you have any questions for
during the show we can answer them live
if it's the on topic okay all right
so so let's talk about the new Moto X
the show is called a Moto X you know
rumor roundup because this week we just
saw tons of information and official
information so so let's get started here
so motorola officially tease then the
nouns but they officially teased the
Moto X this past week on July third the
day before the most patriotic day in the
United States motorola published a flyer
in some of the most highly subscribed
newspapers in the nation to the
Washington Post The New York Times USA
Today The Wall Street Journal they put a
flyer in there teasing / you know kind
of hinting announcing the Moto X and
that this was you know very well time
and they did it on the third on purpose
you know the advertisement said you know
why you're at home eating burgers or out
picnicking burgers you know you're doing
fourth of July stuff you're celebrating
freedom we just wanted to let you know
that this is an American engineered
American designed phone and it's going
to be the first smartphone assembled in
America and following that freedom
notion we're going to give you the
freedom to customize it so you know we
really didn't really find out what type
of customizations were coming to the
Moto X but we knew customizations now
was officially you know hinted tease so
thanks to some leaks thanks to some
speculations you know we have a bit more
information on that but also this was
the first time that Google was
officially showing the world hey this is
our Motorola and it's supported the new
motorola logo at the bottom of the flyer
all right so no now the fun stuff so
what do we know about customization well
reportedly the Moto X is going to allow
engraving similar to what you can do on
an
ipod on iPod you can put on the back you
know your name or because I'm crazy
saying whatever you can put on whatever
you want so there's a rumor a report i'm
sorry that there's a report that you'll
be able to do that with the Moto X so I
can put their across or android
authority or sky Anderson needs to make
his bed anything like that I want to on
the back of my Moto X now okay that's
that's cool and all but you know what
other customizations can we do to make
it our own well there's rumored reports
that in leaks that you'll be able to
customize the color casing the whole
entire phone all you know casing the
sides and the rear it won't be a
two-toned you know black and white phone
like the nexus 4 supposedly it'll be
more than just the back face plate so
that's nice but the big part of that is
it's going to be 20 different colors not
and it's going to be available from
launch not hey here's a black phone six
months later hey look you can make it
white or partially white you know it's
going to be from the get-go and that
that's nice um we actually saw a leak of
some of the cases and there they were
hot pink and teal and light purple like
very pastel bright colors and normally
we don't see that from an oem you know
we'll see that from a third-party case
and normally we see like a red or a
white air but or a blue but since
they're gonna have 20 colors available
you know the regular most popular color
is obviously they're going to be covered
and then some and these are some of the
additional colors ah so I don't know
about you guys but I'm on line up that
hot pink you know my that's gonna be
mine and then so so let's let's talk
about some of the other rumors he is
were kind of a rumor roundup because
this past week you know we got some more
leaks more speculations more reports
when that flyer hit and everybody
are coming out of the woodwork so we've
heard in the past that the battery is
you know it's gonna be huge on this
thing because you know Larry page's said
multiple times at your phone you know
should last the whole day you shouldn't
have to worry about oh my god where's my
charger at where's the next power outlet
so we've heard the battery is going to
be there 3,300 milliamp hours and we've
also heard reports of 4,000 to either
way that's huge um i mean i'd be happy
with either one complaining with either
one of those so we don't know which one
it's going to be you know that that
either way that if it turns out to be
either one of those that's pretty
awesome um there's another report
staying that's going to be ip57
certified so that means it's going to be
similar to the galaxy s4 active which is
ip67 or the Xperia Z so it's going to be
a little bit of dust resistant and it's
gonna be a little bit of water resistant
up to a metre of water for 30 minutes
we've had reports in the past there's
going to be rear touch controls so
you're going to touch the back you know
and and can control something on the
phone we don't really haven't heard
anything else about that in a long time
but you know that's that was still out
there there's been reports it's going to
be maybe a 4.7 inch screen with 720p
display now that that's a little bit of
a letdown for me seeing it as a lot of
phones or 1080p now five inches up or
close to five inches you know maybe it's
a 4.7 inch phone and it's 1080p you mean
look the HTC One so I would like a
higher resolution but that's just me all
I said earlier there's 20 different
colors to choose from it probably won't
be available until August but that's
just a speculation who knows you know in
in a week we could have an announcement
I but you know since its beginning of
July we haven't heard anything yet
usually they make an announcement in a
few weeks later it's available so i
would say august at some point and
motorola did announce at all things
digital
few weeks back that it was going to be
available this summer so August is still
the summer so fingers crossed confidence
high now Taylor Wimberly from android
and me said on Google and a Google+ post
this past week that he had inside
information that the Moto X was going to
offer dual LTE and tenants that's my mum
multiple-input multiple-output antennas
which would be pretty unique it would
offer a faster arm for lte-advanced
though yeah that then that's how
lte-advanced works so it would be
lte-advanced without actually being
lte-advanced or just offer hot you know
higher download and upload speeds
because you're connected you know
multiple times I'm curious about that
report I'll I'm curious is it some type
of precursor to lte-advanced or is it
just you know do LT you know my mo LTE
to just allow we know you to burn
through your data plan faster but that's
what we all want to do yeah I know I
know nice i have the potential it's nice
exactly it's nice if you want to
download and cut through your data in
half the your normal time you know mmm
um so we're still not really a hundred
percent sure on the cpu you know we've
heard and we've heard it's going to be a
Snapdragon s4 pro you know we've we've
heard recent rumors now suggest it could
be a Snapdragon 800 if Dan Charlton
wasn't feeling a little bit under the
weather tonight he'll be all over this
rumor he'd be like it's not going to be
available until August production on the
800 doesn't start until August yada yada
yada August and then we go back and say
uh other rumors suggest is unavailable
to August hmm but you know evleaks famed
insider had said it wasn't going to be a
Snapdragon 800 so only time will tell
one thing that was kind of interesting
if you if you go back and watch the all
things be confident conference um
because dennis woodside was talking
about it and they were
asking him because when he was talking
about the phone being contextually aware
how do you do that without it sucking
down your battery and everything and he
kind of snuck out that we've created we
know we created the processor we said
well actually two processors it's not
really not really hinting it like dual
core or two actual like Snapdragon
processors but you know there been
rumors that they created their own
custom proprietary processor that's
specifically dedicated to contextual
actions and voice actions you know and
that's kind of something they do with
moto active thing with for the watches
so it will be interesting if they had
some kind of I guess context engine like
a processor specifically dedicated to
that would kind of be an interesting
little game changer for them compared to
what the rest of the Mart you know
something unique compared to the rest of
the market you know beyond just the cpu
side yeah definitely so we've heard it's
going to have two gigs of ram you know
that's probably a given we've also heard
that according to evleaks that it's
going to be a 2-megapixel front-facing
camera and a 10 megapixel rear camera
now Taylor once again from Android in me
he suggested that the camera is going to
be in clear pixel camera with gesture
controls now if you're not really
familiar with clear pixel is it's an
image sensor designed by Kodak that adds
panchromatic clear pixels in addition to
the red green and blue pixels and these
clear pixels detect all wavelengths of
visible light so it can be up to two to
four times as sensitive to at low light
levels ultimately giving the potential
for much clearer shots and low light
which would allow you know faster
shutter speeds as well and you know I
don't know about you guys but most most
phones there are some phones that take
decent pictures in low light but most
Android phones take horrible pictures
and
low light I mean they're they're grainy
and if it did they just they just aren't
that pretty so that would be interesting
if that report pans out I mean I'm not
really that familiar with the technology
John is there anything you want to add
to that or oh pretty much it's all I've
meows awesome they I mean contact did
put out samples of course it's hard to
say because Kodak just kind of folded
for reasons that were relevant to that
but you know as far as the samples that
they put out versus a regular you know
camera they look pretty impressive and
considering the phone you know I think
it's a better use case with a phone
where you don't have the luxury of
having this really powerful flash
because you're worried about your
battery whether it you know I don't even
as far as the rumor goes I don't have
they gotten it where this image sensor
could be in a phone form factor I'm not
even sure you know unless someone's
licensing it making it themselves but if
it does you know that was really what
killed the Galaxy Nexus and phones like
that was that the low-light was terrible
i was saying you know who was trying to
push zero shutter lag you know so maybe
they put all huge emphasis on trying to
remedy that with this I don't if it if
they accomplish it with this then that
would be really impressive though yeah
all right now Ryan Moore a friend of
ours from Android Coliseum asks any
Canadian news about the Moto X he heard
that Rogers is going to have an
exclusive and and yeah that's that's
really all I heard from our friends up
north is that Rogers is going to have an
exclusive now I would assume that word
exclusive means exclusive to Canadian
carriers because back at all things D uh
it was stated that the Moto X would
pretty much be on every or almost every
major carrier here in the US is gonna I
forget the exact wording he use saying
it but basically it was that was going
to be well received by carriers in the
US so that's the case then yeah maybe
Rogers
we'll end up getting an exclusive for
the time being in in Canada but you will
have to keep us posted on that my friend
and whoa whoa maybe maybe we'll have you
on the show some time to talk about to
give the the Canadian news segment on
the Moto X or something something all
right so uh I guess really to wrap this
up you know we had a lot of news this
past week and a lot of leaks a lot of
speculation about the Moto X let me know
well let's know in the comments on
wherever you're watching soundcloud
YouTube Google+ Mars let us know what
you think about these speculations and
uh you know we've been asking you this
before but we're getting more
information are you getting the Moto X
you want the meadow X do these juicy
tidbits of information are they keeping
you on your seat because I don't know
about you guys but it's keeping the hype
up for me I'm loving these leaks I'm
loving these you know these reports
motorola couldn't have chosen a better
time of the year to do what they did
that's very true and really the story is
going to be the software and that's what
everybody's kind of waiting on is you
know the software the software does it
justice then that's what's gonna be
getting me really excited about it yeah
all right so let's talk about some more
devices let's talk about let's talk
about Johnathan Franklin and eyes
favorite carrier verizon wireless and
the Druids so the rumor will we have
three what's supposed to be three
rumored devices coming to verizon and
we're dropping the razor name apparently
with the droid ultra and ermas are
pointing to an ultra M which I guess
would be your razr m you know mid-range
replacement in the ultra and then the
ultra Maxx so we got rid of the razor we
really didn't get rid of the stupid max
name but uh
so the ultra code is XT 1080 which would
you know make you think that it would
suggest a 1080p display so you know
progressively I guess we could also
think of it as a 1080p you know version
of the razr HD basically a man XD a
member leaked out an image of it and it
was a white kind of they show the front
bezel and everything in it interestingly
had three hardware capacitive buttons
which is a bit odd just considering that
motorola has went with soft keys with
the majority of their devices in the
last you know tears though two years ago
the original razors were hardware you
know where we're capacitive buttons then
last year when the refresh the HD razors
came out they were sought they were soft
keys muscari oh so boys you with soft
keys too yeah yeah so um I'm confused
you know I wonder why that is yeah I
can't say that I'm a fan of it either
because uh when you if you look at I had
a discussion of mothers day if you look
at Samsung's devices they have a
dedicated menu button which I'm not the
biggest fan of but if you have a
capacitive layout you need to have a
menu button because of like HTC does
with that stupid menu overlay that pops
up on the screen so if you took soft
keys away and put capacitive buttons and
they're gonna have to have some kind of
screen pop up whenever you have an
application that doesn't use the action
bar so I can't say I'm a big fan of the
capacitive key movie that ends up being
true but uh the next rumor is basically
xt 10 ATM which is would be the max
version of that so basically AAP razr HD
max bigger battery evleaks posted an
image of this one and it looks a lot
like a verizon droid razr which isn't
too big of a shock keeps the Kevlar
backing wrapping around to the bottom
kind of has a little bit of a chin to it
almost like the M does I also shows
hardware buttons on it which is like we
were talking
pretty odd um but verizon has been
clearing our stock of its previous joy
branded phones we were kind of hopeful
that that was going to be a permanent
move but you know them probably
indicating that they're getting ready
for you know what's coming up then the
rumors for an altar and we really don't
have a lot of information on that but
it's probably most likely going to be a
smaller more mid-range specification
version of the you know ultra and
ultramax realistically either way
verizon needs some droids I mean they
haven't released a droid since last
November many phones in general you know
I mean so bad off the phones right now
the HTC One is kind of missing in action
and the galaxy s4 is nasal as the last
phone they released since the middle of
November it's been seven months in one
phone that's pretty bad it's it's almost
like being on metro pcs or something its
stead and uh your take you know what
John they released a game though and
damn it that game was more important
than new phone is enough to resurrect
jord landing on twitter i guess but yeah
um it kind of makes me sad to see rumors
of the droid ultra ultra am because
we're back and forth on rumors of
whether the verizon version of the Moto
X is going to be a droid whether it's
not going to be a droid but it it's kind
of odd if Motorola would put out a Moto
X for verizon and put three phones on
verizon to be in a store so it's kind of
scaring me into thinking that one of
these phones is going to be there reaper
android version of them what if the oh
god what if the ultra m is the Moto X
could very well be and now we've seen
what but we've seen four different we've
seen in there are so many rumors some
rumors say that the droid you know the
Moto X on Verizon is not gonna be a
droid something bursting cries I might
not get it all and then you know is just
the way the rumor mill works it just
yeah i'm i'm hopeful I want it to be
eight God from that I would want it to
be and I want to buy
verizon make me happy can I give you my
money here's my wallet please so and
speaking of hopeful HTC One S owners
you're probably not going to be as
hopeful now sorry how about that HTC has
proud of statements and that basically
android 4.2 point2 and since five are
never going to come to the HTC One S if
we're talking about a phone that's about
15 months old and for point-to-point
tues been out since late last year and
you know petitions are growing all over
the web and it's kind of gaining
traction asking HTC to continue support
for it it's sad the 1s was extremely
popular I mean you know in it's odd
because the 1s was they considered to be
a mid-range phone but it was a really
good phone hardware wise you know and I
get you could say okay show me a
mid-range phone from last year that has
gotten or isn't going to get four point
two point to even from Samsung I can't
think of one but the thing is the 1s had
a dual-core snapdragon processor in it
that was just like the one exercise it
was pushing a lower resolution display
there's no zero reason that the hardware
can't run for point-to-point to
flawlessly yes our buddy Dan Charlton he
had a 1s before he got the nexus 4 he
loved that film and you know grateful a
previous show guest of ours Jeff Ribeiro
he had the 1s and he loved that phone I
mean it's it's a good phone I'm
surprised you know I that's sad when a
phone can't even reach 18 months you
know year and a half before it's
obsolete it's to me it's not so much
just that because you know OEMs do this
all the time but HTC just doesn't have a
lot of leeway to piss their fans off
right now yeah you know they're not
really perfect selves on a good
zishan to rebound right now because you
know they've done pretty well with the
one you know they've released kernel
source on time they've been pretty good
about that they put it out right you
know for the google edition they've put
out a couple of updates for the one you
know the HTC One just got four point two
point two and then they come out and do
something like this and people you know
back to square one again it's like but
you just fail to build your trust up
again but don't you respect the fact
that they come out and say it and just
never say it because I think this is a
good step for transparency um and it
said it's yeah it's a good step for
transparency and another thing is I
don't repeat I think people tend to
forget that we weren't that long ago
looking at the galaxy s2 and Samsung
told people that it wasn't going to get
ICS and then they told him it wasn't
going to get jelly bean and the internet
just blew up about it and that's how
that phone got support was because you
know Samsung can't and told somebody
that it was not going to get a jelly
bean update and people just blew the
internet up and asked why well you know
we've done this before we've done this
when HTC you know with HTC dead that's
why we have HTC dev you know we did this
before with asus and the transformer
line you know they weren't good at the
prime that was called I can't read it
was it the bride it was the primer the
Infinity when we were asked on the
eighth loader and then they said went
relax relax we pay hey yeah we flipped
out and you know we took two we talked
to websites we took to social media we
let them know we were pissed and and
they came back then they came back and
released a bootloader unlock tool in and
since then their other you know
successors tablets have have had that as
well so it is possible if we all act
really pissed off and like jerks on
every social media account they have i'm
not saying to do this link um but uh it
has worked in the past so if you do own
an HTC One and you didn't sign a
petition and you didn't flood facebook
twitter youtube
google+ and let HTC know how you feel I
would say do that you know it has worked
in the past we might were not the
majority of the market were probably the
loudest part of the market yes times
matters more exactly so at sony
benchmarks show up and it's an LG device
that looks to be the g2 optimus g2 and
it's already been known and been
announced that this thing is going to
come with a Snapdragon 800 so it's not
really surprising that you know what the
benchmark showed because they were right
along the lines of what you expect to
see from a Snapdragon 800 processor and
the score was about 32,000 which is
amazing but uh thumb benchmarks actually
leaked out for the power consumption and
the battery benchmark show the
Snapdragon 800 you know pretty frugal
for how much power it's packing because
in some of the competitive battery
testing they were doing considering what
they were going up against it was
actually consuming the same or a little
bit less power than the ex knows 5 octa
which is a really good achievement
considering that it's faster it's a good
bit faster but also because you know the
octos pushing the whole big little thing
and even with the four smaller a7 cores
it's still not really any better on
battery than Qualcomm's a modified
version of an immuno Qualcomm's crate
architectures kind of a 9 8 15 hybrid
and they're doing with four cores what
Samsung is able to do with a big little
a 15 setup so the fact that it's better
on power consumption is you know really
says a lot for what they're doing with
their architecture
but the good thing is it shouldn't be a
how power-hungry monster if you decide
to get a phone with a Snapdragon 800 in
it you'll get one that's a really
well-balanced processor alright so let's
talk about a little bit of rutin ramen
Scott you know you still down with the
pink unicorn or are you okay so any news
from the root and rom in front this one
they're just pushing Knightley's I
haven't flashed or lightly yet but I'm
thinking about doing it just because
milestones they're growing a little bit
slower than they were before so I think
I'm gonna flash unknightly next weekend
or maybe tonight just to kind of see if
there's anything new and cool bud yeah
still rocking the the pink what about
the cyanogenmod any news this week ya
khushi actually he got google voice text
messaging working in cm10 messaging apps
stock handcent etc messaging apps
previously you had open google voice to
viewer sent text messages and texts to
your cell phone number were in the stock
app they were separate no longer is the
case this is awesome for people that
have google voice accounts that are
annoyed by the fact that it's not
integrated into really anything but it's
on all your devices because you know
there's an app for that on all of your
devices it's also the fact that the
google voice app is terrible is all
there is no project butter on google
voice at all there's not any place
didn't I project anything and Google
glass right now well there is a project
it's called hangouts which is supposed
to the future of google voice which has
no integration with google voice yet
well that's why it's a project yeah but
you know what's good in winter love all
right so uh so let's talk about
let's talk about glass this past week on
july first seeing at it that it is the
seventh month google pushed out XE seven
explorer edition seven over the air
update for glass and this update
actually added a couple really nice
features it allows you to do more with
voice more hands-free so let's say you
get a text message when you're reading
the text message you can say ok glass
reply to to start replying to the text
message or you can view the text message
and then say ok glass you know read
aloud to have it read to you before you
had to tap the touchpad and you can get
to these options before we had to touch
so now you just say ok glass so they're
giving you more opportunity to say ok
glass and also when you take a picture i
can take a picture now and then after i
take the picture i can say well while
you're still viewing the picture you
just took i can say ok glass share with
scott anderson share with public you
know to share on google+ or share with
android to share to my android circle or
you know if i want to share it to
Twitter you know it's a share to twitter
you know things like that that's pretty
awesome so the next big update with
glass now has a web browser so yes you
can now watch youtube videos and listen
to music through youtube on glass you
can browse the web whenever you do a
google search result whenever you do a
google search i would say ok glass
Google then daft punk get lucky let's
say and the first link is probably a
YouTube video so I select that I tap my
touchpad and it says would you like to
open the website I say yes yes I would
like to open the website and then it
opens the web page
and then I can use my fingers to zoom in
pan download in the across the web page
and then once I find a link I can tap on
the link and it comes up and says would
you want to open the link and I say yes
sir I do and I can browse the web it's
you know it's not the most functional
web browser ah but it gets the job done
i mean it's it's not as good as
obviously using a computer it's as good
as using your phone or your tablet but
it's a web browser on glass i know it's
it's not bad you know I've used it just
to play around that I've actually
watched a couple YouTube videos and
browsed around a few websites you know
booked some pictures and all that good
stuff um another big update was that
that glass now has the same conversation
conversational search that was shown
back in May at Google i/o so you can do
a search for letting you know for
example I say who is the CEO of google
it will come back and say Larry Page
then I can do another search and say how
old is he that can do another search and
say where was he born you know things
like that you know you don't have to
keep you know keep asking the beginning
of the question it knows that you're
asking about that first query and they
said you can do this right now in chrome
you can do it right now on your favorite
android device yadda yadda yadda now
this functionality is now available and
glass um there's where there are some
experimental features found in the
update if you ripped it apart such as
him some type of music or volume control
coming in the future and a glass
boutique which is an app store because
you know google has a lot of them and
they wanted to add another one so we
have the Chrome Web Store we have the
google play store we have the google
apps marketplace and now we're going to
have glass boutique apparently which is
a place to find all of the glass apps
because right now you you have to you
know if you want to find third-party
apps that developers are pushing
out there you have to go to various
places around the web where people are
collecting them and so forth so that's
nice you know we needed we knew it was
coming you know um but yeah so so Scott
and John uh I happen to be wearing glass
now finally ah I picked it up on friday
friday morning while I was on vacation I
i took a two hour bus ride into New York
City from where I was vacationing and
picked up glass and I'm excited so
earlier in the show we asked you if you
guys had any questions for me so I saw a
couple of them and I know Scott and John
have a whole bunch of questions about
glass you know what I've thought so far
so uh first bend the wrist you know the
next 15 minutes the show just talking
about glass cuz i know a lot of people
you know want to know and want to do a
live Q&amp;amp;A about glass so so let's do it
you want to start with audience
questions or us or with our questions
first you know what you're a big boy I'm
gonna I don't care you make the decision
Scott I don't care all right I do have a
question regarding hangouts um you were
in the Hangout earlier and just talking
with us how is the speaker on glass well
I mean it's not really a speaker uh it's
you know bone conducting audio ah but it
vibrates you know the back of your ear
there's a little for lack of better word
is like a little button little plate
here that vibrates my your bone and I
can hear in quiet situations I'm sitting
down here in my office I can hear fine
from walking throughout the house you
know I can hear an outside I can hear if
I'm in a not a car I can hear from
walking down the street yeah probably
not you know it's it's quiet in a quiet
areas I can hear it fine but if there's
for example whenever I was trying on
glass my glass guy told me to do
something and then she said she was very
helpful at a very helpful woman very
nice lady she said hey do a search for
this and you
here red back to you Joe did you hear it
but nay I didn't hear anything in there
because there's a lot of people talking
a little bit of background noise so I
didn't hear it but if you cup your ear
in a loud situation it makes it a lot
easier to hear or in a quad situation it
makes it louder but so I mean it I don't
know I I don't hate it I wish it was a
little bit louder but it you know uh
we'll have to see what the glass team
does with it in the future okay John so
do after the you know I'm sure you're
playing around with the new updates and
everything but do you plan on ever like
rooting the device breaking the
bootloader party yeah you know I have to
do that my Nexus 7 and Nexus 4 never
booted up and or my galaxy nexus never
booted up they know to a locked state
the first time they egged them in i
unlock the bootloader and did you know
but what glass right now is locked I'm
gonna eventually um unlocked bootloader
and play around with some things enable
some of the labs features that you have
to add it to build up prop for and then
I can change them back and I mean
factory images are available you know me
I'm an Android tinkerer I I have to do
these things or my blood but right now
I'm just playing around and trying to
figure things out so i will do it just
not yet okay um what the rest of routing
is there a huge advantage or you know
something that you would benefit from
hurting it oh no no there's no reason to
root glass if you want a side load an
app that some people have developed you
don't need root to do that there's no
reason to relate to sideload a nap
anyways you know unless you want to gain
extra functionality I'm sorry you can do
it um but really the right right now the
benefit of rooting it would be to enable
some of the labs features you know the
UM that are turned off by by default you
know such as such as winking to take a
picture or now the volume controls or
some stuff like that as things slowly
get added to 2 glass you know to turn
them on or off but yeah there's no real
reason to we get updates every month so
next month the things that are in labs
might very well be you know real you
know for everybody to use it's a good
question from you too when I'm curious
about it's from Brendan Owens he asked
how big does the screen feel to you well
so I just turned it on you can see if
you're watching on YouTube you can see
my eye there's my eye is blowing now you
can see also the screen turns off pretty
quickly if I don't do anything um it no
Noah did it feels big I mean it feels
small too because it's not in my direct
eyesight but it's not anything I have to
squint at I mean it's it's a decent size
screen um Nick what I wanted to be
bigger um if it was bigger it would be
in more of my field of view I mean yeah
I think I could see it being a little
bit bigger but um I think it's fine for
for what it's doing now you know so it
doesn't need to be bigger yeah I mean
for what for what you can do a glass now
I think that it's fine because you
remember it's not supposed to be it's
not supposed to overtake your field of
vision it's just supposed to be
something a little extra you know it you
don't want it to cover up you know your
whole entire field of vision because
then you won't know safety reasons you
can't see a things so you know glass
designers made a conscious decision to
put it you know above your eye line so
it is out of your direct you know field
of view you do have to look up to it and
when you look up you know it's a says
you know it's a small screen but it's
not overly some under sized so you don't
think we're gonna see like a later
edition glass mega mega mega um now you
know who knows maybe when the consumer
version
comes out though they'll make it bigger
who knows you know I mean it's a flat
screen or something it could be it could
be a little bit bigger like I said I
mean without causing any major problems
I would think in terms of like safety it
could be a little bit bigger maybe maybe
twice as big baby but yeah it's fine the
way it is another another good one from
the comments is up how's the battery
life you know I'm actually having
horrible battery life compared to what i
thought you know and then you know glass
has been used now for three months
people have been using it you know I
explorers started getting at the middle
of April and you know slowly ramping up
more and more people since then and
people been saying yeah you know what if
you record a 20-minute video on glass
it's going to kill the battery but you
know what you record a 20-minute video
on the average smartphone it's going to
take a big chunk of your battery too so
that's no big deal you know most people
said you know what I can take pictures
use navigation do a video and I can it
can last me all day long you know and
Jason Kruger Tom I'm sorry I'm laughing
at his comment hehe just posted a
comment in our comment section saying
next time he's going to try to watch us
live on glass which you could do that
you could bring up youtube and watch us
live actually all right so anyway sorry
about that I i I'm like a no squirrel
you know anyways um we're talking about
a battery that yeah so so yeah so
there's been some reports people in the
official glass community oh you know as
well as various other social networks
are saying that the XE 7 update konnen
is chewing away at battery life and some
people are saying hey I'm not affected
some people are saying yep battery life
sucks on this update and I'm gonna say I
have I can't compare it because to a
previous update because I updated my
glass in the studio before I left I
wanted to make sure I left before I was
on XE 7 but i'll tell you right now i
should not leave glass it for
or two and a half hours not using it on
my desk and it shouldn't lose twenty
seven percent of my battery I shouldn't
lead glass an hour on my desk and go
outside and mow the grass and come back
and have it go from sixty percent to
forty percent so there's definitely
something that's chewing away battery i
I've right now I mean I'm in my
honeymoon phase i'm using it more than
normal so me having to charge it once a
day or twice a day i mean is uh probably
normal since i'm using it all the time
but i'm gonna say that's probably not as
normal as it should be because it's like
a your your device when it's idle
shouldn't suck away twenty percent of
the battery and i'm having that issue
right now um at nine o'clock my glass
was fully charged i did a hank how long
do you guys think i was doing a hangout
for no no more than five minutes right I
10 megs yeah so right so right now let's
just see so an hour and 20 minutes ago
my glass is at eighty-three percent
right now and I did a five minute hang
out and that's all I've done with class
has been idle since then I turn the
screen on maybe four or five times and
then turned it off so I lost seventy
percent battery in an hour and 20
minutes and I did a five minute hang out
now you know i think but i think it's
dropping battery faster as it gets low
and lower percentage but but who knows
that anyways i'm rambling on let's get
to another another question here so you
guys had think that's uh bad but how
BIG's the screen feel yeah yeah does it
does it heat up like a smartphone um
camo Edmund says doesn't heat up like a
smartphone does well when it's charging
yes um you know I it gets hot when it's
charging you know so you don't want to
really walk around you know with it
plugged in you know to try to extend the
battery life I I did that my first day
because you know
came out of the box it was only like
fifty percent battery and I wanted to
use it all day so i charged it with my
portable charger for a while I felt it
get warm so I wouldn't you know suggest
doing that but who knows maybe something
will will change in the future so you've
seen them we're getting toward this
trend of like hybrid between phones and
tablets and then like we're coming up
with peripherals like little handsets
that you can use with that do you ever
see glasses being like the phone part
and just toting a tablet for your data
aspect of it and being that and getting
rid of the phone all together well I'll
tell you that I haven't used much I got
it friday you know it's Sunday right now
um there's things that can be improved
there's things that need to be added and
then yeah I mean I can make a phone call
and talk to somebody and I have I can do
text messages which I have but i don't
really text message that much anymore I
in fact i rarely has sent a couple text
messages a month I do hangouts to all
friends and family you know I google
talk you know I that's what I do so that
support isn't there yet um I have to
rely on my phone for that and you know
creating creating posts um isn't
available yet an easy way to do it will
say there's a workaround but right now
the only way for me to create a post on
facebook google+ or twitter is to take a
picture and then share it to those
networks but i don't always want to
share a picture maybe i want to you know
just say a random message to a circle or
a public poster you know friends or
whatever or tweet right now without a
workaround you know you really can't do
that on the official apps so maybe that
feat that feature and that functionality
is coming in the future we're actually
talking about a about that in the glass
community earlier and developers they're
familiar with the mirror API told me
that that functionality is available so
I'm not sure why are hopefully in the
future I can say ok glass send a message
to Twitter hey here's a tweet inhabit
tweet or say ok glass send a message to
public and have it send that message to
a public post on Google+ know things
like that i wish that functionality was
there i wish i didn't have to take a
picture to be able to share to a social
network because i don't always want to
share something with a picture right um
but so once that functionality comes
John you know where I can share you know
a little bit more um III mean I think
apps you to get little bit better like
right now I'm subscribed to some news
feeds so I can get some content on the
glass so I could so I can read a
headline but it would be nice if you
could have it read you you know maybe
not the whole article because you know
people need to your are you know I don't
know maybe that would be too much but
region excerpt like right now the New
York Times and CNN app will read you a
sentence or two from the headline but I
don't read the New York Times and I
don't read CNN so whatever you know news
aggregator that's out there such as the
one I'm using wink feed which is awesome
Matt's app it's great but it reach it
reads you the headline I would like a
little bit more information because i
read a headline and right now I when i'm
reading the headline i can add it to
pocket and then go read the article
later or I can you know oh hey this
looks good go look at on my phone but
I'd like to maybe you know get a little
bit more than just a heading but that's
just me you know that takes that means
it's a function that glass has now I
don't have to look at my phone because
right now you know I still look at my
phone to complete the text message
complete the Hangout message or not the
text message to complete the Hangout
message to complete the news feed you
know to complete the sharing to you know
social networks and and all this stuff
but but for notification uh you know
notification about something and I want
to read just a real quick blurb of hey
here's a headline ok I want to read this
later I can add it to boom read it later
and read it later that's nice get a
message on a social network I can do a
quick
ply do a quick retweet or do a quick um
you know comment on google+ if somebody
actually i have actually been doing that
a lot more lately than I normally have
been i've been using glass to reply to
people's posts that was actually
something that I'd it took me a little
bit to figure out so right now I was
only getting post on Google+ when
somebody plus mentioned to me or shared
a post with me I was like well how do I
see people's posts i want to see
everybody's posts you know i want to
scroll through my stream and i couldn't
do that and then that so i created a
circle of notifications and said i
subscribe to these people's posts notify
me when these people post so when I need
to cut that circle down because there's
like 50 some people in it and my glass
is blown up which could be my battery
issue but uh I'm getting tons of
notifications when people post and then
I can +1 it right from glass or comment
it right from glass I can't share the
post but that would be interesting if I
could do that maybe and that's a nice
feature you never to reshare or
something anyway so what was that
question about oh I can just see glass
being great for the media stuff that and
you have to pull the phone out of your
pocket but since you don't have to pull
your phone out of your pocket for that
kind of notification stuff i would think
you could justify toting a baker device
almost closer to like a nexus 7 this
book just because you've got the glass
there for the immediate notification
kind of stuff that you would do that you
would typically do one-handed while
you're walking or something all right so
remember earlier I said to how Jason
Krueger was saying hey I'm gonna watch
us on glass he's actually watching us
right now on glass live so that's
awesome he comment to let us know very
cool so that that's a new form i wonder
if this is our first hangout on air
being watched on glass jason wants to
talk about that later and make some big
you know pat on the back announcement
about it um so I have a question here
Scotty tech more says how is bluetooth
working with your phone well you know
what I'm running cm 10.1 but
surprisingly it's running great I've
heard a lot of people
a their phones are losing connection
with the myglass app so I've had it for
three days now my phone hasn't been
disconnected every time I look at my
phone even when I classes in one room
and I phones you know when another room
so I know they're not not connected
anymore soon as they get in the vicinity
boom they sync up I haven't had any
issues which is amazing because
Bluetooth generally sucks um I had to
actually reboot my glass when I was
setting it up to get it to connect to
bluetooth but since then it's been
connected for three days and I had zero
issues haven't had to turn it off turn
it back on anything I'm very surprised
about that Brendan Owen says how many
people have asked you about it in public
well i live in hicksville Pennsylvania
also known as know anyways that that's
the town I live in so I've been to a
couple stores and nobody has said
anything couple people looked at me kind
of funny probably wondering like what
disability do I have that I'm wearing
this yeah I mean people I'm serious I
people probably differ on you don't know
what it is unless they're tacky um it's
a good time to get glass with all the
NSA and yeah but I'll tell I'll tell you
why right now you walk around with a
camera I'll tell you what though guys
whenever I was in New York City so many
means so many people who it was so many
people came I was only in New York City
for a couple hours yeah we were there we
got glass we left uh in the Chelsea
Market just walking around the market
there was at least half a dozen people
this is all my god google glass and
people came up to me wanted to know but
what do you seek right now and and how
does it work what can you do and as I
calves got this half hour ago I don't
know yet but I talked to him about it
and I'll em try it on I was waiting in
line across the street actually before I
walked across the street as I was
walking out of the building some guy
yelled ok glass and then you know just
he knew what it was you know and him and
his buddies laughed and then I said oh
so hey what do you think of it and I
just got it awe walking I walked a few
blocks so with my wife we had people you
know coming over from across the street
you know where people coming up to me
asking me I was waiting in line at the
bathroom at starbucks and a guy and his
girlfriend were talking to me about it
you know and had all sorts of questions
yeah so i'm waiting to what happens
tomorrow when i'm at work when i'm in an
area that there's more you know tech
people because i said my town at least
the places i've been no one know it was
so i'm sure it's only been a couple days
but so far glasses been well-received
I've been at restaurants and you know I
know what you know no nobody cares yeah
I as you know tons of people have
reported that really just media hype I
mean you're gonna follow us you're gonna
find some people to care but most people
