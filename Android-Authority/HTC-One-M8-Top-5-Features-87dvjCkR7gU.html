sort of rock over the last couple days
you would know that I've been spending a
lot of time with the HTC One m8 over the
last couple days and after today's
launch event we did get our hands on a
review unit because this phone is
available right now available for you to
buy we wanted to put it through a few
more paces before we get started on our
full review and tell you what top five
features we're most excited about when
it comes to handling this brand-new
device so it's Josh vegara from Andhra
Authority what's going on everybody and
this is our top 5 features on the HTC
One m8 alright and when we're talking
about the HTC One m8 of course we have
to talk about its most glaring change
and that is on the back in terms of that
new camera not just the camera that
returns from the HTC One m7 which is the
four ultra pixel camera that did do very
well in low-light photography but also
the dual camera that is found very much
at the top of the device and may or may
not be a blemish for some of you users
out there but its function is undeniable
as it is a hardware solution to one of
the problems that some of these other
manufacturers have been trying to sort
of put into their phones and solve which
is the selective focus inside of your
photos they're really looking to create
a DSLR level experience here and even
though 4 megapixels may not be a whole
lot for most of you users out there the
fact that you can be very stylistic with
the photos you do get out of the camera
on the HTC One m8 is a very big prospect
indeed and then we move over to yet
another feature of the HTC One that has
always been one of its best traits and
that's the build quality in the update
to the m8 the HTC One has been given
even more aluminum and metal in its
build and now the phone is almost made
up of 90% aluminium now despite the fact
that metal might interfere with the
antennas that is not the case here as
they have been able to bolster their
antenna technology to be able to be put
into the aluminum and now the aluminum
is wrapped around the phone from the
back to the front where the screen is
obviously that results in a very nice
feel that is different from the more
rigid fuel of the original HTC One after
that the screen has also been bumped up
to five inches which is more in line
with current flagships which does make
the phone
little bit larger all around but it is
still a very narrow device and with the
curve on the back and the nice
smoothness on the sides this is actually
not that hard of a phone to handle even
with that extra girth on the top and
bottom but then again those are the boom
sound speakers speaking of the boom
sound speakers they have been enhanced
in this new version of the HTC one the
amplifiers in either of the top or
bottom of the boom sound front-facing
speakers have been given a 25% volume
boost allowing this to really be sort of
a replacement speaker or rather if
you're going to be sharing your media
with anybody else you should be able to
share it easily with anybody that is in
at least close proximity because this
thing can probably get really loud and
then our next feature that we're really
excited about is the improvement to
sense 6 or they called it Sixth Sense
because ultimately the operating system
is trying to give you the information
you need without you having to go
searching for it and that starts with
blinkfeed blinkfeed has been enhanced
with a different look that is not
paginated the way it was before and now
is a full-on scroll with all of the
tiles that are there
it looks quite elegant and if you don't
like the color that it is defaulted to
in that green you can always change it
in the settings after that more
contextualization in terms of the motion
sensor you'll be able to turn on the
phone easily without having to reach to
the top for that power button these are
just very nice enhancements of the sense
UI that takes what is already an
attractive package that is also useful
and makes it even more useful for the
general consumer and then finally the
last part of the HTC One m8 that we're
excited for in this top 5 is the battery
life now while the 2600 milliamp hour
battery may not seem that big of an
improvement going from the m7 to the m8
we will see that the battery will
probably last quite a while because of
the optimizations that are put into
there not to mention the Snapdragon 801
which should be a power sipper in terms
of its consumption according to HTC the
battery in here should last 40% longer
than the one that was found in the m7
but they're not just going to stop with
their optimizations they're also adding
in software that will allow you to have
an extreme power saving mode which will
allow you to have the phone on for just
wicked amounts of time at 5% in this
extreme power saving mode the phone will
still be in standby for up to 15 hours
so if you really just need to be
connected
okay someone calls you you can turn on
that mode and then you can take your
sweet time getting over to a charger and
then charging the phone back to full
power to where you need it and so there
you have it for our top five features
that get us really excited about using
and reviewing this brand new phone from
HTC the HTC One m8 there are quite a few
enhancements in the UI and also in the
build quality but also that camera up
top so we will call this a proper update
to what was already a pretty well
received and very nice phone
to boot so keep it tuned to android
authority for all of the best coverage
of the HTC One m8 we're going to have
our full review coming up quite soon and
also feature focuses on both blinkfeed
and the camera to say the least so keep
it tuned to Android thority and don't
forget to head on over to our website
and rathore decom for all of the best
coverage because we are your source for
