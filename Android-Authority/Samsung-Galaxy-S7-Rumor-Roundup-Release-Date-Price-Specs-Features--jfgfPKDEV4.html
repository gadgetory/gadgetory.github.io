domain.com covering the rumors and leaks
of the Galaxy S series is sort of like a
box of chocolates you never know what
you're gonna get
sexy cutting-edge innovation or
perforated band-aid so for the moment
here's what's being said about the
much-anticipated galaxy s7 while
Samsung's days of massive growth may be
over the Galaxy S series remains the
best-selling and most representative
Android smartphone millions of people
see ant right through Samsung's lense
making the galaxy s7 a hugely
influential device judging on history
alone one could bet that Samsung will
introduce the galaxy s7 right before the
Mobile World Congress which in 2016 will
be held on February 22nd to 25th in that
case Sunday February 21st looks like a
good guess for the galaxy s7 launch
however one source that claims the
galaxy s7 will arrive early is Korea's
et news an outlet that has had a
relatively good track record when it
comes to news from its home country
according to et News the galaxy s7 will
be released in January January 19th is
mentioned as a specific date with an
in-store availability to follow in
February now when it comes to price
according to rumors that of China the
galaxy s7 may be 10% cheaper than the
galaxy s6 at launch the caveat here is
that we've heard similar rumors in the
past and at the end of the day Samsung's
flagship will remain as expensive as
always unless Samsung decides to
sacrifice profits for market share we
can expect the s7 to be priced in the
typical 600 to $700 unlocked price range
now that's pricing and availability but
let's talk about what's expected under
the hood the most common rumor is that
we'll see a 5.2 inch
samo LED quad HD display that's 1440 by
2560 in pixels and Gorilla Glass 4
samsung will stick with its tried and
tested formula for the display on the s7
that means keeping with the 5.1 inch to
5.2 inch quad HD display panel utilized
on the s6 though it's possible and
likely that Samsung will improve the
efficiency and overall quality of the
display several reports suggested
samsung will once a
use a mix of Qualcomm and Exynos chips
according to electronic times Samsung
plans to use the Snapdragon 820 in the
US and China and the in-house Exynos
88-90 in other markets either choice
would provide great performance despite
alarmist rumors about overheating issues
given that the note 5 has four gigabytes
of RAM Samsung will probably use the
same amount on the galaxy s6 though it's
possible it will stick with three
gigabytes of RAM which is still very
good now there's a rumor from a Chinese
leaker that Samsung has quote listened
to its customers voice and decided to
bring back the microSD card slot for the
s7 there's no technical reason why
Samsung couldn't do that and indeed that
seems like a good way to win back some
of its hardcore customers I was reading
the comments in a previous show where
one of you were saying the same thing
that yes Samsung should listen to their
customers because they know what they
want and they want micro SD card support
no they don't
geeks want that you and me want that
because we know how to use it and we
know to leverage that the average person
doesn't even know what a micro SD card
is I heard one person say I don't want a
micro SD card slot I want a big micro SD
card slot yeah that's how much they know
geeks want it normal people don't now
when it comes to the camera two distinct
rumors about the main camera on the s7
have surfaced early November the first
one claims that Samsung is going to
source the sensor from Sony the
undisputed leader and the sensor
industry Samsung is reportedly
interested in this Sony IMX 300 sensor
the 25 megapixel sensor used in the
Xperia z5 according to the second rumor
samsung is going to use an in-house ISO
cell sensor at just 12 megapixels but
with larger pixels for improved
low-light sensitivity Samsung pay and
fingerprint sensor will make a return
probably in improved forms in terms of
new stuff one Chinese source claims that
Samsung will integrate synaptics clear
force technology a force sensing
solution if that's accurate Samsung may
be taking another page from Apple's book
in 3d touch Synoptics announced that
clear force will be arriving in
smartphones in early
sixteen but for now we are taking this
report with a big grain of salt
incidentally or not Samsung has a patent
on a force sensing implementation now on
December 10th on leaks released a video
showing renders based on alleged
schematics from the galaxy s7 plus a
six-inch version of the s7 the french
leaker claims that his report was fully
independent from the one from gsm arena
comm if that's the case there's an
increased chance that the designs seen
in these leaks is legit that we need
further confirmation now in our mind
there's no doubt that samsung will
release an edged variant of the galaxy
s7 the question is will there ever be a
flat screen version at all according to
a Vietnamese site Samsung will drop the
regular flat version all together and
launch the galaxy s7 in two sizes a 5.2
inch and a 5.8 inch both with dual
curved displays that would be a very
bold move that could give Samsung the
unique selling point it needs in order
to stand out from the crowd at the risk
of losing customers who dislike edge
screens now some of you may be hoping
for something more innovative more
edgier more risk taking on Samsung's
part but if our recent poll on this
article is an indication most of you
think the device that is rumored is
already fantastic let me know what you
think in the comments below now I gotta
say when it comes to finding creative
domain names the Indians are kicking
everyone's butt are there no Canadians
out there who come up with an Android
related domain name that makes me smile
that has not already been owned show us
the power of a dot-com and I'll send you
one of these because no domain name
extension tells your story with the same
degree of trust as a dot-com or dotnet
domain name.com and dotnet domain name
extensions inject credibility into your
online presence save 15% on domain names
and web hosting when you use our coupon
code android at domain.com check out
when you think domain names think
domain.com that's right you can put the
domain name in the comments below or
follow me on twitter and i will find it
don't forget about my brothers and
sister and Android who are working super
hard like super hard to view our source
