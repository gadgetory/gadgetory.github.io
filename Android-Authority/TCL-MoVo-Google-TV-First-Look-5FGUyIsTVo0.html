calm i'm here with Hannah from marvel to
talk about the TCL mofo Google TV device
thank you hi can you tell me a little
bit about the devices hardware how it
differentiates you know from from other
devices or is it the exact same specs
such as the new high sense pulse you
know what what uh what can we look for
in the device so you know marbella we
really believe in providing solutions
that are low cost of low power
consumption and high performance and the
Armada 1500 platform is a dual core ARM
based platform and it runs up to 1.2
gigahertz about 6,000 drive still MIPS
has an incredible post processing
technology integrated so that all your
upscaling and the rendering artifact
reduction is done all through the
Marvell pipeline the value-add and the
differences between maybe the previous
generation Google TV products that were
ARM based and we're able to provide that
low-cost high performance now compared
to the pulse is the the TCL product is
it the same same chipset from a moral
standpoint it's the same channel oh yes
the thing about Marvel is that we're
able to drive such a nice UI you know
with all these various graphics here so
as you can see we're showing version 3
of Google TV and the added feature is
the primetime application that used to
be the Google TV movies and apps yes yes
we also have the voice search available
through version 3 and you know a
different experience so in a lot more
content that's been added to the Play
Store as well now the remote control
that we had had a look at earlier it was
a lot thinner and a lot sleeker sexier
than current Google TV remotes right
right exactly and it's going to do
something with with gestures I believe
yeah there should be gesture enabled as
well as the voice search and voice
search great alright yeah thank you very
much Hannah this is Derek Ross signing
off with Android authority comm look for
a
full in-depth review on the TCL when it
launches sometime later this year thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
