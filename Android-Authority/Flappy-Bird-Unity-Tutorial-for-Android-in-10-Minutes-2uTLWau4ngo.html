highly inspiring one for any mobile
developer or any budding mobile
developer this is the story of an app
created by just a regular guy a 28 year
old guy called dong Yuen it was a very
simple app something that anyone could
really build but it just happened to be
in the right place at the right time and
he got really rich and famous from it so
this just goes to show you that you
don't need a huge budget you don't need
to be a coding genius you don't need a
massive publishing company behind you if
you have a relatively good game a simple
idea and you make it then there's a
chance that you can still be successful
thanks to the distribution platform that
is the Google Play Store and this really
would be an easy app for anyone to build
even if you're a complete beginner and
especially if you use a tool like unity
which just makes the whole process that
much simpler that much quicker so in
this video I'm gonna demonstrate that by
showing you how to make a flappy birds
game for Android in just 10 minutes
using unity you'll go from a completely
blank screen to a fully working game and
with just a few extra tweaks things like
a high score maybe a menu screen you'd
be able to release this on the Play
Store and who knows maybe make your own
millions actually remember me when
you're rolling in piles of cash of
course before we begin you are going to
need yourself a copy of unity and you
need to set that up with the Android SDK
I'll leave a link in the description
down below to show you how to do that
there's also going to be a link in the
description down below which will take
you to the post that goes with this
video that will share a lot more
detailed instruction all the source code
etc so if this is a little bit speedy
for you then go there and you can get
more detailed information and go at your
own pace so we have much time without
further ado let's get to it let's get to
it or to
okay so first you're going to create a
new project make sure it's a 2d project
and I'm dragging in some sprites here
into my scene that are ready-made if you
want to make sure the sprites the same
size as mine so you can follow along
exactly
then set the bird to be at position zero
zero and point five scale and set the
pipe there to four on the X&amp;amp;Y axis we're
going to copy that we're going to make
another one that's going to be upside
down like so I'm going to rename this
one pipe down
we're going to add a rigidbody to the
bird so select that and then inspector
so they've add component and I'm going
to add the constraint on the z-axis
that'll stop him from spinning around
and rotating now gonna add another
component that being a polygon Collider
that's his bound so he'll bump into
things and unity will know when he
touches something and we want to tag him
as a player this will help us to refer
to him later in the code drag the camera
onto the bird in the hierarchy there on
the left and that make sure that the
camera moves in relation to the bird now
we're going to add the same Collider
this time a box Collider to a pipe and
then to the other pipe we only need the
Collider there no physics necessary now
I'm making three new scripts in a folder
I've traded in the assets folder there
c-sharp scripts that's character pipe up
and pipe down so basically a script for
each of our three sprites we have open
up the character script first we're
going to make a public midget body 2d so
that is the the physics attached to our
character now I'll make a public float
that's a an accessible number that we
can change we're gonna make several of
these ones gonna be the move speed one
will be the flapping height and we can
change that later on you'll see we're
going to create a public game object for
the pipe up and another one for the pipe
down so that means we can access those
elements in our script so first we need
to tell unity where the rigid body is so
our B equals getcomponent and then
that's the rigidbody 2d we have attached
to our game object there okay and now in
the update method that's a method that's
called repeatedly with as the game
refresh
we're going to add some velocity to our
rigidbody the script the physics script
attached to the character so this is
going to keep the character moving
constantly to the right and we're
keeping the y-coordinate the same see I
say our PE bilasa T Y therefore the y
coordinate we're basically saying
whatever the Y velocity is keeping like
that okay now we're using an if
statement so that means that the
following code will only execute if this
statement in the brackets here is true
and we're saying that if the player
clicks the mouse button then we're going
to add some movement going upwards so
that's going to be a flapping motion now
a mouse button is translated as a screen
touch anywhere when you save this and
run it on Android okay now we're gonna
do another if statement and this time we
basically want to just detect when our
character goes too high or too low so
when they're out of bounds then we're
going to kill them because we don't want
to be able to fly over or below the
pipes that look strange and it's
cheating okay so now we're going to
create a new method and this one's going
to be called death and that's where
we're going to handle our player death
so yeah our method is any piece of code
you closed in curly brackets and you can
call it from anywhere else within your
script so we're saying public void death
void means that it's not returning any
data it's just performing a function and
public music can access it from other
scripts we're gonna remove all velocity
because we want to be stationary when
you respawn then we're just going to
literally move him by taking the
transform their transform being his
current position and setting it back to
zero zero now we're going back in here
we're going to add the component the
script to our player character change
these public variables here in the
inspector and then there you go so
that's why you make public floats like
that so you can change them from outside
of the script okay now you're going into
your pipe up script and I'm creating a
reference to our character object and
also to our other pipe up pipe down
object so again we need to tell unity
where to find those two the character is
going to look for an object with the
character script attached to it
we just added that component to our
character sprite then we're going to put
another if statement in the update to
method which remember happens repeatedly
every time the game's refreshed and
we're gonna say if the distance between
the character and the pipe is bigger
than 30 then what we're going to do is
we're going to destroy our pipe and
we're going to create a new one ahead of
us
so basically when the pipe goes off the
left of the screen because remember the
character keeps moving forwards we need
to disappear and we need a new pipe a
new challenge to appear in front of us
so now we're creating three random
variables and these are random numbers
and we want that because we want the
pipes been slightly different positions
each time so we're getting a position
for the X for the Y and for the gap the
distance between the two pipes the top
and the bottom one we want to make sure
that we move the pipe the correct
distance in front each time but also add
a little bit of an random element just
to keep things fresh and keep things fun
now we're going to instantiate meaning
create a new version of this game object
what is a game object with a small G
unity will assume you're referring to
this game object that the script is
attached to so we're creating this new
game object using a vector that's a
position and we're making it in front of
our character 30 spaces in front but at
the same time adding on that random
element and then we're keeping the
height accurate with a slight random
element as well I'm going to instantiate
the other pipe the pipe down that's why
we added that reference to the pipe down
up there at the top and the reason we're
doing that in this script rather than in
the pipe down own script is because
we've generated these random numbers and
this way we can make sure that they stay
aligned with each other without having
to do some you know do Hickory to make
sure that the distance stays the same
by sharing those random variables just
makes more sense to put it here you'll
see how it all works in a moment and
then we're going to destroy this game
object I want to create the new pipe
ahead when used to destroy the old one
who don't do that they're going to keep
popping up ahead and it will take up a
lot of memory ok now we're creating one
more method and this is going to be one
of the most useful methods you use a lot
in unity is the on collision enter 2d so
that means that when something touches
the collider this happens and we're
saying when the thing that touches it
has the tag player remember we added the
player tag to our character then we're
going to call that public method from
our character script called death
so we're saying character death that's
the great thing about public method that
means that you can call that bit of code
from other scripts attached to other
objects so add the component add the
script to the pipe up there same when
you did before add component scripts ok
click play and now each time you touch
that pipe you respawn it kills you great
now we need to do the same thing of
course for pipe down except we've
handled a lot of the code already and
pipe up so this is going to be a little
bit easier we just need to repeat a few
of those same steps we used before so
we've created a reference to our
character up there and we're gonna tell
unity where the character is we've done
this before find objects of type
character meaning it's looking for an
object with that character script
attached ok and then in the void update
remember the method that is repeatedly
called each time the game refreshes
we're saying that if the character is a
certain distance away from the pipe
again and then we're just going to
destroy the game object no need to be
spawn it because it's being respond at
the exact same time that the the upwards
one is being created and then we can
just copy that on collision enter script
from the other place from the other
script and there you go now creating a
new folder called prefabs make sure you
add that to the pipe down
sprite by the way a prefab is a
ready-made game object with all your
attributes and scripts attached so I've
deleted them from the scene and just put
them into my prefabs folder there now
you can see here in the pipe up script
in the inspector I have that option to
add my public game object and so I'm
putting in there that pipe down so that
means that the script will know where
pipe down is and it will be able to find
it and instantiate it and because doing
it from the prefab that means that it's
going to have all those important
attributes
attached as you can see it work there
nicely so now I'm just gonna add in one
more method called build level and this
is where we're going to instantiate the
first batch of pipes because you need to
make sure we've got a good few pipes up
there ahead so that they we're not gonna
have spaces so that they'll fill the
screen and if you use the same numbers
that I did in the same sprites then you
can just copy this fruit pause the
screen and copy out but play around with
way you want your pipes would be you can
add random positions to start with if
you want in the interest of good
housekeeping would also be a good idea
to destroy the pipes every time the
player dies you can add that in later on
but now when we press play because
that's in the character script they're
all going to be instantiated of course
we need to add those public objects from
the prefabs very important you as from
the prefab not from the scene now when
we click play those ones I've
instantiate it in my build level script
which is called at the start of the game
and also when the character dies we'll
be right here so for mine they're going
to be in the same position every time
and then as we go for they're going to
start disappearing and reappearing in
front of us and they go it works nicely
so that's my flappy bird game it's so
much fun I could do this for the days
you know I don't want it don't want it
to end really yeah there we go we've run
through that all quite quickly I realize
but you know slow it down when you need
to and hopefully you've got to grasp the
concepts if the only thing you don't
understand then click the link in the
description down below and I go through
in a bit more detail and explain things
like prefabs what they are they're just
a really useful way of creating a game
object with all the attributes already
attached and also it means if you change
an attribute on one it'll change those
qualities across every instance of that
object throughout your games you have to
make lots of changes people said last
time they want to see how you actually
create an apk how you make this into a
game that you can share let's do that
you just need to go into build settings
then you choose Android as your platform
and then you choose switch platform then
if you click player settings then I'll
open up in the inspector a whole bunch
of options where you can say things like
them the package name the version the
Android version you're targeting etc and
then you just hit build and run and it
will build it and one more thing you
need to do before hit building run is to
save your scene that's the level and
then add that to scenes in build so
there you go that's one way you can
create a nearly fully working flappy
bird game in just 10 minutes really was
pretty quick and simple there's not much
more you need to do to make that fully
functional and release it on the store
and who knows start getting some
downloads take the Fallas video useful
and interesting guys if you did then
