it's Josh of agar from Android authority
what's going on everybody and this is
the brand new LG g5 up against the Nexus
6p in this quick look metal is really
the name of the game here as we have
metal unibody designs across the board
here the LG g5 now brings a very
different design from previous
iterations especially you doing away
with the back button layout and also the
curved designs that used to permeate the
g4 and also the G flex line still it
feels quite nice in the hand mostly
because it is a bit of shrunken down
with the 5.3 inch display but in one
hand you are able to get from one side
to the other quite easily now in terms
of handling the Nexus 6p is a little bit
tougher to handle at one hand because
it's 5.7 inch screen makes it overall a
bit larger and it also has the
front-facing speakers which adds some
girth on the top and bottom as far as
design goes the Nexus 6p does have that
black bar on the top that houses a lot
of the bits and pieces including the
camera and on the LG g5 it still has the
camera on the back that has now two
lenses underneath that area the back
power button is basically where you
would put your finger for the
fingerprint reader and you just have to
press that button leave the finger on
there and you good to go but on the
Nexus 6p you still have that little bit
of design with the circular fingerprint
reader on the back that will trigger
when you do have your finger just laying
on that area in terms of display the
spec hungry will be pretty happy here
because both of these displays have quad
HD resolution despite some differences
in their size and construction the Nexus
6p has a 5.7 inch AMOLED screen so the
colors do pop out just that little bit
and everything has been incredibly fun
whether it be media gaming or text on
the LG g5 it's an IPS display which does
a pretty good job in broad daylight and
it is again quad HD resolution this time
at 5.3 inches in the screen now overall
handling might be the thing that makes
you go to the LG g5 because of its
slightly smaller overall body compared
to the Nexus 6p and part of that is
because of the smaller display now
performance is where we're going to find
the updates in the LG g5 because it
comes with these
dragon 820 backed by the adrenal 5:30
and four gigabytes of RAM on the other
hand the Nexus 6p is rocking v
Snapdragon 810 with the adrenal 430 and
three gigabytes of RAM now the spec
hungry will definitely go for the LG g5
but the Nexus 6p has been proving that
the Snapdragon 810 is still able to
provide really good performance
especially when backed by the Android
marshmallow stock edition that is found
in the Nexus hardware is really where
the LG g5 is going to pull ahead of a
lot of different phones but first we'll
talk about the Nexus 6p which does have
that fingerprint reader on the back and
now uses USB type-c for its connector to
do some very quick charging it does have
all of the different connections
underneath the surface so everything
that you need to do including NFC is
available and the battery comes in at
thirty four fifty mili amp hours which
has provided a lot of longevity for
about a day to two days worth of
moderate to heavy usage and even with
Android marshmallows does feature it is
able to sit down and just sip on the
power rather than let it just trickle
away the LG g5 on the other hand does
have the conventional internals but it's
battery is 2,800 milliamp hours which is
significantly less but of course we have
the modular design which might be able
to add even more milliamp hours to that
battery but it's when you pop out the
bottom panel and slide the battery out
that you can see the expandability
options of the g5 you can replace the
battery if you need more power and then
the battery that you remove can be
slotted into other modules which will
then add further functionality now the
example mainly that we had for you in a
future focus is the camera module which
is able to provide hardware buttons and
controls for the camera experience as
well as a grip and an expanded battery
at 1200 milliamp hours bringing the
grand total to 4000 expandability is
really where LG is trying to think
outside of the box where the general
smartphone seems to have stagnated now
we want to have even better
functionality by providing some extra
features in a bunch of different modules
that even third-party manufacturers are
going to make and LG has told us that
they are going to make it available so
that the experiences can be vastly
different depending on what it is you
want to add
speaking of the camera module we did use
it to take a look at the cameras of the
LG g5 and yes I said cameras because
there are the two lenses on the back
where one of them is the more
conventional 16 megapixel shooter with
an 8 megapixel shooter also available
that comes with a 135 degree field of
view now you are able to fairly
seamlessly move between the two when
you're zooming in and out on the
viewfinder so that you can provide even
more coverage in your picture rather
than having to really just move back
using the conventional lens it has all
of the different modes including manual
controls that you would expect from the
g4 and the v10 and really the finite
control makes it really easy to cater
the shot to what you need it to be but
even in the auto mode or even the simple
mode it still performs quite amicably
and has good laser autofocus speed on
the other hand laser autofocus is also
on the Nexus 6p but it's camera app is a
little bit different the picture quality
of the Nexus 6p has proven to be very
good in the past and continues to be so
even with these new phones coming out
but it's twelve point three megapixel
shooter does provide a lot of good
low-light performance because the pixels
happen to be of a larger size now we are
obviously going to put these two phones
in a camera shootout so make sure you
stay tuned for that when we get our
hands on an LG g5 review unit and really
pit the pictures against one another and
finally in software we have a bit of a
development here as the Nexus 6p does
have the stock Android iteration the
Android marshmallow that we all know and
love that includes everything from the
app drawer to the notification drop-down
Quick Settings and everything that stock
Android provides but the LG g5 with its
GUI has moved forward at least in their
eyes and has removed the app drawer
saying that under market research they
found that a lot of people found
elements of the app drawer to be
convoluted or confusing and a lot of
users are looking for a more streamlined
experience now whether or not you agree
with what LG has done with their
operating systems it seems that this
might actually become a trend in the
coming year so until then you can see
how LG has actually stripped away a lot
of the features from the GUI including
the Q slide and even the dual window
which we were not able to find in the g5
s software and it is feeling like these
- phones despite the app drawer being
that difference are actually a little
bit closer in terms of feature sets this
time around as the LG GUI has happened
to be quite saturated in the past it is
now a much more minimal experience and
so there you have it for this look at
the LG g5 and the Nexus 6p these are two
incredibly powerful phones from two
different ways of thinking the Nexus 6p
is the let's say bare-bones phone that
provides an sheer power with Android
marshmallow and all of the updates that
the Nexus will provide and it comes in a
sleek body as well the LG g5 changes
radically it's designed but does so in
the case of providing even more
functions because of its modular design
and we're excited to see where that
particularly goes for LG's flagship so
keep it tuned to Android Authority for
even more about the LG g5 and stay tuned
for the vs. and the camera shootouts
between these two once we get our hands
on proper LG g5 review units so keep it
tuned here because we are your source
