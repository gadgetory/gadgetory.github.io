voice deeper than you saying stepping to
the light at that moment you decided to
leave behind a dark and dreary life of
iPhone use and embrace the bright
colorful and free life of Android it's a
very wise choice hi I'm mark you're
watching the Android Authority Channel
after deciding to transfer from iPhone
to Android your next important question
might be how do I transfer my data and
files for most people it's a very hard
question because the two platforms are
substantially different in this video
I'll show you several ways to transfer
your data from iPhone to Android let's
begin with a very important set of phone
data your contacts for transferring your
iPhone contacts you can do it with the
help of iCloud first set up iCloud on
your iPhone go to settings tap iCloud
and log into your iCloud account make
sure that syncing is enabled for
contacts and that your iPhone is
connected to the internet so we can sync
your data to iCloud next open the web
browser on your computer and log into
your iCloud account open your contact
list by clicking on the contacts icon
highlight the contacts that you want to
export at the bottom left of the
contacts window click on the Actions
menu button select export vCard to
download your selected contacts and VCF
format save the file to your computer
now that you already have your contacts
in VCF format you can send the file to
your Android phone and import it into
your phone's people or contacts app or
you can upload this file to your Google
account using a browser I'll show you
how login to Google contacts on your web
browser scroll down to the bottom of the
left pane and click import contacts you
will see a dialog like this click the
choose file button and select the VCF
file that you downloaded earlier click
the import button to upload your iPhone
contacts to your Google account once the
upload is complete let your Android
phone sync the newly imported contacts
make sure your phone is connected to the
Internet
wasn't that easy
if you're a busy bee like me you'll
certainly have a lot of calendar events
stored on your iPhone you can move them
to Android in one go here's how it's
done first set up iCloud on your iPhone
to do that go the settings tap on iCloud
and enter your iCloud account
credentials to log in make sure that
syncing is enabled for calendars and
that your iPhone is connected to the
internet so it can sync your data to
iCloud with your calendar data already
in iCloud your next step is to export
your calendar entries into a file here's
how open your web browser on your
desktop computer and log into your
iCloud account click on the calendar
icon to see your calendars here on the
Left you'll see a list of your calendars
click the share' calendar button at the
right of the calendar to be exported
you'll see a pop up like this place a
check in the box for public calendar
highlight the link that appears below it
and copy the link next open a new
browser tab then paste the copied link
but don't hit the enter key just yet
first replace the word web Cal with HTTP
then hit the enter key your browser will
start downloading a file with a long
file name made up of random characters
save the file to your computer you can
give it a shorter name like calendar ICS
if you like now you can import your
calendar to your Google Calendar account

earlier from the drop down list below

sync your new calendar entries make sure

successfully imported yep
