Andrew authority now Google recently
announced a new IOT operating system
called Android things and the idea is
that we replace our existing instead of
things operating system called brillo
and this time more emphasizing the
compatibility with Android well i've
downloaded it i've been using on a
Raspberry Pi 3 and I've discovered how
it all works so if you want to know what
is Android things please let me explain
so first I kind of look what is in set
of things now it's basically any device
it's connected to the Internet and it's
performing a job or a function for us
now while smartphones and laptops are
key to the Internet they kind of connect
to the internet because we're using them
as tools but an IOT device is something
that's more autonomous it stays on its
own doing data gathering and doing tasks
that we've assigned to do without very
much human interaction so take the
example of a weather station maybe it
out in a field somewhere and it's taking
different sensor readings and it's
sending those back up into the cloud for
analysis now that doesn't just mean
weather stations we can talk about home
automation we can talk about home
security we can talk about smart cities
we can talk about sort of factories and
power plants and all these kind of
things that have kind of autonomous
aspects to them and they're using the
Internet to send up the data to monitor
what's going on so it's really it's
sensors that are then sending up data
into the cloud where we then analyze the
information now of course we haven't
really even come to fully understand all
the different areas of which this idea
of connected devices can work in our in
our live streetlamps cars fridges
refrigerators you know everything we can
think of can be connects to the Internet
if it can do a useful task now to build
those products there has to be a element
of computing power inside those devices
so that's why you need a computer a chip
and you need an operating system and it
needs to have internet connectivity so
Google have released Android things with
the idea that they are going to want
would you use the technology built on
Android the knowledge they have of
androids and always they have of Java to
build IOT devices now of course it has
to have a hardware component because it
talked about devices here and what
Google dinah they've supported three
boards from the start and there are more
boards coming on the way and those three
boards are the Intel Edison which
obviously an Intel x86 chip we've got
the X nxp Pico which is an arm cortex a7
based chip and we've got the Raspberry
Pi 3 which uses a quad-core cortex a53
chip at 64-bit so as you can see here
we've got support for Intel processors
and for ARM processors we've got 32-bit
support and 64-bit support all the
devices come with at least half a
gigabyte of memory and we're running at
500 megahertz or 1 gigahertz now that's
quite different to the other types of
IOT kits that we have which are ones
that are running on microcontrollers now
microcontrollers run at very different
speeds I run that maybe only 96
megahertz or forty eight megahertz they
might only have maybe a 256 K of RAM 128
K or Ram a very very very much smaller
power requirement much smaller hardware
requirements now Android things can't
run on those because I hang droid is of
course based on Linux and Linux is a
full multitasking operating system with
virtual memory support which means you
need a complicated MMU memory management
unit and you only find those in things
like the cortex a series and Intel's x86
series now this option to go with
Android rather than with a
microcontroller type of design could be
a great benefit because we have such
great powerful computers in our IOT
devices maybe things like voice
recognition and maybe facial recognition
and maybe kind of picture detection and
some level of AI could happen in the IOT
devices which would be very useful
because we have such power there but at
the same time it does raise the full of
the entry level do I really need a chord
core sort of one gigahertz processor in
my fridge so you know there is this kind
of disk
you know Googler specifically aiming for
one type part of the market with Android
things and it's missing out on a whole
other part of the market now whether
that's a good idea or a bad idea only
time will tell so I'm using a Raspberry
Pi 3 which really is a good idea that
Google support is because it really is a
very popular board I wouldn't even know
where to buy an Intel Edison board but
Raspberry Pi I think I've got like five
of them here in my house so they really
are the most popular platform for this
kind of thing and so the way it works is
issue download the image for the
Raspberry Pi you copied onto an SD card
you boot up the ACE they rise with pie
with that SD card and you're instantly
into Android things now during the boot
up process you kind of see at the
beginning a few lines of boot up
information kind of reminiscent to a
kind of a Linux machine booting up then
after a few seconds you get the splash
screen which shows you Android things
booting up with a kind of a small moving
dots just to show that things are
working and they'll find at the end you
just get the Android thing screen comes
up which does nothing there's no user
interface it's just this is made to be a
disguised loan device it just sits there
and tells you whether it has Internet
connectivity or not that's all that's
all it does but the real power comes
when you start developing apps for it
now to develop apps you need to use
Android studio at least Android studio
2.2 and your SDK needs to be at least at
the level API level 24 so that's kind of
Android seven now once you have that you
can then start using Android things and
you can build an app in a very similar
way to you build an Android app you've
got the normal things as a manifest file
there's resource files for the layout
written in XML there's Java code in
there and very similar to the way you'd
write an Android app you right now
Android things up and then once it's
built you connect over the Ethernet to
the board when you've set that before
using ADB you can kind of connect to it
through Ethernet or through Wi-Fi and
then you connect to that board and it
can upload flashes the app onto your
board now once an app has been flashed
on there whenever you reboot it it
reboots directly into that app now there
are two types of
Android things applications there are
those with displays and there are those
without displays now the with display
ones basically work in a very similar
way to Android apps you've got the
normal layout that you do inside of
Android studio you've got the same UI
toolkit you get in Android and you can
build divider apps that run on these
devices with a screen but there's a few
differences no status bar at the top
there's no buttons at on-screen buttons
to go back and forth you just get the
whole real estate is occupied by your
app and of course that's going to be
useful for maybe types of kiosks for
some types of products that have
touchscreens people are going to want to
be able to run this kind of user
interface on their IOT device but there
are gonna be lots of IOT devices that
don't need a display at all and so and
Ruthie's caters for that as well you can
write a device an app store that has no
display whatsoever but it does network
things it collects sensor data it sends
them up to the cloud and all of the
stuff you get inside of Android all of
the access to the Google cloud services
you can get with an Android things app
that doesn't have a display but of
course the one big difference between an
Android smartphone and an Android things
board is that we also have access to the
hardware now that means access to things
like the different general purpose input
output pins and also two other types of
butters and technologies including I
squared C including SPI including serial
port and those are all available inside
of Android things if you want to do
pulse code modulation to control a servo
then Android things knows how to do that
already if you want talk to I squared C
to a particular device maybe to an LCD
screen then it or Android things only
knows how to do that if you want to talk
spi to some non-volatile memory then
Android thing to already knows how to do
that so they've built in all that
hardware support the lowest level of
hardware so you can talk to sensors and
accelerometers and GPS units and all
these kind of things and build an IOT
product that is able to do complicated
and useful things including cameras of
course and that leads to the whole
possibility of things like facial
recognition
and our object recognition and computer
vision in general so let me just show
you a quick demo of what Android things
can do this is a demo that Google
provide it shows us how to make a simple
user interface and it also shows us how
Android things can talk to hardware in
this case an LED which we're going to
make a switch on and off so the device
has now booted up and here is this
simple demo from Google it shows a
picture of a ball in the middle of the
screen over on the right hand side there
little switches that allow you to turn
the different GPIO pins on and off now
the LED i've got connected is connected
to GPIO 21 and over here we can see we
got a mouse you can use a touchscreen as
well if you've got touchscreen Hardware
connect it up to a board and if I click
here you can see that the LED comes on
we click it goes off ticket goes on
piggy goes off and of course I could
have many LEDs many different inputs and
outputs here but I can control manually
so this is showing us a graphical UI
with Android things and control of
hardware directly with Android things
now at the moment this is a Developer
Preview
that there is running on the Raspberry
Pi and the other board and it really is
a preview because there are some big
holes in Google's vision for Android
things the first and most obvious
biggest hold is there's no deployment
mechanism at the moment what I mean by
that at the moment if you want to talk
to the board you have to set things up
using ADB you have to connect the board
and then you kind of flash things over
and then ADB kind of some type of
disconnect and there's a whole problem I
found with it kind of disconnecting
after a few minutes and if you want to
set up Wi-Fi you kind of type in this
complicated command which for a delta
belapur is not so bad but for a user
will never would never work at all for
them to kind of kind of get the Wi-Fi
connection up and running now Google
need to have a deployment system either
means a generic app that can work with
all internecine boards that they just
say here's our Internet of Things can
control app and you kind of find your
device and you can kind of do lots of
things with a nice user interface on
your mobile phone or they need to
release the source code for a generic
app that people can tailor for their
particular intent of a think device
because at the moment
no way of handling that process at all
you can't actually ship a product yet
that's usable by a consumer at the at
the end level the other problem is that
Google really have set the system
requirement quite high by opting for
kind of Android and Linux and a
complicated CPU they really have set the
entry level higher than maybe some IOT
developers would like we're talking like
half a gigabyte of RAM here and that's
that's that cost money we're talking
about complicated processor that cost
money much much different to the prices
of the low-end microcontroller board now
with that the right decision or not
we'll find out in the future Google are
really betting that the technology of
Android and the people's knowledge of
Android developers knowledge of of Java
will be the key selling point that
people so I can take that same
experience in fact it takes on the same
code that I've already got and I can use
it directly in my new IOT product and
their banking that really is the way
people are going to think I'm not sure
that's going to be true but time will be
the judge of that
