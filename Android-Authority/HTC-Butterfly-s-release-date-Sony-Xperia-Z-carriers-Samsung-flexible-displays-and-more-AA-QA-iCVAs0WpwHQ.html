Chris look you ask we answer its android
authority QA for jun 26 2013 ryan asks
when is the HTC butterfly s release date
and will it be coming to any US carriers
to answer the first question the
butterfly s will be released in some
markets in asia sometime in july for the
u.s. well we don't know yet a we don't
know if the butterfly s will be coming
to the u.s. at all and be we don't know
if like the HTC droid DNA it'll show up
with a different name and a slightly
different set up Gabriel asks will the
Sony Xperia Z come to more carriers than
just t-mobile well so far the only
confirmed carrier is t-mobile whether or
not it comes to other carriers will
probably depend a lot on how popular it
is if it starts selling really well you
can be sure another carrier will
probably pick it up at some point but
who will pick it up is another story
another gsm carrier is probably your
best bet as then sony wouldn't have to
do any extra work like it would with the
CDMA carrier like verizon or sprint
Kanaan asks well the samsung galaxy s5
be released with a flexible Oh LED
display in the near future well right
now the only answer we can give is maybe
Samsung did show off a phone with a
flexible display at CES 2013 and LG has
said they have a phone with a flexible
display coming later this year whether
or not they'll actually meet these
projections and ship the displays on
time is another thing entirely so
basically it really depends on what your
definition of near future is Emilio asks
how can I have something like HTC
blinkfeed on my galaxy s3 while it's not
exactly like blinkfeed there is an app
called Soho in the google play store
that does something pretty similar it
pulls data from various social
networking services and puts them on
your home stream the rating in the Play
Store is only 3.8 stars so it seems like
people either love it or hate it but hey
it's free so it's worth a try Marty says
I live in a rural area
use verizon once the HTC one is released
on verizon which phone will have better
reception the HTC one or the samsung
galaxy s4 that should actually be at i
see both phone views the qualcomm
snapdragon 600 chipset which in addition
to providing the cpu and GPU also
provides the cellular radios for both
phones while differences in body design
and antenna design can change the
characteristics neither of these should
affect the phone so much that it should
be a deal-breaker for either phone
basically just pick which one you like
best rwanda asks is there a way to
connect both the keyboard and a mouse to
an android device i've already tried a
USB on-the-go cable but it has only one
slot so i can only connect one thing at
a time while yes there actually is a way
and it's pretty easy all you need is a
USB hub and to be safe you want to go
for a powered one then you can plug in
as many devices as the hub has ports and
you should be good to go and that's
about it for this week folks we have a
written companion to this video that has
all the links and everything you might
need at android authority calm you can
