reporting live from android authority
we're here at CES in Las Vegas 2015 and
we're with a very special man the
creator and brains behind the yotaphone
to that we recently reviewed we're here
with Vlad Martin off he's the CEO of
yotaphone yota devices and I'm here to
talk about the yotaphone too hello sir
yes hello how are you today very good
good so tell us about what it took to
build the yotaphone tomb oh that's will
be a long story i should say free we are
free years old company startup and three
years ago we was like very lack of
knowledge about smartphone business we
didn't have any supply chain and any
partners component suppliers but we have
a great idea and the passion to bring it
to the tunic market so basically we
start entertaining this idea with
suppliers with investors and with
different partners and slowly we managed
to convince quite big guys like Qualcomm
like ink and a few others to support us
and start innovating together with us
and providing us with certain critical
components so it was not an easy task
but we overcame this challenge and right
now we have pretty good and pretty
successful supply chain and the
technological partnership with with the
big brands leading technological
companies so that was not easy but it
was fun yeah well having had reviewed it
we think that it's absolutely incredible
piece of technology it's interesting to
see you know you are dealing with
something innovative when you have in
your hands and you're touching an
experience in and you have that aha
you're like why didn't no one think of
this before so you had the courage and
I'm to go and have realized your
ambitions for the vision so I have a
couple of tough questions through you
don't know mine so I Inc is a wonderful
technology so power fishing you can do
so much with it and the fact you made a
touch capacitive is wonderful too would
you ever consider the possibility of
making a tablet with an ink display on
the rear with we did assessment of the
business case and realize that the most
compelling value proposition for
consumers will be if it's a smartphone
or at least public because one of the
key five unique user cases and value for
consumers is the power consumptions and
yota we call it your to energy where
your phone yotaphone can last up to two
days on a single charge and all basic
smartphone functions available for
consumer for the yotaphone user but with
tablet where he's a big size screen and
a lot of space for the battery the power
consumption become less an issue so the
value and opportunity to justify extra
cost for the second display is getting
class so that's why we decided to call
to put on hold this project at this
point of time but one more comment like
people would prefer to have one device
exactly instead of multiple devices and
the only device which people carry with
them ninety percent of the time it's a
phone it's not like tablets is not eread
that it's not something else so that's
why I think
we want to excel the yotaphone concept
with a smartphone first and then to see
where we can bring it keeping consumer
in our mind is a the core fundamental
kind of part of our business in our
development so we want to solve specific
consumer problems not just to launch the
product for the sake of the product of
course so in terms of your ambition and
your dream your vision to create the
other phone how close do you feel you
are to creating the perfect device in
your mind well it's definitely yotaphone
to is a huge step a compared to your
phone one because if you remember you're
the fun one was a proof of concept was
we mentioned like we manufacture limited
number of units and we distributed only
to early adopters who really wanted so
basically the idea was to get feedback
from those people what needs to be done
with this concept so it will appeal to
mass market yes to the mainstream
consumers so we've got a lot of ideas
one hundred and hundreds of ideas what
needs to be done and we integrated and
incorporated a lot of them into
yotaphone too so the yotaphone tooth
from our perspective is amazing a high
quality product which we've always on
display in unique features which is very
user-friendly and intuitive for the
mainstream consumers so from this
perspective it's a great product of
course there is always a way to improve
but and we're going to add more and more
applications more animal widget more and
more different services and content
always on display for example we close
the partner we reach agreement with
Twitter to develop a specific kind of
social media dashboard for the ink
display following this play smart
because when people start thinking it's
always on it doesn't consume much power
or we can do this and that for people
who like to use Twitter or like to use
certain applications beyond that what
would you like to see potentially on a
urine phone three have you seen the new
ink technology that they talked about a
CS yeah we definitely tracking
technology and many other low power
consumption technologies of course we
are thinking about improving the refresh
rate
and probably at certain point of time to
add one more color but I think what is
currently for this year the highest
priority to bring more applications more
content more services yeah to make
always on display so valuable for
consumers so there is no doubt this is
this is really new way to interact with
smartphone exactly this is revolutionary
new way which is much better for
consumers so that's how we keep focus
and of course you know that we do have
SDK yes but we gained we didn't push too
much we hear the phone one because we
were very cautious with what we do with
your toe phone one because of proof of
concept idea but now when we have a
mass-market product you will see first
of all next version of SDK and you will
see that we invest more in creating
ecosystem exactly of developers for
always on display for your phone
fantastic for the last two years I mean
again we came up from Russia three years
ago with this idea it was so difficult
to change the mindset of the key
suppliers of key industry players of
consumers but only because the support
of Android communities developers
industry experts I mean bloggers the
people like you and people who who are
really interested to see innovation
interruptive innovations which make user
experience better more convenient only
with you I mean with your support we
make it we make it through we overcame
quite a lot of challenges and right now
will we are we have a tremendous
positive reception yet of your two front
two in 20 countries we start sales one
month ago yeah in most of European
countries in the Middle East in Hong
Kong in Russia in Eastern Europe and so
far the sales is amazing selling out
yeah great and
and I think again because the product is
is great incredibly compelling and the
substantial part of this result is of
course your contribution your support
and your ideas and the fact we finally
convinced the big brands to work with us
and support us in this challenging
project in that regard I want to say let
yotaphone know how they can make their
products better why you would like to do
with the ink display and I want to say a
huge thank you you know thank you and
thank you to all of you thank you it's
my pleasure sir start slack away from
Android is already reporting live from
CS here with your phone to signing off
