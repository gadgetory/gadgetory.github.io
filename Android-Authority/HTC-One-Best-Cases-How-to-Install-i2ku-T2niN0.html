here with the one and only and read
authority calm and today I'm showing you
the best cases for the HTC One
now before we check out our cases I'm
gonna say that I'm using the zag
invisible shield full body protector and
I'm doing that because many viewers
would like to know if full body
protection and screen savers fit under
most of these cases so without further
ado let's check out our first case the
first case we're checking out today is
the speck CandyShell grip and I really
enjoyed using this on the samsung galaxy
s4 so I was excited to slip it on the
HTC One and try it out what makes this
so special is the raised rubber edges
around the front which provide grip for
the front of the screen and then the
four sections on the back would provide
maximum grip in the palm of your hand
the CandyShell grip also offers raised
rubberized buttons for your volume which
really makes the HTC One easy to use it
also has a nice cutout for the power
button and the headphone slot as well as
the charging port and the mic on the
bottom of the device now I really like
the raised rubberized edges on these
sides and the volume key because the HTC
one's volume keys are pretty hard to
press in my opinion and we have a nice
cutout for the camera on the back to
install the speck CandyShell grip simply
grab your HTC One and slide it in from
the top or bottom and then press it down
so it fits into your case the CandyShell
grip is available in four different
colors and it's priced at 3499 the
lineup is the speck CandyShell and
unlike the CandyShell grip it doesn't
have any rubberized grip on the back and
sides it's available in three high gloss
finishes and it's still 3495 so some
customers might find themselves wanting
to get the grip instead now the candy
shell has a very nice glossy finish and
as you can see it protects the sides
bottom top and back very well now I've
used this case for about one day total
and I sustained some pretty big
scratches in the high gloss finish
nonetheless it's very protective case
and it has raised volume buttons that
are very easy to press making the HTC
one very usable we also have cutouts for
our camera and all of our ports
including the charging port but we don't
have a cut out for our mic the case is
very tight especially with my sag
invisible shield invisible shield
installed and it works
very nicely to install the candy shell
just like the CandyShell grip you want
to insert your HTC one from either the
top or bottom and then press the phone
firmly into the case make sure your case
is tight around the bezel of your device
and you're ready to rock next up we're
checking out our case-mate tough case
now the tough case is very very strong
and provides dual-layer protection
against slips and falls by having a hard
shell back and a soft rubber interior
the hard shell back features a nice
texture and the masaf rubber interior is
very malleable for easy installation the
casemates up case is a joy to use
because not only is the hard textured
back protective it's also soft and
comfortable in the hand now it also
features soft rubberized volume buttons
which make using the HDC one easy and it
has the key cutouts for the volume
headphones and a nice cutout for the
camera including the LED we have cutouts
on the bottom for the mic and the
charging part in a nice case mate logo
near there we also have case mate
branded on the side and the textured
sides back in top the casemates tough
case is available for $31.99 and comes
in any color you want as long as it's
black
to install the HTC one into the tough
case grab the soft rubber interior and
fit it around the bezel of the HTC One
then simply slide that in to be full
assembly with the hard shell backing
making sure your bezel is on tight and
you're ready to go
next up is our HDC official hardshell
with cover case and this has to be my
favorite case out of the entire lineup
it's made out of awesome material with a
great color scheme and features a media
stand for viewing media easily it also
supports the dual speaker experience of
HTC one with Beats Audio
includes two speaker cutouts for the top
and bottom as well as cutouts for the
LED but no protection on the sides or
raised rubber edges for the volume
buttons our midea stand is made out of a
nice red velvet and flips downwards for
you to set your HTC one up to view media
simple as that now the flip of the lid
is going to protect your HTC One against
any facedown falls but with the zag
invisible shield full body protection
installed it does not fit too tightly
nonetheless I still love it the media
stand is great and it provides easy
access for all the buttons on the HTC
One to enhance your media experience it
also features rubberized corners in case
the HTC One is to fall installation is
extremely easy even with the zag
invisible shield just pop the HTC One in
the cutout and you are ready to rock the
HTC hardshell with cover case is
available for only twenty two
ninety-nine which is a very very nice
price point for the selection of cases
we have the next case up is another HTC
official product this is the hardshell
case with smart protection for the HTC
One now this is a very awesome case and
it's very very usable except for it does
not facilitate the use of a full body
protector such as a SAG invisible shield
I do remove the back protection of my
sag invisible shield to get the case
installed perfectly nonetheless this is
an awesome case it features grilles on
the top and bottom to provide access to
the speakers so you have the full media
experience of the HTC One and it feels
great in your hand now the volume keys
are flush with the body and I found it
kind of hard to press them because
they're not a rubberized button that
sticks up in the air but nonetheless it
still works great and feels great in the
hand we have cutouts for our power
button headphone jack we also have
cutouts for the camera and LED and the
charger as well as the mic on the bottom
now it's made out of a hard shell
material so it's gonna protect against
any Falls and has a somewhat deep bezel
on top to install the hard shell start
with the top or bottom of the case and
then slide the middle on it doesn't
matter if you use the top first at the
bottom just lock the middle into place
and then slide the other existing piece
on the hard shell is available for 2299
just like the flip cover and it's up to
you to decide which one you would like
to rock on your
dc1 now we're taking a look at our
Trident Aegis series case it's a tough
case with style has put my Trident
simply and I would have to agree with
them
it features dual layers of protection
including a party polycarbonate
hardshell exterior and a soft silicone
interior to protect your HTC One from
shock on the back near a polycarbonate
we have our Trident logo and as you can
see our soft rubber ism is on the sides
and the corners to protect against shock
and impact there's also a nice rubber
bezel around the edge and there's also
dust protection for the charger and
headphone slots so you can see they're
very easy to open and they secure
tightly to prevent dust from getting in
it's also a nice cutout for the camera
and LED section
there are raised rubber volume buttons
which allow the HTC one to be easily
used when viewing media are listening to
music and the aegis is available in
three colors for a price of $27.99
installing the Aegis is simple
grab your HTC One and slide it into the
soft rubber shock absorbing part of the
Aegis and then simply slide that into
the hardshell exterior snap it in around
the bezel and then make sure that your
dust protection for the headphone and
charging ports are outside of the
hardshell exterior it may take a second
to get them there but once you do you'll
know it because it'll have a tight fit
that fits perfectly on the HTC One I was
able to install it with the zag
invisible shield completely uninstalled
as well our second to last case is the
ever reliable OtterBox Commuter for the
HTC One I've been a fan of OtterBox for
as long as I can remember and over the
years they've only improved in their
build quality and design the Commuter
for the HTC one features dual layer
protection in the form of a soft rubber
interior and then a hardshell exterior
much like the Tri Negus now on the back
we have our hard exterior with our
OtterBox branding on the bottom and then
all four color corners are rubberized to
prevent damage when falling on the
corner of the device
it also has a nice deep-dish bezel and
the volume keys are extremely easy to
access
we have cutouts for our camera our
charging port our power button and then
we have dust protectors for our
headphone jack and our bottom charging
port the dust protectors are very nice
and they're easy to fit inside of the
HTC One the deep dish bezel is also
going to protect against any facedown
damage and it comes with a screen
protector to install your HTC One in the
OtterBox Commuter simply grab the phone
and slide it from the top or bottom into
the soft rubber interior you want to
make sure that the rubber interior is
fully gripping the bezel of the device I
was able to do it with my sag invincible
shield on top then you'll line up one of
your dust protectors and clip on the
hard exterior making sure the dust
protectors are fully functional and they
can flap freely open and closed do that
for the top and bottom dust protector
and you are ready to go do a final
inspection of the bezel as well to make
sure that it's not slipping off in any
point and then you're easily ready to
use your HTC One the final case in our
video will be the OtterBox Defender for
the HTC One and I've saved this one for
last because hands down it offers the
most protection for the device as you
can see I have it installed on the top
of the device and with my sag invisible
shield there's a bit of bubbling under
the screen protector included in the
OtterBox Defender nonetheless I'll show
you the installation without that
shortly on the back we have our OtterBox
branding on the third layer of
protection we also have a nice deep dish
around the camera so if it falls on its
back the camera is not going to be
shattered we have dust protectors much
like the commuter series on the top and
bottom for the headphone jack and the
charging ports which open very easily
and then shut just as well we have a
nice deep dish on the top of the device
and the front so if it has any
front-facing Falls it will hopefully
minimize any damage caused by protruding
rocks or landscape our volume buttons
are very easy to press with the defender
because of our hard buttons and our
raised edges and the power button has a
nice cutout so it is safe from any
damage you can make quick installation
of the HTC One by grabbing the bottom
shell of the defender with the shock
absorbing foam followed by the included
protector and deep dish top bezel
snapping those two together and then
simply grab your third piece and line it
up making sure the bezel is fully folded
around the edge of the hard shell now
I'm doing this in real time so you can
see how simple and easy it is and quick
to install the OtterBox Defender I have
it fully installed and all of our dust
protectors are fully functional and our
screen looks very nice because I do not
have the zag invisible shield installed
under the included protector now the
included protector has a little bit of
play and you will get a little bit of a
squishy feedback but it still works very
nicely and you won't have to buy Zack
the defender series also features a very
usable belt clip which is very durable
and also protects the phone from the
back it has a swiveling clip to allow
you to clip it to your belt and use your
defender in harsh conditions the
defender is available in four different
colors and retails for $50 making it our
most expensive case out of the bunch in
conclusion I would have to say that my
personal favorites are the OtterBox
series as well as the HTC official
series the OtterBox series offer maximum
protection and have a pretty nice price
point and the HTC official series offer
the most usability of the phone as
they're tailored directly from the
company to fit this device I also want
to extend a huge shout out to mobile
phone comm for providing us with all of
the cases for this video please check
them out guys
