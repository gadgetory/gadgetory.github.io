from android authority calm and today's
review is for die for metal as the name
implies you will be dying often for
metal it's available in the Google Play
Store for a very metal price of a dollar
10 the menu of the game is really simple
there is a high score button at the
bottom left next to it is a soundtrack
where you can listen to the music from
the game the play button more games from
the developer and finally the credits
once you're in the game the
ridiculousness starts the only controls
are to move left and right and jump you
can double jump and wall jump the
premises that you have to avoid traps to
make it to the end of each level to get
one step closer to joining an epic metal
band it's really not that easy there are
traps everywhere and touching them will
kill you in one shot spikes projectiles
falling platforms and all sorts of other
obstacles work together to block your
path to the end of the levels when you
get to the end you get a score based on
how quickly you completed the level the
faster you do it the higher score you
get it's important to note that you will
die quite often the game developers
specifically say that the game keeps a
death tally to troll you so you can brag
to your friends about how many times you
died for metal all-metal puffery aside
the game is quite fun to play and we
gave it a gameplay value of 4 out of 5
stars simply put the graphics in this
game are ridiculous when you die you
explode every time the main character
has a very creepy metal tastic smile on
his face constantly it's a little
unnerving but it adds to the feel of the
game the levels themselves are darkened
totally metal that said all the levels
are also designed around the same kind
of elements which can get boring to look
at after a while the soundtrack is if
you hadn't guessed an all metal
soundtrack if you like metal you're
going to like playing this game very
loudly if not you can still enjoy it if
you play it on mute really though the
game was designed around its metal
soundtrack the sound is awesome if
you're into that sort of thing and the
graphics aren't wonderful but they get
the point across so we gave graphics to
score of 3 out of 5 stars this is
another one of those games with a star
system you complete a level and you get
one two or three stars so immediately
players have a reason to go back and
play levels again to get the three-star
rating if that isn't enough levels get
pretty hard so you'll be playing them
over and over again anyway there's also
a high score list so if you want to play
with your friends and have
challenger score it's totally possible
if you happen to enjoy the soundtrack
you can open the app and listen to it
without actually playing the game much
like how people watch the show
metalocalypse just to listen to Dethklok
music other than that though there
really isn't a reason to come back to
play the game after it's been beaten
once there are a few reasons to go back
to the app to play more but they're not
all great reasons so we gave replay
value a 3.5 out of 5 stars if you're a
fan of ridiculous games then you don't
have a lot of fun with die for metal
it's goofy the graphics and music give
it a certain absurd charm and it's
totally metal not all games glorify the
fact that it kills you repeatedly on the
other hand it is a goofy and absurd game
so it won't be for everyone if you hate
metal music you will probably hate this
game if you love metal music but hate
these kind of games you'll still
probably enjoy the game at least a
little bit the theme of the game made
overall value difficult to judge because
music tastes vary so widely and the
music is such a huge factor in this game
however the game itself is quite fun and
entertaining if your music taste doesn't
ruin it for you when it's all added up
we gave die for metal of value of 4 out
of 5 stars if you can handle the metal
themes in music it's definitely worth
the buck 10 once again I'm Joe Hindy
