device that undercuts the flagship mate
line however the line between the two
has gradually gotten blurred in previous
generations does this new P series
device bring its own flavor on top of
features that we may have seen any
previous may 9 well it's time to find
out because it's Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody and this is our
review of the Huawei P 10 and P 10 plus
now remember to head on over to the
Android 30.com full written review to
not only take a look at my opinions but
also the opinions of our senior editor
Chris Karlin who was able to take the P
10 to places like the Geneva Auto Show
and this review written and in the video
section we are going to have both of our
opinions be represented the P 10 devices
are still pretty reminiscent of the
previous P 9 and other metal
construction phones in the P series they
have smooth sides and corners and all
the buttons are on the right side
including a subtle but very effective
color accent that goes around the power
button it's something that we really
enjoy the phone is also pretty thin
making it pretty easy to grip while
remaining attractively slim now I hardly
ever take the stance that any Android
device looks like an iPhone but I
literally felt like it when it came to
the regular P 10 because of its slim
profile and its overall size I got the
feeling that it was like an iPhone 7
when holding it and now this is not
really a big deal but I thought it was
something that it was worthy of mention
a small panel on the top when it comes
to the backing houses the dual sensor
system which does change in combination
depending on which Edition is used below
that however is the potential for a
couple of new colors our P 10 unit has
the new dazzling blue color we don't
have the greenery edition but also
there's another little quirk about the
vacuum that we found kind of enjoyable
the only real feature to take note of on
the front is the capacitive key below
the screen that is not only where the
fingerprint sensor is but there's also
what you can use in place of the soft
keys you can press it to go back hold it
to hit home or swipe left and right in
order to open up the recent map screen
it is pretty ingenious we admit but not
only did it take a while to get used to
the recent apps a gesture in particular
wasn't as reliable as the soft key
so overall the p10 the regular one is
the easier to use device mostly because
of its size
however the p10 plus does have more
screen real estate the design benefits
mainly from the new colors otherwise
there are few frills to speak of in
these tried-and-true metal builds the
screens do change between the two
devices and not just in size the p10 5.1
inch display has 1080p resolution while
the plusses 5.5 inch screen boasts 2k
resolution now these are IPS screens and
we give huawei some credit for claiming
that these screens will get up to 600
nits in brightness which is pretty dang
bright and in our testing we found that
to pretty much be the case as far as the
colors ago they do tend to the cooler
side of the color spectrum but that's
not that big of a deal when you can
customize them in two settings which
brings us to performance and underneath
all that surface we have the ki-rin 960
and the mali g71 MP 8 graphics
benchmarks put both of these phones
pretty high up on the food chain which
is not that big of a surprise and our p
10 plus gets the bump up to 6 gigabytes
of RAM and 128 gigabytes of on-board
storage now I play plenty of games on
the P 10 plus in particular including a
rather intensive port of jade Empire and
with hours of gameplay under my belt I
didn't find any real hiccups with the
game performance and the same goes for
all general app usage and also getting
through the interface of emui it is
important to note however that higher
resolutions and the Plus model make it
work a bit harder under heavy graphical
load this is really only mentionable
because of the graphics benchmarks which
favor the 1080p resolution P 10 over the
P 10 plus now aside from the capacitive
key that we have already covered there
are no real big additions in the
hardware all network connections are
possible including NFC and I use the P
10 Plus on the t-mobile network without
any issues when it came to speed on the
mobile network or call quality our
initial test using the Android authority
battery testing app showed that B screen
on time could get up to 5 hours and in
my actual daily usage of the P 10 plus I
found that to be the case with general
usage ranging from Jade Empire gameplay
to YouTube viewing to a lot of music
playing and even GPS navigation from
time to time I found the five hours of
screen on time to pretty much be the
case charging up the phone is also a
breeze especially if you use the
included break and cable now you'll be
able to get from zero to 50 percent in
about how
an hour which is awesome however you're
going to get slower speeds if you use
other cables and chargers however I did
really find that to be too much of an
issue especially when using qc3 charger
adapters a regular 12 megapixel camera
at F 2.2 aperture is backed by a 20
megapixel monochrome sensor and that's
in the case of the regular P 10 the P 10
plus gets a aperture bump to F 1.8 but
before we talk about the main camera
let's talk about the selfie or
front-facing camera and 8 megapixel F
1.9 aperture shooter helps to get better
low-light shots and is backed by what is
pretty much only considered a powerful
selfie mode that is a little bit
uncomfortable in terms of its
customization the perfect selfie mode
requires users to look in a few
different directions so it can take
control of things like your eyes and
even your jawline you can take a look
here at the original photo and then what
it looks like at five level and then
full on at ten level you can almost
barely recognize me otherwise pictures
on the front facing camera and indeed
the main camera benefit from a standard
portrait mode that adds a little bit of
a blur to the background and a few of
these effects it's a nice touch that
falls short in implementation when you
see that the bouquet actually eats up
parts of the subject sometimes which
brings us to the main camera an actual
aperture setting can be used to pull the
foreground away from everything behind
it on top of the portrait mode we just
mentioned it can get as low as 0.9 v
aperture which is impressive but in
reality it doesn't fully emulate what
real lenses can do at that aperture and
at the same time there's still the
problem that the bouquet could actually
eat up parts of the subject video modes
now include 4k and 1080p 60 frames per
second recording which is all good to
see now while the resulting videos look
quite good and don't really lack in any
one aspect and hence stabilization only
works on the 1080p shooting modes you
have Ã³as available for 4k but if you
want the smoothest video you'll probably
have to stick with 1080p now the main
thing about the camera is that you have
to learn its little quirks and you also
have to know a thing or two about
photography to get the best photos when
it comes to HDR for example the best way
of getting the best HDR photo is to hold
on your subject that you want to focus
on and then drag the exposure
compensation over to a very bright
portion of the blown out image so that
will allow for the highlights to be
brought down while the shadows can be
bumped up with the HDR enhanced
this isn't really something you would
know off the bat and you can't really
just go to HDR and shoot a photo and
expect it to be amazing and while we
will always enjoy seeing manual controls
and built-in camera software it does
require you to kind of use those
settings in order to get the best
possible photo the Huawei P 10 and P 10
plus have great cameras but they're not
necessarily the most user-friendly auto
cameras well really overall we see that
the pictures from the P 10 proved that
the dual camera lens and sensor combo
still works not to mention the fact that
monochromatic photos look awesome
because it has a 20 megapixel sensor
dedicated to it all pictures have a good
level of detail and color modes can be
changed through their output to vivid or
soft aside from the standard profile
it's really the level of detail that
makes us understand why this camera got
good marks on the XO mark now while we
wouldn't really recommend it for just
anybody looking for a great auto shooter
if you know a thing or two or dive into
the settings of the camera you can get
some of the great pictures that you
would expect from the P 10 and P 10 plus
and finally emui the huawei Android
iteration that has seen a few changes in
the last generations and the P 10 emui
still has a large number of features
that make it one of the most robust
versions of Android so far and it only
gets better with Android nougat
especially with the addition of Google
assistants at first glance the Mui kind
of grates on the senses because it
doesn't have an app drawer but
thankfully even that is an option in the
settings and after adding the app drawer
a lot of what I didn't like about emui
even in previous generations got
remedied that's only one facet of this
operating systems capabilities ever
there's a ton that the software can do
and users may not even know it without
looking through the settings for example
the capacitive key we mentioned earlier
but also a floating dock that also can
replace these soft keys by adding a
small button that floats on the screen
and then you can just press all of the
different home back or recent apps
buttons there and that doesn't even
include the knuckle feature that emui
has kind of been known for already you
basically take a knuckle and you almost
punch the display and do a number of
gestures with your knuckle and it will
trigger different shortcuts or
applications and all of these functions
and more under an interface that
actually isn't too hard on the eyes
anymore especially after adding in the
app drawer we're not the biggest fans of
the icon pack but we give lobby credit
where credit is due because of the level
of polish that they put into emui this
time around
not only do elements no longer really
bleed past their designated areas but
even then animations are crisp and easy
on the eyes and everything works very
smoothly we do admit that users might
have a bit of difficulty fathoming all
that it can do without some proper due
diligence but in general you couldn't
really go wrong with this version of
emui so with that the huawei P 10 and P
10 plus are going to be available in a
number of different markets but
availability in the u.s. is still a bit
let's say blurry for now in Europe
you'll be able to get the phone for 649
euros in the case of the p10 and 699
euros for the P 10 plus and so there you
have it - the huawei P 10 and the P 10
plus these are very solid devices and
really show that Huawei is blurring the
line from its flagship mate line down to
its P serious phones on the P 10 is a
wonderful example of that while we do
think that it's camera is quite stellar
it does require a bit of due diligence
and the display is great the design is
very solid and one thing we really love
about the Sun is its battery life it's
one of those phones that requires users
to kind of do their homework and then
once figuring out all of the different
quirks of the phone you might end up
having one of the best Android
experiences of 2017 especially
considering that we are expecting all of
the competition in 2017 to be pretty
fierce if you do have the ability to get
the Huawei P 10 and choose between it
and other Android flagships this year we
think you might actually have a fight on
your hands so from there thank you so
