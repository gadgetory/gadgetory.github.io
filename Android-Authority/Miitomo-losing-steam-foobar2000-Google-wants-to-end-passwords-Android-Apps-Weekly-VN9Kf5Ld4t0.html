Hindy the android authority app guy and
welcome back to the Android apps weekly
show this is episode number 142 we have
a ton of news to get to so let's get
started the stats were released this
week that showed the world's most
popular messaging apps whatsapp took
home the crown and some apps like
facebook Messenger fiber and WeChat
showed well in certain countries fun
fact bbm is installed on almost ninety
percent of Android devices in Indonesia
not bad for a service that most people
think is entirely irrelevant after
polemicists went nuts over the last week
the developers of ES file explorer have
decided to roll back the update and
remove the abomination that was the
charge boost and lockscreen advertising
there are still a bunch of cleaner
features that are pretty much useless
but it is a little less bloated than it
was before and hey score one for the
anger of the Internet after I wildly
successful launch new stats have been
thrown out there that suggests that me
tomo isn't doing as well as it was a
month ago the stats show that the
download numbers of meets home will have
slowed to a crawl and only about
twenty-five percent of people who have
downloaded the application open it up on
a weekly basis this has some concerned
about me tomos longevity but that's to
be expected when you release a game that
does nothing last week we told you that
pokemon go was accepting signups for
their beta well this week that beta went
live people are getting invites that
signed up for the beta last week and you
may be lucky enough to snag a beta
invite if you signed up we imagine that
the game will be coming out sometime in
the coming months so keep your eyes
peeled Google is working on a very
ambitious project that we remove the
need for passwords from applications by
2017 the idea is to use various metrics
and sensors in your device along with
the trust API to determine if you are
who you say you are without you having
to do anything there will be varying
security levels depending on the type of
application that needs a password but it
seems like the really big stuff will
require a bit more than just being in
the right GPS location well know more
about it later this year or even more
Android apps and games news check out
this week's newsletter which is linked
in the video description below there
you'll find a ton of fun news that we
didn't have time for here if you'd like
you can sign up using the form in the
written companion which is linked in the
video description below and
email that newsletter directly to your
inbox every Sunday if you want the
latest news even faster check out the
official android authority app alright
folks is take a look at some apps that
made some big news this week as usual if
you want to check out any of these apps
or games for yourself you can find those
links in the video description below
romancing saga two is an RPG that was
released all the way back in nineteen
ninety three in Japan only this last
week the game was released on mobile
along with PS Vita and this release
includes English translations for the
first time ever you'll play as the
Emperor and it's your job to build up
your kingdom and defeat the seven heroes
that have turned into demons the game
also features new classes and new game
plus mode and some additional gameplay
features it's quite expensive at $18 but
that's pretty normal for a square enix
release Once Upon a Time foobar2000 was
one of the best audio players on PC it
was lauded for its simple interface
lightweight nature and support for
various codecs now the retro audio
player is available on Android it
features a very simplistic design that
we admit would have looked a little
better with some material design thrown
in it supports a variety of formats
including flack Muse pack and others
it's free with no in-app purchases which
is definitely worth a try but do beware
that they're still working on it and
there are still some bugs the crashing
season is a game that is known as a
closed runner it has some charming 3d
graphics and you'll play as a bunch of
different animals as you run around
survive wave after wave of bad guys and
defeat bosses the game includes
unlockable content like more animals
boost power ups and accessories given
that it's a freemium game you can
probably guess that a lot of that stuff
can be purchased with real money if you
want it that bad it's a fun little time
waster and there is even multiplayer
supports the science journal is a
little-known Google application that was
released during Google i/o the idea is
that allows you to use the sensors in
your phone or you can connect to outside
sensors and then use the application to
record data test results and perform
actual scientific experiments and
research like most google apps this one
is entirely free and steeped in a heavy
dose of material design it's a great app
for students especially and you can find
out more by going to making science dot
with google com the brothers a tale of
two sons is an adventure game where you
play as two kids who are on a quest to
find some water of life to save their
ailing father in the game you'll have
control of both brothers simultaneously
most of
time which means this is one of those
few games that actually plays better on
a touchscreen than it does with a
controller the story is emotionally
charged the graphics look good and aside
for some early bugs it seems to play
pretty well the Google Play listing said
there would be in app purchases but we
really couldn't find any okay so this
week's episode isn't sponsored but we
