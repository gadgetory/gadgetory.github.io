up today you asked we answer its android
authority Q&amp;amp;A for July thirty-first 2013
hey everybody I'm Chris Walken as you
might be able to tell i'm getting over a
cold so you have to bear with me a
little bit this week but that said let's
get started Colin says I just got a
galaxy s4 active and I know that Samsung
makes a wireless charging kit for the
regular s4 do you think we'll see one
for the active anytime soon I think that
whether or not we'll see a wireless
charging kit for the galaxy s4 active
depends on how well it sells if one does
come out we'll probably see it in a few
months will 615 asks what do you think
the price of the LG g2 will be well
since the g2 is LG's new flagship I'd
say it's fairly likely that it's going
to sell for a flagship price probably
somewhere around 700 off contract or 200
on contract now I will personally be
there in New York on August seventh when
LG unveils the g2 so hopefully we'll
find out more about the pricing then
somebody who simply wants to be known as
an Android user asks when will Android
4.3 come to the samsung galaxy s4 well
if you're talking to Google Play edition
of the samsung galaxy s4 Google said
that it'll come soon but they haven't
given us a specific date now it did leak
last month and you can try it out for
yourself if you're feeling adventurous
this apparently even works on the
vanilla samsung galaxy s4 to kasher says
hey Chris hey I'm looking forward to a
purchase of an unlocked mobile phone
within 382 four hundred and fifty
dollars do you have any suggestions in
that price range there are a ton of
great options first I've got to mention
the google nexus 4 which is actually
cheaper than your price range and a
great phone if you don't want that you
have pretty much two options for
categories either mid-range phones and
check out our reviews to find out some
mid-range phones or last gen flagship
phones like the samsung galaxy s3 hope
this helps Vikramjit asks well the
samsung galaxy note 3 have features like
air view and air gesture like the galaxy
s4 i'm sure that it will since there are
a lot of people who use the note 2 and
never pull the S Pen out of its holster
for example but it's going to be
interesting to see how this works with
the S Pen in the note 3 Peter says I'm
in Bulgaria and I have a nexus 4 when am
I going to get the Android 4.3 update
it's rolling out so it should be coming
soon for all I know you could already
have the update by the time you're
watching this but Google is gradually
rolling it out so if you don't have it
let's try to be patient as tough as that
is you should get it soon enough and
that about wraps it up for this week
