company for more than a hundred years
and we are born I mean consumer being is
born from this company so friend
speaking even for me and return we are
at our our CEO for consumer business we
really have to change our man from the
b2b to the pc so that women are we
already start our hands happiness for 11
years in the listed first 27 28 years we
only hear from our customer at the time
our customer it operators so here from
operators what operate wanted with two
leads let's start from the two sound
health regularly change from the b2b
penis to the bit of silliness I mean
even from handset business we're really
doing a lot of the discussion face to
face to the consumers and we're doing a
lot of the using a lot of the company to
work together with us to to doing some
investigation to cut the feedback from
consumers about the trend about the
color about the the what they like of
lady a technology of course we also
cooperate with a lot of the very good
company and technology to provide the
best technology to the consumers and in
consumer area we won't leak leave the
industry so in this several years we're
already doing a lot of the a fantastic
job we are improved from a b2b penis to
the Batusi penis we have three paths in
consumer penises the first penis is a
smartphone I'll handset is my area is
fully focus on the bit to see that means
even with copy will operators we still
think about that consumers because
consumer is a end-user they are using a
smartphone they are really buying
smoking may be strokin operators so with
still focus on the
on the hands a penis with everything we
focus on the consumers and we have
another business is the owner brand it's
also focus on consumers hope your own
the brand is online brand and we sell
this using the online sales for the
directly to the consumer is even close
to the consumers is a poner brand and
third is a mbb and home this area we
have some b2b businesses such as module
to the car and we have this um some
mobile mobile 15 to cooperate with
operators to give them to give up
bridges different solution I mean to
very close to the office so I think that
most out of our business is focused on
the consumers are some still focused on
the let's say physical fitness yeah I
won't see the wahwee Mia maybe we are
not invest we do not want investor a
company to produce a screen or a CD but
we are let's say we are invite a very
good person very good experts in this
area worldwide to turn my way to help us
to discuss with existing tummy such as
in Japan GDI and in China summit omni
and also some some coming Taiwa we can
teach English what's the direction kids
for the LCD and we can work together
with them to design some new technology
with some maybe we apply for the pattern
of course we can give the consumer very
good reappearance so we invest in this
area will you measure our ability to
design to distinguish this error to
think about we have the ability to to
tell what's direction of the
Sarah so this is a way invest but the
way to now invest the product line I
will do not imagine the manufacturing
manufacture for this Ellie yeah maybe we
have to compromise because the 4k you
know for being a very huge screen
 is really very good but for the
smartphone it said you know five inch or
six inch at least at most so maybe where
our eyes cannot tell what difference
about 40 to cook a even to the four HD
in a small screen set for five inch but
you have to spend a lot of the power to
support 4k keeps red so you'll have to
compromise that means maybe your food in
folky but the power maybe it's
apparently the huge the maybe you just
can use it for half day but if you're
choosing full actually 0 to K you can
last one day or even more than one day
so we have to compromise because a full
case you have the let's say several
times maybe two times of four times
pixel you have to make the light so the
power consumption is huge so we have to
compromise this so i think the nard is
because the high silicon family not
belong to our hands happiness if another
part of the power group so from my
personal idea i think the maybe
knowledge we are not ready yes I only we
are not ready as user mentioned even for
consumers yes thing about what's
different what's advantage over us from
high silicon to the cocoa so we still
have a lot work to do so I think them
maybe today hi silicon should only in
support for a smartphone together
because they are if they support mo
company to make the devices they will
spend a lot of the tumor cells to maybe
not not the most important thing
multimode needing enhance our ability
I think that hasn't you only have that
customer it's always divided ecommerce
not only in China but also worldwide
it's a it's a trend for our let's say
our work that means I in Jenna online
sales in the 2014 is a almost certain
percent of the online sales and the
outside China I mean such as Western
Europe the online sales maybe ten
percent increase of course good every
year so we are using owner in China I
think the two doing online business I
think we're also using a owner in some
country is the online sales if the good
is a have the potential increase in that
country we will use the owner in some
countries but not every country may be
recruiting some several dead kid country
to using owner not depend on the
e-commerce how about becomes it is where
I think the identity is your with it
should be with the best sales product
together so i think the with a madman
seven this kind of the appearance and
our p6 p7 a slim design all of this is
identity to the customers we're also
doing the polarizer as a design the best
products and step-by-step identity
should be better very clear to the
consumer is okay thank you thank you
very much thank you I have to catch my
flight I grab him a little bit again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
