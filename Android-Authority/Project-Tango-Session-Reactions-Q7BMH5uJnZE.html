already recorded are you recording
alright cool hopefully there's AA
battery to last alright well it's josh
of a gar from android authority what's
going on everybody and I'm here with lon
when and Chris Carlin of course the
three of us are here at Google i/o and
we all just got out of right behind us
over here in the Hydra stage yes that's
an unfortunate name for stage but the
Hydra stage we watched the project tango
session what's new in project tango now
hopefully you guys can hear us just fine
the wind is blowing a little bit and
behind the camera is Android Pro Audio
playing some in just just terrible
dubstep right now I'm it's good I'm I'm
losing my mind right now I'm just saying
but anyway imma dance I wanted to just
go ahead and just jump into it like
tango is essentially to you okay two
years ago if I'm fortunate enough to
find and download the clip you're
probably seeing some footage of a
project tango demo I did two years ago
where they used with the same device the
tablet that had all of the different
sensors and you used it in order to kill
zombies from a gunship a zombie gunship
and you learn no buttons you just move
around with the tablet and that's how
you kill all of these zombies so that
was the first taste of tango I ever had
and what I didn't realize and I guess we
can make the discussion a bit a part of
this is that project tango back then was
essentially I'm realizing the foundation
for what we're going to see in AR and VR
yeah I don't know how you guys felt
about what did you guys think of the
session that we were in with project
tango I I thought it was pretty awesome
to be honest because I've only seen one
other project tango demo before and it
wasn't super impressive they didn't show
too much and I really enjoyed this one
because they showed not only practical
uses like being able to place furniture
and your home to see if it fits or see
how it looks but they also showed a lot
of the fun stuff that you can do like
the whole thing with the dinosaurs that
they had there and the shooting game
that they showed so that all of that was
really cool and I I'll be perfectly
honest don't really follow project tango
too closely I follow it enough to
understand
works so a lot of this was still pretty
new to me and I was pretty blown away by
it it's really cool and it seems like
the pretty much what you can do with it
is pretty just pretty limitless and it's
just going to be bound to your own
imagination as to what you can do with
project tango so I think that developers
can really take this to to a lot of
different places so it's going to be
really cool well I mean it's not very
long now until the first project tango
phone is out with Lenovo next month and
it's great like there's really a lot of
polish going on now with I mean it's not
it's not proof of concept kind of stuff
anymore it's it's very much getting to
the pointy end of the stick you know
there's some really really great stuff
like the um there was a demo just before
where the area on the stage was mapped
and then slowly overlaid with with like
wireframe animals and then it will
texture mapping of an outdoor scene and
and and it was great and then this
portal appears and it's like a one-way
mirror then through this portal you see
like the real world you see you see the
audience sitting out there pretty cool
stuff it's almost refreshing at Google
i/o to actually see the product being
used right in front of you rather than
just being told oh yeah and you'll see
it later on you know and to all of our
viewers and our listeners and our
readers and whatnot if you don't really
know what project tango is we've done a
lot of coverage on it but just to give a
quick synopsis here synopsis rather
project tango is depth and camera and
spatial recognition now products are
going to be coming out with all of the
different sensors including a depth
sensor a field sensor the camera will be
used and all of them are used in
conjunction to give you basically the
easiest way of scanning what is around
you and that could have a lot of
different applications like they said
already there are a couple applications
where you could use tools in order to
virtualize different parts of the world
so that you can see and visualize what
it is that you want to create in that
world AR style augmented reality style
but there's also spatial learning as
well so tango devices will will learn
the spaces that you take them through so
the more the more you take your device
around the world the more it understands
the spaces that you go to so it can
actually lead you through supermarkets
and it can
map you know the interior of your home
and things like that it's it's it's
really getting kind of cool after saying
and for gaming it's also it has a VR
component to it also you're not
necessarily putting on a headset for it
but the tablet will know where it is so
like that one demo where you put it on a
gun and you could actually go around
that's exactly what you do in a VR
headset except you don't need a VR
headset yeah which is pretty crazy yeah
that was actually really sweet i was one
of my favorite demos that they showed
and that kind of makes me look forward
to the project tango think that were
going to do later on tonight so yeah it
should be a lot of fun there's a demo
you'll see a whole video on that if
we're allowed to film it that is and the
best part about it is that these these
sensors if they're available in devices
then they will be compatible with
basically these apps that are just going
to be put on the Play Store so project
tango is not just a thing that companies
and corporations and construction
management areas and all that stuff it's
not something that just corporations and
companies will use it's something that
the consumer will be able to use because
the hope is while we might have daydream
enabled phones we might have tango
enabled phones yeah and they talked
about developers developing tango
specific apps for Android in as well
that there'll be a bunch of API is
available in Android and that will
unlock certain potential within there
within they are content that will only
be available for Android end devices so
we wanted to make sure to give you guys
just a brief glimpse I have a bunch of
clips that you probably already been
seeing inside of the session there but
the other thing we want to say is that
they even said it during the session is
that they've had this tablet on the
google play store that is project tango
enabled it's odd price of five hundred
and two dollars it's a little bit this a
little bit odd but an actual phone with
all these sensors will be coming out a
much smaller mobile device and we're not
going to be able to see it but i will be
able to see it we want we're not seeing
you here at Google i/o because it'll be
at lenovo tech world and that's going to
be very soon on which myself and John
Velasco we're going to be going to so
really exciting that products are
actually going to come out very soon
with this kind of technology and they
even showed a little bit of a teaser
there was a bit of a silhouette of the
actual device which looked kind of sleep
yeah it looked a little sleek
well yeah that should pretty much do it
we're just doing a quick reaction to
this session that we did hopefully you
watch the other reaction that these two
did earlier today and you can see what
it's like to be here at Google i/o don't
forget to check out the rest of our
coverage at Google i/o including our
look at the keynotes a reaction to that
the vlogs I've been putting out and also
there's even a 360 video that I just
released so you can actually experience
what the keynote was like it's almost as
if you're sitting right next to us
during Google's IO keynote of 2016 so
keep between two android authority for
even more because we are your source for
all things google i/o</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
