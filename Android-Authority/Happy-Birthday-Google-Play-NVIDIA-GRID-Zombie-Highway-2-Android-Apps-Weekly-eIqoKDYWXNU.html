Hindy the android authority app guard
welcome back to Android apps weekly
let's take a quick look at some
headlines first up nvidia has announced
they'll launch the grid gaming system in
May this will let you stream PC games to
your nvidia gadgets the popular quote is
that this will be the netflix of video
games tinder plus was launched this week
and that lets you pay for extra features
and then attempt to alienate practically
everyone the younger crowd will pay less
because tinder thinks they're broke and
older people will pay more because
they're old this last week Google
announced that ways is now officially a
part of google mobile services that
means it's now officially a Google
application and will likely start being
pre-installed on smartphones
congratulations two ways Mortal Kombat X
was announced this last week it's a
hybrid of a card game and a combat game
that admittedly looks really impressive
and all of its violent glory it'll be
launched sometime in April last up this
week Google Play is now three years old
to celebrate its birthday there is a
sale on movies apps and music including
daft punk's discovery and runtastic

in the video description below
blackberry messenger got a huge update
this last week with it came myriad
improvements to channels photo sending
picture previews in chat playback of
voice notes and the ability to customize
your PIN if you subscribe along with
that comes Android wear support which is
surprisingly forward-thinking for an
application that almost became
irrelevant years ago the update is out
right now if you want it zombie highway
2 was released this last week it uses
many of the same mechanics as the first
game but includes improved graphics and
sound effects nitrous new cars new
weapons new zombies and more the only
downside is the release date bug so you
may want to wait a week or so for
everything to get ironed outs oh BTW of
Genesis 2 is the latest game out of
chemco games who are known as one of the
best JRPG Studios on Android this is a
JRPG with a decently long story line
better than average graphics and some
unique battle mechanics it uses a job
system for character customization and
the company promises in the NIH
are not required to finish the game
there are some release date bugs so do
be aware of that auto where is a new
android wear application that allows you
to create tasks and tasker and then use
them on your Android wear devices using
this application you can do a bunch of
fun things with your watch and control
it in ways you previously couldn't some
of the things you can do is create
customized notifications create
interactive screens utilize improved
voice commands and a whole lot more
there is a free trial so you can try it
before you buy it last up this week is
king of thieves this is a game out of
Zeptolab known for their hit Cut the
Rope franchise in this platformer style
game you must dodge defenses and steal
gold coins from other players then build
your own level to defend your gold coins
against them you can also join guilds
engage with leaderboards and there are
some extra things in there like costumes
it's a different kind of platformer and
definitely worth a shot once again I'm
