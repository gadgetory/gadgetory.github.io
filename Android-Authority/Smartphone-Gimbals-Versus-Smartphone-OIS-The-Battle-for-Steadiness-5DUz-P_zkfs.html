these guys being used more and more at
conventions like CS and MWC and if you
guys don't know what this is this is
actually a smartphone gamble now it's
very someone promised to the gimbal
stabilizers you see probably for
mirrorless cameras DSLRs but these are
meant for smartphones of course now if
you don't know what they do they
basically help to steady your camera
your movement so if you don't see as
much shape and it made me really wonder
whether or not this is going to be for
more advantageous than just say using
the OIS in your smartphone's camera now
we've seen the improvements made to oh
is it really gives you a steadier look
but how does it really compare against
these smartphone gimble's so in this
video I'm going to take four of today's
top flagships not all them but just for
five shifts they've been released this
year I'm going to compare their
performance against these gimble's but
what I have here is the giant smooth
three I also have the DJI Osmo mobile
which are probably going to be the two
most popular smartphone gimbals out
there so we'll take them out do some
test footage and we're going to compare
and see what happens but before we get
into the comparisons I want to talk
briefly about the two gimbals that I'll
be using here the first one is the giant
smooth three and the other is going to
be the DJI Osmo mobile two of the most
popular smartphone gimbals out there and
what I like about these two smartphone
gimbals is that they're fairly simple
and straightforward when it comes to
setting it up you just put the
smartphone into the cradle do some minor
adjustments and once it's balanced you
turn it on and that's about it and the
other thing I want to talk back here are
the smart phones I'll be using so I have
four Android smartphones they're going
to be the Google pixel XL the wall way
p10
26 and the Samsung Galaxy s8 and we'll
talk about briefly the settings that
I'll be using here now I'm going to keep
them all on the automatic mode when it
comes to video I'm shooting at 1080p
because that's where the OIS usually
kicks in when you do 4k or even quad HD
sometimes the OAS feature is not it's
not allowed so we're going to stick with
1080p at 30 frames per second automatic
shooting mode and I'm going to do couple
tests one with OAS off another with o is
on so you can see the two and then I'm
going to put them on the respective
stabilizers with both OAS on and off
just to show you the difference
the first phone here is the Google pixel
XL and as you can tell already
OAS does make a big difference than just
using it handheld so this next segment
is with the rezaian smooth to read and
already you could tell the difference
it's a lot smoother more stabilized
especially when going up the stairs and
with the DJI Osmo mobile it's pretty
similar except that you notice just a
little bit of a rocking motion going up
the stairs it's not bad but still the
general footage is pretty stabilized
here's the compassion between the two
gimbals with OAS on comparing it with
that Hawaii s and with just the phone
and is on
next up is the huawei p10 and again you
can see the difference between music and
handheld without OAS and then with it
turned on not going to go into too much
detail about the next parts because it's
the same thing here with the giant
smooth the reeds you could tell it's
very smooth it's very stabilized and no
problems whatsoever moving on to the DJI
Osmo mobile gaming that thing looks nice
and smooth fluid movement and looks like
you're walking on air
you
the LGG six has some nice sharp looking
footage but as you can tell again
without oh is is pretty unusable because
the amount are shaped going on but that
of course goes away when you start using
these gimbal stabilizers and I do notice
that there's just slightly better
results when you have oh is enabled and
are using the gimbal stabilizers
and finally we have the Galaxy s8 and no
surprise again with oh is it really
helps to keep things nice and steady
looking versus without at all
you
and the last thing here I want to show
you guys is just a comparison between
all four smart phones just using it
handheld with oh is on you can see the
difference between all four still for
the most part fits smooth and usable but
not as smooth as using the gimbal
stabilizers you definitely notice more
pronounced movement when you're going
down the stairs
so after shooting all those segments
repeating it with all the phones with
Hawaii s on and off and then the gimbal
stabilizers I looked at all the footage
compared them all and it's just
unbelievable what these smartphone
gimbal stabilizers do because yes
they're still better performing and than
just relying on Hawaii s all I ask
though I got to give credit does a
better job than just using it handheld
with that Hawaii s at all but the gimbal
stabilizer this gives you that walking
on air look and feel with your shots and
if you're enthusiast and inspiring
videographer you will appreciate how
fluid it looks versus just the line on
Oh y-yes the biggest thing I saw is just
with a vertical movement especially
going up and down stairs with oh is it
does a decent job but you could still
see just a little bit of a rocking
motion whereas with the gimbal
stabilizers and with oh is enable that
combination delivers some really fluid
and smooth looking videos and that's the
beauty about them and to add even more
that cinematic quality to your videos
using these gimbal stabilizers with the
combination of OAS and your smartphones
the probably won't check up these add-on
attachment runs is you can pick them up
pretty much anywhere like Amazon this
one here is from the company Amir and I
used the wide-angle lens this is
actually a three three-in-one lens
system it has a macro a fisheye and a
wide-angle lens I really like the
wide-angle one because you compare it
not only with the rear cameras but also
with the front-facing camera so if
you're doing some sort of vlogging style
video you get a wider field of view
thanks to the wide-angle lens and if you
are like a skateboarder or extreme
sports type of person the fisheye lens
that's a great job as well at the end of
the day who is is great but stabilizers
are even better and as you could tell in
the comparisons here that I showed you
the gimbal stabilizers do a far better
job at keeping things nice and smooth
and steady now begin pull themselves are
going to cost you a pretty penny the
science from the three and the DJI Osmo
will cost three hundred dollars that's
cheap but if you're serious about
cinematography shooting professional
video these gimbal stabilizers will
achieve that especially when combined
the OIS feature in today's smartphones
you're going to get some really fluid
movements and on top of that not only do
you get the stabilized movement you have
also different following modes with the
stabilizers you have built-in controls
it's a versatile tool if you're
inspiring videographer so there you go
guys that is a quick comparison between
the OIS and today's smartphones and how
they compare against the gimbal
stabilizers for smartphones you guys
