just might be the charm and you no
longer need an invite to buy it it's
Joshua freghar from Android authority
what's going on everybody
and this is the one plus three now
before we get into the full review let's
get the specifications out of the way
longtime fans and followers of oneplus
will notice that the oneplus 3 has a
pretty radically changed design there's
no longer a removable backing and the
backing is no longer of sandstone black
material now you have a complete uniboob
that is a little bit larger due to the
5.5 inch screen but it's also incredibly
thin this is definitely a sleek and
slender device with all of the different
bits and pieces exactly where you would
expect them to be it's also quite
minimalistic with only the oneplus logo
on the back right underneath the camera
optic package and on the top left there
is still the alert slider returning from
the oneplus 2 and the 1 + ex handling is
not too difficult an affair even in
one-handed usage is not too hard to get
from one side to the other but getting
to the top with this 5.5 inch screen is
a little bit tougher so you're probably
going to be using two hands more often
than not however the main gripe that is
here is that the metal is quite slippery
it's a very smooth metal and though it
does give it a very sleek look it might
also sleek right out of your hands and
that is the reason why oneplus probably
gave us five different cases showing all
the different materials that otherwise
would have been backings for the phone
but instead these are all covers that
you can snap onto
the back of the device sandstone black
is still a material that a lot of other
companies aren't using and now on the
one plus three we simply don't have that
anymore what you have is a metal phone
much like plenty of other phones in the
market today and if you really want to
have that better grip on the phone
because this metal is quite slippery
you're going to have to use those covers
and that's a little bit of a nuisance no
matter which way you put it and though
we might be a little bit sad that
oneplus has stepped backwards in their
design departments we do think that
oneplus has created what can be
considered though typical a very
nice-looking metal phone given that this
device is supposed to be somewhat
affordable it's no surprise that 1080p
resolution comes in this 5.5 inch AMOLED
screen that said however it would have
been nice to see quad HD in a phone that
is supposed to be a flagship killer for
2016 but 1080p is still nice and still
provides just enough sharpness for the
real estate that it provides and it's
still fun to use for everything from
gaming to media consumption that said
the AMOLED screen does provided a couple
of extra features including the ambient
display it does have a very similar
ambient display to devices like the
Nexus 6 in the Nexus 6p only you can
actually wave your hand near the front
of the device and it will trigger it as
well there's also the night mode which
is nice to have especially if you are a
night owl that is always looking at the
phone turning on the night mode will
bump up the warmth of the color
temperature way high so that it's easier
on the eyes especially when you're in
dark conditions overall the screen on
the 1+3
is standard for the most part but it is
a standard that oneplus nails but the
same can be said for performance where
oneplus has actually provided a little
bit more on top of the performance
package we need in flagships today the
Snapdragon 820 provides great
performance that we've had pretty much
no slowdown or stutter in any
application or any part of the interface
and oxygen OS and I could also be
attributed to oxygen os's more
minimalistic design that said however
performance is still top-notch
especially when gaming we've had a lot
of fun with Sky Force reloaded and have
been able to have a lot of apps in the
background even when playing these games
and the reason for that is because
oneplus put in six gigabytes of RAM when
we're using this phone we actually don't
notice any of the applications just not
responding or even quitting because it
runs out of the ability to keep those
the memory so it's a nice little step
forward for oneplus and definitely
something that they will be able to
boast in the oneplus 3 moving forward
we'll start off talking about the
hardware by saying yes there is in fact
NFC in this device where the oneplus 2
had a bit of a misstep and a lot of
people pointed it out the oneplus 3
clearly has NFC available so you will be
able to do Android pay and also do
connections through NFC call quality was
quite good with no complaints on either
end of the calls and there were no drop
calls either one using this particular
phone on the t-mobile network and
speaking of sound the speaker on the
bottom right next to the USB type-c port
is adequately loud it doesn't have that
much body to it but it's something that
you would expect from a bottom mounted
single speaker but speaking of audio the
headphone jack actually drives
headphones pretty well it's a little bit
louder than a couple of other ones out
there and definitely not quite as loud
as the HTC 10 but it's still a very
enjoyable experience straight out of the
box the fingerprint reader performs very
well once you get your fingerprint read
and scanned into the phone it's just a
matter of putting a finger down on that
particular area and in under a second
the phone will be woken up and unlocked
right away the alert slider makes a
return and in the oneplus 2 I didn't
find myself using it a whole lot because
I do happen to use a smart watch but
lately with the oneplus 3 I did find
myself changing the toggle just easily
finding it because of the textured
button or slider rather and being able
to turn it off for full silence or for
all notifications it is a nice tool to
have if in a pinch you need to be able
to turn off all of the notifications on
your phone so you don't disturb anybody
battery life on the one plus three is
fairly standard given that it is a 3000
milliamp hour battery with a 5.5 inch
display on a snapdragon 820
but I still got three and a half hours
of screen on time despite somewhat
heavier usage that included music
playing and navigation throughout the
day but the best part about the 1+3 is
the return of fast charging which was
missing in the oneplus 2 and this time -
charging is what oneplus is boasting and
it brings 60% of battery life in just
half an hour's worth of charge and that
is actually quite incredible very easy
to use when you are running out of juice
you just have to plug the phone in for a
little bit
you'll get the power you need to get
through the rest of the day and yes the
cable is still red but it is not flat
anymore the camera of the one plus three
comes with a pretty good app pretty nice
and into it if not too hard to use it's
very similar to the one that was in the
oneplus 2 it does come with the ability
to swipe on the viewfinder to change the
different modes but once you get to
panorama you still have to go into the
vertical orientation and then you have
to swipe differently to get to the other
modes again it's just a little bit
annoying but after that you have the
manual mode that allows you to change
the shutter speed the white balance and
even the focus points and you also have
a nice little feature that was
introduced in the 1 plus 2 which is the
ability to tap onto the area you want
for your exposure and then move the
focus point somewhere else it's actually
kind of nice pretty intuitive and I
think it's something that should be
available in the auto mode also despite
some steps forward in the cameras like
having an 8 megapixel camera on the
front unfortunately the camera quality
of the oneplus 3 is simply average at
best
the main reason here especially for
low-light shots is that at F 2.0
aperture it needs to have a longer
shutter speed now no OIS in the world is
going to be able to compensate for a
very long shoulder speed so if you have
shaky hands blurry photos can definitely
happen that said however overall quality
of these photos also tends to be lacking
especially when it comes to colors and
most shots there are a few shots where
the clothes actually look quite good but
other ones the colors have that lack of
saturation to really take the vibrancy
of the scene this also happens in video
now though videos do tend to look pretty
smooth you do see the noise in these
videos as well despite this video being
in 4k resolution there are even a couple
of other missteps like in panorama mode
when the stitching over on the right
side of this photo just wasn't done very
well now that we know that updates in
the future might be able to make the
camera a little bit better it's just a
bit of a disappointment that the camera
is again the main place that oneplus
finds themselves stumbling in their
flagship killer oxygen OS has been
updated to Android marshmallow and just
like in the oneplus 2 it doesn't have
too many extras when compared to let's
say stock Android as a matter of fact it
actually looks a lot like stock Android
but in this version of Android I
actually think that some of the features
oneplus does bacon are finally really
ironed out they do provide
nice functionality and they could be
features that could make stock Android a
little bit better the Shelf returns and
is a place for you to put all of your
different widgets now the widgets can be
scrollable like this calendar here and
that is really nice to have but this
little touch that's added in is the memo
a quick way of just jotting down a quick
note and it's actually kind of nice to
have for those times when you do need to
have some information at the ready on
the shelf a feature that stock Android
even the Android and beta that's out
right now has been unable to
consistently have is the dark mode and I
think the dark mode is still a great
feature of oxygen OS because it provides
that just little bit of customization
especially since you can pick an accent
color so you can really make the phone
look kind of what you want it to look
like the buttons on the bottom are now
dots rather than lines but it still
serves the same purpose they don't have
to adhere to what they look like and
they are fully customizable you can swap
what the buttons do or you can make new
functions happen if you were to double
tap or hold on to any of the three
buttons on the bottom it's a little bit
of customization that gives just that
little bit of character to oxygen OS and
for the end user it's nice to have that
little bit of control
whereas I felt that oxygen OS was trying
too hard to be like stock Android and
also like cyanogen from before mixed
together
now oxygen feels like it has its own
identity and that might be the best part
about the software on top of the fact
that it is really smooth the oneplus 3
is available now for 399 dollars
actually a great price when you consider
you don't need an invite to buy this
phone anymore
overall the oneplus 3 does a great job
of hitting all the right notes
especially for that price point but the
phrase we have to look at now is not
necesary flagship killer but never
settle did oneplus maybe step back a
little bit by creating a phone that for
all intents and purposes is a lot like
everyone else well for typical users
this phone is still going to be a
wonderful choice but for die-hard
oneplus users maybe there's just that
little bit less to be excited about this
year what happens when a phone
manufacturer takes all of the flagship
conventions and puts them in a package
that is not only nailing those
conventions but it's actually really
affordable back in the day we call that
the oneplus one and I think that the
reason the oneplus 2 what
a misstep is because they lost sight of
that philosophy instead of providing the
best features for a good price which is
their claims of fame they tried to put
in features that were forward-thinking
but not fully fleshed out that has
changed now with the 1+3
that melds the philosophies of the 1
plus 1 and the 1 plus 2 together but in
doing so one plus had to make a couple
of compromises and maybe they also
needed to create a phone that appealed
to pretty much everybody and to do so
they had to bend to convention as always
thank you guys very much for watching
and I hope you enjoyed this review of
the one plus three it's a great device
and it actually does a lot of the things
we would want out of a flagship killer
including not needing to be bought with
an invite but there are a couple of
things that oneplus had to do in order
to make this happen and so that's what
we kind of focused on in this review
stay tuned to Android 34 even more about
the oneplus 2 in clean comparisons
between this and the other flagships
that are available in 2016 and then make
sure you stick around for even more
