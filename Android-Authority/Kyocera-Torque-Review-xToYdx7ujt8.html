phone and a hammer do I really have to
buy two things maybe not by now in our
review of the Kyocera torque hey
everybody I'm Chris look now the Kyocera
torque trades top of the line specs for
being tough and waterproof but how much
does it sacrifice when it comes to the
specs let's take a look the Kyocera
torque runs a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU pushing a 4-inch
WVGA display it has one gig of ram and a
relatively small four gigs of internal
storage though that is expandable by
microsd the rear facing camera is 5
megapixels while the front facing camera
is 1.2 megapixels power is supplied by a
2500 milliamp power battery the first
thing you might notice about the Kyocera
torque is that someone seems to have
encased it in a small truck no it's not
the fanciest looking phone we've seen
but it is resistant to water dust salt
and pretty much everything else you can
throw at it
buttons are very sturdy as you'd expect
and all the ports are covered to further
protect the device from the elements
given the bulkiness the torque fits well
in the hand and for the most part the
buttons are logically placed and easily
accessible the torques display fall
short of HD but despite the resolution
of 800 by 480 the screen looks
relatively sharp with a pixel density of
233 pixels per inch the small size of
the display definitely works in the torx
favor here texts and images are well
rendered and colors are suitably well
represented no this isn't the best
display we've ever seen but it is
protected by Gorilla Glass in keeping
with the phone's theme like a lot of
other devices we've seen lately the
torque runs a dual-core Snapdragon
chipset but performance isn't quite on
par with other similarly spec devices
we've seen antutu benchmark produced an
average score of 10,000 375 across three
tests Epic Citadel produced an average
frame rate of 56
frames-per-second in high quality mode
and 57 frames per second in high
performance mode while the benchmarks
might have been a little lower than some
other similar devices real-world
performance was decent scrolling through
various screens was smooth and though
you might have trouble running
top-of-the-line games Temple Run 2 ran
as smooth as ever during testing sadly
but not entirely surprisingly the
Kyocera torque runs Android 4.0 point 4
Ice Cream Sandwich though apparently
there are plans to upgrade the device in
the future while this is a- the
interface is very close to stock android
which should no doubt make some users
pretty happy only a few bits of
bloatware were installed on my review
unit which was certainly a nice change
of pace some of the more useful
pre-installed software included the
flashlight app polaris viewer and eco
mode which aims to reduce battery usage
pictures produced by the Torx 5
megapixel camera are usable but
unremarkable while they were relatively
sharp colors seemed a bit on the
washed-out side this happened both in
sunlight and with indoor lighting the
1080p video capture suffers from the
same issues though somewhat less so
probably due to the shorter exposure per
frame the video doesn't look too bad
though no image stabilization is present
still for a phone that focuses on being
rugged the camera is above average
throughout heavy testing the 2500
milliamp hour battery in the tork held
up admirably remaining at about 65%
capacity after nine and a half hours the
estimated talktime is around nineteen
hours and after seeing how well it held
up to almost 10 hours of benchmarking
and other testing it's easy to imagine
this being the case if the battery
doesn't quite hold up to your needs
it is replaceable which is always nice
now really the decision on whether or
not the Kyocera torque is for you is
probably made the second you see it
either you're the type of person who
needs a phone that tough or you're not
that said the torque is definitely one
of the better options out there right
specs aren't bad performance is decent
and it's all around a pretty good phone
especially for something so tough if you
want to know more we have a written
