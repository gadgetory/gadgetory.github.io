flagship killer then this might be the
one it has to aim for H Josh regard from
Android Authority what's going on
everybody and this is the oneplus 2
versus the Samsung Galaxy s6 in this
quick look the big change noticeable
right away is up front with a new home
button that is not really a button that
you can really press down but more of a
capacitive area for a home key but it
also houses a fingerprint sensor that is
looking for fingerprints even when the
phone is off on its screen and from
there there's also the alert slider on
the left side which moves the power
button and the volume rockers over to
the right side all together the alert
slider is like a notification toggle in
which you can change how you get your
notifications Weatherall none or just
the priority ones but on the other hand
is the Samsung Galaxy s6 that saw
dramatic departure from norm in build
quality this time moving to metal and
glass unibody constructions this move
wasn't without its compromises however
with the replaceable battery and
expandable storage becoming omissions
nonetheless it was a much needed shift
and something that pretty much everybody
tends to appreciate there's no mistake
in the s6 or any other samsung device
though with its signature physical home
button flanked by recent apps keys and
bad keys as well still present along
with the standard button layout of the
power button and volume rocker to the
right and left respectively in the case
of the Samsung Galaxy s6 edge you do
have the curves on the right and left of
the screen helping with handling but not
really providing too much else when it
comes to features the oneplus 2 is
obviously the bigger of the two devices
with a 5.5 inch screen and such points
for handling and experience in handling
have to be given to the sleeker and
smaller Samsung flagship now as we
already mentioned the oneplus 2 keeps
the same 5.5 inch size as its
predecessor in its screen as well as the
same Full HD resolution which is kind of
disappointing for those who wanted or
expected quad HD which you do get in the
Samsung Galaxy s6 and edge despite its
smaller size the viewing angles are
still fantastic in either of these
however just the pixel density of the s6
and s6 edge will trump that of the
oneplus 2 but we still think that the
oneplus 2 display looks pretty great and
especially when compared to the oneplus
one there is a bit of a enhancement in
the one that we have now
the Super AMOLED display however on
samsung's cam does bring some pretty
great colors and high saturation a
little bit of sensory overload so if
that is a little bit too much for you
the oneplus 2 might be the choice for
you in this case in performance is all
about pure power as the oneplus 2 packs
the Snapdragon 810 backed by the audrina
430 and 4 gigabytes of RAM in the 64
gigabyte storage option making it one of
the few devices around to have this kind
of combo
despite some known issues with
overheating which one-plus claims will
not happen with this version 2.1 of the
processor this processing package is
looking to be one of the best in the
world while will definitely be pushing
its device to its limits in an upcoming
full review performance was certainly of
no issue in the time that we were using
it thus far but on the other hand the
powerhouse that is the Ixia 7420 is
backed by three gigabytes of ram in the
samsung galaxy s6 and edge samsung
decided to give the snapdragons of the
world a bit of a skip in its step with
its in-house processor which so far has
been a pretty fantastic move the
optimization is evident with the very
snappy and mostly lag free TouchWiz UI
even if it's more toned down nature is
also a contributing factor for this
nonetheless it between these two
different devices we already see that
performance is at high marks no matter
which one of these two you choose for
your daily driver a shift in hardware
for the oneplus 2 and the Samsung Galaxy
s6 generally meant better-looking phones
for both but it also came at the cost of
a couple of features for the Samsung
Galaxy s6 and edge in the case of the
Samsung phones there was the loss of
removable battery and expandable storage
both issues that have been addressed in
the oneplus 2 for the most part while
the oneplus 2 does not have expandable
storage it has an option of 64 gigabytes
that should be enough for the common
user and it's bigger 3300 milliamp hour
battery might be able to last a full day
especially considering its full HD
display both devices do future
fingerprint scanners and readers rather
in a similar implementation and position
with it integrated into the home buttons
up front
the s6 fingerprint reader is actually
quite accurate and that happens to be
the case in the oneplus 2 as well but we
do give the oneplus 2 a bit of an edge
because you are able to just put your
finger down on a turned off screen in
order for it to trigger as well now one
of the big changes in terms of hardware
for the oneplus 2 is the shift at USB
type-c making it the
Android smartphone to feature one
another welcome addition is the alert
slider as we mentioned already it is a
reversible plug on both sides of the
cord and the actual cable itself will be
made available at cost so it will be one
of the cheapest ways for everyone to
adopt what might be the new standard of
connections for Android smartphones now
when it comes to the camera as the
galaxy s6 might just be the king of the
Android space when it comes to its
picture quality boasting a 16 megapixel
rear facing camera with smart optical
image stabilization and a 5 megapixel
front facing camera Samsung has a
handful of nice camera features and you
are able to launch the app from the home
button just pressing it twice so it'll
load up in under a second now one
slightly disappointing aspect of the
oneplus one was its camera 2 performance
but the oneplus is looking to really
change all that with the 2 while
featuring a similar 13 megapixel shooter
as its predecessor in now features F 2.0
aperture with oh is and a laser guided
autofocus system which should make a bit
of a difference as far as image quality
but also in terms of experience the
laser autofocus allows for touch
refocusing and the optical image
stabilization will help with some
low-light performance as well 4k video
shooting is also available in the video
format and also capturing images in RAW
format is available as well of course
it's really too soon to tell which of
these two cameras will be better but we
will say that the oneplus 2 is
performing a little bit better than we
expected but we're not sure if it's
going to live up to the standard of the
s6 until we get our hands on a review
unit and put it through its paces and
finally in software the oneplus 2 is
running oxygen OS born of the ashes from
the relationship that went sour from one
plus and CyanogenMod oxygen OS otherwise
is now version 2.0 based on 5.1.1
lollipop that brings a lot of the stock
Android and material design elements to
its version of Android it's back to the
gills with a slew of features though
including off screen gestures and the
ability to change the button layout to
soft keys if you so choose two features
that were available in the oneplus one
from the get-go and now even a dark UI
mode is available for better nighttime
viewing and then there's of course the
Shelf which is a new type of way of
looking at your frequently used apps and
frequently contacted people the galaxy
s6 on the other hand is running an
lollipop and TouchWiz and TouchWiz looks
just about the same on the galaxy s6 as
we've seen in the past but the main
change is that it has been toned down a
lot of the features that might have been
in your face throughout the usage of the
OS have now been put aside or at least
hidden to the point where the operating
system feels a lot faster than it did
before it does provide a lot more
customization with a theme engine and
also a lot more features on top of the
Android shell underneath but the oxygen
OS just sort of gets a little bit of a
detraction here because it is just about
as stock against Android can get and by
feeling just a little bit too vanilla it
doesn't feel like it's really
differentiating itself from the rest of
the androids in the pack we still won't
really go as far as to say that either
device really overtakes the other in
terms of specifications and Rauf
features but what gives the oneplus 2 a
huge leg up is its price with a price
point less than half of what the galaxy
s6 would set you back it is fantastic to
think that a device like the at one
point one plus two even exists of course
if you're clamoring to get your hands on
this device you'll have to navigate
through the invite system once again
however many more devices should be
available now and at 389 for the 64
gigabyte version and an even cheaper 329
16 gigabyte version soon to be available
there are some choices here especially
when you consider some customization
with style swap backgrounds to make the
oneplus 2 your own stay tuned for even
more about the oneplus 2 here at Android
authority especially when we get our
full review unit and put these two
devices through their real paces with
everything from vs. videos to camera
shootouts because we are your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
