have a tradition that every YouTube we
should make an introduction video so i'm
gary sims and this video is all about me
so where do I start when at eleven my
grandfather gave me as an X 81 computer
and ever since that I've been into
technology after finishing school I
eventually went on to do a degree in
business information systems from a UK
university that's a computer science
rated degree and then I went on to
become a software engineer the first
company I worked for was called Dec or
digital Digital Equipment Corporation
they were famous for their mini
computers their VAX mini computers for
their 64-bit alpha processor for their
VMS operating system eventually Dec got
bought by compac compact got bought by
HP and Dec just disappeared into the
annals of history alpha dec I went to
work for Reuters for a while working on
their databases that store all of their
stories they have millions of stories
and these stories are accessible by
their journalists to check facts and
figures and previous stories for the new
stories that they're writing and after
right as I went to a company called
Barco who in the department I was
working for we were doing broadcast
television equipment specifically I was
working on the digital encryption
systems that we have for satellite
television in 2002 things changed a bit
and I got into writing I started doing
IT blogging I started doing blogging for
Linux comm before it got bought out by
the Linux Foundation for open logic for
IT managers journal and in 2008 I wrote
a book called learning freeness FreeNAS
is an operating system that you can
install on your PC and turns it into
network attached storage you put lot of
hard drives in it you can access it from
Windows Mac and Linux and so on I wrote
a book about it and actually the company
Packt publishing asked me to write a new
version recently but unfortunately
because of my commitments here to
Android Authority I wasn't able to take
up that offer it was my first book
hopefully it won't be my last
maybe we'll see what the future holds
for us and in 2012 I started working
here at hand with authority and having a
great time writing about the news
reviewing devices looking all that's
going on in the Android world phones
tablets robots small board computers
everything that's going on with arm and
it's very exciting and now I'm starting
to make videos so this is my
introduction video so that you know who
I am when you see me reviewing a device
or talking about something that's
happening in the Android world outside
of Android I like to spend time with my
wife and kids I am heavily involved in
my local church and I've been known to
do a spot fishing besides that I don't
know what else to say maybe later on
when you get to know me a bit better
I'll do another one of these
introduction videos maybe answer some of
your questions
maybe we can expand on this a little bit
but for the moment that's who I am
don't forget also to subscribe to
Android Authority and that's it thanks
for watching and I'll see you in my next
video
did someone mention tea thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
