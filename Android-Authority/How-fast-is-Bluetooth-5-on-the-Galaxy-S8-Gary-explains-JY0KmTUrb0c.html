authority now I've done lots of videos
about Bluetooth 5 in the little last
while because there's been so much
confusion about the capabilities or
Bluetooth 5 and one of the problems I
had is I couldn't get the Galaxy s8 to
work with Bluetooth 5 but thanks to the
people from Nordic semiconductors I now
managed to get the Nordic semiconductors
Bluetooth 5 development board working
with a galaxy f8 so if you want to know
how I did it and what I found out please
let me explain
now if you remember the situation was
this there is no support in Android at
the moment for Bluetooth 5 so therefore
it's not possible to write an Android
application using an Android SDK to
start making a Bluetooth 5 connection to
another device now there's no SDK from
Samsung either so really at that point
and I made my last thing about this I
thought that's it there's no Bluetooth 5
support at all well there is but there's
a trick normally you would take your
Android device and it would act as the
central device and it would connect to a
peripheral normally like you know like a
Fitbit or something like that this would
be the main and this would be the
peripheral now actually you can't do
that with the galaxy s 8 because there
is no API but what the people from
Nordic semiconductors points out to me
is if you start with the development
board as the master and connect to the
s8 as a peripheral then actually the s8
recognizes the incoming Bluetooth 5
connection and will establish that
connections and the two will start to
speak in fact there is actually also
another trick you can actually start
with the Galaxy f8 write your app and
you can connect using Bluetooth 4 and
then the other device can say back to
this one hey do you support Bluetooth 5
can we upgrade this link to a Bluetooth
5 connection so again you can't do it
from the galaxy s 8 but the other device
can kind of suggests that we upgrade the
connection to negotiate is the proper
word to a Bluetooth 5 connection
then you get a Bluetooth 5 connection
working so what I've done is I've taken
the SA taken the development board and
I've done some testing indoors only to
see about the speed and the range of
Bluetooth 5 now I've done three tests
the first test the two devices are
literally next to each other just a few
centimeters apart then I move the device
out into the hallway away from my main
office it's about 5 meters it has to go
through one wall and then after that I
move it across the hallway into another
room which is about 11 meters away and
has to go through two rooms and in each
place I've tested the speed so let's
take a look at those speed numbers okay
so first of all when they are next to
each other I managed to get one megabit
a second now that's slightly less than I
was getting when I was using to
development boards side-by-side however
that is obviously a significant
throughput one megabit a second many
said over Bluetooth I was use Bluetooth
low-energy not Bluetooth classic like we
use for the speakers and for audio
streaming of the headset this is
Bluetooth Low Energy the kind of stuff
you use when you're talking to a Fitbit
or a SmartWatch so one megabit a second
when they were next to each other now
that would be good enough for audio
streaming all your over Bluetooth Low
Energy when we finally get that standard
into the Bluetooth specification now my
second test which was five meters away
and through one wall I managed to get
915 kilobits per second so that's naught
point nine megabits a second so not much
of a drop there in the speed and again
that would be absolutely fine for audio
streaming over Bluetooth Low Energy
when that comes out then my final test
was two rooms away across the hallway
into another room two walls 11 meters
away and once I started to get further
away now the speed here dropped to 460
kilobits a second now that drop is quite
significant for 160 kilobits a second is
kind of really on the edge of what we
could use for audio streaming so what
we're finding here is it because of the
advantages of Bluetooth 5 the extra
speed we're actually able to do a high
lap throughput for audio even when
you're through to wall
and when you're about 1011 meters away I
then tried a fourth test actually
further away than that and I couldn't
get the connection to work so this seems
to be kind of a limit now in my house
because I've got different types of
walls and you've got in your house
I've got wooden walls rock wall walls if
you've got concrete walls or brick walls
we've got ironworking of always all
going to change how the distances work
but for me when we get Bluetooth Low
Energy audio streaming over Bluetooth
Low Energy this is going to work at
least to a distance of 10 11 12 13
meters now remember don't get confused
is four times range thing that people
have been talking about for Bluetooth 5
only applies to a very special mode
that's inside bluetooth I which is very
low bandwidth only 100 and 920 something
like that kilobits per second now the
most I got here was a thousand kilobits
a second so it's 10 times less on this
long distance speed long distant
long-distance setting so that isn't
getting any good for for streaming audio
but in terms of what we do today with
our headsets and with our speakers
Bluetooth Low Energy using audio over
Bluetooth Low Energy
could become a reality and it will work
I'm going from Android and I hope you've
enjoyed all these Bluetooth 5 videos
that I've done so I'm really happy
actually managed to get Bluetooth 5
working over the Samsung s8 to the
Nordic semiconductors test board it does
work and I am getting a megabit a second
when using them in very close range
which other well I hope you enjoyed this
