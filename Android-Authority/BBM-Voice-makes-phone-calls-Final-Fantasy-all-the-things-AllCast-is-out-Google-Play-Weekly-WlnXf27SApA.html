brought to you by netflix head to
netflix.com / android for your free
30-day trial hello again ladies and
gentlemen I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority afgan and welcome back to the
last episode of Google Play weekly in
the year 2013 we had a major holiday
last week but the application ecosystem
continued to chug right along we're
going to talk about the Final Fantasy 6
teaser trailer the interesting journey
that rom manager had and a whole lot
more so let's get started amazon is
running a promotion right now that's
continuing until december 28th where if
you download an application from the
amazon appstore you'll get a five dollar
credit so you can go buy more the best
part of the promotion is you don't have
to buy an app to get the five dollar
credit you can buy an app or download a
free one and you'll still get it
obviously this is Amazon trying to
entice new users onto their ecosystem
and if they're giving away free stuff
we're totally okay with it act fast
though the deal is almost over if you're
one of the 40 million people using BBM
then 2014 is going to be an exciting
year for you included in the features
planned is easier sharing more emoticons
bbm channels and BBM voice the
interesting two are obviously the
channels and voice features channels are
like those old AOL Instant Messenger
topic chats where you go in and chat
with people not on your contact list
about various things BBM voice will let
you make free voice calls to any other
bbm user using only your data pay
attention to that one folks because that
one's going to be interesting when it
comes out have you ever wanted to see
where you've been with your device a
google maps feature posted on reddit
allows you to see where you've been with
your device but only as long as you let
Google track your data you can see your
maps by going to maps google com /
location history if you don't allow
google to track your data your map will
obviously be empty for those of us that
do you can see pretty much everywhere
you've been with your device shown is my
personal map from thursday december 26
as you can see i wandered around my
house for a little bit and that one spot
that's far away from the cluster that's
me taking out the garbage as you can see
it can get quite detailed we've talked a
few times on this show about Square Enix
is inevitable remake of Final Fantasy 6
which is due out sometime this winter at
the Jump Festa 2014 expo square enix
released a low definition trailer
showcasing some of the new graphics
the reactions were mixed on one hand a
remake is coming which is great but they
didn't give the game the graphical
overhaul that many Final Fantasy fans
including this guy believes it deserves
for fanatics it'll be a must-buy title
regardless however for a more casual fan
Square may not have given the game
enough of an overhaul to make it worth
it enter the last bit of news this week
rom manager along with helium were
removed from the Google Play Store due
to in app purchase problems the problems
were fixed and the apps are now back up
the problem was rather simple actually
in both apps there was an option to pay
with paypal instead of Google's Google
Wallet this of course is against the
Play Store rules and thus the apps were
removed thankfully they've been updated
to get rid of the offending issue and
are both back in the play store right
now so who wants to check out some
trending applications as usual if you
want to check any of these applications
out you can find the links in the
written companion in the video
description I'll cast from couche the
same guy who does rom manager and helium
mentioned earlier is now available in
the Google Play Store there's a free
demo that lets you stream a measly one
minute of videos you'll have to fork out
the five dollars to get everything to
work if that's not too much it's a
really good app to pick up super-g nes
is pretty much the premier super
nintendo emulator available on android
over the last week it's been updated to
include a lot of under the hood changes
that should improve game compatibility
and audio quality it also fixes a
long-standing bug on the Nexus 10 so if
you're into emulators this one is worth
owning okay so square enix is actually a
developer and not a game but they are
tossing quite the sale at the moment
where most of the Final Fantasy titles
are about fifty percent off this
includes Final Fantasy 1 2 3 4 5 and
dimensions Chrono Trigger chaos rings KO
springs omega crystal defender and
pretty much everything else they do if
you love their content but thought it
was a little bit too expensive this is a
great time to get them for a more
reasonable price swiftkey has undergone
a lot of changes this year and they
ended the year with a pretty decent sale
it's over now unfortunately but there
are a few apps that made a bigger splash
than swiftkey in 2013 if you're looking
for what many consider to be the best
third-party keyboard available we
recommend giving swiftkey a try another
great app that's having a big sale is
camera zoom FX it's on sale right now
for fifty percent off and if you've been
looking for a camera replacement app
that's packed to the gills with features
this is a great one to have it was even
included on our best camera apps list
once again I'm Joe Hindy the android
authority app guy don't forget to some
grab to our YouTube channel and check

you're hanging out for a minute we have
