handy the Android authority app guy and
happy Friday everybody this week we're
going to talk about Google Play and
PayPal running applications on devices
that usually shouldn't be able to run
them and a lot of other awesome news so
let's get started in our first bit of
news this week you can now pay for
applications using PayPal this is kind
of a huge deal for a long time Google
has had preferential treatment of their
own Google Wallet platform so to see
PayPal show up like this is actually
kind of surprising for now PayPal is
supported in only twelve countries
including the US Germany and Canada
according to the Android developers blog
this is to help make payments more
seamless that's not all that's going on
along with the paypal support google has
also added carrier billing and Google
Play gift cards to a number of countries
worldwide developers in 13 new countries
can now sell their apps on the Google
Play Store lastly it adds an additional
information screen to app pages
simplified headers easier to read
permissions and more if you want more
info on the tweet UI you should follow
this guy on Google+ whose name I won't
even pretend to know how to pronounce
the speaking of new things Plex now
supports camera upload okay so here's
what this means if you have a Plex past
subscription than Plex will begin to
automatically upload your camera roll to
your Plex library for future viewing
where ever you can use Plex as usual you
can turn them off in the settings and
set it to upload only when over mobile
data or Wi-Fi as you prefer as stated
you need to have a Plex past
subscription for this to work oh and as
usual there were the boilerplate bug
fixes and performance improvements in
the update and now for the news that
likely got you to click on this video in
the first place there is now a way to
run iOS apps on Android yes it's true
friends dub cider the projects ultimate
goal is to allow totally unmodified iOS
apps to run on Android here's the short
version essentially some science
students from Columbia University
developed cider which is essentially a
compatibility layer that fools iOS apps
into believing that the Android Linux
kernel is the xnu kernel that runs on
iOS this could have some pretty epic
ramifications with interests ranging
from individual users to businesses
it'll be interesting to find out exactly
how Android users get ahold of iOS apps
since the Apple App Store is it the most
open place ever it's also worth noting
that this is still in the
type phase and it's not altogether clear
if the project will keep going because
it was originally done as a research
project personally I hope someone picks
it up because this would be awesome this
was a triumph
I'm making a note here huge success so
portal was released on May 12th as
scheduled but owners of Nvidia's
handheld Android power gaming system got
a bit of a surprise because half-life 2
was released right alongside it both are
available right now for shield for the
not so low price of $9.99 each portal is
currently rocking a 5.0 rating in the
Google Play Store with half-life 2
earning a respectable 4.9 at this time
it'll be interesting to see if he's ever
make it to non shield devices but with
the recent price drop to $199 the shield
is looking like a better device all the
time now the speaking of applications
that shouldn't be able to run on your
device a new app called port app lets
you run om skin apps on other devices
it's called port adapt and it was
released by the aptly named XD a member
app maker here's how it works the app is
actually a collection of apks that allow
you to run apps from OAM skinned roms
included our apps from Sony Samsung
signage and mod Nokia and others and you
can run them on pretty much any device
the app is a great idea but it is
limited for the time being there aren't
many apps you can choose from but we
assume the list will grow with time it's
also worth noting that you cannot get
ported app in the Google Play Store you
must head to xda-developers download it
and then manually install the APK if you
want to try it we'll have a link to it
in the written companion so who wants to
see some trending applications as usual
if you want to check any of these
applications out you can find the links
in the written companion which is in the
video description below first up this
week is an application called bright
weather and it's done by the same
developers who brought us the insanely
popular beautiful widgets at its core
bright weather is just another weather
application you can find weather in your
area or around the world view local
forecasts view radar and some more
unique features like a weather Almanac
what makes this app nice is the design
which includes new background images
daily and more interactive elements than
usual it's free in the Google Play Store
right now if you want to try it out next
up is a little time waster game called
make it rain in this game you swipe up
on a pile of money to make money and
then you spend it on other things that
make you money every action in this game
only serves to making more money except
the FBI spin wheel which actually takes
away money it's a lot of fun and short
runs and it's definitely something a
little different it's also free Monument
Valley is an optical illusion based
puzzle game that's both fun to look at
and fun to play the level design in this
title is one of a kind and while the
game is pretty short few people seem to
be regretting spending the $3.99 the
game is going for in the Google Play
Store the music gameplay and artwork all
seem to seamlessly blend together in a
stunning presentation that you can enjoy
with your eyes and with your ears if you
have four dollars to spend check this
one out next up is per app modes which
is one of the best fruit apps ever it
was updated to version 2.0 which added
bug fixes performance improvements a
polished up ey multi selection support
and many other smaller UI and
performance tweaks to make things better
for those who may not know per app modes
is a root application that lets you set
the maximum and minimum CPU speeds on
various applications along with other
variables this can help improve
performance on heavy games save battery
on less CPU intensive apps and give you
more control over how your device acts
it's a dollar ninety-nine and if you're
a root user you should go give this one
a look last up this week is an
application that's perfect for travelers
called grab my charger the premise for
this application is simple it uses your
phone's GPS and an alarm to make sure
you grab your charger when you leave it
seems useless for normal folks but if
you're traveling leaving your phone
charger behind can suck a whole bunch so
what you do is set the alarm and you
plug in your charger and when you leave
without it the app will send you a
notification so you can go back and get
it it's free for a limited time right
now so go check it out once again I'm
