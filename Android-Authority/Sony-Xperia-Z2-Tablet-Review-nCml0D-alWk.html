with their vision of a tablet one that
we really liked and deemed one of the
best of 2013 now with their latest
offering Sony keeps things mostly as
sleek as before but continues the
evolution of the Xperia line hey it's
Josh fer from Andhra Authority what's
going on everybody and this is a Sony
Xperia z2 tablet much like the name
implies the Xperia Tablet is supposed to
be much like its smartphone counterparts
only much bigger you'll see this notion
permeate throughout the review but first
let's take a look at design in this
10-inch tablet you do get the black
slate design in full effect with glass
on the front and plastic on the back and
the sizable bezel around the 10-inch
screen does make this look a little bit
like a picture frame of sorts but I like
to think that it's more like a small
Sony TV because it does pack quite a bit
of that power screen nuts might think
the bezels are too much but in reality
they really help with the handling of
the device as you are able to grip the
tablet easily on all sides by resting
your thumb in that space and it truly
makes a difference and makes the bezel
more welcome than shunned and if you
look closely on the sides of the screens
lower third you'll find the dual speaker
setup always a welcome feature of a
tablet experience one of the first
things you'll notice once you get this
tablet in your hands is how thin it is
after all six point four millimeters is
the measurements on the thickness and it
makes this one of the thinnest and
Nimbus tablets that you'll ever see out
there and slab is really the idea that I
get here as you're going to wonder how
something so compact in its thickness
can provide so much power the signature
silver power button and volume rockers
are on the left complete with the stiff
but meaty press to them a headphone jack
is left on the lower panel while the top
of the tablet houses an IR blaster along
with a flap that gives access to microSD
card slot and the micro USB charging
ports and as you may already expect from
experience devices these days those
flaps mean that this tablet is rated for
water and dust resistance helping the z2
tablet brave the elements users of the
previous Xperia tablet Z will notice a
better feel all around helped primarily
by the fact that the skeleton has been
smoothed out on the corners by the same
plastic mixer
that comprises the back this is a good
change from the rigid corners of the
original end does well to provide that
much more comfort in usage finally on
the back the material is of a plastic
that is somewhere between hard and soft
touch it has a little more to it than
the soft touch found on the likes of say
the Nexus 7 but it retains its
propensity to get smudged handling is
basically what you would expect from a
10-inch tablet but perhaps it's at its
best in Sony's capable hands and that is
because again I'll say the bezel around
the screen you are able to grip the
tablet pretty easily because there's a
lot of real estate outside of the screen
for you to rest your hand and then of
course the actual thinness of the device
provides a very nimble and light
experience so you might find yourself
throwing this tablet around like I've
been doing already in this review just
because you can and it feels comfortable
and easy to do the display of the Xperia
z2 tablet gets the same change as its
smartphone counterpart mainly the move
to an IPS matrix that helped the
experienced you to get even better
display quality along with better
viewing angles you get the same
advantages on this much larger screen
with a resolution of 1920 by 1200 and a
respectable pixel density of 224 pixels
per inch
now Sony's own enhancements of the live
color LED which adds extra colors to the
already established LCD color gamut
along with the triluminos and then the
ex reality for media viewing basically
all of this means that you get a display
with very deep contrast and great color
production resulting in an experience
that is quite cinematic in nature and if
I may say very much what you think Sony
would interpret media viewing and though
the pixel density might be lower than
found on certain competitors I found no
reason to fault the reading experience
here text is still very sharp and it's
not hard to read at all so ultimately
you'll be getting a lot of watching
movies reading books or magazines and
playing games on here and you'll have a
great time doing any of those things
which makes the z2 tablet a great media
consumption device and all of that fun
is accomplished with the help of a great
processing package the kind of which are
probably already expecting the
Snapdragon 801 clocked in at 2.3
gigahertz backed by the audrina 330 and
three gigabytes of RAM provide the sheer
power you need to perform basically
anything that the Android ecosystem has
to offer and while the high resolution
of the screen might be somewhat to blame
for this I did see from time to time the
slight stutter when moving between apps
and even somewhat during basic tasks
like swiping through home screens
nothing that really broke my experience
or make it tough to get what I needed
done however and when gaming I saw no
issues with pretty much any game that I
played on here whether they were sprite
based or 3d and multitasking takes on a
pretty simplistic motif with the Xperia
I and the recent apps button and perhaps
with the small apps as well but the main
takeaway here is that all of it works
about as well as it should without any
major hiccups of course which has always
been the case with Xperia devices the
marquee feature is the IP certification
if you really need to watch that movie
while enjoying a relaxing bath you can
otherwise you can be as clumsy as you
want to be with your beverages around
this tablet and it will be fine now the
bits and pieces that are found
underneath the surface of the z2 tablet
include that wide array of connectivity
tools that you're probably used to
already including NFC which you have the
marker right there and you can pretty
much say that Sony is the master of NFC
at this point because they like to
integrate it into pretty much every
device these days you can even set up
your Xperia z2 with the tablet to make
it a real companion even screen
mirroring is possible though the future
I would probably use the most is the
built-in network tether an IR blaster
allows you to control your TV with the
tablet's remote control app and after
that you get the general slew of
connections though my version is Wi-Fi
only the dual front-facing speakers on
the tablet are very much like the ones
found on the smartphone counterparts
they do get pretty loud the sound could
use a little bit more richness but
ultimately for a media consumption
device like this tablet they are a very
very welcome addition
the sound experience can be catered to
your liking with quite a few
enhancements built into the sound
settings menu they can bring up the
sheer loudness or just the clarity of
the audio quality I did like that the
tablet is able to perform the same noise
canceling as the smartphone but my unit
did not come with the headphones that
are needed for that to happen it's a bit
of a shame but if you can get your own
pair of those earbuds you'll get a
wonderful audio experience that is very
Sony like in quality battery life is
supported by a lot of power saving
features but also that's 6,000 milliamp
hour unit within what kind of struck me
the most about this tablet was well it's
standby time I did use this tablet for a
little while before I went off to
Beijing the other week and when I
returned what I had originally left at
30 percent battery life still had 20%
left after 5 days and I was able to pick
up the tablet and continue doing what I
was doing on it five days before I went
with one of my classic battery life
tests here putting on my media
consumption hat and watching two
episodes of Top Gear which got the
battery life down from 90 percent to 72
percent which I thought was pretty good
you'll be able to watch a couple movies
easily on here and still have more than
half the battery life left over for
browsing the web and getting any other
tasks you need done now cameras on
tablets are always a bit tough to give
big recommendations to primarily because
it's fairly obvious that you're not
trying to buy a tablet solely for its
camera capabilities and the lack of a
flash diode someone tells the story of
the camera experience as the optics are
more of a required addition rather than
a defining feature I will come in Sony
for trying to outfit the app with quite
a few features that you will find in the
smartphone like the background defocus
or the AR effect but without the quality
to back them up they're just novelties
and ultimately not very useful at all
and also the 8 megapixel optics are
plagued by a similar issue that you find
on Xperia smartphones you can't use the
full resolution if you want to be able
to shoot at 16 by 9 at which point you
will have to use 5 megapixels instead
picture quality thus is passable at best
you won't get anything from this camera
that rivals the smartphone you already
have in your pocket probably especially
if it's the Xperia z2 the only
application
generally find for a tablet cameras is
if you're just sitting back on your
couch and you want to send a snapchat or
share something that's maybe sitting on
the table in front of you the experience
software experience is largely what you
may already be used to from other
experiences this time just blown up for
a tablet size what has always been at
least to me a success of the Xperia UI
is that well it doesn't really try too
hard and like I always say when you keep
it simple to keep it fast
Sony's very stylized take on Android
KitKat retains the rather simple home
screen experience with the app drawer
accessible from the top right allowing
you a canvas that you can fill with
icons and widgets galore get into the
app drawer and you'll find a quick pull
over from the left that allows you a few
shortcuts and some customization options
as is the case with most tablet
interfaces you pull down on the left and
get a look at your notifications and
then on the right you can get the quick
settings that are editable the recent
apps screen houses the main edition of
the small apps ultimately only sometimes
useful overlays that go over your
workspace for quick multitasking under
the settings areas you are able to
personalize the user interface using a
number of different downloadable themes
as you can see here with the spider-man
theme that was free as some of them you
have to pay for and even though the
background that a number of system areas
are changed like the bar on the bottom
and the bar on top the icons remain the
same so there's that and finally you
have the different applications that
Sony implanted into the tablet like the
Walkman which is still one of my
favorite looking local music players and
I would use it all the time if my music
wasn't already in the cloud the album
and movies applications allow you a nice
looking interface for your different
pictures and videos and of course there
is sony's own media market called
unlimited and it has a stage along with
the PlayStation mobile but honestly the
both of them don't really offer anything
more than stylized way of looking at
content that may already be available on
the Play Store
once again Sony shows us that even
though the things I it puts into its
devices might not ultimately be useful
for a number of people out there at
least they don't come off as bloat and
bog down the system which eventually
mean that the Xperia UI is one of the
better streamlined Android iterations
out there so you can get the Sony Xperia
z2 tablet for about $550 on online
retailers and that is a premium price
point
but in a way you can argue that you get
what you pay for because this is a
pretty premium device from the build
quality down to the software experience
maybe - that camera there are some
competitors out there like the Samsung
Galaxy Tab pro 10 which provides a
largely similar experience but has a
higher resolution and of course
Samsung's own version of Android so if
you're going to pay the premium price
for this tablet right here it's probably
because of Sony's own style and you
think that perhaps Sony rocks Android a
little bit better and then of course
there is the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014
edition but its main trump card is of
course that s-pen if you really don't
need a stylus experience or the
multitasking that Samsung does put into
its tablets well then you do still have
one of the best media consumption
devices here after all Sony style is
really sometimes hard to deny and the
Xperia z2 tablet does feel premium
enough in a number of respects to
multiply its higher cost Sony is entry
into the tablet game started over a year
ago but we're glad to see that they kept
the best of the Xperia tablet Z and
brought even more to offer in this
second iteration as far as media
consumption goes you can't really get
any better than this tablet right here
especially if you put down the extra
money for those noise cancelling
headphones that are compatible with it
and when you hold the power of a small
Sony TV in your hand with all of the
power of the Xperia z2 smartphone you
really do have something special and
that is definitely what the z2 tablet
feels like when you're just too busy
