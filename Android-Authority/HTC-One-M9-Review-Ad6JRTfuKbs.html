software and shifts the ultrapixel focus
but is it enough to differentiate itself
from the rest including its own past
iterations
well it's Josh regard from Android
authority what's going on everybody and
this is my full review of the HTC One m9
few people have argued in the past
couple of years that HTC really has the
design of the one down and in the m9
this same design language continues
perhaps bringing what people loved about
the m7 and molding it together with the
changes that were made in the m8 almost
quite literally as you might see in this
close-up of the frame a sharper edge
returns and rises to meet the panel up
front the result of being a deliberate
separation between the two sides the
frame also has been given a coat of
paint and the main version of this phone
sports a subtle hint of gold that isn't
too gaudy and blends in well to make the
phone actually quite neutral in its
coloration but that new edge does mean
that the phone is a little bit meteor
than before the general elements are the
same with the front-facing speakers
being the design headline of the HTC one
bringing a great audio experience for
media consumption and yes the HTC Barr
is still on the bottom of the front
panel but this is something that has
never really bothered us here at Android
authority though we know that it is
still a sore point for some users coming
around the back the brush male design
makes a return but has also been given
that subtle tone down from the m8 its
material feel is a little better this
time around so slippage is not as much
of an issue as it was last year couple
this with the new edges on the sides and
ergonomically this just might be the
best HTC One phone in terms of handling
and now there was a much larger camera
optic package on the back as well with
the 20 point seven megapixel camera
coming without the dual camera this year
which removes the extra eye that was on
top of the One m8 speaking of the sides
the button layout now falls in line with
general Android lexicon with the power
and volume rockers now housed all on the
right side the power button is textured
differently from the others which helps
with recognition but one thing that we
did notice is that it is a bit low on
the phone this might not be an issue for
let's say left-handed users but when
trying to wake the phone with the right
hands you might have to reach down a
little bit lower than is fully
comfortable all in all the HTC continues
with this design language and it is the
shining perhaps literally example of how
a fly
device could be and probably to some
people should be constructed even if it
is a little bit thicker than before and
has that edge on the side that can cause
a little bit of a pinch still there's no
denying how good the phone looks how
much better it feels now and how the old
adage of the today broke don't fix it
applies here and we applaud HTC for
sticking to their guns and keeping the
design of the one pretty familiar for
that very reason
HTC also sticks to a tried-and-true
display experience with a 1080p panel
that will look and feel incredibly
familiar to flagship phone users of the
past say year or so at five inches this
screen also pumps 441 PPI adhering to
the standard that we've been enjoying
for quite some time now though quad HD
is the new fad these days HTC seems to
understand that it could hurt the
battery life and they prefer not to risk
that happening with their one that being
said you'd be hard-pressed to have a bad
time with a 1080p display like this
compared to the overachieving 2k screens
filling the market right now colors
still look quite rich though the blacks
on the Super LCD three screen might fall
low short of the contrast found on say
AMOLED panels but it isn't far off by
any means our unit at least shows a
warmer display than previously observed
in HTC One devices which isn't a
detractor but we felt was a worthy
detail to mention text looks as sharp as
it should and everything still does
justice to the forms of media
consumption and gaming at least in my
experience perhaps one day we'll get an
HTC one with a quad HD resolution but
given the experience that we have here
we're not looking at raw specifications
really driving this device it's more
about what you get to do in the user
experience and given the display that we
have here are still performing as well
as we would like well there are no
complaints here
speaking of performance the HTC One m9
already impressed us in our first look
as one of the fastest iterations of
android available thus far and if this
is a trend we're going to see in current
flagships we're excited to see it all
happen in the case of the m9 the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 makes a
reappearance and brings the Adreno 430
and 3 gigabytes of RAM for graphics and
multitasking and we got to tell you this
phone is a speed beast this has as much
to do with the Sense UI as it does with
the processor itself which has had a bit
of a bad go of it since its inception
but HTC does well to showcase the power
of this device by putting an operating
system that is Spartan enough to
consistently go transitions in and out
of the general interface are smooth and
noticeable somewhat shortening of the
certain animations further lends to the
flying speed of this interface even
multitasking is a breeze as HTC opted to
keep their grid layout instead of the
cards as the default two recent apps
screen I do feel like I have to address
one of the concerns that have come up in
the past week or so about the one m9 and
it's processing package the idea that it
gets really hot under heavy Bunch
marking now I don't really do heavy
benchmarking for reviews as much
nowadays because I'd rather give you the
day-to-day experience but I will tell
you that the phone did get pretty warm
under certain types of load in my case
it was one gaming for extended periods
of time and when using the phone on a
turbocharger it actually wasn't enough
to make me put the phone down in
discomfort but it was enough to really
make me take notice Hardware takes on a
pretty similar outlook is found in
previous iterations with the media
consumption experience still taking
center stage and that starts with the
expandable storage found at hop D 32
gigabytes already built in the boom
sound speakers returned and are now
backed by dolby enhancements which can
be easily found in the settings screen
and this front facing speaker
combination still stands as one of the
best out there for everything from music
to gaming to videos
they even work well for speaker phone
calls but the call quality is still in
general as good as it should be with no
dropped calls or complaints on t-mobile
from me though I have to mention that
this is an international model of the
one m9 and as such I haven't been able
to use it on LTE networks with it
turning on the phone from the prone
position can still be done using the
motion launch gestures which detect the
phone being brought up first after which
you can double tap the screen to wake
swipe a number of ways for other
functions or hit the volume down button
to quickly get to the camera we do like
this functionality but we wish that we
could double tap the phone to wake while
it's sitting on a table and finally in
battery life an embedded 28 40 million
power battery brings the somewhat
above-average battery life to the phone
typical day to day moderate usage makes
the phone go for up to a day and a half
with few problems though this example
comes from a day full of gaming and
picture taking after which the phone
conked out at about 10 hours basically
we're still looking for a better outlook
in the battery life Department and it
seems fast charging is going to be the
consolation prize will be given until
that time comes finally we make it to
the camera which was a big point of
contention with the previous version of
the one this time around we don't get
ultra pixels nor there claims of good
low-light performance like we did before
as now these claims are relegated to the
front of the phone for better
self-portraits and you know what that
was a pretty good move though you won't
be able to use a flash to fill in the
darkness the ultra pixel camera proves
itself in plenty of situations when used
as a front-facing camera it is the
twenty point seven megapixel optics that
are the real story here as HTC has moved
into the realm of very large picture
taking experiences you have split
capture and photo booth returning from
the desire line bringing a couple of fun
ways to capture your memories and if you
actually do miss the dual camera for its
depth of field capabilities there is
still a bouquet mode that tries to
alleviate this by using the more
conventional method of taking multiple
shots of the same scene in order to make
the subject pop it works pretty well and
the speed of capture further proves this
is a better method than last year's
oddly uneven duo camera video
capabilities include 4k recording now
though the lack of optical image
stabilization could result in some shaky
footage so what does a move to 20
megapixels mean for HTC's newest phone
sadly it doesn't amount to too much more
because
the way the fun processes picture data
is about the same as before and that's
not a very good thing even smaller
pictures from ultra pixel optics from
before would be fine if the noise was
processed in a better manner but the
poor post-processing of the data into 20
megapixel pictures are exacerbated when
zoomed in now an F 2.2 aperture is
actually not too shabby but the camera
still has to opt for the highest ISO
limit of 1600 to fill in the darkness
and this will always lead to noise as
you can see here pictures are full of it
to begin with and that's to be expected
but zoom in to the photos and you'll see
a lot of artifacts accompanying the
noise including a smudging effect that
is supposed to help but only makes the
photo look less accurate in detail
though a higher megapixel count might be
nice for the general user the camera
still suffers from the same low-light
issues as predecessors in much better
lighting situations more usable photos
can be had but there aren't issues there
as well mainly with exposure HTC opts
for the typical metering based on the
point of focus but this doesn't take
into account what is around that point
the results can lead to often blown out
portions of pictures or the opposite if
you choose to focus and expose on a
shinier portion of the scene it's almost
as if the scene itself has to be perfect
or even have even lighting in order to
yield a great shot and that can be the
case as good photos are definitely
possible with the m9 but because of
these issues they're not as common as we
would like
HDR helps a little bit to even out the
exposures but it isn't a practical
feature to use especially when the
shutter speed has to be very slow
already to get a decent shot and then
you have to be steady for a long time
before processing even begins now one
thing we're eager to test out is the
supposed pro mode that is coming to the
m9 where photos will be taken in RAW
format but that mode won't be made
available until later the reason why I
want to test out the pro mode and I'm
really eager to is so that I can take
the raw photos and process them myself
in a program like Lightroom and perhaps
I can find a way of creating the photos
that have the post-processing needed
that HTC doesn't seem to get in the m9
yet
finally in software I already mentioned
that this is a simply fast version of
sense powered by the Snapdragon 810 but
the new version of HTC UI has a few new
tricks up its sleeve but first a general
look at the still familiar interface
vertical Abbe drawer for example darker
tones all around and the inclusion of
the blink
you can hunker down into the actual
publications or phoebs that you choose
to get new stories and updates from but
now there are a few contextual additions
like food recommendations especially
around meal times of the day certain
blocks will appear suggesting places to
eat this might not be useful for
everyone but at least the effect isn't
too invasive the one that might be a
little intrusive is the feature that
puts these recommendations on the lock
screen in a morning bundle while it is
something you can turn off I've had it
on since receiving this unit and I
actually haven't seen it pop up which is
a little bit odd since itself updates to
version 7 but this basically means two
big enhancements the home widget and the
themes engine the home widget is
basically a place where you can find
your most used applications and it
changes based on your contextual
location it works fairly well keeping in
mind how often you use certain
applications in multiple locations the
folders that accompany it provide an
easy spot for your most recently
downloaded applications and a folder for
suggestions on what to install next
which could be useful but thankfully can
be turned off if you don't want it there
and the theme engine is perhaps our
favorite addition to sense as it changes
more than just the colors of parts of
the UI and is one of the most
customizable first-party iterations
we've seen on a flagship device while
there are already a bevy of themes
available in the store you can also
create your own by taking your home
screen wallpaper and letting the theme
engine find the colors to match it this
is a pretty powerful and actually really
cool customization tool that we feel
many users may take advantage of and
even without these key additions sin
still remains one of the most Spartan
versions of Android that we've seen yet
and its speed and its ease of use make
it one of the more accessible versions
of Android that we would be glad to
recommend to people who are looking for
a new phone official price points for
the HTC One m9 are trickling in and the
phone is available for pre-order now we
expect the price of the m9 to come at
the premium price for contracts and at
least $600 off those contracts which is
typical for flagship devices competitors
in the same bracket include the
different flagships coming out this year
like the Samsung Galaxy s6 though we
will provide a mention to its
predecessor the HTC One m8 this is
because the previous HTC device might
still be of a good value if you think
the m9 hasn't really done enough to
distance itself from its past
and so there you have it the HTC One m9
a beautiful package with lovely software
that really only has one gaping hole the
camera experience while it isn't the
worst shooter in the high-end market it
does feel a few steps behind the
competition and for many users this
feeling might permeate throughout the
device as much of the m9 feels perhaps
too familiar for some but that isn't
really a bad thing to us for the design
and software as the refining of what
made the One m7 nmh so desired keeps
this phone looking and feeling great on
the inside and out underneath the
surface users can be sure that they're
getting a top-notch user experience in
the speedy functional and not too
cluttered Sense UI for a daily driver
this is still a compelling choice as
long as the budding smartphone
photographer can look past the camera
deficiencies though a rethinking of the
camera processing might be in order
we fully applaud HTC for sticking to
their guns and basically all other
aspects of this phone as veterans and
newcomers alike can enjoy the best that
HTC has to offer in the HTC One m9 so as
always thank you guys very much for
watching and I hope you enjoyed this
review of the HTC One m9 while it is
still a beautiful package and personally
I love the way that it looks and feels
and runs given the processing package
and the combination with Sense UI
unfortunately for a lot of you users out
there you might need to look past the
camera deficiencies to find what might
be one of the best-looking flagships
this year but we still have even more to
tell you about the HTC One m9 as we've
hit it against its competition we're
going to put it against the Samsung
Galaxy s6 for example so you can keep it
