the android authority app guy after the
intro we're gonna be taking a closer
look at the Croods the Croods is based
on a movie that will be hitting theaters
March 22nd 2013 it has some pretty big
stars like Nicolas Cage Cloris Leachman
Bryan Reynolds and Emma Watson the game
itself is a collaborative effort between
the well-known creator of Angry Birds
Rovio along with the widely popular
animation studio DreamWorks if you are
going into this hoping for another
addictive yet repetitive level based
game like Angry Birds you're going to be
disappointed in reality the Croods plays
more like your standard Facebook flash
game this includes the time constraints
when performing actions having access to
in app purchases and the gradual unlocks
of new features items and areas the
premise of the game is that you need to
capture wild prehistoric animals you
then need to tame them build them homes
and feed them when you feed them they
produce new items that you can then use
to build more things
this dynamic continues indefinitely as
there's always animals to feed and
things to build in addition you complete
chores given to you by gran which earns
you some experience and coins usually
they're pretty simple and involve
capturing animals removing trees feeding
animals or collecting items you unlock
more chores as you progress through the
game and gain levels if you find that
you have a boatload of items that you
just can't unload Buga will make you
soup in exchange for raw items the soup
can be used to upgrade animals and
there's a darn fine handy way to grind
for gold coins
the graphics are on par with most
Facebook games which is nice because
those games are typically played on a PC
and this is an Android game the style of
graphics is classic DreamWorks and
you'll have no trouble discerning which
characters are which from the movie the
soundtrack is very meth and that's
really all we can say about it moving
around the game is usually pretty smooth
unless you have an older Android device
there are animations to show that things
are happening and the people do move
around some but it's nothing
groundbreaking overall it wasn't a
visually impressive experience but it
did look better than average grabbing
this game from the Google Play Store is
free beware though as it is a freemium
title so you can purchase items like
gold coins and crystals with real-life
money you can play through the game
without being required to buy these
items but it is very tedious and we'll
definitely take longer to get to the
later parts of the game this is actually
our least favorite mechanic in the game
and many reviewers on the Google Play
Store agree the game is pretty fun and
addictive when you start out but once
you run low on coins and crystals the
game slows to a new
halt unless you spend cash the game
quickly becomes a grind for coins and
crystals well it doesn't stop it from
being fun at first
tedious grinding for the same coins and
crystals gets tiresome after a while if
you're a fan of Facebook flash games
like Farmville or cafe world then you
should feel right at home with the
Croods however more serious gamers will
be immediately irritated once they get
to the point where it's just a tedious
grind for gold and crystal the best we
can say about it is that at least they
don't make you pay to download the app
overall this game showed a lot of
promise after all the Angry Birds
franchise has over a billion downloads
and DreamWorks is generally considered
to be a positive force in the movie
industry to that end the gameplay does
have the potential to be addicting and
it is a good-looking game however the
game is severely bottlenecked as players
will have to resource grind for copious
amounts of time just to advance unless
they want to shell out a lot of money if
these kind of titles are your thing
you'll definitely love the Croods if
you're a more serious gamer then you may
want to look elsewhere to put it simply
