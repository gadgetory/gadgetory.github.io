review of which we have one right here
and they obviously come with a brand new
idea to smartphones called the moto mods
now essentially if we take off the cover
here we have the magnets on the top and
bottom and all of these connector pins
which allow for a number of new
capabilities when you slap on mods to
the back of this phone now we already
alluded to how we felt about the moto
mods and our full review of the Moto Z
and the Moto Z force but it's time to
give them a closer look it's Josh
freghar from Android thority what's
going on everybody
and these are our review of the Moto
mods we start off with the JBL sound
boost speaker which is this large unit
right here that obviously makes the Moto
Z a much larger device especially if
you're using the Moto Z force the JBL
sound boost speaker has a couple of big
drivers on the back and a cutout for the
camera optic package and no you do not
get any vignetting when you're using the
camera when using this mod on the back
as well but you may not want to even use
the camera while you have the mod on
anyway those two large drivers will
allow for stereo sound and in the middle
of them is a nice red accented kickstand
that will allow the phone to be in plain
view but there's actually another
advantage to having this kickstand on
there which we'll get into in a little
bit the inner portion of the Sambu
speaker has an interesting pattern
design along with a button that will
allow for the checking of the battery
level and then there is a USB type-c
charging port there as well so you can
charge the 1000 milliamp hour battery
now 1000 milliamp hours doesn't really
sound like a lot but it is dedicated to
just powering the speaker and to JBL and
moto have said that this battery can go
for up to 10 hours now while we actually
didn't go from 0 to 10 hours to bring
the battery from 100 to 0 we did notice
that it went for a really long time
especially if you have it at half volume
we're pretty confident that you can get
up to those 10 hours with this
that said sound from the speaker is
incredible when you consider that it is
being attached to a phone you have a
front facing speaker on the Moto Z and
the Moto G force which does a decent job
really it's not all that great or not
all that bad per se but once you attach
this speaker to the back it just changes
the entire experience there's a lot of
body and richness to the sound it
actually gets incredibly loud enough to
fill a room even if it doesn't
necessarily create a surround sound feel
if you have it on a surface like a desk
or a table having the kickstand out
actually bounces the sound off of the
surface that it is leaning on which is a
great idea because it helps to
reverberate the sound a little bit
better it's really hard not to recommend
such a convenient way of getting a lot
of sound out of the Moto Z and the Moto
G force and at $80 it might be somewhat
more expensive than even some Bluetooth
standalone speakers that are out there
that provide arguably better sound but
at the very least the JBL sound boosts
speaker is one of the great examples of
how the Moto mods can really add to the
Moto experience
which brings us to what might arguably
be the most important of all of the moto
mods that are currently available the
incipio off-grid power pack now this
power pack here is a white color with a
matted finish that does help with a lot
of grip definitely helps with the
all-metal design of the Moto Z which can
slip about from time to time it also
adds a significant amount of girth to
the phone so again you are going to get
a heavier device because of the mod now
power packs of different colors and
styles will be made available so while
you are adding to the battery life of
your Moto Z or Moto Z force you can also
do so in some style 2,200 milliamp hours
is what you get extra in the power pack
on top of the already existing batteries
of the Moto Z and Moto z-force but
there's another benefit to having the
power pack in that it does include
wireless charging it not only need
wireless charging to be charged
standalone it also adds wireless
charging to the entire Moto Z experience
and by sliding this onto there you can
just put it onto any qi wireless charger
and it will charge not only the phone
but also the battery pack itself
simultaneously and when using the power
pack on the Moto Z you do have a couple
of different ways of draining that
battery you could use it as a straight
charger just to charge the phone when
you need that power or you can put it in
an efficiency mode essentially you use
the power pack already on the phone and
it only activates in order to keep the
phone at 80% but in either case I was
able to get between one to two hours
more on the Moto Z and moto Z force more
realistically I did use it for obviously
Pokemon go and it was able to get me
another hour of screen on time overall
incipio power packs will start at $59.99
and go up to about 89 99 as we were told
which hopefully means higher capacities
for these power packs but there are
going to be other styles so that could
dictate the price as well when there's a
level of convenience like this to
getting more power out of a smartphone
it's really not something you can pass
up so if you're getting a moto Z or a
moto Z force we do recommend that the
incipio power pack be part of your
purchase as well and finally we take a
look at the insta sir
projector now this is a standalone
projector that latches on to the Moto Z
to mirror the display on to
a projected pico projector image now you
might recognize this idea from a Lenovo
yoga tablet and we think that it's
influences are pretty apparent here that
said however this is a pico projector
that latches onto the back of the moto Z
devices and there is a kickstand that is
available so you can angle the image
onto any surface flanking the actual
projector is a wheel to shift the focus
and then a button that you must hold in
order to activate it you can also press
it in order to change a few of the
settings so that deals with the
brightness and also the keystoning which
is usually done in auto auto keystoning
basically means that if I were to have
this projector projecting onto a surface
at a particular angle it will actually
shift that image so that it looks flat
on the surface now the image that is
projected is of 50 lumens in brightness
and that's actually kind of impressive
when you consider how this is just a
small peripheral that latches on to a
smart device but when compared to
standalone pico projectors of similar
size there are definitely some more
powerful ones out there now specifically
that is 854 by 480 resolution but the
other thing that you might be seeing
already in this shot is that the color
is is severely lacking even when all of
the lights are turned off and you get a
pretty decent looking image the
coloration just pales in comparison to
when you look down at the phone and you
realize that the AMOLED screen is doing
an incredible job already of showing
good saturation that also is the case
when it comes to the battery which comes
in at 1,100 milliamp hours and as moto
has said this will go for about an hour
now that's pretty good for business
presentations and definitely ok for
maybe just the short viewing session on
something like Netflix but for just one
hour it's not necessarily something that
you would want to use for long term
enjoyment really the big problem is that
lackluster image not to mention just
that one hour of battery life because of
that we don't really see this projector
being all that useful for a lot of
people out there who might want to use
it for media consumption and at $299 we
just don't think that the fun you can
have with this projector really
outweighs the cost of value ratio in
testing these devices we actually had a
lot of fun with them and
in the powerpack one of the most useful
ways of getting something that we all
sorely need in our phones which is
battery power but the problem with these
devices or these modal mods rather is
that they only really work on one device
and that's the Moto Z now of course it's
going to be seen if these mono mods will
be compatible with future versions of
moto smart phones but as of right now if
you pay the money especially that 299
dollars for that instachat projector
you're only really going to be using it
on one device at least currently the
other thing is that there are
alternatives to all of these mods the
power pack log convenience can be done
away with if you have an external
charger and an extra large er could have
higher capacity at a lower price and it
could actually charge this phone
feasibly faster than the Moto mod can
the insta share projector while really
fun has a very high price point and at
that price you can get standalone pico
projectors that arguably can put out
better video and definitely have better
battery life and finally with the JBL
Sambu speaker while it does greatly
enhance the sound experience of the Moto
Z family you can get comparable or
probably even better sound from
standalone Bluetooth speakers overall if
you're going all-in with the Moto Z
family then you have one of the most
innovative phones that we've seen and
also one of the best executed new ideas
for smart phones that we've seen in the
last even two to three years so keep it
tuned to Android 34 all of the best in
the world of Android but you can also
delve outside of the world of Android if
you visit our sister sites our sibling
sites rather be our source sound guys
and tab times and you can find a lot
there including our giveaways and then
you can pop right back to andrew
authority comm talk about android in our
forums and then subscribe to this
channel if you haven't already after
done with all of that you can stick
around because we are your source for
all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
