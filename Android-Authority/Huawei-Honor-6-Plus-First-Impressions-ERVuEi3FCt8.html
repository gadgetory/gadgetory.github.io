over the last year or so is that the
Chinese market is definitely growing we
have seen a lot of companies coming out
of the woodwork to bring some very nice
affordable but still powerful offerings
and one of those companies that embodies
this is Huawei the ascend mate 7 was a
bit of a surprise coming out of Eva in
Berlin 2014 but at CES 2015 just a few
weeks ago we also got a little bit of a
surprise from them as well in the form
of this the Huawei honor 6 plus the
honor 6 plus just very recently made it
to my doorstep and I wanted to bring you
a first impressions on it because the
moment I got this phone in my hand I
actually kind of already enjoyed its
look and its feel you can already see
some of the elements around the device
itself but let's start off with the back
because honestly I think it's kind of
cool to have the word honor so nicely
put on the centre back off this phone
it's just the first thing that I noticed
on the particular device but the other
thing that you're going to notice right
off the bat is that this phone has a
dual glass set up of course we have the
5.5 inch screen up front and then a
panel on the back that houses a number
of elements the honor of course in the
middle there a rear-facing speaker here
but a dual camera setup up here it's
going to be something I really put
through its paces because this is
hallways take on a dual camera setup
very similar to the HTC One m8 in which
one of these optics up here will be able
to get depth information and you'll be
able to refocus the photo as you see fit
after the fact but if we take a look at
some of the elements around the frame
you're going to see that this particular
device has a bit of a hodgepodge of
different design languages the dual
glass panel setup is very reminiscent of
the Sony Xperia line especially the most
recent iterations of it and you can see
down here that this area where the metal
frame ends is also reminiscent of the
Xperia z2 and it's a design element that
I did notice but of course above that
we're going to have this metal frame
that is of course reminiscent of the
Apple iPhones so it's really the first
thing that I noticed on here but on the
design aspect that was really the first
impression I wanted to give nonetheless
the flat profile on the sides makes this
a very easy phone to hold especially
with its five
five inch screen that is a little bit
larger and but is still becoming a bit
more common in the smartphone space and
it's really not a hard phone to keep a
hand on the buttons feel quite nice with
the volume rocker right here and the
power button underneath it which makes
it easy to wake the phone and be able to
use it preliminary thoughts on
performance here are very positive which
shouldn't come as much of a surprise
when you consider that we have used
Huawei phones in the past and have been
very impressed with their in-house
processing packages of course here in
the honor 6 plus that will continue with
the high silicon Kiran 9 to 5 which is a
very powerful processing package that
could rival even those of the Qualcomm
Snapdragon variety but of course we also
have the emotion UI which is what we're
taking a quick look at here as well and
what you'll notice here as is usually
the case with Asian operating system
takes on Android oh you're not going to
have an app drawer instead you're going
to have a lot of different pages here
that will need to be organized via
folders and you saw me looking at a
couple folders already right there the
notification drop-down is one of my
favorite parts and something that I
really liked in the ascend mate 7 where
it comes down in a chronological order
in reverse chronological order where the
most important notifications are found
on the top you could only swipe away
those and if you go over to the
shortcuts there will be quite a few
options that are available there in
order for you to cater the experience to
what you need it to be and also
different options for the various
features that are found in the emotion
UI and then in a final look at the
features of the honor 6 plus we also
have the camera now the camera is a dual
setup on the back but these sensors are
actually a little bit larger a little
bit closer to the HTC ultra pixel
sensors that are available so you might
be able to get some pretty good pictures
off of here but the dual camera setup is
also reminiscent of HTC zone setup
because the other camera will be able to
get the depth information from the scene
in order for you to refocus it it's a
feature I'm going to put through its
paces in probably a camera shootout or
at the very least inside of the camera
section of my forward view of the honor
6 plus but nonetheless there is also
another reason why I want to give you my
first impressions on here is because I'm
taking it with me on a trip now it's
important for me to tell you that right
now as you're watching this video I'm
actually on my way to China
Shenzhen China in particular in order to
meet with Huawei Darcy and I have a tour
of Huawei's offices in campus that we
have coming up along with a number of
other outlets and we're all going to get
to see the processes behind what Huawei
does in order to create their phones
you'll see content from that particular
aspect of the trip but also we'll be
able to talk to some of the people who
work at Huawei and bring you some
answers to some burning questions that
we might have for them so make sure you
stay tuned for that our coverage of the
Huawei campus inch engine China and for
my full review of the honor 6 plus don't
forget to subscribe to our channel if
you haven't already and drop us some
likes on these videos as well because we
love to see those thumbs up keep it
tuned here and once you're done with all
of that checking out other content from
my colleagues in Android don't forget to
head on over to android authority comm
because we are your source for all
things Android see you in China</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
