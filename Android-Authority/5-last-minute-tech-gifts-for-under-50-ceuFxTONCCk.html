Hindy from android authority com
Christmas is right around the corner and
if you need some gift ideas well we've
got some gift ideas all right folks this
is a pretty short list and while these
products are pretty awesome we're really
just trying to help you accumulate some
ideas here we have some additional lists
of gift ideas in the video description
below and we'll talk more about those at
the end of the video if at any point you
want to pick up any of these items will
have those links in the video
description below as well let's get
started first up is the cb3 ultra slim
bluetooth speaker this is a fun little
speaker with some decent audio and
around eight hours of battery life it's
slimmer than most bluetooth speakers
which makes it a bit more portable it
also normally runs at about a hundred
and forty bucks but it's on sale right
now for fifty bucks which not only makes
it a great gift but also a pretty good
deal as well of course a popular gift
for under fifty dollars is the
chromecast and the chromecast Audio you
can pick up either of these dongles for
about thirty five dollars and there are
still some stores that sell them for 24
fifty dollars or two for fifty five
dollars depending on the store in either
case it's a fun gift idea that can
really open up someone's media setup and
they're even easy to use when it comes
to cheap tablets amazon has no doubt one
this year with a great tablet offering
for only fifty dollars it doesn't come
with the Google Play Store but the
amazon underground service that gives
away free applications helps make up for
it and the specs actually aren't half
bad it's actually sold out until after
the holiday season so if you do get this
for somebody let them know that their
gifts are going to be late the idea us a
portable battery charger is next on our
list and it's one that won't break the
bank you can get the 5200 milliamp hour
portable charger for a scant 10 bucks
and using the coupon code that we have
on the bottom left side of the screen
you can knock that down further to about
seven bucks this makes it a great deal
and a cheap stocking stuffer idea 5200
milliamp hours is enough to charge most
devices at least once last up on our
short list here is tile tile is an
interesting device that lets you use
your phone to find your keys and even
better your keys to find your phone do
note that if you lose both you're kind
of screwed these go for about twenty
five dollars but really this is one of
those things that just about everybody
should have it even comes with a
bluetooth tracking feature so you can
see the last known location of your tie
now these are just a few recommendations
that we threw together to help you find
some ideas but we actually have quite a
few holiday guides to help you find more
cool stuff depending on your budgets we
have a list for under fifty dollars
under a hundred dollars and even under
two hundred and fifty dollars each of
these lists contains all kinds of
awesome stuff that you can get for your
loved ones or you know for yourself
we'll have all four lists linked up in
the video description below if you're
interested once again I'm Joe Hindy from
android authority com as promised all of
our delightful gift guides are linked up
in the video description below along
with all of those awesome videos that
you see it right over there best of luck
to everybody I hope you find what you're
looking for as always thanks for
watching and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
