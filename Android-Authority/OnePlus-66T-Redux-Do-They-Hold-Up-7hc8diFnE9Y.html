flagships becoming increasingly and i
watering lis expensive we at Android
Authority are bringing you a series
about older smartphones dissecting the
promises made by manufacturers at launch
seeing how the phone stacks up over time
and taking a closer look at update
support hardware floors and of course
its viability after so many months of it
being on sale so hey guys money's Ryan
Thomas with Android authority and this
is Redux in this pilot episode we'll be
taking a look at the one plus six and
sixty to check their viability in 2019
the one plus six and sixty have gone
relatively unscathed with regards to big
game-changing issues the couple of
problems that were present at launch
namely the missing notifications and
dark automatic brightness since been
resolved in software updates and are no
longer issues software is certainly a
strong point for the company and with
the six and sixteen looking to get
Android q in q4 of this year with one
plus three a device launched in 2016
getting Oreo we'd be surprised if the
six and sixteen miss out on the next big
Android release the company promised
back in mid 2018 that they serve updates
to each and every model they produce for
a minimum of two years from its first
release and so far they're right on
track with these two but we just have to
wait to really evaluate the fulfillment
of the promises both of these devices
are running versions of oxygen OS 9.0 on
top of Android Pi 9.0 and thanks to
oxygen OS is pretty lightweight
structure if you're able to get more
life out of that piece of software you
don't get that blow or extra apps that
can bog down a phone and leave a phone
feeling pretty unusable after just nine
to twelve months
performance in heavier tasks such as 3d
gaming in pub G Mobile and Real Racing 3
is still top notch since the specs of
the six series are still very strong and
competitive with all but the very best
phones in 2019 the cameras will still be
great in terms of versatility compete
with good mid-range devices in 2019 for
image quality dynamic range has been
noticeably improved over the months with
software updates and we've still got a
healthy array of shooting modes with the
phone with only one focal length dynamic
range is solid with good sharpness just
lacking in color accuracy and field
review options
around 550 USD GBP and euros brand-new
it doesn't look like one plus has really
dropped the pricing of the 60 at all
however in the use market expect to pay
a hundred less of each currency finally
for money is certainly questioned when
you think about the LG G seven think you
that it's substantially cheaper and
Lopaka fair enough form which is cheaper
still one use might be the small option
here as we don't really see any crazy
sales from oneplus however of course the
seven is coming soon and we should start
to see a small price drop for the 16
third-party sites and carrier stores but
they tend to just take away the Buy
button on the official website if you're
looking for the mall 2019 looking device
the 60 has your back it features the
water droplet notch in display
fingerprint scanner and unfortunately
lacks a headphone port but does have the
added benefit of having a battery size
substantially closer to the four
thousand milliamp hour mark that seems
to be the 2019 standard the six on the
other hand is an example of a device
with new specs and old features features
that a lot of people still really
appreciate such as that headphone port
at the expense of just looking at out of
place in the current crop of handsets as
a general rule if you're going to buy
six series from one place and 2019
you're going to get a great phone with a
great list of specs and some spectacular
performance you might be losing out a
little bit on the screen and on the
camera and perhaps on the battery life
it's still getting a fantastic phone and
if you buy usual getting an even better
deal and just in case you don't like
oneplus here are a couple of
alternatives that we recommend firstly
is a brand new pakka phone f1 for a
similar specs a much lower price if you
don't really care much about the screen
or build quality and second would be a
refurbished p20 pro since you get a lot
more features and also that awesome
camera a price around a brand new one
+60 neither going to be quite as quick
as the 1 + 6 and 60 but definitely more
versatile with more features for the
money the 6 and 60 are tremendous
smartphones that feature great screens
OB a full HD plus resolution good
battery life solid cameras excellent
software support and performance that
just keeps on crushing the competition
if you want a phone with a wealth of
features including some increasingly
uncommon ports then my pick would be the
1 + 6 or though a year old it is the way
to go if you value a headphone port and
want a super fast physical
fingerprint scanner alternatively if you
want truly unrivaled performance for a
fraction of the cost of the competition
the 16 will more than satisfy your needs
and with that it's about time for me to
go thank you so much for watching
