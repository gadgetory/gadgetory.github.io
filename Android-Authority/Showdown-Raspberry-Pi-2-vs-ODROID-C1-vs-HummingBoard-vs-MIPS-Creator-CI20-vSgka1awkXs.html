released in 2012 it created a whole
movement of developers hobbyist and
educationalist who used the small arm
base board to create hack and teach it
succeeded for three main reasons first
of all it was a full desktop computer
it had compilers so you could write
programs secondly it had a set of
general purpose input output pins GPIO
pins that could be connected to motors
and sensors and so many other different
things similar to what you'd get on
microcontroller platforms like the
Arduino and thirdly and probably most
importantly only cost $35 well that was
2012 and since then the single board
computer market has changed quite
significantly and today we're going to
be looking at four boards that are
available in 2015 that could be
alternatives to the original Raspberry
Pi now the four boards I've chosen are
ones that I personally have ones that I
have used ones that I have reviewed one
I've spent time with in the written
article that goes with this video I've
included links and suggestions to other
boards that you also might want to
consider but in this video I'm only
using ones that I have personal
experience of now the four board I've
chosen are the raspberry PI's to the O's
yc1 the humming boards ie
X 2 and the mix creator CI xx so let's
take a look at them
the SBC market is heavily dominated by
arm and three of the four boards we
looking at today have ARM Cortex based
processors the exception is the mix CI
20 creator which has a dual-core MIPS
processor now before we start to compare
all these boards together I think it'd
be good if I formally introduce you to
each one although the Raspberry Pi 1 was
enormous ly successful there was one
complaint the overall performance of the
board was lacking especially when
running desktop applications but
performance was less than desirable
because it used a single core CPU
clocked at just 900 megahertz
considering the cost the innovation of
the board and his versatility and the
performance was perfectly understandable
but there was room for an improvement
and that improvement came in the form of
the Raspberry Pi 2 which uses a quad
core processor and doubles the amount of
RAM even though the PI 2 is more
powerful has more memory the Raspberry
Pi foundation managed to keep the price
exactly the same and this really was a
guarantee for success so quickly looking
at the specifications for the Raspberry
Pi 2 uses a 900 megahertz quad-core arm
cortex a7 processor from Broadcom has a
video core for GPU 1 gigs of ram and the
storage is provided by an SD card slot
you also get four years B ports HDMI
Ethernet and an audio jack output there
are also of course the GPIO pins a
camera interface and so on and it's
price is just $35
one company that has managed to build a
board for the same basic price as the
Raspberry Pi is hard colonel called the
Oh droid see one it cost just $35 and
like the Raspberry Pi uses a quad-core
processor the Oh droid see one isn't the
only SBC that hard colonel make but it's
the cheapest details about their other
boards can be found in the written
companion looking at the specs of the
Odroid c1 it uses a 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core arm cortex a5 CPU it has a
Mali 450 GPU one gigabytes of RAM
storage is provided by SD card or emmc
module and then of course you get the
four USB port a micro HDMI port Gigabit
Ethernet infrared remote control
receiver the GPIO pins and a battery
backup connector for the real-time clock
it costs just $35 another company which
offers several different SBC's is solid
run all of their boards are built around
free scales imx6 series of processors
the imx6 ranges based on arms cortex a9
design and scales from single to
quad-core the humming board I - II X
uses a dual-core imx6 processor and
comes with 1 gig of ram but it also has
the same fall factor as the Raspberry Pi
one in fact it will even fit into a case
designed for the first-generation Pi the
humming board I 2x uses a 1 gigahertz
dual-core cortex a9 base 2 CPU and the
GC 2,000 GPU it comes with 1 gigabyte of
RAM and has an SD card slot for storage
you also get two USB ports HDMI Ethernet
and an infrared remote control receiver
on board you also have the GPIO pins and
a connector for a real-time clock
battery it costs a hundred and ten
dollars
the one board in our lineup which
doesn't use an arm-based processor is
the MIT CI 20 creator at its heart is a
dual-core MIPS based processor coupled
with a power VR GPU and backed by one
gigs of RAM it is also unique than the
includes its own built-in storage plus
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth at just $65 it's
more expensive in the Odroid c1 and the
Raspberry Pi 2 but you are getting more
for your money and so that's the
hardware what about the software will
all the ball - capable of running at
least 2 operating systems they all run
Linux and three of the four run Android
the only Baba doesn't run Android is the
Raspberry Pi - that's because the
Raspberry Pi foundation don't see
Android as a priority and apparently
there are some porting difficulties with
some missing drivers from Broadcom
Herber the other three board all do run
Android 4.4 KitKat and they're all also
capable of running Android 5.0 lollipop
however none of the board manufacturers
have actually released a firmware at
this time to judge the relative
performance of a handle on each of these
boards I will use the following criteria
features performance and support for
Google's services
the two main Android features that
distinguish one board from another huh
support for sound over HDMI and the
support for USB flash drives the best
board in terms of these features at the
Odroid c1 the humming board in the CA 20
don't support USB flash drive under
android and the CA 20 doesn't support
sound over HDMI scoring each board out
of four four features the Odroid c1 gets
the maximum four points the humming
board gets three points and the CA 20
gets two points next performance using
antutu as a guide to the relative
performance the Odroid c1 scores 15
thousand eight hundred eighty seven and
the humming board i - e^x cos twelve
thousand one hundred ninety eight I
wasn't able to test the CIA 20 but
according to comments I've seen on the
internet it scores less than the other
two so scoring again out of four points
the Odroid gets a maximum of four the
humming board gets three in the CI
twenty gets two finally in terms of
support for Google Play and Google
services the humming board comes with
Google Play pre-installed whereas the
Odroid c1 doesn't include
Google services by default but you can
install them via a quick hack the CIA 20
doesn't include any support for Google
services whatsoever
therefore scoring each board again out
of four points with Google Play support
the humming board gets four points this
Odroid C one gets three points and the
CI twenty scores two since the Raspberry
Pi doesn't support Android at all it
will unfortunately score zero points for
this section so let's add up the totals
and this is what we get in first place
we have the Odroid to see one with 11
points and then close right behind it is
the humming board I - eh with 10 points
next comes a CI 20 created with 6 points
and finally the Raspberry Pi with 0 all
four balls support Linux and they
support it well to try and judge which
board supports the mix the best I will
use the following criteria the number of
distribution supported performance and
the amount of free memory available
after a fresh boot into the desktop the
board which supports the most
distributions is the Raspberry Pi -
largely due to the sheer sizes user
community there are applied to is such a
popular platform and it receives a lot
of attention when it comes to porting
however the Odroid c1 isn't too far
behind and neither is the humming board
last but not least comes the mips CI 20
partly because it's a relatively new
board and partly because it uses a
mips-based processor rather than an ARM
based processor the number of
distributions is less on the CI 20
however it's still quite respectable it
includes Debian gen - an angstrom
therefore the scores for the Linux
distribution section are Raspberry Pi 4
points o droid c1 and humming boards
tied on three points and the CI 21 point
as for performance the open SSL
command-line told has a speed option
which tests the performance of its
various cryptographic algorithms it also
provides a good way to judge the
relative performance of one CPU compared
to another the scores are quite
revealing the fastest board of the four
in terms of CPU performance without
using the GPU is the Odroid c1 next
comes the humming board followed by the
Raspberry Pi - last place but not by
much goes to the CIA 20 as a result the
scores for the performance section are
Odroid 4 points humming board 3 points
raspberry pi 2 points and the CI 21
point since the
bored all have one gigabyte of RAM it's
important how much free memory remains
once the board boots up into the desktop
graphical user interfaces can be memory
hoaxes and each of the board uses a
lightweight window manager to try and
conserve memory the most frugal board is
the Raspberry Pi 2 which had over 800
makes free after booting next comes a CI
20 which had over 700 Meg's
followed by the C 1 which had 400 Meg's
and finally the humming board which had
300 Meg's
so the score for the free memory test
our Raspberry Pi 4 points
the CI a 23 points the Odroid c1 2
points and the humming board 1 point
therefore adding up all the scores for
this section the results of the linux
tests are as follows raspberry pi is the
overall winner with 10 points the Odroid
c1 9 points in third place the humming
board i 2 e^x with 7 points and a fourth
place the CI 20 creator with 5 points
all 4 boards should support Cody so to
test the performance of Cody I use its
internal codec display information to
show the frame rate and the amount of
CPU time being used to code the video
and then produce a full HD 50 megabits a
second version of my ZTE Blade s6 plus
review video and played in each board
the Odroid C 1 and the humming board I 2
e^x both did an excellent job of
displaying the video both managed to
consistently show the video and its full
frame rate and neither tax the CPU too
much the same can't be said for the
Raspberry Pi with disappointingly could
only manage 9 frames a second instead of
the needed 23 point nine seven frames
per second and unfortunately I couldn't
find an easily accessible version of
kony to run on the CI 20 and neither
could I find a video player to play the
video from any of the online
repositories so the scores for this
section are Odroid C one for the humming
board for Raspberry Pi 2 and the CI 20 0
the big news that accompanied the
release of the Raspberry Pi 2 was that
Microsoft will be releasing a version of
Windows 10 for the small board however
we might be disappointed because it's
not going to be a full version of
Windows it's going to be a Windows 10
for the Internet of Things devices and
it may not even include a desktop
however besides Windows 10 the write
with PI 2 also supports riscos net VSD
FreeBSD an open wrt
as for the other boards they support a
limited range of other operating systems
besides Android and Linux for example
the humming board supports FreeBSD and
the Odroid C one supports net BSD also
the CI twenty mix base board supports
net BSD and there is work going on to
port open wrt therefore for this section
I'll get the full four points to the
Raspberry Pi - as it has the broadest
support and each of the other three
boards will each get two points a big
factor in picking in SBC's the size of
the various online communities you might
ask yourself how many people are there
blogging about this board how many
videos are there available on youtube
are there books can you readily get help
from the forums and so on there is
little doubt that the Raspberry Pi 2
community is the largest this is mainly
due to because of the success of the
original Raspberry Pi how it's also
clear that the community has embraced
the new Pi 2 board with the same passion
it's hard to judge between the online
communities of the odor in the humming
board but roughly speaking in broad
terms they are approximately the same
the CI 20 has the smallest community
partly due to its relative newness as a
result the Raspberry Pi 2 will score
four points with this section the Odroid
c1 and the humming board would get three
points each and the CI 20 scores one
point so we've tested Android we've
tested Linux rooted the support for
other operating systems we've considered
the online communities so which board is
the best but without further ado here
are the results in 4th place comes the
MIT's creator CI 20 with a total of 14
points in third place comes the
Raspberry Pi 2 with a total of 20 points
in second place comes the humming board
with a total of 26 points and in first
place our winner for this SBC comparison
is the Odroid c1 with a total of 29
points and so there you have it yo joint
c1 is our overall winner congratulations
to Odroid now that might be a bit of a
surprise to you maybe you're thinking
the PI 2 would win but really the PI 2
fell down our test because it doesn't
support Android if you take away the
Android scoring from our results
actually the PI 2 does beat the Oh
joycie won by just a couple of points
but of course the weaknesses of the
Raspberry Pi 2 are more than just the
fact that'll support Android it's also
slower than the Odroid c1 and slower
than the humming board in fact the mid
CI 20 creator is actually itself only
just slightly slower than the Raspberry
Pi 2 also Cody isn't working very well
on the PI 2 at the moment and that could
be a software issue and I'm sure it will
be fixed in the future but at the moment
the c1 and the humming board do a better
job of displaying high bitrate video now
of course the online community of the
Raspberry Pi 2 is absolutely massive
it's unequaled and really that does
compensate for some of these other
weaknesses that we've talked about and
if you're buying a single board computer
for the first time really still the
Raspberry Pi is the best online
community to get into because of its
immense size there is also the issue of
the price of the Eau de ruyter c1
although it cost $35 directly from the
manufacturer I've read online that some
people are experiencing high shipping
charges because it gets shipped directly
from Korea and vitamin gets to your
country you might have incurred quite a
large cost having said that I got my
board from a European distributor
directly and it cost 44 euros which when
you do the calculations for today is
about $10 more than the price of a
Raspberry Pi 2 so that wasn't too bad
for me so if you want a board without
Android support then probably should go
with the right with PI 2 but if you want
Android which of course we and Android
authority think is important if you want
Android then you really need to go with
the Odroid c1 well my name is Gary sim
from Android authority I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did please
give it a thumbs up also please use the
comments below to tell me what you think
about these 4 different boards do you
have a Raspberry Pi do you have a no
droid see one tell me what you think
about those boards also don't forget to
subscribe to and royalties YouTube
channel and as for me I'll see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
