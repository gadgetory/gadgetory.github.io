range of high-end phones issue it
started with the galaxy s6 then we had
the galaxy s6 age then we have the
galaxy s6 plus edge and now of course we
have the note 5 but course Samsung
aren't the only smartphone manufacturer
in the world recently I reviewed the
qual way mate
s and today I'm going to compare it with
samsung's galaxy note 5 so if you're
ready let's take a look
Samsung has certainly switched things
about a bit with its design since the
Galaxy s5 and Note 4 everything changed
with the galaxy s6 and the samsung
galaxy note 5 has followed suit by that
to him a new design language however
soir√©e hasn't remained stuck in the
past either although it has had other
metal phones in the past the mate s also
sports a new design the samsung galaxy
note 5 has a body made of metal and
glass with a unibody design that is
unlike many others similarly the mate s
also has an all metal frame and a non
removable battery overall the difference
between these two are the mate s has the
power key and the volume rockers both on
the right whereas a note 5 has the
volume keys on the left and the power
button on the right the note 5 has the
Samsung home button on the lower bezel
flanked by the capacitive keys whereas a
mate s has no button and no capacitive
keys or keys are on screen last who must
have forget the note 5 also includes a
stylus in the S Pen a feature missing
from the mate s the samsung galaxy note
5 touts a 5.7 Super AMOLED display which
is larger than hallways 5.5 inch AMOLED
panel aside from side we are looking at
full HD resolution on the main s and q
HD on the note 5 however both are using
similar screen technologies Super AMOLED
on AMOLED panels are known for emitting
very bright saturated colors as well as
red deep blacks something that continued
to be seen on both devices have one
aspect of the mate s that some people
won't like is that the designers have
elected to use very thin bezels so much
so there is a black border around the
display where the active pix will stop
and the display material continues
towards the edge purse I don't find this
a problem however some users find it
quite
tracting the note 5 clearly has the
upper hand when it comes to raw
processing power with its Exynos 7420
optical processor although the quirian
935 is also an octa-core processor by
way of popping for two clusters of quad
cortex a53 calls whereas the Exynos 7420
uses four cortex a53 cores and four
cortex 8:57 calls also the GPU in the
note 5 is the mali t760 whereas the mate
s is supporting the lower performing
martyt six to eight the other big
difference is the mate s has three
gigabytes of RAM while the note 5 packs
a draw dropping four gigabytes but let's
move on to the other components internal
storage options for the mate s are 32
gigabyte and 64 gigabytes plus a 128
gigabyte variant with a
pressure-sensitive screen however this
latter option won't be available
globally the Galaxy Note 5 also has a
similar lineup but there is no 128
gigabyte variant both suffer from
excessive use of the internal storage by
the system as both devices only offer
around 24 gigabytes of free space to the
user from the 32 gigabytes of total
flash memory some of you might prefer
the quali mate s when considering
storage as it supports micro SD cards
something Samsung has done away with
however neither offer removable
batteries the battery in the note 5 is a
3000 milliamp hour unit or the mate s
packs a two thousand seven hundred
million power unit both devices have a
built-in fingerprint reader but how they
are implemented is quite different the
note 5 includes the fingerprint reader
in the home button on the front for a
device on the lower bezel while they
have taken a different approach and
let's place the fingerprint reader on
back while both fingerprint readers are
highly accurate I find the fingerprint
reader from the make s easy to use the
reason is quite simple the mate s allows
you to wait and unlock your phone in one
step whereas the note 5 requires two
steps the thing about all lockscreen
technologies is that the harder they are
to use the more likely they are to be
ignored on your Android phone use it of
a pin or a pattern that unlock the phone
there are lots of people to use them but
when the authentication step becomes too
then you just tend to do away with them
I try using a pin or a pattern on my
phone but having to type in the pin or
make that pattern like 50 times a day
drive me crazy so I don't do it anymore
fingerprint readers off an
authentication step I should make
unlocking smart phones quick when it
comes to the unlock both on the note 5
and the made s do an equal job some
people won't like the fact that the
fingerprint read it on the back of the
mate s as it means you can't unlock your
device without picking it up that is a
fair criticism however I've been digging
back into my memory and I really can't
recall the last time I tried using my
phone without actually holding it in my
hand however if for you it is essential
to unlock the phone without holding it
and there is always the backup PIN
number which can be tapped in on those
occasions when you aren't holding phone
however where the mate s gets it right
on the note 5 gets it wrong is that the
mate s allows you to wake it and lock
your phone in one step
with a phone asleep you can just press
your finger on the reader and the phone
will wake it on all in one swift
movement on the note five you to wake
the device with the power button and
then place your finger on the sensor all
you need to press the home button and
leave your finger on the button until
the fingerprint is read now I've
practiced this maneuver repeatedly and
it still takes around one second to wake
and unlock the phone and don't get me
wrong one second is great but it seems
like such a long time when you compared
to the instantaneous wake and unlock on
the mate s quawi mate s comes with a 13
megapixel rear camera that includes a
four color RGB W imaging sensor and
optical image stabilization also the
camera housing is scratch proof thanks
to a sapphire protection however the
note 5 has a 16 megapixel sensor and F
1.9 aperture and also includes optical
image stabilization there is no doubting
of the camera on the note 5 is a better
of these two however here are a few
sample photos so that you can compare
yourself
on the front side you'll find an 8
megapixel camera on the koala mate s and
a 5 megapixel camera on the note 5 here
on paper at least the mate s offers more
to selfie lovers both are Samsung Galaxy
Note 5 and Huawei made s run android
5.1.1 lollipop but i doesn't exactly
mean their software is identical in fact
their UI schemes are quite different
Samsung's TouchWiz UI will strip down
for the Galaxy S six we are thankful the
same philosophy has been applied to the
note 5 Easton has all those great S Pen
features multitasking and other elements
but the interface is much speaker while
weighs version of boundaries known as in
motion UI and it's quite significantly
different from touch with and from stock
Android most notable difference is the
lack of an app drawer which means you
are dependent on folders to keep things
organized while they has added some
extra built-in functionality including a
set of motion controls like a flip to
mute and the knuckle gesture system
there is also a one-handed layout mode
which temporary reduces the size of the
UI so it can be used with one hand
finally emotion UI also has some jeweled
windowing support but mainly for these
stock apps like gallery notepad videos
and so on overall guar weighs take on
hands but is certainly different from
the stock experience however it is sleek
and well designed when it comes to
pricing the mate S is available for 649
euros in Europe or 469 pounds in the UK
while the note 5 is waiting for $700 for
those in the USA if you're using a
direct conversion between dollars euros
and pounds on the two devices are
similarly priced however the note 5
isn't available in Europe a direct
conversion liver world anyway for
example the new Amazon fire tablets cost
$49 from amazon.com
yet they cost 49 pounds from Amazon co
dot uk' but forty nine pounds at the
time of writing he's actually around 75
dollars if you could get a note 5 in
Europe for the same price you can get it
in the USA then the note 5 would be an
absolute bargain likewise if you get a
huawei mate s in the USA only four
hundred and sixty-nine dollars then it
would clearly be
the cheaper of the two devices and there
you have it my quick comparison between
the note 5 and the mate s now you have
to choose between these two phones it
may not be just the pure specifications
that would alter your decision for
example there's availability and there's
pricing the note 5 isn't available in
Europe for example and what is the price
of a mate s in your local area if you
put aside availability and pricing then
King in the note 5 is the better of the
two devices however the huawei does
offer a good overall general experience
