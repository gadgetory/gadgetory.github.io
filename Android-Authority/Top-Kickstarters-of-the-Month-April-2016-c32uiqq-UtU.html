platform for creators to gather up
supporters create a community and have
their dreams come true and for consumers
it's a great way to take a peek into the
future to see what new exciting
technology is on its way
hello everybody its Christa Laura and
this is top Kickstarter's of the month
in this episode we'll be taking a look
at the hottest and coolest Kickstarter
projects of April seeing how they work
where they're pledging goals are add and
more so let's jump right in
now I don't know how many of you are
like me where even with all these
touchscreen laptops and phones or cell
is's I still prefer to take my notes and
sketch with actual pen and paper but
unfortunately I don't have any way to
save my notes in an organized way or
back them up into the cloud but rocket
book wave is a project that looks to be
the answer to this problem
it's a microwaveable notebook rocket
book wave is a notebook and an app where
you can instantly blast your notes you
wrote on a piece of paper into the cloud
using your phone rocket books machine
vision instantly record your note and he
answers it and uploads it to any
destination you choose as your default
so no you're not just saving photos of
your notebook lying on a table the
photos that wind up getting sent to the
cloud are enhanced images that get rid
of any background areas like the
notebook itself and gets rid of any
imperfections so your uploaded notes are
simply your handwriting over a pure
white background making images more
crisp and vibrant than the real thing
there's also symbols on the bottom of
each page that you can mark and you can
set these up so for example when you
mark the diamond symbol it can send it
to your customer meetings folder in
Evernote or when doodling mark the star
symbol where it could send it to a
folder you set up and drive so that's
great
you can save your notes within the cloud
very fast and easily but now you have a
bunch of notes in this notebook that you
don't really need anymore because
they're already in the cloud and a big
problem with taking notes with the
notebooks is once they're filled you're
gonna have to buy a new one but with
rocket book as long as you're using
friction pilot pens which are available
in many office supply stores you can
erase your entire notebook by throwing
it in the
microwave for about four minutes so yeah
the rocket book is microwave safe and
with those friction pilot pens using a
special thermochromic ink notes become
clear under heat so when your notebook
is full just put it in the microwave and
when you see the wave logo on the
notebook turn from blue to white you
know that your rocket book has been
cleared and is ready for more
note-taking Rocket book is only seeking
a pledging goal of 20,000 but at the
moment there aren't 570 thousand dollars
now there's another Kickstarter project
similar to this one but I think is a bit
more interesting and it still needs some
help reaching its goal
it's called cap TiVo and it would be
very helpful in offices and classrooms
cap TiVo is based on the idea that
although white boards are found
everywhere and we depend on them to help
us communicate ideas to others in a room
they create a lot of extra hassle in
today's connected world instead of
focusing on the meeting and the ideas
that are being presented
we're oftentimes only focused on copying
down everything into your notebook and
of course we've all been there why don't
we just take out our phones at the end
of class and take a few photos at the
white board including reflections and
the top of classmates heads and yeah
these pictures really go along nicely
sitting between your family photos on
your camera roll but kept TiVo aims to
fix these problems essentially it's a
little camera that you can mount to the
top of the whiteboard in the office or
classroom and it does require some
drilling but after you're done with that
you can start using your whiteboard
again as normally use a normal pen use
the same standard whiteboard you've been
using and use any number of people
collaborating at the same time and
everything you write is captured
automatically with the camera and
broadcast it to others in the room with
the Captiva app with clean and sharp
images in real time Captiva fixes angle
distortion removes glares and even
erases hands and arms leaving you only
with the writing over a true white
background thanks to the kept TiVo app
if you want to see how the whiteboard
evolved during a class or a meeting you
can easily use a playback feature to
rewind pause and fast-forward to see
exactly what you want if the final
product can actually do all these things
that promises it could really be a
game-changer because it works with any
whiteboard you already own instead of
buying a new one
for $1,000 or more right now light blue
optics the creators of cap TiVo are
seeking a goal of seventy five thousand
but at the moment are only at twenty
seven thousand dollars with 17 days left
to go so we'll have to see what happens
and next up we have one of the most
popular kick starters of April with a
project that has already earned over 10
times its original goal ripple buds
which are ear buds that can record your
voice using the sound coming from the
inside of your ear like any successful
Kickstarter we have a common problem or
inconvenience that a lot of us wish
there was an answer for with ripple buds
it's a struggle to communicate clearly
with people with voice calls in the
fast-paced world we live in today you'll
see tons of people in big cities trying
to cut through the noise to talk to
somebody while calling on the way to the
next meeting or event cutting through
that noise is tough and usually calls
for you to talk extra loud press the
phone harder to ear or bring tangled in
your ear buds ripple buds are very small
wireless earbuds that also sport a
wireless microphone well how exactly is
a microphone that's pretty much inside
your ear going to pick up the noise all
the way from your mouth while cancelling
out the background noise at the same
time well it doesn't pick up noise from
your mouth instead it picks up the noise
coming from inside your eardrum ripple
buds creates a two-way path for sound
waves the less you hear and speak with
just a single bud as sound waves travel
from your body to your mouth
they also exit through the eustachian
tube in your eardrums hear ripple buds
can capture this sound and transmit it
to the caller very clearly before it can
be lost by background noise that's
pretty incredible you don't even have to
talk very loudly at all four colors to
hear you and even doing things like
activating okay Google or Siri while
doing things like driving will be much
more reliable with a lot less
interference and already ripple buds
have about 5000 backers pledging a total
of $600,000 over the initial goal of
$50,000 now here's something that can
save us a lot of money and more
importantly a lot of lives in just North
America alone we spend eight billion
dollars a year on speeding tickets and
unfortunately a lot of lives are lost as
well due to speeding
trap tap is a small little device you
put on your dashboard that knows every
location of red light cameras and school
zones while relying on the community to
mark the location of police and mobile
radar tracks and this all sounds very
familiar I'm sure because there's tons
of apps that already do this but that's
the problem that Bryce North creator of
trapped app recognized it's always an
app on your phone the one thing that
you're not supposed to be using while
driving that usually sits below the
windshield in your cup holder taking
your eyes off the road when driving trap
tap will light up red when you're
approaching red light cameras and school
zones or blue when you're approaching a
police or mobile radar trap you can even
have trapped app adapt to your lifestyle
having it blink when you've come to your
trap or only if you're speeding near one
it sits right on your dashboard so your
attention will always still be on the
road and already trapped tap has
received ninety nine thousand dollars
other sixty four thousand dollar goal
but thirty one days to go well that will
be all for this episode of top
Kickstarter's of the month thank you
