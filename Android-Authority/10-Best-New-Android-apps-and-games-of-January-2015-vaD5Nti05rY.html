hindi the android authority app guy it's
nearing the end of the month so it's
time to round up the best android apps
and games from january of 2015
first up this month is adobe lightroom
mobile using this you can edit organize
and otherwise manage your photos and
other images there have been some issues
including compatibility and space issues
however if you can get past that this is
a powerful photo editor that can be used
in tandem with the desktop version
assuming you use and pay for a Creative
Cloud subscription the sana is a task
management platform aimed at teams of
people who need to get work done
technically this application has existed
for a long time but it was essentially a
wrapper for the mobile site and it was
pretty awful now it's a native Android
app with material design and it's way
better than it was before there are
still some issues here and there but
this is a big step forward and an
application to keep an eye on yeah mu is
a popular photo editing application that
was very popular on iOS and has finally
made its way to Android it features the
ability to shoot videos and photos with
live effects applied at collages text
various effects super focus and auto
enhance mode it's free with in-app
purchases but believe it or not the
in-app purchases really aren't that bad
flipsie Road is about as big a hit as
any app could possibly be on the Amazon
App Store and it eventually saw its
release on Google Play it's kind of like
Frogger in that you must cross many many
roads the graphics aren't great but the
gameplay is surprisingly fun there is no
story or anything ridiculous but it's a
solid and difficult time waster that
costs nothing to download swear Enix
continues to re-release their old
collection of games here in 2015 and
first up this year is Dragon Quest 5
much like others in the series the game
is played entirely in portrait mode
which is unique for a video game
it also features full camera control
monster catching AI bottles for easier
level grinding and a whole lot more it's
a tad expensive at $14.99 but at least
there are no in-app purchases Facebook
Lite was developed for those who use
budget phones it's optimized for 2g
internet and it's less is more design as
great for weaker processors
unfortunately you can only get it
officially from the Play Store if you
have a terrible phone it's less than 1
megabyte in size and includes the core
Facebook functionality including chats
without any of the extra frills if your
device isn't compatible we'll have a
link to the direct apk download in the
video description below
Google classroom is a classroom
environment that allows teachers and
parents to help students learn by
creating a virtual classroom environment
it was only available as a web
application for a long time but it is
now available on Android and iOS it
allows students to take and upload
pictures to classroom interact with the
platform in general chat with students
live and a whole lot more lego bionicle
is a hack and slash style game where you
must pick your lego hero and kill a
bunch of bad guys the graphics and
controls are actually pretty good even
if the storyline is a tad shallow it is
totally free to play with no in-app
purchases which is a rarity and thanks
to its mild nature it's a great game for
kids libreoffice viewer is a document
viewing application released in beta
this last month it is in beta so if you
find bugs it would be better to report
them than to give the app a bad review
because it is a beta and bad reviews are
kind of useless when the app is a beta
aside from the beta related issues the
app seems to be progressing nicely and
even hit four out of five star rating on
Google Play recently it's also nice to
see official libreoffice on android even
if it's just a document viewer last on
our list this month is manual camera
this application takes full advantage of
the camera to API and lollipop so as you
can probably guess this application is
only for people who use lollipop it lets
you adjust things like shutter speed
focus distance ISO white balance and
exposure compensation the compatible
device list is pretty slim so read the
description before downloading well that
about does it for this video folks once
again I'm Joe handy the Android
authority app guy while you're here why
not subscribe to the Android Authority
YouTube channel if you're hanging out
