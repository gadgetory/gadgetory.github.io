Authority in this episode I'm going to
talk about two of today's hottest
smartphones the Apple iPhone 5 and
Google Nexus 4 made by LG these are
powerful and very attractive phones but
one may suit you much better than the
other hopefully after this review you'll
find out which one is best for you as
far as size and weight are concerned
each of these two phones speaks to
different crowds on the one hand the
iPhone 5 is slimmer lighter and smaller
than the Nexus 4 for some people these
iPhone 5 qualities are huge factors
admittedly these make the iPhone more
portable than the Nexus 4 this is not
saying that the Nexus 4 is not portable
on the contrary the Nexus 4 is in fact
still portable despite being bigger and
heavier which is a necessary trade offer
it's larger battery and bigger screen
both of which are deciding factors for
many both phones manifest their
minimalist designs in quite different
ways on the Nexus 4 for instance the
front of the phone has nothing except a
touchscreen itself the front camera
notification light light sensors and
phone earpiece grille on top a similar
observation can be said of the iPhone 5
on its front you'll see only the
physical home button the camera and the
phone speaker grille the left and right
bezels on both phones are thinner than
their top and bottom bezels presumably
to give better grip when using the
phones in landscape mode on the Nexus 4
the bezels are surrounded by a silver
frame while on the iPhone 5 the bezels
are framed by bluish-gray aluminum which
also may accept the phone sides these
are very beautiful and elegantly
designed smartphones both Apple and LG
deserve a pat on the back for these if
you ask me
hardware buttons are conveniently
positioned too on the Nexus 4 the volume
rocker sits on the left side reachable
by the index and middle fingers and
right-handed use though unlike the
Galaxy Nexus the SIM tray on the Nexus 4
pops out from the left side in contrast
on the left side of the iPhone 5 are its
mute or lock switch and the round volume
keys on the iPhones right side
is it symmetry no button here for your
thumb to press I find this design
helpful to convenience because the thumb
can focus primarily on supporting the
phone in contrast the nexus force right
side has only the power button but just
within easy reach of the pump at the top
side of the nexus 4 is a lonely
headphone jack I personally find this
location very convenient since I usually
keep my phone in an upright position
inside my pocket on the top side of the
iPhone 5 is its power button near the
corner and with an easy reach of the
index finger of either hand at the
bottom of the nexus 4 is the microUSB
port and two Torx screws which in my
opinion greatly disturb the nearly
seamless frame of this beautiful phone
meanwhile at the bottom of the iPhone 5
of its headphone jack loudspeakers and
non standards compliant and proprietary
lightning port the Nexus forced non
removable back is a truly shining piece
of artwork I describe it as having
subtle flamboyance its speckled with
crystals that twinkle when viewed from
certain angles this Nexus logo and this
LG logo appeared to float on a sea of
glittering crystals if you view them
from a slight angle the back panel is
protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 2
which provides protection against
scratches but not against drops or
strong bumps much as I want the entire
bag to be completely smooth there's a
break in the glass here for the camera
flash housing and down here for the
speaker grille the 8 megapixel camera is
underneath the protective glass cover
the back of the iPhone 5 of course is
also a delight to look at it's a very
simple design and I find its simplicity
elegant the back has black strips of
glass here and here majority of the back
is dark grey and it appears to shine a
bit when light hits it from a certain
angle revealing both the Apple logo and
the iPhone wordmark
this backplate is a tough one it's made
of aluminium and as we've demonstrated
in our drop test not too long ago it's
hard to crack this thing just like the
Nexus 4 this Apple phone has an 8
megapixel camera and flash if you think
that the exterior of these 2 phones are
already eye-popping wait until you've
seen the gorgeous displays on each of
these
the Nexus 4 of course has a larger 4.7
inch screen that uses true HD IPS plus
technology it displays images in
high-definition and it's very easy to
see that the display is sharp and crisp
the iPhone 5 and contrasts uses Apple's
Retina display on its 4 inch IPS TFT
screen with a resolution of 11 36 by 640
pixels I particularly admire the vibrant
and bright colors on the iPhone 5 photos
and videos appear rich and bursting with
colors on this phone on the Nexus 4
colors are slightly subdued though still
colorful I personally prefer the
brightness of the display on the Nexus 4
because it doesn't sting or strain my
eyes with prolong viewing as for
performance these are powerful and
smooth phones with quad-core power on
the Nexus 4 and dual core power on the
iPhone 5 the Google phone runs the
latest Android 4.2.1 jellybean and the
Apple phone has the latest iOS 6.0 point
1 navigation is smooth and fluid on both
phones their respective touch screens
are very responsive and app launching is
generally quick playing games is
likewise smooth though for games I
prefer the Nexus 4's bigger screen to
the iPhone 5s cramped screen web
browsing is also generally snappy
although I noticed that photos on
webpages flicker or take a moment to
re-render and zooming in on them on the
Nexus 4 I didn't notice this behavior on
the iPhone 5 although I prefer the Nexus
4's bigger display because it allows the
screen full of text without having to
squint these two phones can play 1080p
full HD video without any problem each
phone comes with its default movie and
music player with simple and
straightforward playback controls sound
level and quality on loudspeakers are
quite wonderful but the Nexus 4's audio
tends to be muffled when placing the
phone on a flat surface because its
loudspeakers are at the back
whereas the iPhone 5s loudspeakers are
along the bottom side although both
phones have equalizer presets the Nexus
4 leaves more room for manual audio
adjustment through a five band equalizer
with bass booster and 3d effect for
storage the Nexus 4 has only two storage
models one for 8 gigabytes and another
for 16 the iPhone 5 has 3 16 32 and 64
gigabyte models as far as storage is
concerned the iPhone 5 gives you more
options the two phones won't allow you
to add more storage via microSD card for
connectivity the Nexus 4 requires a
micro sim while the iPhone 5 requires a
smaller nano SIM both phones are capable
of both 3G and Wi-Fi connections but the
iPhone 5 can also connect 4G both are
equipped with Bluetooth but in our
experience Bluetooth on the iPhone 5
sucks somehow and is somewhat very picky
when pairing with other devices the
Nexus 4 also supports NFC and uses a
standards-compliant Margaux USB port the
iPhone 5 doesn't have NFC and uses a
proprietary non standards compliant USB
port that Apple calls the Lightning port
both phones have primary cameras with
the same eight megapixel resolution each
one is capable of producing crisp and
clear photos given adequate lighting
both photo cameras are very snappy too
hardly any shutter lag on the iPhone 5
though you're stuck with only 8
megapixel photos on the Nexus 4 you can
set the camera to capture at lower sizes
even up to QVGA size both can capture up
to 1080p full HD videos with the Nexus 4
allowing you to choose lower resolutions
such as 720p and 480p generally and
based on our experience with these two
phones the iPhone 5 seems to produce
better looking photos and videos
it also has image stabilization to
reduce shaking as for battery life the
Nexus 4 has a 2100 mAh lithium polymer
battery with published talktime of 15
hours on 3G
that's enough power to last you through
a workday the iPhone 5 has a 1440 mAh
lithium polymer battery with published
talktime of eight hours on 3G all things
being equal of course the Nexus 4
appears to provide longer battery life
but then again your mileage will vary
according to use it's difficult to say
whether the Nexus 4 is better than the
iPhone 5 or vice versa
both phones have elegant designs and
great performance potential but cater to
different crowds the iPhone 5 is known
for its durability design and stable
ecosystem on the other hand the Nexus 4
comes from a lineage of customizable
software that is competitive both in
performance and price which phone offers
