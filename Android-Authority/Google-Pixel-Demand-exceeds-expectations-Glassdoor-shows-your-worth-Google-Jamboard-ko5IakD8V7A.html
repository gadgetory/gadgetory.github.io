most of you were a little meh on the
Google pixel but it turns out that
demand for the pixel is so high that
Google has run out of them they don't
have enough to meet demand as reported
by nine to five Google many people who
pre-ordered the pixel and pixel X al are
now posting on reddit that their orders
are still listed as quote pending or
pre-ordered and their credit cards have
not yet been charged some delivery
estimates have also been pushed back for
the phones which likely indicates that
Google doesn't have the supply to meet
the current demand some people who
contacted customer support are being
told that their shipments are being
pushed back well into November good
problem to have no and as a result the
alphabet stock has gone hoppin alphabet
voting shares hit a new record briefly
reaching over eight hundred and twenty
eight dollars before closing day at 821
dollars analysts attribute the jump to
the solid reviews of the Google pixel
garnered almost across the board the
pixel in the pixel XL were praised by
large swathes of the tech press for the
build quality smooth operation great
camera and especially for Google
assistant so mother Google's getting
paid well but what about you well
glassdoor is trying to help you make
sure that you're getting paid what
you're worth glassdoor the job search
and review website has released a new
feature which could tell you if you're
being paid fairly the search function
entitled know your worth ask t details
about your current occupation and
previous experience to determine if your
wage is more or less than the average
for your industry once you've filled in
your details glassdoor will display a
graph of your pay versus your market
value over time which could help inform
your future career decisions in a blog
post glassdoor CEO and co-founder Robert
Holman said and I quote most people
think salary changes every couple of
years but the truth is that salaries can
change every single day demand for jobs
change every single day all of which we
can see in know your worth now let's
talk google jam board what is google jam
board well it's a 55 inch 4k whiteboard
or just a really cool toy google wants
more businesses to use its cloud-based
collaboration apps like G
Google Drive and Google Docs and it
believes that new hardware will help
introduce those apps into more offices
the company has just announced the
Google jam board a big 55 inch 4k
touchscreen whiteboard that it plans to
officially launch early next year Google
which recently combined its cloud-based
collaboration apps under the G sweet
branding says that the jam board will
allow businesses to show any files
stored in Docs sheets and slides it will
also be able to add any images stored on
a Google Drive account the jam board
itself will also have its own set of
tools such as sticky notes and stencils
to help enhance any business
presentation it will also be able to
recognize handwriting and hand-drawn
shapes in its big display of course any
changes and files that are made to the
whiteboard can also be saved in the
cloud and checked out by later employees
on their own smartphones and tablets
while google has yet to offer much
information on what's inside the jam
board it does come with two crayon
looking passive styluses along with a
passive large eraser for when you want
to wipe the whiteboard clean of content
while it can be mounted on a wall like
any flat screen TV the Google Jam board
will also be designed so it can be
mounted on wheels where can be moved
easily around any room in an office now
Google has not put a specific price tag
on the jam board but they are assuring
us that it will not be more than 6,000
bucks what do you guys think would you
like to play with the jam board is that
something you could see would help you
in your workplace let me know in the
