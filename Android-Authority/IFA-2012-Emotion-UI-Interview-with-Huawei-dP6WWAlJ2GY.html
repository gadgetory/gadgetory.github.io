with android authority we're reporting
live from my for villain now I'm just
here with Lars why swagger he's the vice
president of a huawei Western Europe and
we're just going to explore and take a
closer look at the the emotion UI that
why always bringing to the table now so
I'll leave it to you sir okay perfect
let's have a big joke so we established
a new we gave on this fair and you look
at it what we plan to do in the next few
months so we are announced and shown to
the public the emotion user interface
because why the great thing about the US
the the most new is that is completely
takes away any kind of complexity autumn
and wat while at the same time
completely keeps the flexibility
flexibility and the personalization
features android has obviously it also
has the capability of doing everything
you want to do with the android
environments of widgets and everything
else you can still run on the system
basically what we have done is we have
combined the home screen with the app
mountain airs as you can see here
there's no it is no app launcher anymore
it's all I can based and folder place so
all the applications are in the first
layer and we want to make sure that
people who up right from which refers to
smartphones don't
in any hurts like they can use every
function as you have this great OS right
away axes out having any problems one of
the the main visible features of the
emotion why is this so called me widget
this mortgage on the home screen which
you can as a person with user completely
edit your cell so you can remove icons
rearrange icons add new icons if I want
to take up for example the media player
now and move the media player the bigger
media player on to it which is this
banner widgets just move it inside and
then you have a completely new arranged
new budget the next thing we are doing
is we we are very very strong on
personalization where you have a full
set of themes which I put white
chocolate which here themes happen um
which I which completely changed the the
way the u.s. uprights so if you for
example want to have more android
standard look at feel we typed up on
this you can see here it looks like like
like android to go play apply e and then
everything has changed to way ouch I
know it looks and take it out of the box
so you have to decide android icons but
you keep still the widgets we have in
any device sorry um
like things like like the halo effect
which I person like best he Rihanna has
round round shapes and also a nice
additional layout for four different
functionalities just go apply and it
changed it to you completely new look
and feel that's excellent these themes
we support at the moment six on the
device again the beta version we already
have on an online platform another 26
okay by the end of the year we plan to
have up to a thousand devices as the as
a target and we are working together
with design schools to make sure that
they actually get it that they work with
it me and then the next step we
obviously also want to make this
available for the end castle of course
everybody can be laid his own widget you
need to pay it back to the to the
community answers at the end of the day
community is very very important for us
yes so we want to develop these things
together with the end customer that's
why we decide to put out in retail
version so that everybody can have a
trial at it look at it and feedback and
say okay I like you I but it wouldn't it
be nice if you would actually also
supports or for example profiles
profiles we already have in a very nice
way of user profiles in better day you
know which is really really nicely
implemented um but stuff like this which
you are useful from your number phone
Cuba's on smartphones we are expecting
from the customer to come back to us as
a this would be great for the emotional
I and we were then taken into
consideration and we
and the full version every month so that
this is a very very lively experience
through up to date everybody has the
chance to to actually part of this
development so that there's a really
ryujin hype in the community around this
user interface well incorporating
crowdsourcing and also being able to
easily theme your device's something
consumers are looking for it's like
right now people have to pack and root
and mod their device and it's very
technical for many users so it should be
very very easy for everybody that's a
really great idea and in terms of the
hardware itself are you going to be able
to accelerate the speed it takes for
devices to go to market sorry the one
thing which is very very important for
what I also heard from from while we
also from deep belief within the company
is that when we launched devices they
have to be as perfect as possible of
course song get me wrong yes there's no
such thing as a person parked free
device yes but we want to send for very
very high quality we understand for a
very reliable devices so it will also
device ninety-nine point nine percent of
the users will not run into any problems
yes that is the idea that very point
very important for that matter we are
actually willing to sacrifice one or two
months for go to Marcus but having
better product with you know that's
definitely a wise strategy long term and
in terms of the pricing of the devices
are it seems that there's a devices like
the San quad XL that are at the top tier
in terms of performance and obviously
there's a lot you know they populate the
middle and lower tier
but in for the highest end devices do
you think that you're going to have a
more aggressive pricing strategy or so
in general we see ourselves kind of the
Volkswagen of the mobile phone industry
okay so we want to firstly have broad
offering from the entry-level Volkswagen
up to the high end volkswagen touareg
nice on the other on the phone side
however the SNY 21 pro which is an
entry-level ICS device which we showed
yes also on the sphere yes up to the
very very high-end quad-core device like
the SNT 14 x yes exactly all that is
very very important for us and for all
the devices right on Volkswagen we want
to be want to be very reliable very very
good hardware for it to you good service
um touch and feel yeah nice design maybe
another day a very good bargain for the
money ok funny it's very important no
absolutely this is sound strategy unless
I think what what what yoga to be
quality often so
we have launched five new devices hyouka
yes holy on the smartphone side yeah all
of them are moving their price burgers
to the best offer at the mark excellent
well I think you'll see a lot of success
with that strategy then thank you for
