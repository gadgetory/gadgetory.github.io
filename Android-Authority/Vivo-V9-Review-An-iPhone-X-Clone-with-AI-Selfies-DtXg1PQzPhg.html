smartphone and if you think it looks
like an iPhone you wouldn't be wrong it
has vertical dual cameras on the back
and not surprisingly there's a notch at
the top of the display there's a ton of
iPhone 10 look-alikes coming out this
year and despite the v9 similarities to
the iPhone 10 I didn't really mind it
all that much it's being powered by a
Snapdragon 626 processor and four
gigabytes of RAM so even though this is
vivos flagship phone it's more of a
mid-range device and isn't what we
usually think of when we hear the word
flagship performance however is
perfectly fine the phone was quick to
launch apps scrolling and swiping was
smooth and responsive and I didn't run
into any issues with lag or dropped
frames when multitasking or playing
games
the v9 uses polycarbonate or plastic for
its design so it doesn't feel quite as
nice as a phone made of glass or metal
but it still feels very sturdy it's
super lightweight because of the plastic
and the rounded corners and curved
backside makes it feel pretty
comfortable to hold the only thing I
don't like is the glossy finish which
makes it really tough to keep clean from
fingerprints it's got a large 6.3 inch
display with very thin bezels all around
giving the v9 an impressive 90% screen
to body ratio it's an LCD panel with
1080p resolution and an aspect ratio of
19 by 9 so it's slightly taller than the
18 by 9 screens that we're used to
seeing but it's not something you'll
really notice all that much even though
it's an LCD and the black levels and
contrast aren't quite as good as an OLED
panel it's still a gorgeous looking
screen its colorful vibrant has
excellent viewing angles and it's pretty
bright so I didn't have any problems
using it in direct sunlight the notch at
the top is smaller than the one on the
iPhone since it's only housing your
basic sensors the earpiece and a
front-facing camera and it doesn't
interfere with how apps appear on the
display or change any interaction with
the phone pretty much every application
works as it normally would on any other
Android smartphone but the notification
bar does color match itself to the
respective application to give the
illusion
that the app runs underneath the notch
the only exception is videos and games
since most of the videos we watch and
games that we play aren't usually in
nineteen by nine so this does result in
pillarboxing
the pillarboxing does sort of make the
knotch disappear but if you want a more
full screen experience vivo software
unless you rescale applications to build
the entire display at the expense of a
slightly cropped image now as modern as
the v9 looks and feels I thought it was
really weird that Devo chose to go with
a micro USB port instead of USB type-c
it just feels a little backwards
compared to the rest of the phone on the
plus side it does have a headphone jack
which we don't see a lot of anymore and
the fingerprint sensor that's on the
back is really fast which I didn't
expect
it's practically instantaneous and
unlocks the second I rest my finger on
the sensor it's probably one of the
fastest fingerprint sensors I've used on
any recent Android smartphone the v9
also comes with face unlock which feels
equally as fast but it isn't very
reliable in low-light vivo says that the
face unlock uses AI to detect if you're
looking at the display before it will
actually unlock and it does work but I
don't know if I buy that there's any
real AI happening here another area that
vivo uses AI is in the front facing
camera the v9 has a very high resolution
24 megapixel selfie camera that is
supposed to give you the quote-unquote
perfect selfie where the AI comes into
play is with the beauty mode it's
supposed to be able to detect your age
sex skin tone and texture to give you a
better looking selfie and that sounds
great and all but I didn't really notice
much of a difference between an AI
Beauty selfie and a normal selfie other
than its softening some of the details
in my face the qualities of the selfies
though are pretty good with nice detail
and natural skin tones and there's a
portrait mode if you want to add some
extra background blur the primary rear
camera comes in at 16 megapixels with a
secondary 5 megapixel depth sensor which
means you have portrait mode on the rear
camera as well but because of the depth
sensor it's a little bit more advanced
you have the ability to simulate an
aperture ranging from as wide as at
point 9 5 to us
small as f-16 and the point of focus can
be adjusted after the fact which is
something you can't do with the front
camera it's pretty similar to the wide
aperture mode that we see on huawei or
on ER phones and I like this feature
because you're able to tweak the image
to how you want it to look image quality
from the 16 megapixel camera is fairly
decent when you're in good lighting
colors are pleasant with good details
and sharpness but it does struggle a bit
in high contrast situations you either
wind up with the photo that's too dark
or too bright and it never seems to be
able to get the exposure quite right the
camera falls apart pretty quickly in
low-light with muddy details washed out
colors and overblown highlights but this
didn't really surprise me all that much
since the camera doesn't have oh is and
it also doesn't have the brightest
aperture at F 2.0 now before I talk
about battery life I want to throw out a
quick disclaimer my usage with the vivo
b9 was purely on Wi-Fi as I was unable
to get mobile data to work on this phone
I tried a couple different SIM cards
rebooted the phone and made sure my APN
settings were correct but nothing seemed
to work for what it's worth I was able
to get through a full day very
comfortably even with a lot of YouTube
watching and gaming I would show you
screen on time numbers but vivo software
for some reason doesn't show you a total
amount of screen on time and instead
breaks it down on a per app basis
speaking of software the v9 is running
Android 8.1 Oreo with a custom skin that
vivo calls fun touch OS like many other
parts of the b9 fun touch OS is very
heavily inspired by Apple there's no app
drawer and a lot of icons look almost
identical to iOS you can swipe down for
a spotlight search feature and swipe up
for control center and the v9 even has
an option for iPhone 10 like swipe
gestures that let you swipe up for home
swipe up and hold for the app switcher
and swipe left or right along the bottom
to quickly switch between recent
applications despite feeling like an iOS
clone it does have some pretty useful
features like the game mode that can
auto reject phone calls while you're
gaming and let you answer messages
without having to leave the game
there's also a motorbike mode that
prioritizes your safety when it comes to
phone calls and messages and an app
cloning feature that lets you run
multiple instances of the same app which
can come in handy for apps that don't
support multiple accounts as of right
now the vivo b9 is only available in
India so I would not recommend picking
one of these up if you're in the US if
you are interested the price converts to
roughly three hundred and sixty US
dollars but you'll most likely be paying
much more than that to import one if
you're in the US you have some other
options like the honor 7x which is very
comparable to the b9 in terms of
hardware and features and will be
significantly cheaper at $200 the V 9 is
a great option if you're able to easily
get your hands on one but for the rest
of us Devo has shown us more exciting
stuff in the past several months that is
worth waiting for so that about wraps up
