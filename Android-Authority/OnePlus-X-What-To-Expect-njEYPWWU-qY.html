domain.com that's right we got more news
on the oneplus X one class has been
teasing the launch of a new product for
October 29th with the tagline powerfully
beautiful going by the teaser image the
company is preparing to announce it's
one plus x smartphone according to the
company's Twitter account oneplus will
be heading to london for its next launch
event a similar X shape was used in the
teaser for an Indian focused event that
took place earlier this week so we could
be looking at a global release for this
upcoming handset shortly after the
teaser popped up a phone known as the
oneplus Mini was accidentally posted on
the Amazon India website complete with
pretty much full list of specifications
the next one plus smartphone looks to be
a mid-range er the handset features a
5-inch 1080p display with Corning
Gorilla Glass 3 and synaptics clear
glass technology the listing also
includes an octa-core MediaTek mt 67 95
system-on-a-chip 2 gigabytes of ram 32
gigabytes of internal memory and a 2,450
milliamp hour battery the phone is said
to be powered by oxygen 3.0 which is
based on Android 6.0 marshmallow other
rumors pin the smartphone's camera on a
13 megapixel sensor powered by Sony
which features phase detection autofocus
technology but will lack optical image
stabilisation ip67 certification NFC FM
radio and IR blaster and front-facing
speakers are expected to be featured in
the oneplus X giving it plenty of extras
to boast about now here's the potential
problem for oneplus previously they have
branded themselves as the best bang for
your buck option one plus one and
somewhat last the oneplus 2 were the
best bang for your buck options
fantastic specs at a much cheaper price
than almost anyone else only comparable
to the Nexus 5 now what is this this is
a mid tier option under the oneplus
brand kind of waters that brand down now
some of you may be thinking I am being
overzealous or to nitpicking but in a
history of marketing it has been crucial
to brand your product in a certain way
and
water down that brand so for example ZTE
is doing this very well ZTE is trying to
make top-tier phones and one they want
to make entry level or mid tier phones
they create a new brand to sell those
phones in that market Toyota didn't make
a high quality high-end Toyota no they
made the Lexus and it is sold
exceptionally well you can't muddy the
message to your users if oneplus is that
high end best bang for your buck phone
and they want to create a mid to your
phone do that under a different brand
we'll see how it goes let me know what
you think in the comments below so why
don't we just help out oneplus a little
bit and create for them a new brand name
for their mid tier offerings that's
right for any one of you who can come up
with the best brand name that's
available with the dot-com extension I
will send you a t-shirt to wherever you
are in the world
this could get fun now why is that
because no domain name extension tells
your story with the same degree of trust
as a dot-com or dotnet domain name.com
and dotnet domain name extensions inject
credibility into your online presence
