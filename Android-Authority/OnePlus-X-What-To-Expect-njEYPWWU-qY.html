domain.com that's right we got more news
on the oneplus x one class has been
teasing the launch of a new product for
october 29th with the tagline powerfully
beautiful going by the teaser image the
company is preparing to announce its 1
plus X smartphone according to the
company's Twitter account 1 plus we'll
be heading to London for its next launch
event a similar X shape was used in the
teaser for an Indian focused event that
took place earlier this week so we could
be looking at a global release for this
upcoming handset shortly after the
teaser popped up a phone known as the
one plus mini was accidentally posted on
the amazon india website complete with
pretty much full list of specifications
the next one plus smartphone looks to be
a mid-ranger the hens that features a
5-inch 1080p display with Corning
Gorilla Glass 3 and synaptics clear
glass technology the listing also
includes an octo core MediaTek mt6589
ceramic ego bytes of internal memory and
a two thousand four hundred and fifty
million power battery the phone is said
to be powered by oxygen three point 0
which is based on Android 6.0 other
rumors pin the smartphone's camera on a
13 megapixel sensor powered by Sony
which features phase detection autofocus
technology but will lack optical image
stabilization ip67 certification NFC FM
radio and ir blaster and front-facing
speakers are expected to be featured in
the oneplus x giving it plenty of extras
to boast about now here's the potential
problem for one plus previously they
have branded themselves as the best bang
for your buck option 1 plus 1 and
somewhat less the oneplus two were the
best bang for your buck options
fantastic specs at a much cheaper price
than almost anyone else only comparable
to the Nexus 5 now what is this this is
a mid-tier option under the oneplus
brand kind of waters that brand down now
some of you may be thinking I am being
overzealous or to nitpicking but in a
history of marketing it has been crucial
to brand your product in a certain way
waterdown that brand so for example ZTE
is doing this very well ZTE is trying to
make top-tier phones and one they want
to make entry level or mid to your
phones they create a new brand to sell
those phones in that market Toyota
didn't make a high-quality high-end
Toyota know they made the Lexus and it
is sold exceptionally well you can't
muddy the message to your users if one
plus is that high-end best bang for your
buck phone and they want to create a mid
to your phone do that under a different
brand we'll see how it goes let me know
what you think in the comments below so
why don't we just help out one plus a
little bit and create for them a new
brand name for their mid tier offerings
that's right for any one of you who can
come up with the best brand name that's
available with the dot-com extension I
will send you a t-shirt to wherever you
are in the world this could get fun now
why is that because no domain name
extension tells your story with the same
degree of trust as a calm or dotnet
