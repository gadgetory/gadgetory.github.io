by Toyota and almost as rapidly as it
came CES is gradually coming to a close
and we are here on the third day of the
show but day 5 for us and as you can see
behind us a very very nice metaphor for
the ending supposedly coming very
quickly of CES no one's here we
basically are the only people here aside
from the cleaning crew but with that in
mind it's josh regard from andhra Tory
what's going on everybody i'm here with
darksteel a cuvette vandroid authority
hey you guys doing all right then we're
here just winding down the day we got
out a few great videos for you along
with a couple of interviews I will get
to it a little bit but we're just going
to recap what was going on today this
morning we woke up and we went straight
to a sous for a very very special
announcements don't you go ahead and
fill them in about what happened well
this marks the inaugural time the
android authority is going to be holding
an annual CES 2014 best of android
awards we're very privileged and please
provide aces with our highest
affirmation for the best android phone
of 2014 yes and why do you think that
was josh well we we look at a lot of
different factors when it comes to
picking what we believe is the best
phone we get that question all the time
and a lot of time when I get that
question I asked them what you need it
for well when I think of a phone that
has to get the best android phone award
i think of one that anybody can use one
that i could wholeheartedly suggest to
pretty much anybody that I know and
often that has to do with accessibility
and price has a big big factor in that
so we have for three phones rather in
this end phone line the four five and
six all because those are the sizes of
the phones but every single one of them
comes under the two hundred dollar price
point and I was just absolutely
incredible we played with the phones for
a little bit the you I was actually very
nice and very easy to use it was a
snappy and very smooth experience on
these phones and for that price you
really can't go wrong and that's the
reason why they got our best android
phone award
make a mistake these are not cheap
phones this is my great quality horse
and I just really really evident when we
saw them so we deliberate on the Sony
Xperia z1 compact was very close yes
marketing 20.7 megapixel camera
Snapdragon 800 in a really spelt package
but considering its price point mhm we
had your hind a basis because there's a
lot of people out there who would love
to have a high quality smartphone at a
more affordable price yeah bet the best
android phone shouldn't be in my opinion
one that you just wish you could have it
should be one that you could have so
with that in mind we were able to meet
with a sous and give them the award
which is a lovely lovely event and we
are we were actually able to look at the
foreign one Transformer book do wet as a
well that uses a windows 8 and Android
to creating experience on a tablet and
as a lap times we had the privilege of
meeting I know who's a huge inspiration
for you and one for me as well jon
rettinger of TechnoBuffalo absolutely a
gentleman who is a veteran in our
industry a bona fide expert someone who
lives and breathes mobile technology and
technology of all kinds and we could act
interview with him and to be honest I'm
still sort of swooning as though I
working teenage kind of girls seeing
some celebrity story but it was just a
huge honor and this Day marks the
culmination so many years of hard work
absolutely and so we're all very touched
and humbled the two of us got to
interview tricia from SourceFed nerd and
she's just just a lovely personality the
very lovely and talented Trisha and that
was one of the most spirited interviews
I've ever been in I thought that was
really awesome speaking of their
inspirations yes John definitely one of
them he's been at this for quite a while
but i will i will give my own little
shout out as well because yesterday at
the revision 3 meetup that i told you
about yesterday i was actually able to
have a nice long conversation with my
inspirational figure from my childhood
from the old tech TV days patrick norton
he's just this hulking guy and I'm this
small asian guy
ok Patrick and he sat down and he talked
to me for for all of like half an hour
to even more he wants to talk to us even
more you know he went so contact he's so
humbling yes tomorrow we have a lot of
great content coming especially in
regards to wearable technology and also
a lot of the more kind of not necessary
fringe but these are the phones that you
the in the Western audience may not
necessarily know much about we're going
to show you what those are like keep it
tuned here at Android Authority CES 2014
and once again thank you to Toyota for
sponsoring our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
