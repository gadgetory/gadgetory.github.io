Olympian well maybe not but if you are
an athlete type then you might be
interested in this Olympic edition of
the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 it makes a lot
of sense that a company from South Korea
is going to celebrate the fact that that
country is the host of the Winter
Olympics going on right now and with
this particular phone you have a white
backing with of course the Olympic rings
down here on the bottom and some themes
and some graphics that are used for the
phone's interface the white backing
almost always looks pristine you don't
even really see any fingerprints or
smudges on here and then of course it is
accented by this gold frame that is not
all the way gold it looks a little bit
more like a cross between gold and
silver but overall it is a great looking
phone that is probably one of the
best-looking versions of the note 8 that
we've ever seen now obviously
functionally everything else is about
the same you have the s-pen that also
gets that little bit of a paint job in
order to match this white edition this
white Olympic Edition and from there you
have some elements inside of the
interface via an Olympic theme that you
can get from the Samsung theme store it
is of course enabled by default which
means that there are rings and small
motifs all over the interface to reflect
the Winter Olympics occurring right now
in Pyeongchang now as far as who would
use this device obviously if you are a
fan of the Olympics and you really want
to show your pride then this is one of
the ways to do it but for anybody that
is actually working out or going to the
gym regularly it might not be the most
comfortable phone to have because it's
still a very large device it's a little
bit taller and because of the glass on
glass design you would hope that it
doesn't drop or get any weights dropped
on it for example what's anybody out
there that really puts health and
fitness first perhaps the idea of being
an Olympian is an inspiring one in
of itself and to have those rings on the
back of what is probably the
best-looking no date we've ever seen is
a really nice gesture
now we're really lucky to get a look at
this phone because it is one of the
rarest items probably one of the most
special editions ever and pretty much
nobody in the US or even back in Asia
will be able to buy it because it's only
available for Olympians so if you are
inspired to become an Olympian because
you want to have this phone well there
you go there's the inspiration you were
looking for but it's the kind of phone
that I would really only see people who
are already into the fitness world using
anyway and if you are close to becoming
an Olympian well maybe Samsung will have
a treat like this for you if you're able
to make it to the Olympic Games let us
know what you think about this phone and
if you would want one because it is a
super special edition by telling us what
you think in the comments down below and
then don't forget to hit like on these
videos and if you're not subscribed to
android authority already make sure you
do so there's a lot of stuff coming up
in 2018 including Mobile World Congress
which is happening in just a week or so
so keep it tuned for that and all of the
great flagships and coverage that we're
going to have at Mobile World Congress
in Barcelona because we are of course
