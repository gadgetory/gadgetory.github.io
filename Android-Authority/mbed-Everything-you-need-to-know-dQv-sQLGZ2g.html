found in a bewildering range of devices
from single board computers like the
Raspberry Pi right up to servers like
HP's moonshot course we also find them
in our smart phones and our tablets
needing our Chromebooks but I'm also
make a range of microcontrollers known
as the cortex M range and in fact
they're probably more popular than the
cortex a range last year arms partners
ship some 4.4 billion microcontrollers
hello there my name is Gary Simms from
Andrew authority and today I want to
talk about arms microcontrollers and the
EM Bay platform a cordless M
microcontroller is quite different to a
cortex a microprocessor really there are
two different ends of a scale there's no
access to a GPU for example when you're
using a microcontroller it doesn't have
access to a sophisticated memory
management unit for virtual addressing
it runs a completely difference of speed
and microcontroller might run it may be
only 48 megahertz or 100 megahertz and
it has only a tiny amount of RAM maybe
16 K or 32 K quite different to what
we're expecting what we see with cortex
a micro processors so what are they for
well if your microwave oven has a small
display on it it's probably using a
microcontroller this control circuit
inside your washing machine are probably
using a microcontroller in fact we'll
find them in wearables like the Fitbit
that also uses a microcontroller rather
than a micro processor we find them in
cars in toys in smart locks in security
systems in musical instruments we find
them in anywhere that needs some kind of
computer control but with a low amount
of power and not much performance of
course the big thing that is a
blossoming at the moment is the Internet
of Things and microcontrollers are
perfect for the Internet of Things it's
able to capture data talk to the network
send it up to the cloud and allow us to
make intelligent decisions on the
information that we've received and this
might sound quite complicated quite
inaccessible but actually thanks to arms
embed platform it isn't for just $12 you
can get yourself a small board with a
micro controller on it that
allows you to start programming almost
straightaway before going on it's worth
mentioning the different
microcontrollers in arms cortex-m range
there are currently six microcontrollers
the cortex M zero the M zero plus the M
one the M 3 the M for and the m7 the M
zero is the smallest and the silicon for
this chip can fit onto the cross section
or the hair as you go up the range the
microcontrollers increasing complexity
and speed the m3s micro architecture
includes branch speculation and 32-bit
Hardware divide while the m4 adds DSP
extensions and the ability to use an
optional floating-point unit the m7 is
arms latest microcontroller and offers
greater performance and more features
for example it offers twice the DSP
performance as the m4 the key thing
about the M bed platform is all you need
is a web browser and a USB connection to
start programming the development
environment is all web-based and from
within your web browser you can write
code and compile it to a binary when you
plug the board into your computer via
USB it appears as a flash drive to copy
your program onto the board all you need
to do is drag and drop the binary from
the Downloads folder onto the drive hit
the reset button and your board will
start running the program that you have
written the language of the embedded
platform is C and C++ that means that
anyone with high school level
programming experience can start
programming an embed board you don't
need to worry about inventing the wheel
again as the embed platform provides a
whole range of libraries so that your
board can communicate with other
peripherals and with the outside world
for examples there are libraries for
networking USB LCDs displays audio
monitors sensors NFC barcodes DSPs and
so on later this year arm will release
the next iteration of its embed platform
which will include embed OS and the
embed client embed OS is a new operating
system designed for IOT devices that
enables them to securely connect to the
rest of the world it will be open source
and is designed specifically for arms
cortex-m range of microcontrollers
the embed client is a set of core layer
bridge which allows embed OS programs to
be
to cortex a based computers and board
running Linux in other words you can
develop an IOT or other network away a
program using embed OS on a cortex and
microcontroller and then simply just by
recompiling ported to balls like the
Raspberry Pi or the Odroid c1 at the
time of writing there are over 50 boards
available for the embed platform
everything from simple cortex m0 base
board with no integrated peripherals to
board with built-in displays
accelerometers networking on Wi-Fi there
are even bought of cellular connectivity
board with Bluetooth and there's even a
robot to help you get an idea of what
you can do with a cortex-m
microcontrollers and with the embed
platform I'm going to look at four
boards and see what you can do with each
one of them the first board is the
freedom KL 25 0 free scale this board
uses a cortex m+ core clocked 48
megahertz and includes 16 K of RAM plus
128 K a flash it comes with a built-in
three color LED a 3-axis accelerometer
and a capacitive touch sensor this makes
a great starter board and you can pick
one up for just $13 in the world of
microcontrollers the simplest program
you can write is one that will flash the
LED on and off is the equivalent to the
hello world program that is so often
used during programming language
tutorials ok so what I want to show you
now is how you write a very simple
program the blinking LED program the
hello world program or the embed world
to see how easy it is to put it onto one
of these Balter first we go to embed org
then over here at the right we click on
the developer site and I've already
logged in with my account and then up
here at the top it says compiler so we
go there that'll open up another tab and
we get an integrated IDE here in the web
browser now as you can see there's
nothing in the web browser at the moment
so I'm going to go to import and this
will give me a list of all the different
example projects that are available on
the embed web site and the first one I
want to import now is embed blinky just
turns the LED on and off we hit import
yep horn we important that and here it
is now just one thing to know he's
helped here at the right top right-hand
side I've already selected the ball that
I'm using you can click on that button
and in hand select any boards that you
like that are available on the embed
website I've got that one board at the
moment so we're using that one now if we
double-click on main.cpp we'll see a
very simple program this one says that
the variable my lid is connected to the
lid and then here my lid we turn the lid
on and off again with a slight pause in
between nothing very difficult it's an
infinite loop here while one would go
round and round around forever
switching that LED on and off so to get
it what we do is hit the compile button
this will compile the program on embeds
website and you can see it's downloaded
a file here embed blinky dot bin now
I've got my downloads folder already
open here
there's the father's has been downloaded
from the web browser and here dry an e
as you can see has come from the actual
ball that I've plugged in when you plug
it in it appears as a flash drive and
all I need to do is drag the file from
here to here and it will program the
board and start running it so here I
have the board plugged into my laptop
USB connector at this and giving power
to the board and also allows data to be
transferred to it it allows it to be
programmed this end is connected in to
my laptop what's this green light when I
copy over the file it will flash to show
the file is being reprogrammed the board
is being reprogrammed and then watch to
see what happens with this LED here so
here we go we're going to copy over the
file onto the board notice the flashing
LED the green one and there's the red
one flashing that's the blinky program
that we just compiled our next board is
the Nordic n RF five one eight two two
this borders is a cortex m0
microcontroller clocked just 16
megahertz and includes 16 K of RAM and
128 K of flash in terms of performance
that might seem like a step backwards
from the KL 25
but the this board is special in that it
has built-in Bluetooth 4.1 and includes
a battery slot so the board can be
independently powered by a single 2032
coin cell battery the M 0 is designed
for the lowest possible power usage and
is therefore perfect for standalone
Bluetooth applications and this is where
Android comes in like a Fitbit or other
Vette wearables this ball is the perfect
building block for devices that will
communicate with an Android smartphone
over Bluetooth Low Energy now here I've
got the Nordic board with the Bluetooth
built-in capabilities Bluetooth Low
Energy again connected via USB to give
it power that this one has got a slot
for a battery not much else is happening
here on the board we can see this little
LED is flashing here ok but if we get
out my Android phone better see the
Bluetooth signals that this device is
sending out so here I am running the ble
scanner as you can see the first entry
is for my Fitbit the second entry is for
this ball is advertising itself as h RM
one which is something you can define in
the code if we connect to it now we
better see what the scanner is picking
up is pinging all these different
services we're interested in the heart
rate service let's click on that there's
lots of other things it can tell you but
one of them is the heart rate
measurement which we want to go to there
we hit notification and we can see the
heart rate information coming in 161
beats per minute 160 260 will just keep
on going up to 175 then it cycles back
down to a hundred again that's just
something set in the code because it is
really just a fake heartbeat information
that is which is using in his up but
there he goes come back down to a
hundred now and it will just cycle round
and round around but this shows the
Bluetooth working on that board so how
about that for instead of things devices
a Bluetooth smart phone now just imagine
what you could create next up is the
embed LPC 1768 and its application board
the 1768 doesn't look like much on the
outside but on the inside it's quite
different as well as sporting a cortex
m3 processor it has 32 K of memory and
512 K of flash but more importantly has
for built-in Ethernet and USB the power
of the LPC 1768 can be seen when you
connect it to its application board the
board comes with an impressive set of
peripherals and sensors including a
graphics LCD an rj45 Ethernet connector
a five-way joystick two potentiometers a
speaker a three axis accelerometer two
servo motor headers a temperature sensor
and a socket for a ZigBee although you
won't find a finished product based
around this application board in its
prototype form it certainly makes a good
springboard for building something like
an IOT device for example you can use
the temperature sensor on the board
together with an Ethernet connection to
periodically upload the current room
temperature to cloud services like
things speak it would also be possible
to integrate the board with your Android
device again using a service like things
speak you could write an app to send
commands to your LPC 1768 to perform
home automation tasks ask for specific
sensor data or even get to perform a
task for you
like tweeting or sending an email in
fact the only limit is your imagination
if you want something that's a bit more
fun than IOT devices then I recommend
the M Bach from outrageous circuits it
is an n-bit enabled robot with the
reflective sensors LEDs and a buzzer on
first power up and bot is loaded with
software that makes it dance on a table
without falling off it does this by
reading the two reflective sensors on
the front if it detects no reflection it
knows that is off the edge of the table
and will back up and turn it only cost
$30 and provides a great introduction to
microcontroller programming outrageous
circuit provides all of the source code
for the default program and also
provides full documentation including
schematics pin outs and a hackers guide
as I mentioned earlier that over 50
boards available for the embayed
platform this number is growing all of
the time the board's action today
arranges a brief overview of some of the
things you can achieve with a
microcontroller and of course once you
add connectivity to your smartphone once
you add connectivity to the cloud the
possibilities are endless
