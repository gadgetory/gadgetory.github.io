partnership between Oppo and Amazon
India it's real selling point was its
price for around $100 but it came with
some decent performance considering that
low price it had great face unlocking it
had a Helio P 60 processor which was
fast enough for most tasks the biggest
issue was the lack of a fingerprint
sensor which for some people would have
been a deal breaker
then just months later Romi became its
own brand and it came out with the real
me - not only was this strange because
it was so soon after the real me one but
it's also stranger because it wasn't
entirely an upgrade over the real me one
it fixed some of the issues it had a
fingerprint sensor and the camera was a
big improvement now a dual lens camera
with a much higher megapixel count it
also had a whopping 4230 million power
battery which could go for a long time
in fact it was one of the best phones
that I've used in terms of longevity
thanks for that low resolution combined
with that huge battery unfortunately
also took some steps backwards the
screen was a lower resolution at 720p
and the processor was the snapdragon 450
which is actually significantly slower
and then just a few months after that
realme is come out with a real meaty pro
which is actually the upgrade that the
real me - should have been by a long
margin it's a very often when an OEM
brings out a range of devices you'll see
them laid out in the show room left to
right so that you have the cheapest and
oldest device with the lowest specs on
the left and it will progress slowly to
the right with the newest and most
expensive and powerful device on the
right however that wouldn't be a very
accurate representation in this case
rather we'd have the real me one and two
on top of each other like that with
their strange neck-and-neck specs and
then we'd have the real me - pro all the
way over here because it's that much
better it's not quite perfect so let's
take a look and see how it does so in
terms of specs and performance like I
say this is a huge upgrade over the real
me - this time around are getting these
Snapdragon 668 SOC which gives you far
better performance for gaming you should
easily be able to handle most of the
games on the Play Store it's not a
workhorse by any stretch of the
imagination this isn't one of the most
powerful devices out there but it's more
than enough for the vast majority of
tasks and it's a significant step up
from
either of the two previous models it
comes with up to 8 gigabytes of RAM
which is a huge upgrade and it comes
with 128 gigabytes of storage the
battery is unfortunately a step back
again this time from the real me to at
3500 million powers but that's more than
enough for most people you still have
the fingerprint sensor and there is a
headphone jack down the bottom and
fortunately there's no NFC which has
been true for all three of the devices
and which is also fairly standard at
this price point so we can forgive them
to me the biggest drawback of the
hardware setup in this case is the
microUSB down the bottom we've seen
manufacturers charge very low prices and
include a USB type-c so we know it's
possible and this device has got the pro
suffix in its moniker you'd think it
would have a USB type-c so that's a bit
of a mistake in my opinion it's a blight
on an otherwise good hardware setup a
blight I tell you you've also also
probably noticed at this point that the
design is a significant step up also
from the previous model so these two
were very plasticky feeling this one has
a glass build they also have this kind
of diamond effect on the back which I
did quite liked but like I said in my
reviews it wasn't always visible
depending on the light this one has what
real me is calling a dude drop back and
I don't really know what that means but
it basically has an extra layer of
transparent glass on top which gives it
this nice kind of depth effect and as
you can see the colour here is quite
attractive more impressive is the screen
around the front which is a full HD
display and it has an actual dew drop
not show at the top here which makes it
very small as for the camera it's a 16
megapixel primary shooter with a
secondary depth sensor it has a very
nice big aperture at 1.7 and round the
front you also get another 16 megapixel
camera which is of course very good for
selfies
in all honesty I've prepared to not like
the camera on the real me to pro but
it's actually not bad at all given the
price in fact at this price point I'd
say it's one of the selling points so
it's definitely not perfect it struggles
a fair bit with exposure as you can
probably tell right now and it lacks a
bit of detail when you zoom in close on
things they can be a little bit over
sharpened however on the whole photos
have got nice saturation good contrast
and good dynamic range they also have
that nice F 1.7 aperture which means air
you get the natural depth effects and at
the same time the low-light performance
is also much better than you would
expect plus it's nice to have the 16
megapixel camera at the front here for
things like vlogging and of course
selfies you also get the faux bouquet
effect which is all but two mandatory
these days that's a bit hidden mist as
tends to be the case at this price point
but it's nice to have it there but yeah
if you look at the auto exposure in this
video then you can really see the
limitations obviously not a problem if
you're filming somewhere with a nice
table lighting but if you're filming out
on the go and you're a professional
vlogger a youtuber then video like this
would unfortunately be unusable on the
whole the camera isn't going to be
suitable for someone who's a social
media aficionado but at the same time
it's more than suitable for just
chronicling your adventures your meals
out with friends and the crazy stuff
that your dog does I do always say that
the devil is in the detail when it comes
to devices and there are some ways that
this is going to give away the fact that
you're using a cheaper device it's
running colour OS on top of Android
which personally I'm not a big fan of it
has a few irritating features like the
inability to remove notifications what
is that about and it doesn't look as
nice in my opinion as most other skins
in fact I think it's probably the
ugliest Android skin around at the
moment likewise another little
irritation for me is the haptic feedback
which I found a bit loud and buzzy other
people say to me kind just turn it off
and the answer is yes but I'd rather
have it on I just want it to be good and
there are a couple of places where this
doesn't feel like a free
experience but then it's not so that's
absolutely fine I used this for a couple
of days and it was perfectly up to the
task when I was doing my productivity
tasks when I was playing basic games
from the Play Store so it's decently
performant for that price speaking of
it's the price of course here that is
going to make or break this as a
proposition so if you go for the more
expensive model then you could actually
have gotten a pocke phone f1 for just
$50 more and you've got significantly
higher specs better performance as a
result and if you went for the cheaper
model then it would be roughly
equivalent in price to the chamois me a
2 for instance and that has very roughly
equivalent specs so I was hoping this
was going to be for the budget market
what the PACU phone f1 was for the
mid-range unfortunately is not that it's
a fairly standard offering for the price
but that's not to say it's not good
value it is good value it's a nicely
made phone and it will perform really
well it's just another example of how
you can get a really decent phone these
days for a lower budget and there's much
more option for people these days who
don't want to spend a fortune on their
Android device it's definitely a big
step in the right direction for real me
and that's a callback to one of my
previous reviews if you didn't see it it
was really clever
in other news I'm really tired I give
this phone a well-done real me thanks
