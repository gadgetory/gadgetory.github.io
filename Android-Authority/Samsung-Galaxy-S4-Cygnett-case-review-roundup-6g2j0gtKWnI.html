that's certainly like no other with its
recent release and record-breaking sales
in the past two months is put a ripple
and android and smartphone communities
alike now many case manufacturers are
trying to ride this wave and produce
quality accessories for the galaxy s4
and signet is no stranger to this
territory as they are a front-runner in
a case game now it's always a difficult
decision when choosing a case for your
smartphone but signet has exactly what
you need whether you're looking for
style ultimate protection or the best of
both worlds what's up everyone clayton
youngberg here with android authority
calm your number one source for all
things android and today i'm going to
review six of cygnus hottest cases for
the gs4 so today we've got six signet
cases and every single one of them
serves a different purpose whether it be
protection aesthetics or just the feel
of the case now they also come with
screen savers that you can apply and
many people are wondering if the screen
savers in fact fit inside the case so
I'm installing my screensaver right now
and i'll be using every single case in
the video with the screen saver applied
now oftentimes if you have different
brands screensavers they might not be
compatible with the cases you've
purchased so always make sure to get a
screen saver and case combo if you're
ordering cases but you won't have to
worry because they come with them
anyways getting right into it we're
going to check out our urban shield case
for the samsung galaxy s4 now this is
designed with actual carbon fiber and
has a nice white accent throughout the
entire case you simply pop the phone in
and it formed fits to the galaxy s4
quite surprisingly now there's access to
all the buttons including the volume
home and power you also have your
speaker part on the back cutout as well
as camera and LED in one hole looks very
very great with the carbon fiber and it
just sparkles in the light next we're
going to check out our cage tactile flip
case now this is a very very stylish
case and it also is very functional as
well protects both the front and back of
the galaxy s4 with a hard shell on the
back and a soft flip cover on the front
now it's very soft to the touch and it
also provides cutouts for all of your
necessities and it has a credit card or
a business card holder in the front flip
the front cover is sewn on and it's very
heavy-duty does not feel like it's going
to tear off anytime soon it provides
protection for the volume
keys as well we have access to our top
and bottom of our phone including the
charger and the headphone port as well
as the mics and we can actually fold the
case for a media stand it's very very
nice next we're checking out our flip
fiber soft microfiber flip case now this
is made with microfiber so it is a bit
softer than the first case case but it
is still a flip cover case very durable
in the back nice and soft in the front
with some nice artwork on the front as
well fits very nicely with the phone and
looks great in the Sun of course it
provides the cutouts for the LED power
volume headphones microphone and charger
and this one has a credit card holder as
well now this one you can't use as a
media stand but it makes up for it with
this beautiful aesthetics just fits
greatly on the Samsung Galaxy s4 and the
color matches the blue color galaxy s4
as well next case up is the feel soft
touch slim case now this is more along
the lines of the cases that most people
are used to it's just a shell case but
it does have a nice rubberized coating
on the outside that feels great hence
the name simply snap your Galaxy s4 in
and you have protection wrong along the
bezel you also have access to the bottom
speaker LED camera and all the buttons
on the device feels very great in the
hand it has a nice color it's available
in multiple colors as well and it
protects your Galaxy S 4 from Falls to
the side and back
so next we have our form high gloss slim
case now the packaging doesn't lie it's
very glossy that's a nice vibrant finish
and it is quite slim now as you can see
this is in pink but they do have other
color combinations as well but many of
our viewers will enjoy the pink case
anyways when you slide this case on you
simply snap the galaxy s4 into place you
can slide it in your pocket from there
like all the others it does have the
power cut out volume as well and then it
exposes the top and bottom of the galaxy
s4 so if you drop it in lens directly on
the top at the bottom you will sustain a
little damage but i would feel perfectly
safe dropping it on its back we have cut
out for speakers as well on a nice
signet logo you can see the high gloss
is vibrant and it's popping galaxy s4
looks great in this case and I would
suggest it to anyone on a budget next we
have the best of the best with the
workmate evolution case now this one's a
try material extra protective case and
actually comes together or comes apart
into as you can see this is black and
blue looks very nice and as I have the
darker samsung galaxy s4 and popping it
into the first layer you can already see
the color match so you simply do just
pop the rubber layer on and then from
then you put the blue shell on and click
it into place you can see there's a nice
anti-slip protection on the back and
that will absorb some of the impact if
you drop it now this one has full
protection including the corners sides
and it has a deep dish bezel to help if
you drop your samsung galaxy s4 face
down if there's any protrusions in the
ground see the deep dish is a few
millimeters tall and it is going to
protect your phone so here are a few
tips guys out of the six cases we
checked out if style is you thing I
would definitely go for the urban shield
the flip fiber any cash cases these have
unmatched aesthetics and they don't
compromise on protection at all the case
and the flip fiber both have front
covers so they're going to protect the
front of your screen and then you can't
be the carbon fiber styling on the urban
shield if you are looking for a budget
case that also is very stylish and
looking for a few different color
options I would go for the feel and the
form cases these are just your Bay
six shell cases but they work very very
well and they look nice too but if
you're looking for ultimate protection
and you do want some nice aesthetics I
would definitely go for the work mate
case this one has unmatched protection
it has that deep dish so you're not
going to drop your phone and break it on
a rock or anything like that if it lands
screen down two layers of protection and
then you can't beat the color scheme
especially if you have a darker colored
galaxy s4 alright anyways guys check
these cases out hit up signet calm or go
to Amazon and browse through the signet
cases for the samsung galaxy s4 will
also provide links to these specific
cases covered in the video and as always
thank you very much for watching this is
