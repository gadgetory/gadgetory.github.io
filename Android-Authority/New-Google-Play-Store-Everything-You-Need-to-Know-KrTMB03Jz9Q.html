the android authority app guy so get
this google has completely redesigned
the google play store in this video
we'll explore this new play store and do
some quick comparisons to the old one
first let's talk about some features
upon a cursory glance it doesn't appear
as though google has added any
additional features to the new play
store in most cases it's the same old
stuff with new clothes on you can still
surf by app movies music books etc you
can still see what's trending and the
hottest new stuff so in that regard very
little has actually changed however
there are a few things here and there
beside each Play Store entry is a three
dots button pressing it allows you to
download the application right then and
there instead of having to open up the
app page for people who run down through
lists and download apps quickly this is
a huge time saver additionally they've
removed a few things from the old Play
Store that caused the experience to be
slower when downloading applications
will no longer be hounded by the
annoying keep shopping page when you
start to download it'll go right back to
the app screen like it used to which can
also save some time the big change here
is design if you take a look at the old
play store it had a sort of magazine
layout there are no spaces between
anything and it all looks cluttered
together with Google trying to get the
most content out of the least amount of
space in the new design well the design
is much cleaner if you are entering the
Play Store knowing exactly where you
want to go the new app design helps you
get there faster for those looking to
explore and see what's new the quick
navigation and well labeled pages help
you do that as well to be honest though
not even the design is that different
the front page is no longer a cluttered
mess having been replaced by a much
cleaner front page instead of a tiled
list it's now a card view similar to
that of Google now also it's gone from a
dark theme to a light theme which really
only matters if you were really fond of
the dark theme however when you search
through things it's essentially the same
experience all the categories are still
there top new paid top new free trending
and all that stuff is all still there
the categories follow the same color
schemes movies are still red music is
still orange the apps are still green so
while there are some noticeable
differences the core experience remains
the same so people won't have to learn a
new system overall we like the new
design but don't let the height make you
think this is something that it isn't
the light theme doesn't look as cool as
the dark one did but it makes the whole
experience look more organized the
magazine view that no one really used to
begin with is gone replaced by an
interface that's more ergonomic instead
of titles we now have card style lists
like many Google
have these days we definitely like that
the keep shopping page is now gone it
was annoying and no one liked it anyway
we also liked the three-dot install
buttons which is great if you're
installing something really quick
however at the end of the day we are not
looking at a brand new google play
experience here it's fixed some
convenience problems and it's definitely
nicer looking but the core experience is
still pretty much the same the same apps
adorn the tops of each list in each
category and even the color scheme is
the same despite the theme change so if
you were hoping for something brand-new
and amazingly different you may be
disappointed it's the same great google
play experience we're all familiar with
by now with just a few tweaks here and
there if you take it for what it is
you'll have a lot of fun with the new
play store if you want to check it out
just hang tight as the new Play Store is
rolling out right now to devices and you
should have it very soon once again I'm
