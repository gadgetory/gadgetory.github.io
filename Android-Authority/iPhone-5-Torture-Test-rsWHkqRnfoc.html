Lach over
here from Android authority we had the
iPhone 5 Hong Kong drop test the thing
fared really really well it's a very
durable device this is the same device
we did drop in Hong Kong there is no
scratches there is no Genting or
fracturing to the display itself so
today we're going to be putting it
through a torture test first we're going
to drop some coffee on it second we're
going to scratch it with some keys in a
ziplock bag and finally we're going to
submerge it in water for 15 seconds to
see how it fares its iPhone 5 torture
test time guys so guys we're taking a
closer look at the iPhone 5 as you can
see it still is working and functioning
we did drop it over four times in Hong
Kong and we just wanted to get a closer
look at it for you and now we're going
to put it through the torture test
iPhone 5 torture test time so everyone
tends to drop a little bit of liquid on
their device from time to time so we're
gonna be taking a nice big hot fresh cup
of Android authorities finest here and
drop it on our beloved iPhone 5
here goes nothing guys oh no poor iPhone
feels so good oh yeah we go gosh that is
a hot I phone man woah
jeez go guys
still working still working guys
this phone is quite impressive so
everyone gets a little sloppy and they
tend to drop their device in their
pocket with some keys in the lighter and
from time to time so that's exactly
we're going to do right here we're just
going to insert it into the bag like so
and then we're gonna give it a nice hard
shake yeah okay then we're gonna do a
nice slide test yeah okay guys what do
you think guys let's test it out we had
to get a lot of bags here because they
tend to break okay all right let's take
a closer inspection give it a nice
little rubdown here see
okay so they do have one scratch here on
the display it doesn't seem to be too
bad in fact actually I can smudge it
away obviously still working yeah in
terms of the aesthetics obviously some
minor scratches on the metal on the rear
we have a little bit on the side here
yeah we're going to give it a Polish
we'll take some macro shots but yeah
it's still working there's actually on
closer inspection there really is hardly
any scratches to the display very very
minor so again iPhone 5 is held up
really well
you
you
you
you
to the iPhone 5 is held up remarkably
well during our torture tests thus far
so now we're going to be throwing it in
the water and submerging it for 15
seconds with the video playing to see
how it fares after that we're going to
pull it out we're going to dry it off
and see its operation if it is not
functioning we are going to chuck it in
some rice for 24 hours but based on what
we're seeing so far this thing is
virtually well we'll just leave it dark
judgements for later shall we okay so
here we go
alright the video did get started there
okay let's try it out really quick
that's a long time to leave a device
under water okay and it is still working
guys
it is amazing let's try and power down I
mean it's it's still working okay guys
so it's arrived of submerged desk
okay guys so it does actually turn out
that the device was compromised we do
see that water did penetrate the upper
edge of the display unfortunately oh we
are able to unlock it okay that's a
really good sign you know for about five
minutes though it was stuck in a
perpetual boot and we were unable to use
it but yeah initially we thought that
water had penetrated the display because
there was some color degradation but it
does seem that it has come back to life
it is still functioning let's just test
the keyboard okay so the keyboard is
still not really doing so well so we're
now going to put into rice overnight for
24 hours I just so that we can remove
all water to see if that it does fully
function after that okay guys let's
check back in 24 hours okay
iPhone 5 torture test time
okay guys so it's been 24 hours since we
submerge the iPhone underwater for 15
seconds we did place it in rice to let
it dry off to soak up the water now
let's power it on and see if it works
okay now let's power it up those don't
belong together obviously a bit dirty
that's not going to affect its
functionality okay so repeated attempts
to power it on are proving to be
unsuccessful so the iPhone 5 did fail
the water submerging test though the
device is still in very good shape the
build is still intact the display has no
scratches so we want to say that the bar
has been raised
Android manufacturers are going to have
to create better quality devices from
here on in if they want to compete with
the iPhone 5 my name is Darcy la cuvette
and this has been the iPhone 5 torture
test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
