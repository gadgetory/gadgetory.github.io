12th Nexus device and this isn't even
counting other Google push products such
as the Motorola Xoom and the g1 we have
seen Android grow exponentially since
its debut this open-source operating
system has seen adoption at an
unbelievable rate where we are today is
a very exciting place and this journey
it all started with the t-mobile g1 the
g1 was Google's first foray into the
smartphone game and I had big
competition from the outset the g1
wasn't set out to be an iPhone killer if
anything it tried to differentiate
itself to an alternate user base a crowd
that inevitably found itself being
slightly more technical it was a modest
paradise the Android OS represented
something different something new and
most importantly open perceptibly the
screen didn't compare to the iPhone of
the time but Hardware decisions such as
the SD card slot and slide-out keyboard
gave people a choice the interface was
quite basic but boy did it have some
unique features we had a home screen
with widgets aesthetically speaking it
was one of the defining features of
early Android stories they were
interactive little tidbits which
presented glanceable information without
opening the app the g1 debuted with the
OS codenamed cupcake Google's playful
nature of naming its OS versions after
well-known desserts
donar eventually made its way to the g1
and if your internet in addition the
Android Market was another compelling
feature which allowed any developer to
publish their app this openness was in
stark contrast to Apple who took a very
different stance on the whole the OS
seemed less restrictive and more
experimental for those who wanted
something more than just a phone it had
a single core CPU which by today's
standards is punitive but for its time
it was powerful and even using it now
doesn't feel as bad as it probably
should the salawa keyboard worked well
and gave a tactile feedback and that
thunk of which the keyboard slid out was
an incredibly pleasing piece of
workmanship this wasn't just a phone it
was a start of something quite special
and whether this was just an experiment
it paved the way for Google's ambition
with an
in 2010 January 5th the Nexus 1 came
which brought along it the ethos of what
we see today
it was the showcase platform a reference
device of sorts for developers and OMS
to take note and orbit their designs
around Google wanted to show what could
and should be possible it was based on
the original incarnation of the HTC
Desire and featured an 800 by 480
resolution screen with what felt like
normal then a trackball it featured four
capacitive buttons on the front and it
also featured a micro SD card slot for
storage expansion the Nexus One debuted
with Bluetooth 2.1 and the ability to
perform voice guided turn-by-turn
navigation we saw Android 2.1 Eclair
which features software enhancements to
the contact email messaging and camera
systems we soon saw an update to Android
2.2 codename Froyo there was Adobe Flash
support Wi-Fi tethering and also the
ability to install apps to the SD card
this feature alone was a long-awaited
and much needed it was all positives
though the phone was based on the HTC
Desire which arguably had a more
developed front-end with its Sense UI
not only that it chose to go down
traditional carrier routes which the
Nexus 1 did not it could be said that
this is where the Nexus 1 probably fell
short we can see that it slowly gained
momentum but people were quick to write
it off as a failure
however the Nexus 1 surely did make an
impact on the market in one way or
another and this was only just the
beginning
soon after based on the Samsung Galaxy S
came the Nexus S Google decided to
switch from HTC to spread the love as it
were among the many OEMs that were
fighting the Android fight it was pretty
and unassuming and despite being plastic
throughout it felt good in the hand the
phone launched on the 16th of December
2010 in the US and a few days later in
the UK however only in March the
following year did we see the phone on a
carrier we saw Android 2.3 codenamed
Gingerbread and NFC was a spotlight
feature on the Nexus S 2.3 also brought
along with it a more streamlined
interface and new keyboard along with a
host of back-end features the phone
however did not come without its
drawbacks the camera like 720p recording
which at the time was found on
comparable devices it wasn't just that
though the phone lacked expandable
storage it's a fairly common omission
nowadays even though it's coming back as
a premium but back then most devices did
and it was shortly one of the best
things about Android handsets given this
the fact that the phone was priced at
five hundred and twenty nine dollars off
line it seemed a bit high
fans and critics were keen to point out
that the device really didn't offer much
over the Nexus One regardless it brought
along a bigger four inch Super AMOLED
display back the same 800 by 480
resolution along with small hardware
upgrades the important thing here was
that I addressed the internal storage it
offered more for applications and got
partitions right Android was becoming
stronger and stronger and some may say
this is where things really started
Samsung found themselves in a strong
position offering something similar but
different from the iPhone some loved it
some didn't understand it and Google
inevitably found themselves along for
the ride in the lawsuits that defined
the tech landscape of that decade that
didn't stop Google from sticking with
Samsung for a second go though this
advocated the popularity that sampling
was slowly starting to gain with that we
saw the Apple named gallery
Nexxus the phone was announced with a
slight delay in respect to the passing
of Steve Jobs it launched in November
2011 technically we were starting to
enter a really exciting place the race
we were experiencing during this time
was like no other every bump in clock
speed every increasing pixel count had
an extreme significance on the
functionality of a mobile phone we found
ourselves with the unique hardware
design the previous two Nexus devices
were variants of existing ones the
Galaxy Nexus featured a dragon tail
front which saw a slight curvature to it
this gave it a unique look and a sense
of class the display was a huge four
point six five inches with a 720p Super
AMOLED display screens were to slowly
get bigger and bigger it launched
alongside the highly anticipated Android
4.0 which was also known as Ice Cream
Sandwich for the first time we saw no
capacitive buttons as usual the Nexus
was the first device to push this
reference to complete the design it
featured a pleasing ambient notification
LED which was something missing on its
predecessor
Samsung we're doing considerably well
with the Galaxy s2 and the Google's push
with ICS the Galaxy Nexus proved to be
an exciting device let's not forget
Android 4.0 was a big change it aims a
unified design with a tablet only
honeycomb in a form that would be
functional on the smaller screen the UI
was modernised under the name holo it
was cleaner and revolved around a new
typeface named Roboto ICS brought along
Android Beam lock screen widgets the
questionable but novel face unlock and
the ability to limit mobile data
subjectively ICS was awesome it was a
Tron s looking device which appealed to
the so-called geeks the Galaxy Nexus ran
the OS well and proved to be a good
reference device to launch with the lack
of expandable storage continued which
was slowly becoming the industry
standard it seems as though Google or
finally joining the rest Google still
kept selling the device through the Play
Store but soon they partnered with the
US carriers such as Sprint and Verizon
in Europe they launched on o2 and
Vodafone but lacked Google Wallet you
may also remember the Galaxy Nexus
suffered a brief sales ban which was due
to the ongoing battle between Samsung
and Apple regardless of whether the
device was a high sell or not there was
no doubt that the new software features
made the Galaxy Nexus
compelling device for those looking for
an interesting bloke free device
showcasing a great and flexible OS there
was some slight negative such as the
battery life and the poor camera but the
positives always seem to outweigh the
negatives
the next device was a new chapter for
google and it represented a new time in
the mobile space Google partnered with a
new OEM and this change was needed to
widen the reach of Android the
speculation was high really high and
with the delayed announcement due to
Hurricane sandy it made things
fever-pitch the Nexus 4 was unveiled on
October 29 2012 and it was coming from
LG at the time it was quite surprising
but LG was only up
it brought serious style at a price
point which sat comfortable with a lot
of wallets
we had 299 for the 8 gigabyte version
and 349 for the 16 this was much lower
than comparable devices which are
costing around 600 things only got more
exciting when we saw that I offered a
Snapdragon s4 pro quad-core processor
this clocked in at 1.5 gigahertz and I
had 2 gigs of ram which all round on a
lovely 720p IPS display this seemingly
quiet but beautiful device propelled the
nexus program into the mainstream the
front sported a glass panel which was
slightly curved on the edges the back
feature - annoyance effect it looked
stunning and showcased a different
design language but more importantly it
proved that great design wasn't limited
to higher priced phones as classy and
premium as a glass construction made the
device feel it also vocalized some
niggles both glass panels were covered
in Corning Gorilla Glass 2 but that
didn't stop people from finding their
devices were starting to see scratches
and cracks once again we saw an
underwhelming shooter we had an 8
megapixel camera but it was lacking any
form of quality from the sensor in
addition we were slowly starting to see
Google take more control of the devices
the four followed other devices in the
market and offered no removable battery
this was obviously a cause for concern
for diehard Android fans that have been
used to a certain form of usage this
argument was countered with the
relatively low price and echoes saying
you can't have it all
after the initial launch the device sold
out quick Google can restock quick
enough and fell into manufacturing
issues and so the Nexus 4 stayed sold
out for a long long time the success
here could have been potentially very
different had this not been the case
Android 4.2 debuted with the Nexus 4 we
saw quick settings on a notification
system we had gesture typing and the
ability to take photo spheres within a
year the price dropped by a hundred
dollars it was astonishing to realize
what you could get with the amount you
were paying for we hadn't really seen
anything like this before and coming
from a brand name it gave confidence
overall the Nexus 4 was a sign of the
ecosystem that Google was trying to
build and also an indication of what was
to come for both hardware and software
LG stayed for another round and this
time expectations were high we were now
at a point where the Nexus Brown was the
be-all and end-all for Android
enthusiasts the Nexus 5 was available
from the Google Play Store for 299
dollars for the 16 and 349 for the 32
which was surely increased by 50 dollars
it was slightly thinner slightly lighter
and had a slightly larger screen this
was a refinement that felt natural as if
Google wants to make the same formula
more efficient and lean with the second
go
we had a polycarbonate shell which was
vastly different from the n4
the phone was beautiful but in a way
that was understated subtle and probably
more sophisticated than the n4 the
device was based on an lg g2 but in
actual fact it wasn't all that similar
it had a smaller display a smaller
battery but more importantly it didn't
keep the panel self refresh regardless
at this point being a Nexus device it
had a unique selling points that other
phones who really could not match Google
have once again delivered a high caliber
phone at a lower price there was no real
competition the phone shipped with a
Snapdragon 800 SOC it was also the first
Nexus device to officially have 4G which
curiously was not found on a nexus 4
unless you enter the secret menu as with
previous Nexus devices the five was the
showcase phone for Android 4.4 which
went by KitKat if we had faults to find
in the devices throughout the years
there was no doubt that the software was
only going from strength to strength
Google had tightened up the very nature
of the ecosystem and introduced new
api's this made Android much more memory
efficient now only needing 512 megabytes
of RAM to run this was essential to
Google's aim of getting Android instant
developing countries KitKat also
introduced a host of new features we saw
screen recording system wide support for
closed captioning audio tunneling
composite sensor support and much
much more the m5 was also the first to
sport the Google now launcher this was
the first major sign of Google focusing
their attention on user experience as
launchers on previous devices were
bare-bones to say the least we also had
Google now an excellent card based
system which provided ultra rich
notifications the Nexus 5 exhibited
similar issues to a number of previous
Nexus devices and that was a relatively
poor camera it was better than its
predecessor as you'd expect but poor in
comparison to a number of different
devices out there again we looked past
its false due to the relatively low
price point this arguments to be made
regarding the exact purpose of the Nexus
line of devices like with any embryonic
form that was always going to be changes
some good some bad and some just
questionable like the marketing and
distribution either way what started out
as a handy reference device of
developers soon began to attract
widespread appeal and why not it was at
a lower price point for featured and
uncluttered interface and timely updates
tablets have been a completely different
game for Google before anything even
started they were playing catch-up with
the iPad and its dominance we never
really thought anything of the iPad
initially but it proved that there was a
market for an alternative to a laptop
which wasn't necessarily for
productivity but definitely for
consumption smartphones were
ill-equipped so Google decided to
showcase its tablet optimized version of
Android with the release of the Motorola
Xoom
announced at CES 2011 it featured
Android 3.0 titled honeycomb it was a
vastly different experience to anything
that we were used to it featured a new
design language which we would see as
the inspiration for future versions of
Android we saw support for multi-core
processors copy and paste a new
connectivity options such as Bluetooth
keyboards honeycomb wasn't just a tablet
OS it was an indication of where things
were going people were keen to point out
that Android did not contain many tablet
optimized apps they were coming and here
we had an insightful and daring a look
into what Google had planned for their
tablets we saw an influx of tablets from
all sorts of companies and OMS as
finally had a capable OS to run on a
larger screen Advent Samsung ZTE Toshiba
and Amazon were all in the mix the next
year saw Google announced the Nexus 7 a
curiously small 7-inch tablet it was
made in conjunction with the Zeus and it
was the first habit to carry the Nexus
branding it featured an unusual form
factor and came very very friendly to
the wallets of potential buyers at $199
it was the cheapest way of entering the
Nexus family and for that you got an
NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor paired with 1
gigabyte of RAM all running on a twelve
eighty by seven hundred eighty degrees
design and production process Google
Anna's just managed to release a tablet
which propelled the Nexus brand to
widespread knowledge it put the seven
inch form factor into the spotlight
we had a tablet that was relatively
portable but encompassed a lot of
technology for its relative size and
weight the designs were plastic chassis
which was supported by a corning scratch
resistant thick glass had a dimpled
plastic surface with a rubbery leathery
texture on the back with this Google
debuted Android 4.1 codenamed jellybean
the aim here was a user experience and
in that the GUI elements were now
slightly more relaxed the pull down
notification area was improved and now
adjusted to various screen sizes we saw
multiple improvements under the hood and
the ever-present lag was the main
priority this resolution took form as
project butter
in addition Google push forth their
ecosystem they put their store front and
center of the device offering a free
film ebook several magazines and a $25
credit spending Google Play home was
also now the default browser making the
overall system tighter some love this
some not so much
the argument here was that Google slowly
take you more control to an OS that was
natively meant to be open it could be
argued that the Nexus 7 was the first
device to have mass consumer appeal it
had finally brought a device which did
not just appeal to Android associates
but something which had the hardware had
the price but more importantly had the
ecosystem to finally start matching its
competitors
later that year looking to build on the
Nexus 7 and not to disappoint users of
larger tablets Google announced and
released the Nexus 10 built in
conjunction with Samsung it featured an
out Stan
in 2560 by 1600 resolution screen all
running on a 10.1 inch pls backlit LCD
it featured a samsung exynos 5250 with a
mali t6o 4 GPU it featured Android 4.2
and gone was the honeycomb navbar menu
we were now back to three standard icons
in the center of the screen this perhaps
wasn't the most sensible decision
considering it wasn't in reach of either
hand during operation the Nexus 10
featured the usual connections but an
interesting addition was the micro HDMI
great for media enthusiasts but hampered
due to the lack of expandable storage
regardless it offered a way to mirror
the display at a time where chromecast
and similar devices went around its
habit also featured great front-facing
speakers critically the Nexus 10
received mixed but generally positive
reviews
it was praised for the sheer resolution
of the screen there were questions
regarding whether the device had the
longevity to run the display but with a
9000 milliamp battery 9 hours of video
playback and 7 of web browsing will
claim all of this equal to the Nexus 10
retailing at 399 dollars for the 16 and
$4.99 for the 32 this was probably not
what we were expecting considering the
recent history of lower prices but it
was still cheaper than the then-current
iPad despite this the Nexus 10 was sold
out within hours of its release on the
Play Store and what feels like
repetition now we ran into stock
problems you expect Google to be
efficient considering the scale of their
reach
given the newfound popularity of the
seven-inch form factor it was only a
matter of time before Google releases
successor to the Nexus 7 Google would
have missed an opportunity had they not
followed up but they did and we saw the
release on July 26th in the US and 20th
of August in the UK with the Nexus 7
2013 the partnership remained and the
ethos stayed we had a better screen with
an increased color gamut and contrast
ratio the resolution was now up to 1920
by 1200 from the original 1280 by 800 we
saw a new SOC and a Snapdragon s4 pro
and doubled the RAM of the original do
to better component choice and further
software optimizations we saw much
better battery life despite the Nexus 7
2013 containing a smaller battery we now
had a design which reflected Google's
confidence
there was no conflicting elements in the
entire device was black and featured a
soft touch plastic backing the whole
package was a slimmer and more
sophisticated attempt it was a clear
representation of what we would see with
the Nexus 5 6 and 9
still codenamed jelly bean we saw
average 4.3 we had restricted profiles
for tablets Bluetooth Low Energy and on
the software side we had faster user
switching lower latency for controls and
the ability to wirelessly display
content this improvement resulted in a
slightly higher price
we saw the Nexus 7 2013 debut at 229
dollars for the 16 and 269 for the 32
this increase in price was justified by
a much better product overall
and that brings us to the now and with
what Google must see as a future of the
nexus initiative we have the Nexus 6 and
9 the context is intriguing confusing
and exciting all at the same time for
the first time we see a difference in
the very nature of what we believe the
Nexus branding represents if we consider
the price has gone against everything we
have witnessed throughout the history of
the Nexus program the devices have
generally focused on great specs but at
a lower price and with the Nexus 9 and 6
we have definitely entered the premium
territory in this space there are no
excuses for underperforming hardware or
non functioning software this is where
we start to question the depth of the
software and Google's overall intention
om such as Samsung HTC and Sony offer
their skins on top of Android but there
are features that could possibly be
justified more so than the Nexus devices
features such as IP certification for
water and dust proofing camera and
camera apps with the option for manual
control expandable storage and so much
more vanilla Android does not offer this
inherently so when you're paying the
premium what counts as a justification
when other devices offer long the heir
of premium firstly comes in the feeling
and here they do absolutely find the
Nexus 6 aligned both incorporate
materials which command this feeling
instantly the six sees itself with a
subtle metal frame with a big bold
screen the back however is a different
story and probably the biggest issue
with the design we have a slippery
plastic which is a very confusing design
choice the premium feeling oddly enough
also comes in its heft the six feels
heavy but as its big this weight gives
it solidity the nine follows suit it's a
big device and keep the design language
and materials of the five these are fine
looking and feeling devices but more
importantly they now come with top-tier
specs throughout the six comes with a
beautiful 2560 by 1440 AMOLED display
the color isn't the most accurate
displaying a slight green tint but it
doesn't draw anything away from the
sheer number of pixels on the screen we
all question the significance of having
anything higher than a 1080p display and
in 720 at one point but the difference
is noticeable in addition a nexus 6 has
amazing onboard speakers subjectively
it's one of the best around we are
seeing more devices coming out with
front-facing speakers and it's confusing
to think why it took so long for OMS to
include this the Nexus 9 follow suit and
comes in with an equally good 2048 by
1536 IPS display it too has great
onboard speakers which only should be
expected considering the price but with
the 9 in particular we have to question
whether overall it makes the best use of
the components it has Android on tablets
has always been a contentious point
regarding tablet optimized apps and the
UI on a larger screen subjectively there
was something magical with their
previous tablet efforts the UI made
great use of the space however since the
release of the Nexus 7 we have seen the
tablet and phone UI merge it worked well
on the 7 but probably not so much on the
9 more and more applications are making
great use of the space available but
it's a shame the OS doesn't not as much
as it used to anyways the 9 comes with
the state-of-the-art Tiger k1 processor
which is famed for its GPU power with
all the talk of this chips that we see
nothing on an X 9 that arguably makes
use of the power we have to even
question whether this is even needed in
comparison the Tegra shield tablet
contains the same chipset but here it's
arguably justified we have game
streaming console mode 4k output and
lots more
this is complemented on the hardware
side with a micro HDMI slot expandable
storage and baked-in stylus support this
makes compelling justification of this
chipset and all our price point lower
than a nexus 9 so it's somewhat
underwhelming we must hope that google
has some great ideas in mind with the
hardware they have given the Nexus 9
Android 5.0 is the shining star in all
of this though the rate of evolution has
been unbelievable and what we have today
is a great oh s there's a new design
language deemed a material design and
for once every interaction and animation
makes great sense and seems to have a
purpose it's more colorful more fluent
in its approach and overall will appeal
to a wider audience underneath we have
the all-new art one time which is faster
and more
fishin Nexus devices have always been
reference devices which have been
heavily developer driven the devices
provided a form of Android without any
customizations or additions which were
paired with timely updates to new
software versions where we are heading
with the software is somewhat nebulous
as everything is becoming more
streamlined and the gap between stock
and AOSP is only growing OMS are now
starting to offer compelling reasons of
sticking with their ecosystem they're
also offering features and functions
that some users may genuinely want in
comparison paying a premium for devices
that offers stock experience may not be
as enthralling as it once was so there
is no doubt that we are in a good place
right now the Android silver program has
also seemingly disappeared so the future
is just as confusing as it is exciting
there is no doubt though where we are
and with the technology available these
are the greatest devices to come out of
the nexus program if it wasn't for this
the software really wouldn't be what it
is today
developers have created and enthusiasts
have modded and hack their way through
the fruition of Android we have seen
roms kernels and hans mints tweak
scripts themes and much more that really
can't be described the nexus program has
only been the catalyst for this this has
been a sh for android authority thank
you so much for listening and stay tuned
because we will always be your source
for all things Android
