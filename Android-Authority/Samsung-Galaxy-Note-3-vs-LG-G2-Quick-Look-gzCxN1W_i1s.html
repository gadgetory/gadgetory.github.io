about to go head-to-head eight Josh of
agar from Andhra Authority what's going
on everybody and this is the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 versus the LG g2 in a
quick look in a way these two phones are
quite similar in that both represent
changes in their respective lines the g2
dropping the Optimus and its name is
much like the galaxy s4 in its form and
material opting for the glossy plastic
and has a 5-inch screen the button
layout has been moved to the back and is
a unique way of using the smartphone
that becomes pretty natural after a
little time the other feat of the g2 is
it's thinner bezels that give it a 5.2
inch screen thinner Bessel's are also
found on a note 3 which allow it a
similar increase of 0.2 inches for each
screen now at 5.7 as a larger device
two-handed operation will obviously be
more common especially considering the
usage of the s-pen the new changes in
the note 3 actually involved the overall
material instead of the glossy plastic
Samsung went for a textured plastic that
alleviates the finger printing and
slippery field that the g2 can get in
display the IPS display of the LG g2
brings a lot of expected brightness to
the display game but LG has been able to
create a color saturation profile that
actually rivals the Super AMOLED that
Samsung has consistently brought out
it's a great display at 5.2 inches and
is comparable to the 5.7 inch screen on
the note 3 which is like a larger
version of the grey performer that was
originally on the galaxy s4 when it
comes to specifications we actually have
a little bit more level playing field
both phones employed the Snapdragon 800
processor clocked in at 2.2 6 gigahertz
backed by the audrina 330 the note 3
does have an edge with 3 gigabytes of
RAM aside from the standard 2 gigabytes
like is found in dg2 that extra ram is
important for all of the multitasking
that the note 3 is capable of especially
considering the new S Pen functionality
the note 3 also has a little bit of an
edge by having a removable back which
allows for a replaceable battery and
expandable memory when it comes to the
camera LG put a lot of new features in
the g2 that we might have seen iterated
in the Samsung Galaxy s4 so in creative
smartphone photography things are a
little more evened out here as well as
the note 3 camera employs pretty much
everything the s4 s camera was capable
of the trump card in the g2 is its
implementation of
optical image stabilization which is a
feature we thought would come in the
note 3 but didn't make the final cut and
in software both LG and samsung have
been striving to add new features and
functionality to their respective
Android versions and in the case of the
g2 there are a few new multitasking
options slide aside is one particular
new and notable feature and for the note
3 we have the S Pen that has been
updated with the air commands menu that
includes smart memos and small app
windows while LG's optimus UI has grown
quite a bit the TouchWiz of the note 3
is bolstered by the S Pen if a stylus
experience is more appealing to you it's
pretty obvious which device to look at
here and so there you have it LG and
Samsung are going head-to-head with
their close releases of their flagship
phones if there's one thing that the
note 3 does make me wonder its what the
pro version of the g2 will look like
since the original Optimus G pro is
closer to a note device offered by LG
we'll have to see what the g2 in the
future and for the rest of our galaxy
note 3 and LG g2 coverage make sure you
stay tuned to Android authority</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
