brought to you by domain.com now let's
talk about the epic privacy battle
between mother Google and Daddy Apple
where Tim Cook said Google gobbles up
everything they can learn about you and
tries to monetize it we think that's
wrong and it's not the kind of company
Apple wants to be and then Eric Schmidt
said someone didn't briefed him
correctly on Google's policies we have
always been the leader in security and
encryption our systems are far more
secure and encrypted than anyone else's
including Apple they're catching up
which is great but there is another
contest of lesser titans but no less
epic battle between me and Hindi and my
weapon of choice fruit now let's dig a
little deeper cook further states we
believe the customer should be in
control of their own information you
might like these so-called free services
but we don't think they're worth having
if your email your search history and
now even your family photos are mined
and sold off for god knows what
advertising purpose and we think someday
customers will see this for what it is
now Tim Cook is not lying but he is
overstating the case a little bit and he
begins to tug at the fear strings of
every parent when he refers to Google
mining your family photos it's a bit
hypocritical because Apple does similar
things on their own platform in Apple's
own words they state when you create an
Apple ID apply for a commercial credit
purchase a product download a software
update register for a class at an Apple
Retail Store contact us or participate
in an online survey we may collect a
variety of information including your
name mailing address phone number email
address contact preferences and credit
card information we also use personal
information to help us create develop
operate deliver and improve our products
and services and content and advertising
for loss prevention and anti-fraud
purposes now although to be fair it's
not apples core business but they are
collecting data for much of the same
purposes that mother Google does this
Apple loves privacy and Google does not
campaign is hypocritical just because
the company processes your private
information it doesn't mean they're
doing anything nefarious with it and
then there's the tremendous value that
is being
turn to users not only dozens of
excellent free features but products
that couldn't exist without access to
your private data like Google now and
automated tagging features on Google
photos in fact Apple is rumored to be
trying to emulate Google now with an
initiative codenamed proactive which
will leverage Sri contacts calendar
passport and third-party apps to create
a viable competitor for Google now on
Android devices I feel compelled to
point out the obvious here but these are
too large powerful corporations with one
sole purpose to make gobs of money and
therefore would probably both sell your
grandmother if they thought they could
get a pretty penny for it
so Hindi yeah the man who could law the
virtues of the king of fruits during
fruit through Lifehacker reaching
millions of people yet not eat the fruit
himself he hasn't responded to my
challenge curious so I wanted to show
him how it was done but first of all
just to indicate just how repugnant this
fruit is here's my family trying to eat
the fruit
hmm
Oh mm hose it hope all I didn't Iike
mm-hmm
Andy this is for you
Oh God that's what it takes your turn
maybe I have to take this to another
level and actually use the domain name

fruit dot-com why because no domain name
extension tells your story with the same
level of trust as a.com or.net domain
