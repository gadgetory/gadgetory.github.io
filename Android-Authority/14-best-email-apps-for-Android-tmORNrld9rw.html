hindi the android authority app guy and
in this quick video we're going to take
a look at the best android email apps
first up is the classic AOSP email
that's been updated and refined over the
years it doesn't have a lot of many
features but it is a solid option for
those looking for something simple there
are some issues though so do beware aqua
mail is an email application with a few
extra features on top of these standard
email supports including exchange there
is also light flow and Tasker support
along with several other apps the design
was also recently updated with blue mail
is another simple but elegant email
application it supports a metric ton of
email clients and borrows design
elements from AOSP mail there are also
quite a few customization options and
tweaks along with some security settings
the cloud magic made a big splash in
2014 as a great alternative for email it
features material design and includes
integration with todoist
asana MailChimp Pocket Evernote and many
other applications there is also a sync
feature if needed mail wise is an email
application that specializes in exchange
support it doesn't have a lot of unique
features but it does have a solid design
and it is generally reliable you can
also add non exchange email accounts if
you need to Gmail is among the most
reliable and popular options out there
for an email client this is especially
true now that you can log in to multiple
accounts that aren't from Google it's
one that a lot of people trust and it's
already on your device probably inbox by
Gmail is a unique option available to
Gmail users only it uses a newsfeed
style layout for your email so it gives
you all kinds of control over how emails
are displayed and it even comes with
Google now supports canine email has
been around for a long time and was one
of the first really good third-party
email apps it uses a more minimal style
interface and it's open source and it's
also totally free to use and it's
reliable mail dot Roo has silently
garnered over 10 million downloads in
the Google Play Store and currently has
a 4.5 rating it features multi account
support advanced search notification
filtering and a built-in spam filter
it's a pretty decent option mailbox is
developed by the popular cloud storage
company Dropbox and as you can imagine
has direct integration with the cloud
storage service you have the basic
features along with some advanced ones
and it's a fairly solid experience my
mail is an older email application with
a decent list of features it supports
the most popular email service
and even some older ones like AOL it
doesn't have a lot of advanced features
but sometimes people like simplicity 9
exchange is another exchange client that
was recommended to us by our readers it
is compatible with most Microsoft email
services including hotmail exchange
office 365 and more if you use Microsoft
you should definitely try this one out
we mail is a unique email application
that displays emails similar to how chat
applications display conversations which
makes it fairly easy to use and
understand it also has a fantastic
attachment system and it represents
something a little bit different last up
is yahoo mail and those who don't use
yahoo mail already can zone out for the
next 10 seconds or so yahoo users will
simply get more out of this and if they
just signed in to another email app and
you can do stuff like read the news
while you check the mail and that about
does it for this video folks the video
won't be updated again but the article
definitely will so do check back from
time to time to see what's new if you
have any recommendations for me please
leave them in the comments if you
haven't already don't forget to
subscribe to android authority on
youtube and follow us on social media as
always thanks for watching everybody and
have a wonderful day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
