Android smartphones you may find it
challenging to find the very best budget
device with so many options all claiming
to offer the best bang for your buck it
can be pretty overwhelming to try to
find the best of the bunch we've taken
all of the work out of that though with
the selection of the best budget devices
on the market today this is Bailey Stein
with Android authority and these are the
best budget smartphones you can buy for
under $200 the best all-around cheap
smartphone you can buy right now is the
Asus zenfone 2 now the zenfone 2 did
receive quite a bit of hype when it was
announced back at CES 2015 for being the
first smartphone with 4 gigabytes of RAM
but there's much more to the story
Asus is top offering does feature a 2.3
gigahertz quad-core processor 4
gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of
storage but it also costs $300 just as
they did in 2014
Asus also wanted to target the budget
smartphone market the base model does n
phone - sold in the US has a 1.8
gigahertz quad-core processor kiyo
gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
storage for $1.99 you still get a very
powerful phone with some mid to high-end
specifications the zenfone 2 7 CH 1080p
display looks excellent although it may
be a bit too large for some users
however the phone's curved design makes
one-handed use easier and the rear
facing volume keys are an excellent
departure from the norm placed on the
very top the power button is difficult
to reach and press but the phone does
support double tap to wake
despite the zenfone 2 being made
completely a plastic it still feels nice
and solid in the hand the base model is
plenty fast with the Intel Z 3560 1.8
gig or its quad core processor and
gaming performance with the power vrg
6430 is very difficult to match at this
price point into two ranks the phone's
performance just below the Samsung
Galaxy s5 a phone that launched last
year for $600 locked needless to say the
zenfone 2 is one of the faster Android
phones available despite having a lower
price even if 16 gigabytes doesn't sound
like enough space asus has you covered
with micro SD card expansion up
64 gigabytes the 13 megapixel camera is
pretty good for the price and the
phone's 3000 milliamp battery will get
most users through a full day of use
with an upwards to 3 to 4 hours of
screen on time the zenfone 2 does ship
with Android 5.0 lollipop and Asus is
Zen UI which some users may dislike a
lot of the changes made in Zen UI do
improve the user experience though and
many of the UI elements are close to
stock Android the best part about the
software experience though is Asus its
commitment to frequent firmware updates
asus has shown us in the past that they
are willing to keep their devices up to
date as the zenfone 5 went from Android
4.2 jelly bean to Android 4.4 KitKat to
Android 5.0 lollipop and if they
continue the running trend for the
zenfone 2 the overall experience will
only get better if you're in North
America you can use the zenfone 2 to
receive 4G LTE on AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile in
the United States and Rogers Wireless in
Canada few unlocked phones support both
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile 4G LTE let alone
devices that cost under $200 finally it
does have dual SIM support meaning that
you can use two carriers at once
although only one SIM card can be used
for 4G LTE for less than $200 you really
can't go wrong with the ESEs anthem -
but what if you're looking for something
smaller or want a stock android
experience the motorola moto g second
generation may be a good choice then for
180 dollars with a 5-inch 720p display
that looks nearly as good as the zenfone
2 's one-handed use is much easier with
the Moto G the phone has a really nice
design although it doesn't feel as solid
in terms of build quality as the zenfone
2 or even our third pick you don't have
to deal with an oddly position power
button though which will likely appeal
to users who prefer a power button over
double tap to wake the front speakers on
the Moto G are also superior to the Asus
zenfone 2 s single rear speaker although
the quality of the output is about the
same the Moto G has the advantage of
having stereo speakers facing towards
the user which does make the audio sound
better while using the phone
unfortunately the Moto G isn't nearly as
fast as the zenfone 2 but it's still
usable the power efficiency
dragan 400 quad-core processor clocked
at 1.2 gigahertz is enough for basic
tasks but the one gigabyte of ram makes
the moto g feel sluggish at times like
fleece stock Android manages the low
amount of RAM well but it still can be a
problem one opening more than a few apps
at once the jump from 1 to 2 gigabytes
of RAM is a major one at least right now
and that's where I think the zenfone 2
really has the edge over the Moto G the
Moto G does include 8 gigabytes of
internal storage which can be expanded
up to 64 gigabytes via microSD they
megapixel camera isn't very good but the
2070 Milley have battery will get most
light users through a full day with up
to two and a half to 3 hours of screen
on time one obvious advantage of the
Moto G 2nd generation is that it ships
with stock Android Motorola has updated
it from Android 4.4 KitKat
to Android 5.0 lollipop and it can be
expected that they will continue to
update the phone for a little bit longer
if you're a fan of stock Android you may
want to seriously consider this phone
over the other options the Moto G
unfortunately does not support 4G LTE
networks at least in the u.s. it doesn't
that means you'll only receive up to
HSPA+ or 4G speeds which is essentially
glorified 3G the good news is is that
the u.s. metal is unlocked and does
support both AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile so you
aren't tied to a single carrier if 4G
LTE isn't available where you live and
you really just want to stack experience
or you prefer to have a smaller device
the Moto G 2nd generation is a good
choice for 180 dollars I do have one
more recommendation though for users who
want to try something a little different
that recommendation comes from none
other than Chinese smartphone
manufacturer Xiaomi the xiaomi redmi 2
is an excellent choice for users wanting
to experience me UI and all that Xiaomi
has to offer while still keeping a tight
budget availability is going to be the
bottleneck here although you can buy the
redmi 2 from official resellers like I
buy gal importing the redmi 2 does
slightly inflate the price but it's
still the cheapest phone on our list now
there are two models of the redmi 2 and
a few variations based on intended
carrier support the base model of the
redmi 2 has one gigabyte of RAM and
eight gigabytes of internal store
grunts for about $150 on import the
price may be attractive but you should
really instead consider the redmi 2 Pro
which has two gigabytes of RAM and 16
gigabytes of internal storage the redmi
2 pro does cost a bit more at about 170
dollars but that's going to be $20 well
spent for virtually all users in the
head the redmi 2 feels surprisingly
solid and very comfortable
the 4.7 inch 720p sharp auo display
looks pretty good with quality coming
really close to that at the Moto G and
viewing angles being just as good or
slightly better even than those found on
the zenfone 2 the rear speaker on the
red meat who does seem to be louder than
the speakers on both the zenfone 2 and
Moto G
although the Moto G still has the least
amount of audio Distortion when it comes
to performance the base metal redmi 2 is
slightly faster than the Moto G both the
bass and pro models of the redmi 2 have
1.2 gigahertz Snapdragon 410 quad-core
processors which is a slight improvement
over the Snapdragon 400 the pro model
should be faster and much better with
multitasking however since it has two
gigabytes of RAM instead of just one gig
me UI isn't as good as memory management
as stock Android though and I found
myself running into issues more
frequently than I did on the Moto Qi at
least with the one gigabyte variant if
you get the 2 gigabyte model though the
performance should be better than the
Moto G but unfortunately still inferior
to the zenfone 2 4 months although the
redmi 2 does have microSD card support
up to 64 gigabytes me why does not allow
apps to be moved or installed onto the
microSD card the redmi 2's 8 megapixel
camera is pretty good and the 2200
milliamp removable battery in the red
meat you should get most users through a
full day of use with roughly 3 hours of
screen on time depending on your usage
the redmi 2 runs shelley's fork of
android me UI 6 over Android 4.4 KitKat
Mui is a pretty heavy Android skin and
it has been criticized for taking some
inspiration from a certain fruity tech
company but the experience is truly
unique and different compared to stock
Android Xiaomi does release occasional
updates for the redmi 2 and if you flash
the developer rom you can even receive
an update every Friday
Xiaomi is known to be pretty optimistic
on the
timelines but hopefully we'll see an
Android 5.0 lollipop update within the
next six months unfortunately for the
redmi 2 the zenfone 2 and Moto G are
likely to receive Android updates much
faster than the redmi 2 while the redmi
2 is slightly better than the Moto G
overall in terms of hardware
availability is a major challenge with
the redmi - you can't officially buy the
phone in the United States meaning that
you'll have to import it importing won't
get you the standard one year warranty
that many people expect the model is
available for import are not intended
for the US market either meaning that
carrier sport isn't always what you may
expect like the zenfone 2 the redmi 2
does have dual SIM card support unlike
the Moto G which supports both AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile HSPA+ or 4G the redmi 2 has
limited support for US carriers
depending on the specific variant there
is a variant that supports WCDMA 850
1920 100 megahertz which is fully
compatible with AT&amp;amp;T and partially
compatible with t-mobile depending on
your specific coverage area I wouldn't
recommend buying the redmi 2 unless
you're on ET or an ATM BNL and even then
please make sure to confirm that you're
getting the right variant I like to
think of the redmi 2 as being the option
for users wanting something different
it's a great phone but it is difficult
to get and carrier support can be a bit
complicated so there you have it my top
three picks for the best budget
smartphones under $200 there are other
options available of course but I tried
to keep this list exclusive to the
phones with the absolute best value each
and every user has different needs so
it's important to evaluate what you want
before jumping in and making a purchase
