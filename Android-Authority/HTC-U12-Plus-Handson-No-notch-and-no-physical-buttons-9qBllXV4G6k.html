couple of new cameras a full screen
experience that does not use a notch and
is literally more sensitive than ever
it's Josh of Agora what's going on
everybody and this is the HTC you 12
plus the first impression that we're
going to give you is based upon the
translucent blue we're in an era right
now where a color is actually a feature
of many devices and this is the most
unique of the three different colors you
can get of the u12 plus the translucent
blue is by far the one that we want to
have because you can see some of the
elements just underneath the cover
due to that slightly transparent back
cover all of the phones are made of
glass but there's a real heft to them
the glass panels are separated by a
metal frame and in the hand it almost
feels brick like to me it's almost like
a callback to the kind of build quality
you used to get in a lot of HTC phones
one easily and immediately recognizable
change is the lack of any buttons on the
front there are no more front-facing
home buttons fingerprint readers or
capacitive keys now you just have a
screen the fingerprint reader has been
moved to the back but the screen has
very little bezels on the sides and it
is an 18 by 9 aspect ratio making it a
little bit taller so it's pretty easy to
use especially from left to right there
are very minimal bezels on the top and
bottom just enough to hold the dual
cameras up top and then to have the bits
on the bottom including the USB C port
and the speaker unit no there is no
headphone jack but adapters are
available at HTC comm and the box will
include a pair of u sonic USB C
headphones just like last year the rest
of the phone looks conventional but then
looks can be deceiving this is where
some of the fun begins much like last
year the phone can be squeezed in order
to trigger a couple of functions you can
just squeeze it quickly or hold it in
order to trigger two different shortcuts
but pressure sensitivity has also been
added to the area where you would
normally see the power button and the
volume rockers you do still see what
kind of resemble buttons up there but
they're just risers that you're not
actually pressing down for a real click
instead you get haptic feedback when
pushing down on those pressure-sensitive
areas to trigger the volume buttons or
the power button the areas below the
buttons where the squeezes are
registered have also been tweaked to
allow one more shortcut a double tab of
one's thumb now in those areas it will
be able to recognize which hand is
holding the phone based upon perhaps how
many fingers are on one side but in any
case
you are able to tap on the bottom
portion of either side with your thumb
and trigger yet another shortcut by
default however this is the triggering
of the one-handed mode one handed mode
is not new but making it this easy to
trigger is probably going to make it a
lot easier and simpler for a lot of
users out there who don't want to do all
those ham gymnastics and then there's
one more place that this grip actually
makes a difference and it's in one
real-life scenario pesky rotation pretty
much every user has had that issue orden
you're lying down and you want to look
at your phone in portrait mode but when
you lie down and go sideways so does the
phone with smart rotate the you 12-plus
understands that the phone is being
gripped vertically and we'll keep the
portrait mode while held that way it's a
slight annoyance that now has a solution
that we didn't realize we needed until
now now as far as the other
specifications go you get pretty much
what you would want out of a flagship
it's a quad HD panel the six inch Super
LCD six that is also supporting HDR ten
there's also an always-on function
called smart display which can be set on
at all times at the expense of some
battery life or it can simply turn on
when the phone knows it has been picked
up kind of like HTC motion gestures HTC
Sense UI looks mostly the same as last
year and comes with blinkfeed as the
secondary home screen there's not a
whole lot that's different here but it
still seems quite smooth and really
clean which is something we always liked
about sense every phone will be getting
six gigabytes of RAM however the most
premium version in the translucent blue
will get 128 gigabytes of on-board
storage but then again all you 12 pluses
also have microSD card slots and finally
that thirty-five hundred million power
battery is pretty sizable and can be
charged via quick charge three or four
if you have a compatible adapter however
there's no wireless charging involved
which brings us finally to the cameras
and I say cameras plural in a very
literal sense you've already noticed and
we've mentioned that there are two
lenses for the front-facing camera
together these allow the u12 plus to
capture 84Â° selfie portraits the two
lenses are identical at 8 megapixels and
f 2.0 aperture but together they are
able to also get depth data in order to
provide the correct cut out for bouquet
effects the result is not only a good
looking portrait that has those bouquet
background effects but you are also able
to change the focus points in the
gallery and then use a slider to change
how much of that bouquet there is
those same bouquet tweaks can be done on
pictures captured on the rear shooter
and it has a dual setup as well the
normal lens is a 12 megapixel F 1.75
aperture while the zoom lens has 16
megapixels and F 2.6 aperture obviously
the main draw here is zoom capability
which also adds to the portrait mode
where you get a tighter frame phase
detection and laser focus are both used
on the rear shooter to ensure fast
focusing and there's both osne is used
to make sure that especially videos are
as stable as possible while we are
talking about video HTC has also added
in good slo-mo 1080p capture can be done
with 240 frames per second while 4k
videos have 60 frames per second
capabilities and with the 4 microphone
setup the audio should sound pretty
great on here including high-res capture
overall there's a lot that this phone is
bringing to the table and we're really
excited to put the camera through its
paces to see where it stands against the
competition after all
HTC also announced that the DxO mark
score it puts it just below the current
top contender on that list and so there
you have it
it seems HTC is putting just as much
effort into the basics as they are in
the extras and there's plenty outside of
the core experience that makes this
phone exciting the u12 plus will be
available on HTC's official website and
via Amazon for 799 dollars while the 128
gigabyte translucent blue model will go
for 849 you can get it right now or wait
a little bit for our final verdict as
our full review will be coming very soon
here at Android authority stay tuned to
see what we think about HTC's latest and
greatest because we are of course your
source for all things Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
