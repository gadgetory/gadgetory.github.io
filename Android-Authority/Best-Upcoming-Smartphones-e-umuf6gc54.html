favorite topic now first off I've got to
tell you that I'm gonna exclude from
this list the 1 + 5 t and the razor
phone why because I just talked about
them over the past few days go back in
the channel and check that out but let's
first talk about the spec tastic HTC u
11 + the HTC u 11 + will be the even
higher-end version of the HTC u 11 that
launched a few months ago nearly
everything about this phone is
impressive in terms of specs the u 11
plus will have a bigger 6-inch display
than the u 11 with a 28 80 by 1440
resolution it will also have a qualcomm
snapdragon 835 processor with 4 or 6
gigabytes of RAM depending on the market
64 or 128 gigabytes of on-board storage
again depending on the market and a big
three thousand nine hundred and thirty
milliamp hour battery the camera on the
u 11 + is the same as the one found in
the u 11 with a 12 megapixel ultra pixel
3 sensor on the back and on the front
and 8 megapixel sensor the phone does
lack a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack but
does have an IP 68 rating for dust and
water resistance the u 11 plus has the
edge sense squeezable body found in the
u 11 with the addition of the edge
launcher which allows you to access
favorite apps contacts ins quick
settings by squeezing the phone's frame
finally the phone will come with the
option of a translucent color in the
back which will let you see through the
Gorilla Glass back of the phone this
option will let you check out the
internal hardware of the u 11 plus now I
know you're gonna ask me about
availability it is expected to be
launched before the end of the year next
up let's talk about the odd sort of I
don't know 1980s design inspired device
that is the red hydrogen one as powerful
as our smartphones are and as
great-looking as they're getting with
near bezel s designs and metal glass and
ceramic constructions there isn't much
of a WOW factor anymore particularly for
those of us who live in the West red a
famous cinematography company that
you've definitely heard of if you
any interest in filming is hoping to
change all that with their first
smartphone offering the hydrogen one now
we don't know a whole lot about this
device except for the fact that the
prototype looks really good the phone
will be modular and is expected to be
released early next year
however given Reds area of expertise we
can definitely expect this upcoming
Android phone to feature an excellent
camera even more exciting is that this
phone will feature a holographic display
even if we don't know what that will
entail exactly this member of the
upcoming Android phone list is one to
watch out for I'm looking forward to it
either to enjoy it and this amazing
innovative thing or just to make fun of
it what do you guys think let me know in
the comments below do you think it's too
early to talk about the Samsung Galaxy S
9 nope if the latest rumors to be
believed
Samsung plans to launch the
next-generation version of the Galaxy S
series in February following an
announcement in January some rumors
about the phone include one that claims
it will have a camera that can record
video at a thousand frames per second
there were also reports that Samsung
will launch a phone with a folding
display alongside the s9 none of this is
confirmed yet but it certainly puts both
devices on our upcoming Android phone
wishlist now the release date or
announcement of the s 9 is pretty
believable since they've done it around
the same time each year but I am really
hoping that this isn't a spec bump year
for Samsung I expect that it will since
the recent s8 has had a major design
they usually don't change the design for
about two years at a time what are you
hoping what are you expecting will they
really launch a foldable display
alongside the s9 I think that has some
reasonable credibility why well if
you're gonna launch something like that
you want a piggyback that off the
biggest device release of the year when
it comes to Android devices that is the
s9 there's nothing really gonna be
bigger that's the biggest Android
flagship out there they would be smart
to piggyback like that what do you think
let me know in the comments below or on
Twitter verse well as someone who
an online business I can tell you that I
look for tools that make my life easier
and our sponsor fresh books not only
makes this show possible but they make
online payments and accounting much less
painful and how do they do that exactly
well you can send clean and
professional-looking invoices in about
30 seconds and in about two seconds you
can set yourself up to receive online
payments and you don't have to manually
input your receipts you can take
pictures of your receipts with your
phone
using fresh bookses mobile apps and for
a 30 day unrestricted trial you can go
to fresh books com4 which lasts Android
and in the section where it says how
you've heard about us Phil in Android
