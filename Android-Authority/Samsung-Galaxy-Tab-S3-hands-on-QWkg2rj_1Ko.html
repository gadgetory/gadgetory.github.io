Billy Goldman to the higher-end side of
the Android tablet market in fact the
last Android tablet that they release
overall was the Galaxy Tab A which was a
lowly spec model released back in the
fall
however we finally have a true successor
to the 2015 release Galaxy Tab s2 and
that's the Samsung Galaxy Tab s 3 it's
armed with an updated design along with
that fancy smancy s-pen so hopefully it
can reinvigorate an Android tablet
market that's been dwindling in scope
when the first things to take note
looking at the Galaxy Tab s 3 is that it
takes after Samsung's premium design
language with its Android smartphones
you could easily say it's a galaxy s7
and tablet form just because it combines
a glass back with an all metal frame it
looks really nice for a tablet but there
is a bit of fragility at stake here
because of the materials speaking of the
glass construction it bounces light
similarly to the s7 but it's just a
fingerprint magnet
other notable changes to design include
its USB type-c 3.1 connection there's a
higher resolution 13 megapixel rear
camera with flash you larger 6,000
milliamp hour battery with fast charging
technology and now there's no longer
those two holes in the back to attach a
cover or keyboard and oh yeah there's
only one model of the Galaxy Tab s3 the
screen is a nine point seven inch 2048
by 1536 Super AMOLED display it's not
one to disappoint it's detailed and
offers all the exceptional qualities of
AMOLED technology would expect to find
when it comes to watching videos though
Samsung leverages a brand new HDR
cinema-like mode that adjust the
contrast and color saturation
accordingly to deliver a wider color
gamut
that's pen isn't new we've seen it
before but technically that's the first
time it's making its appearance in the
Galaxy Tab s line now this new s-pen
which doesn't require any power source
offers over 4000 levels of pressure
sensitivity it has all the features of
the S Pen test and much more however
it's a shame that there's no slot to
place the s-pen into when it's not being
used so you gotta be care
about it it's powered by Snapdragon 820
with 4 gigabytes of RAM which runs
pretty fine from what we saw and yes
the S Pen does indeed add a new level
utility to the tablet that we haven't
seen before but to tell the truth it
doesn't seem like there's anything more
extravagant with the Android experience
here we haven't come across before so
far though
Samsung has kept hush about the tablet's
price and release and speaking the price
it's gonna play a pivotal role in its
success just because if it's priced
above the $500 mark that would meet
competing against all those Windows 10
tablet convertibles that we see out
there which would offer more versatility
in long run with full Windows 10
software alternatively though it'll also
be going toe-to-toe with some of those
sub $500 Chromebooks out there including
Samsung's own ARM based Chromebook so
yeah it took a while for Samsung to
release a true successor but we've seen
what happened in the landscape we have
things like the iPad pro so it's gonna
be interesting to see how this one
competes so if you guys want to learn
