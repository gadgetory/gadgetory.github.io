and a five thousand milliamp hour
battery for just under three hundred
dollars seems like a great combination
blue has just announced its new device
and if this sounds good you're in the
right place what is up guys this is Ben
here with Android authority we're going
to be taking a look at the all new blue
energy XO so let's get ready right off
the bat the design on this phone is
definitely the most eye-catching the
blue energy XL has a premium metal
design with the edges rounded off it
comes in two colors a silver or a gold
and this is the gold version Blue has
done a great job in keeping it a thin
profile with an 8.4 thin aluminum
unibody housing the phone feels very
good in the hands and you'll notice that
the metal they have used is of high
quality because it does not feel cheap
at all since it is then and it is
slightly rounded to the back that will
help with your grip which is actually
really good because you don't want to
fall out of your hands moving on to the
display you'll notice that it is huge
and great quality blue ice push this
phone to have a six inch full HD Super
AMOLED display the colors look very nice
on the screen and since it is an AMOLED
display it provides you a greater range
of color options does creating an even
more vibrant looking image it also
allows a fantastic viewing experience
since along with the AMOLED display
you're able to watch this at a
resolution of 1080p with the pixel
density of 368 moving on to the
performance the phone is powered by a
powerful octa-core 1.3 gigahertz
processor with three gigs of RAM the
phone runs very smooth even with the
custom animations for the homescreen you
can switch from app to app instantly
without it getting even a bit of stutter
I did run the phone through some
benchmarks with Geekbench and it did ok
I tried to also see if you could hold up
to gaming and it actually did a pretty
good job without dropping any frames now
one of the biggest selling points to the
phone is obviously the battery life
coming in with a five thousand milliamp
hour battery this battery will give you
a lot of juice you'll never be charging
this device on a daily basis I gave mine
a test and use it for a medium to heavy
use and I was still left with just over
60% at the end of the day so that is
definitely an awesome addition to the
phone towards the bottom you will notice
that it is charged via type CD USB cable
and the charge times are rather very
quick considering the size of the
battery you will also find a dual SIM
card tray
sixty four gigs of internal storage and
if that's not enough you have an access
to a microSD slot to increase the
storage capacity in terms of the sound
it does not have a heavy bass to it but
overall this is a great job in producing
a good amount of bass without distorting
the sound and ends up giving a very high
quality sound similar to the blue vivo
five Blue has stayed with Android
lollipop version 5.1 the app Troy is
still not there so you have to have all
your apps on the screen you can however
create folders which does make it
slightly more organized or you can solve
this simply by just downloading a nova
launcher and having your app drawer back
in action when you slide from the top
you'll get your notification screen
which looks great and has an option
button so you can customize what
notifications you want to see pulling up
from the bottom will bring additional
quick functions which also house your
Flash calculator camera and the infamous
button to fake a call which is my
personal favorite on the phone itself
Blue has applied to touch sensitive
buttons one taking you back and the
other opening your most recent apps
which is nice you can also customize
your homescreen with different themes
and create some custom animations as
well as for the themes there are a
couple of themes but the one that's
already been defaulted actually does
look really good with the phone so I
went ahead and kept that one so overall
there are some things on the blue energy
exhale that are not native to everyone
but it is easy to get used to and once
that is done the software is a great
companion to the phone the camera is not
something to be wowed over but it will
definitely get the work done and
actually does a great job Blue has given
the phone a 13 megapixel main camera
with the phase detection autofocus and a
5-megapixel selfie camera the pictures
come out great I'm not being too exposed
or overly saturated the camera does a
great job outdoors but has a little bit
of trouble without lighting that is ok
since we're not doing with the DSLR
camera or something but overall the
camera is good at the price point that
it is given at video quality is great
but nothing too exemplary it has good
quality about constant exposure changes
it is kind of difficult in the outdoors
to capture video and since there is no
stabilization it can be shaky at times
overall for the camera it is something
you would see in a budget smartphone at
the end of the day this is a 300
smartphone that really feels like a
flagship device when looking at it from
the outside and inside the exterior
design and build quality is amazing and
can definitely not be complained about
the Super AMOLED display giving out a
resolution of 1080 by 1920 is superb and
gives out fantastic vibrant images and
more along with an insane mega battery
giving it five thousand milliamp
hours which can last up to three days
the software on the device can be a hit
or miss but can be solved if tinkered
just a little bit when paired alongside
with the Nova launch so is this phone
worth picking up I would say yes blue
has done a lot better with this device
and being just under three hundred
dollars it's great considering it comes
with an amazing build quality as well so
you definitely can't go wrong with the
blue energy XL so that'll be it thanks

think on the blue energy XL and it's
5,000 milliamp hour battery also don't
