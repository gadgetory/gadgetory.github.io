handy the Android authority app guide in
this quick video we're going to take a
look at the best music players for
Android first up is double twist this is
a classic music player on Android and
supports the basic functions like
playlists and equalizers some of the
features are paid with the basic stuff
is free to use equalizer an mp3 player
is a basic mp3 player that tries to
focus more on the equalizer side of
things if you love equalizers it's worth
giving this a shot but those who want
more music features should probably look
elsewhere Google Play Music is actually
a fairly decent option for your locally
stored music you can also upload up to
50,000 songs on google music for free to
stream but that functionality can be
finicky sometimes jet audio music player
is a feature packed application with
plugins loads of features and a decent
if somewhat old graphical interface it's
also compatible with pebble smartwatches
n7 music player is one of the more
uniquely designed options on this list
it employs a modern design and tries to
make your music collection more visually
appealing it's a lot of fun but it's not
for everyone
neutral music player is a reader
recommended application that we also
really liked it has a simple interface
plenty of features and a large number of
supported formats the only problem is
that there is no trial version the
player pro music player has a bunch of
features including the basics along with
unique stuff like gesture controls and
Shake support the UI is geared a bit
more toward tablets though power amp is
the mack daddy of music players on
Android it comes with a loaded feature
support for many file types and skin so
you can theme it there's also a trial
version available so you can try it
first the rocket player is a solid music
player with plenty of features
chromecast support and some unusual
stuff too you'll have to go to the
developer website to get it though
because it's been kicked out of the
Google Play Store shuffle plus music
player is a simple application that
mimics Google Play Music to an extent
but that's ok because that means it
looks really good it's not heavy on
features which can be both good and bad
and that about does it for this video
folks the video probably won't be
updated but the article certainly will
so check back there every now and again
to see if we've added anything new since
