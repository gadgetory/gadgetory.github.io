at a pre briefing with Samsung and at
Aoife here in Berlin and we're taking a
first look at the Galaxy Note 2 now this
is a device that's generated a lot of
consumer demand key features include has
got a 5.5 inch panel
it's a 1280 by 720 Super AMOLED HD
display just looking at the galaxy s3
here you can obviously see it's just you
know a lot more substantial in terms of
this footprint but you have a much much
bigger display obviously very very
similar in terms of thinness they've
been able to reduce the footprint of the
device itself it's lighter and thinner
than the original note obviously a
little bit heavier than their the
original Galaxy s3 other than that we're
looking at an 8 megapixel camera on the
note 2 he's got a obviously a
front-facing camera now I believe that
this display doesn't have the pentile
matrix they did have to step down the
resolution a little bit but it does have
a proper a proper RGB matrix so you can
have a much better color reproduction
other than that it's got a 1.6 gigahertz
quad-core processor same one that's in
the s3 just overclock it's got 2 gigs of
ram they're gonna come up with the 16 32
and a 64 gigabyte version it also has an
expandable 3100 milliamp battery and you
can insert a 64 gigabyte micro SDHC card
so you can have up to 128 gigabytes in
it
obviously it's got the s-pen
and it's an extremely fluid device the
original and the initial benchmarks that
we're doing are showing that it's
extremely powerful and likely to
probably be the most powerful device on
the market when it goes to launch anyway
so this is a Galaxy Note 2 vs samsung
galaxy s3 just to get a sense in the
hand it's pretty big obviously about 25%
maybe 20% larger than the original
Galaxy s3 anyway this is started like
over here with Android authority
reporting live from Aoife Berlin taking
a first look at the Galaxy Note 2 vs
samsung galaxy s3 thanks for checking in
