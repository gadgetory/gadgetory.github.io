iPhone 6 versus the HTC One m8 metal is
the order of the day with both of these
smartphones as both feature a premium
build with a design that is actually
quite comparable at least from the back
the iPhone 6 has more of a curve to it
especially on the sides of the front and
back will remain pretty flat aside from
that small protrusion of the camera
sticking out there m8 refines what was
great about the One m7 using a lot more
metal this time around but it does have
a little bit more of a curve along the
edges on its own a front is where the
differences are more obvious Apple
continues its signature style with the
physical home button that now has a
fingerprint scanner integrated and
somewhat bigger bezels HTC does away
with capacitive keys but the Black Bart
is still found under the display but of
course there are the very welcome and
now signature boom sound speakers the
iPhone 6 is finally catching up to
Android devices in terms of display size
and that translates to the comparison
over all dimensions but the m8 is still
obviously the larger device definitely
thicker and definitely heavier but the
handling experience might be somewhat
similar on both as the metal back might
prove to be slippery and is a problem
for both of these devices but for
Android users they've already been used
to devices of this size so iPhone loyal
is switching to the 6 may require a
little bit of time getting used to the
bigger build and of course the big news
this year is about Apple finally giving
in to the bigger screens the iPhone 6
comes with a 4.7 inch IPS LCD display
with a resolution that Apple calls
retina HD but basically comes in at 1334
by 750 resolution the one I made on the
other hand has an S LCD screen at 5
inches with a 1080p resolution a pixel
count of 441 PPI over the 326 of the
iPhone 6 both displays are great
performers with good colors and contrast
and pretty great viewing angles and
while the advantages of having a pixel
density above 300 PPI is still debated
the difference between the two is
somewhat noticeable with the closer look
but overall the general user may not
really notice the difference it's
basically a battle of Android and iOS
here as comparing two very different
types of processors isn't necessarily to
fare in this comparison but for the
record the iPhone 6 comes with a all new
a8 chip that is made in-house and is a
dual-core processor clocked in at 1.4
gigahertz and is backed by one gigabyte
of RAM on the other hand the one mA
boasts a quad-core Snapdragon 801
clocked in at 2.3 gigahertz along with 2
gigabytes of RAM but regardless of the
differences on paper both handled their
respective software's very well with no
issues with like across the board and
both handling multitasking very well
since UI in particular does get a nod
because it is one of the more
minimalistic Android iterations that are
available and is a better rival somewhat
to the iOS that has always been a pretty
good performer on iPhone devices when it
comes to other Hardware the iPhone 6 is
the first along with the six plus two
future NFC though it will only be used
for Apple pay at least for now the One
m8 also has NFC but it isn't new and can
be used with plenty of other features
the one in May does have the additional
benefit of expandable storage on top of
its 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal
storage and there is no microSD
expansion with the iPhone but it does
come in a 128 gigabyte flavor for those
concerned about storage both of these
phones stay away from the megapixel race
as the iPhone 6 features an 8 megapixel
rear shooter the same as its predecessor
with some improvements across the board
including focus pixels which is
basically a phase detection autofocus
but also a more open aperture and also
software based image stabilisation video
capture also gets a boost as well with
the capability of capturing 240 frames
per second slow motion at 720p
resolution and on the other hand the One
m8 is even more megapixels shy as it
brings back its for ultra pixels from
the One m7 added in however on the back
is a secondary camera the duo camera
that helps get depth data in order for
you to create depth of field shots
low-light photography will be better on
the One m8 but that low megapixel count
kind of evens out the playing field a
little bit and finally in software as I
mentioned before the Sense UI is one of
the more minimalistic versions of
Android that is available but it still
comes with quite a few of its own
features one in particular is the blink
feed which is a secondary screen that
brings you an aggregated list of news
websites social media feeds all in a
very easy to use and very attractive
format it does run Android 4.4 KitKat
and this is Sense 6 we're talking about
and after that we do have the added
benefit of some gesture control such as
the tap to wake in the ability to answer
a call just by raising the phone to your
ear
iOS 8 on the other hand has had a major
update I it's not
necessarily the big aesthetic overhaul
that ios7 was but it does introduce some
new features like for example continuity
which allows you to have synching across
a lot of different Apple products but
you can also have the Health application
which is actually quite robust Apple pay
is here now to take advantage of the NFC
chip though it does make the NFC chip
only used for its the aesthetics of the
OS however such as the color scheme
remain largely unchanged from iOS 7 and
so there you have it for this battle of
the metal phones we have the Apple
iPhone 6 versus the HTC One m8 people
will pretty much argue that a aluminium
design usually makes the phone a little
bit better and in that case both of
these phones are probably going to be
the choices for those particular people
as far as features go they do have
pretty similar feature sets but the
resolution of the One m8 might be a
little bit better for you even though
the bump up in resolution for the iPhone
6 is definitely welcome for iPhone
loyalists stay tuned to Android
