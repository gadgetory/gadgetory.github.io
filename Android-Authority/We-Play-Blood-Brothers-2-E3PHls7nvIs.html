Hindy the android authority app guy and
in this quick video we're going to take
a look at blood brothers too for those
who have never played Blood Brothers or
blood brothers too here's how the game
works you are in control of commanders
who each have a contingent of soldiers
in battle you send your commanders out
to fight the enemy commanders and this
process repeats until someone wins
outside of battle you can recruit more
commanders train commanders and have
your commanders research skills and
abilities on a skill tree to make
everyone more powerful you can also play
through events engage in PvP combat in
the arena and you can check out the
gifts read the latest blood brothers
news and plenty of other stuff DNA has
added a lot of new stuff to the game in
a recent update and that really changes
how the game is played by far the
biggest changes the inclusion of guilds
each guild can have up to 50 members and
there's a dedicated guild chats
everything is fairly straightforward and
typical of a mobile game guild except
for a few things gilts have a shared
mastery tree similar to the ones that
each player has guild members can
contribute and complete the guild
mastery stuff and each member benefits
from its even the new ones also if
anyone buys any blood central's through
in-app purchases everyone in the guild
gets a gift which is kind of a nice idea
one of the other new features is a new
slew of daily events this is to help
keep the game fresh and give players
something else to do a little more
frequently DNA has said that there will
be seven dungeons that will be rotated
out daily and players will be able to
use these to win more stuff like gear
gold various souls and other stuff there
are other new features as well there are
now new daily packs that you can engage
with to get yourself more commanders and
the opportunity to buy more commanders
based on the day of the week there are
also random Luke boxes that appear
randomly after random battles that gives
you a lot of awesome extra stuff here's
what we liked about blood brothers to
the gameplay is consistent simple but
still fun you're not asked to do a whole
lot but you do have to pay attention and
think a little bit in order to win this
not only includes battles but upgrading
skill research and pretty much
everything is easy to do but you have to
make sure that you're doing it right the
guild system is fantastic during my
testing I went to bed one evening and
woke up with around 45 gifts thanks to
the actions of my guild members
the chat is useful for strategy and
discussion and the guild skill tree is
very useful it was a very positive
addition to the game the story is
actually pretty decent for a mobile game
it's not super deep but the dark fantasy
grittiness is refreshing usually in
mobile games you have cute little
monsters and you're always trying to do
good it always looks so polished and
friendly in this game you get the trench
warfare feel and the people you work
with don't look friendly at all it's
actually kind of nice there is a lot of
stuff to do between the campaign the
events the daily missions upgrading your
troops recruiting new ones and getting
the skill tree mastered it's going to
take you a long time to beat this game
don't forget the new guild stuff the
achievements and the PvP arena also
there is just a lot to do the developers
seem to be able to get a lot done you
already had a lot of stuff to do and DNA
came back and gave players even more
with guilds the daily missions and the
other new stuff lastly Blood Brothers 2
does include cloud saving it's not
google play games cloud saving but it is
definitely good enough to get your stuff
to another device and here's what we
didn't like so much the menu system
probably could have been laid out a
little bit better it's not that bad but
it's a bit overwhelming at first and I
feel like things could have been better
labeled of course once you pour a few
hours into it you'll learn where
everything is so this really is a minor
nitpick still a few things are kind of
hard to find it first the PvP arena
dynamic is a little bit weird I assume
they're going for an idea where players
blindly choose their commanders not
knowing what the other players are going
to pick the problem with this is the
game heavily relies on choosing based on
what you see on the field so a blind
match kind of takes away a lot of the
control it's not necessarily a bad thing
but it does operate on different
mechanics than the rest of the game and
as a result it feels just a little bit
off overall this is about as good of a
time waster game as you can possibly get
it pulls from a lot of genres including
card collecting strategy MMO and RPG
elements which really allows players to
delve into the game and gives you a
whole lot to do the new addition of
daily missions and guilds help keep the
game fresh and gives a bit more of a
social aspect so you have someone to
talk to you while you play which we
liked a whole lot there were a few
things here and there that didn't quite
mesh well with the overall feel of the
game but at the end of the day these
were minor nitpicks the game is free
with
and that purchases in the Google Play
Store which means it costs nothing to at
least check it out and you'll be showing
