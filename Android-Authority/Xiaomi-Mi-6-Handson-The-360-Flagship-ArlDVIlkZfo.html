best features from the last year's worth
of smartphones into one cohesive package
it's Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody and this is my first
impression on the Xiaomi music it's
pretty easy to notice the design of the
music's mostly because there are quite a
few colors but the main one is a blue
with gold accent it's almost like a
reverse Iron Man of sorts and it's
incredibly eye-popping it's definitely
different from the standard black and
the standard white but I will tell you
about a couple of other somewhat more
exclusive colors the highly exclusive
one is one that's not even available for
the public just yet they just wanted to
show how as engineers they really wanted
to take an idea and make it a reality in
this case it is the Silver Edition now
all of the musics is have stainless
steel frames which takes a lot in the
manufacturing process however in trying
to make the entire device that sheen of
silver out of tens of thousands of
different attempts maybe only 10 to 20
of them actually make it out of the
manufacturing process making this a
highly sought after device because it's
well technically really hard to make but
if you're looking for the most premium
version of the music's well Xiaomi is
sticking to their ceramic guns if you
remember the me mix there was a ceramic
edition of that that looked really great
and we still enjoyed that material for
these smartphones and Xiaomi is going
back to that well for the mini six this
is the most premium version and it comes
with 128 gigabytes of on-board storage
and 18 karat gold to line the cameras on
the back so we can go ahead and get into
the specifications all of the screens
for the music's are 1080p panels and
more conventional 16 by 9 aspect ratios
making them just a little bit behind all
of the current specifications for
flagships that we've seen thus far in
2017
however it does have highly saturated
colors that do the me UI justice and
there's also an eye care mode that is a
lot like the blue light filter however
they've dialed it back so that if you
want to use the blue light filter or the
I care mode it's not going to put that
aggressive yellow hue on everything
beneath the display is the capacitive
array including a home button that's a
little bit reminiscent of the HTC 10
basically a small area that does get you
back to home but it also doubles as the
fingerprint reader and if you look at
the glass in the four corners at least
on the front it has a four-way curved
glass
allows it to literally wrap around the
front of the device meanwhile if you
turn the phone around the glass curves
upward so that it would make the entire
device a little bit easier to handle in
one hand definitely more of a
comfortable grip so that covers design
let's go deeper underneath the surface
Xiaomi has positioned itself as the
first manufacturer to bring the
snapdragon 835 to China six gigabytes is
no standard for RAM and their different
capacities for on-board storage like we
mentioned already the ceramic Edition
has 128 gigabytes of on-board storage
and the battery is one of the bigger
deals with the stone as its parts 33 50
million hours we're still going to do
our full testing on this device however
it is interesting to note that with a
5.1 5 inch 1080p display and then
there's 3350 million power battery the
ratio between the two is higher than
most flagship devices however in order
to make that type of battery fit in the
Xiaomi 6
unfortunately the company had to do away
with one key element the headphone jack
Yami's moves in the camera are very
notable as well in the era of the dual
camera Xiaomi is bringing its own flavor
to it by bringing a dual camera setup
that has a regular wide angle and also a
telephoto lens that adds a 2 X optical
zoom this is a little bit like the
iPhone 7 plus and it also comes with a
couple of features you might recognize
from there as well including a portrait
mode now I was able to take the ceramic
Edition and it is the one that we are
going to review out for a few tests when
it comes to the camera at the temple of
heaven in Beijing now photos did come
out quite well at least in my initial
testing and you can see them here in the
video but also video gets a little bit
of a bump up as the main camera the main
wide-angle camera has for access
stabilization now unfortunately one of
the big drawbacks to this camera array
at least for now is that you're not able
to zoom when recording video I have been
told that this is not a hardware
limitation and this could become a
feature in future versions of the me UI
but they will stop short of actually
guaranteeing me that that would happen
for a little bit more depth of field
from the F 1.8 aperture lenses you can
use the portrait mode which is a lot
like the one you find in the iPhone 7
now essentially it's going to zoom in
and then add a lot of Boquete in the
background of a cutout subject this is a
little bit different from the Huawei p10
bouquet effect and that you can't really
control the amount of depth of field
that you get however it does do a pretty
good job of finding the subject cutting
it
and then adding the effects but you do
have to be rather close to the subject
any further back and you might get a
little bit of blurriness on the subject
itself so with very little to say about
the software all of these hardware
changes are the crux of this chamois me
sex experience me UI is constantly
changing however under the guidance of
its forum members and we could see some
changes come in the future but for now
the music's is a conglomeration of some
of the best features we've seen in the
past year put into one package so how
much does this cost actually it's
surprisingly affordable for a snapdragon
835 Siksika bytes of ram and a dual
camera users can get the phone the base
model for the RMB with equivalent of 360
dollars if you want to go for the full
premium to the ceramic Edition then it
would only bring it up to a total
equivalent of about four hundred and
thirty five dollars in the West this is
a price that's kind of unheard of for
something that packs all these features
into what is considered a flagship
device my first impressions does put the
music's in a pretty positive spot as it
does pack a lot of great features into a
package that hopefully will become more
refined as updates come in unfortunately
it will not be made available in the
West but this is certainly a pretty good
prospect for those who are in the East
keep it tuned to andrew authority for
our full review in about a week or so as
I continue testing the ceramic version
of this device and remember to subscribe
