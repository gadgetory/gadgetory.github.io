major blow I'm talking like right to the
family jewels you see it comes down to
api's and for you noobs up there API
stands for application program interface
suffice it to say it's a fancy word for
being a middleman between various
programs they allow programs to interact
communicate and share data and they're
everywhere and they're absolutely
crucial to our digital world you see
every time you view Google Maps
information on your Facebook app the app
must make an API call through to Google
servers every time you received a
facebook notification on your phone if
you're an Android user Google must
handle the API call this cost Google
money so far they haven't been charging
developers for it but they certainly
could now this amount would be miniscule
for small app developers especially for
apps that don't reach for Google
services like Google Maps but for
Facebook the bottom line would be
absolutely staggering you see most
Facebook users own Android devices and
Facebook owns four of the most popular
Android apps in the world Facebook
whatsapp Instagram and messenger all of
which rely heavily on Google handled API
calls now for those of you who are
thinking no jace Google would never do
that
think about it Google did start charging
for Google Maps usage years ago and just
because they've been mute thus far on
the API calls Facebook should be
concerned now currently it's totally
feasible to use a method of delivery
other than Google Cloud messaging the
service that handles API calls so prior
to this summer Facebook may have had
hopes of developing their own system and
decoupling themselves from Google but
just like the final scenes of
ghostbusters despair arrived in the form
of something soft white and round
marshmallow androids newest version
introduced a number of changes to the
way Android operating system handles
notifications these changes make it much
more difficult for developers to use
anything but Google Cloud messaging to
ferry notifications to their apps now
what makes sense that Google would want
to make sure that apps use their
proprietary system to vet app
notifications before sending them out to
Android devices in terms of both
security and consistent
your experience this is a no-brainer but
now Facebook is staring down the barrel
of an Android future in which they will
no longer have any other option but to
lean on Google's API support and as some
of you know one of the major goals of
marshmallow was to improve battery life
across Android devices Google realized
that one of the best ways to do this was
to let devices doze for longer intervals
and handle notifications in batches
marshmallow introduced a task system
that allows developers to categorize
push content as low priority and high
priority low priority notifications get
bundled off by Google Cloud messaging
and sent to devices over intervals high
priority notifications that may require
immediate action like Facebook
notifications are sent right away waking
up the device notifications increase
engagement with an app by creating this
division Google is essentially
encouraging developers to make every
notification a high priority
notification if developers do this then
this battery saving method will be a
bust to salvage it Google may start
trying to decide themselves what
notifications constitute the high
priority label now you can see how that
might be a major issue for Facebook they
don't want mother Google deciding when
and how you get your notifications
that's how Facebook makes their money
bringing you back to the app now you
might be thinking Jace Facebook is a
multi-billion dollar business they have
the money and developers to make their
own and not rely on Google but think
about it for that really to work that
have to come up with their own Google
Maps their own Gmail their own YouTube
their own Google search on Play Store
etc etc etc it's a massive enterprise it
might be easier to make nice and play
with Google although very expensive
thanks for watching Android army my name
is Jase love to connect with you right
here on Google+ or Twitter you don't
want to forget about my brothers and
sister and Android we're working super
hard to be your source for all things
