brought to you by domain.com when this
news dropped earlier this week the
Internet seemed to have lost its
collective mind why earlier this week
Google announced alphabet its new parent
company that will encompass all its
other brands including Google what is
alphabet alphabet is mostly a collection
of companies the largest of which of
course is Google this newer Google is a
bit slim down with the companies that
are pretty far afield from our main
Internet products contained in alphabet
instead now this is Larry page's
somewhat convoluted way of saying that
Google and all the companies that they
bought are now split up into separate
companies themselves instead of being
divisions under Google they are separate
companies for most part with their own
CEOs that now answer to their new parent
company alphabet so why do this at all
simply put Google is getting too big for
its own good and as each of its
subsidiaries grew the company would find
itself stretched under the old structure
the company would need to plan
strategically as a search giant
thermostat maker operating system
developer internet provider but now the
slimmer Google can just focus on its
core aims of providing internet products
and services to people like you and me
Google's co-founder Larry Page went on
to say this Sergey and I are seriously
in the business of starting new things
we've long believed that over time
companies tend to get comfortable doing
the same thing just making incremental
changes but in the technology industry
where revolutionary ideas drive the next
big growth areas you need to be a bit
uncomfortable to stay relevant ok sounds
pretty good but what does this mean for
Google as we know it one of the biggest
changes in Alphabet is the ability to
have each business have its own CEO and
this is likely one of the biggest
reasons behind the new structure as a
division of alphabet Google is now able
to run independently of the other
businesses and focused purely on its end
product the newer slimmed down version
of Google will be run by sundar pichai
who steps up to become the new CEO of
Google he will control all of Google's
internal divisions except for YouTube
which will continue to be a subdivision
of Google but will be run by current CEO
Susan Wojcicki
by letting pitch I take the reins of
Google both page and Brin can now take a
step back and focused on the future
Larry Page said this of sundar pichai
Sergey and I have been super excited
about his progress and dedication to the
company and it is clear to us and our
board that it is time for sundar to be
CEO of Google I feel very fortunate to
have someone as talented as he is to run
the slightly slim down Google and this
frees up time for me to continue to
scale our aspirations Google itself is
also making all sorts of new products
and I know sundar will always be focused
on innovation continuing to stretch
boundaries so all of Google's other
companies like Google X Google Ventures
Google Capital Google Fiber will now be
somewhat independent have their own CEOs
and I'll report to the parent company
alphabet if it's a bit confusing this
may help the core Google businesses
including search YouTube and Android
becomes a slimmer Google with other
businesses like calico nest labs venture
etc become part of alphabet now there's
also another big reason moneymoneymoney
the restructuring should also mean
significant changes for shareholders in
the stock market of like under its old
structure the wider Google Group
reported all its figures together with
only some declaration of individual
performance but the restructuring should
also hopefully provide more transparency
for example Google's venture arm may
have invested 500 million dollars in a
bold new startup only for it to fail
miserably and this would have impacted
the wider Google Group financials as
such shareholders may have questioned
whether it would have been better to
invest the money in developing the core
Google businesses under the new
structure however the company could
report the Google Ventures and Google
financials separately and while this may
not change the shareholder pinions about
the money being spent it should provide
greater transparency on the performance
of individual units as well as the
company as a whole now although this big
news won't necessarily have a direct
effect on you and me it does encourage
more innovation and that is always a
good thing now come on guys is one of
the fundamental rules of the internet
when you start a new site and you want
people to take it seriously for business
you really want to get the dot-com now
why is that
because no domain name extension tells
your story with the same degree of trust
as the dot-com or dotnet domain name.com
and dotnet domain name extensions and
jet credibility and your online presence
