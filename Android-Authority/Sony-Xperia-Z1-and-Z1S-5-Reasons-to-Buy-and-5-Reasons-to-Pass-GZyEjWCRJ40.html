Authority what's going on everybody and
here we are again with the reasons to
buy or to pass this time on the Sony
Xperia z1 when we talk about the reasons
to buy we start off with the design the
Sony Xperia Z one happens to have a
design that really only Sony puts out
and you can't really find it anywhere
else in the Android space glass on glass
with a metal frame here or plastic on
the z1s really make for a very premium
device premium feeling device that is
actually very sturdy our drop tests
showed that even after a few drops this
phone still looked exactly the way it
did out of the box and of course when it
comes to the power in the device we have
the squarely top-tier type of processing
package here what these Snapdragon 800
basically enough power to tackle
basically anything that you can throw at
it and of course we have to talk about
the camera this is the G lens that is a
twenty point seven megapixel shooter
that is found in the z1 NZ 1s it is
basically one of the most powerful
cameras in the Android space especially
when you consider it's in a slim body
you can get very good quality shots
especially for your general users out
there and they are enhanced by the small
add-ons that add to your creativity
software is another reason why we give a
good reason to the Xperia z1 so by
because its UI is a very minimalistic
one at best and it provides a pretty
stock like experience it's very familiar
to those of you who might who may have
used an original Android built the small
apps and the Sony apps like the Walkman
also further enhance the experience and
of course all of this comes in a body
that is water and dust proof thus making
this a phone that can withstand the
elements and you can if you want to take
it into the shower with you as a lot of
people keep saying or even better use
this phone underwater to take some
underwater photos when we talk about the
reasons to pass on the Sony Xperia z1 we
do have to start with the display now
it's a 5-inch display that does provide
a very vivid sony TV like experience but
unfortunately it does suffer from very
poor viewing angles when you have the
phone at an angle yes some people say it
doesn't really matter as much to them
but when we see that the image quality
detracts at an angle it just makes us go
oh the other reason for the display is
that the bezels especially at the top
and
more larger than we would like and that
ultimately leads to a passing reason for
design the bezels eventually make for a
larger device in general and compared to
a lot of other 5-inch screen devices out
there this one is definitely larger than
many of those which may be a turn-off
for some people going a little bit
deeper and we find software and the
simplicity that it has might work very
well but it doesn't come with the bevy
of features that other interfaces may
come with it might be too simplistic for
some and then we move on to the camera
now yes the camera is very good in the
Android space but it could be argued
that in the general mobile space are
some better ones out there and the z1
unfortunately we can point to the fact
that it doesn't process dark colors very
well primarily when you look at
low-light shots you will find that the
noise levels are really kind of through
the roof but once you look at other
pictures like even bright ones that have
dark spots in them when you look closely
at those spots those of you who kind of
prefer a more pearl like experience with
your cameras will find that that smudge
enos in the noise level is just a real
big turn-off
and finally we make it back to the
hardware again now while it is water and
dust proof
unfortunately the bits inside aren't
necessarily stellar for it to protect
for example the speaker is just really
not all that great and as far as battery
life it is just an average performer at
best giving you maybe a day or a day and
a half depending on how much you don't
use your phone so as always thank you
guys very much for watching and I hope
you enjoyed this look at the reasons to
buy or passed on the Xperia z1 or Z one
s remember we have a lot of coverage of
the Xperia z1 here at the Android
authority channel so you can check them

has been Sony's flagship phone so keep
