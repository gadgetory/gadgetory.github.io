brought to you by full sail university
welcome back to android weekly my name
is Jace and this is where we cover the
week's Android news like how LG dropped
new details of their LG GG watch and
Samsung of course launched officially
their new flagship tablets and Google
wants us all to take a quantum leap oh
it's just looking at it well that's not
exactly right because it's actually
quantum paper not quantum leap but every
time I hear the word quantum I think of
the 80's television show when television
matters but it turns out quantum paper
is simply Google's continued effort to
have a consistent design language right
across multiple platforms so whether
you're using iOS Android or the web the
design language or user experience is
going to look very much the same the
updated design is expected to bring a
new icon set however it appears that
each service will gain its own color
identifier we already see red for the
Google+ app gmail may get blue and
calendar will get white or green and so
on and so on now for all of you looking
for news about the LG G watch anonymous
sources have told modaco that LG's
Android wear device will be launched as
early as July seventh to conclude just
after the google i/o conference now
these charts came by way of up leaks the
same leaker that recently brought us a
system dump of the G watch if the charts
prove correct the G watch will offer a
1.6 inch display with a 280 x 2 80
resolution 4 gigabytes of storage which
has got to be a typo and a 400 million
power battery with standby time of 36
hours and will take up to two hours to
fully charge wowzers the watch will have
the overall dimensions of 37.9 x 40 6.5
x 9.9 5 millimeters and will weigh
approximately 61 grams now the notion
that the device will have 4 gigabytes of
storage is ridiculous it's probably
going to have 512 megs or 1 gigabyte but
that's just our speculation so for those
of you who know me for my original
channel how to become TV which all
focuses on how best to pursue a career
in saw
for development you'll know that there
is one big painful truth and it's not
just that there are not enough
developers to meet the demand but
there's not enough developers with the
deep technical skill set necessary to
build the apps that are in the highest
demand that's why programs like Full
Sail University really shine and are so
fundamentally important in this degree
program you'll learn specific technology
used in creating and distributing apps
so that you can conceive develop deploy
and market an application from start to
finish Full Sail also offers the online
mobile gaming master's degree program
allowing you to expand on your
programming skills while learning how to
improve the mobile gaming experience
through full sales project lunchbox
program students receive a macbook pro
industry software plus iOS and Android
devices now if tech is your calling
don't waste any time go to full sail edu
/a thority now for those of you who
bought the oneplus one we have some news
for you about the delays earlier this
week 1 plus 1 fans were disappointed to
learn that the shipments of the oneplus
one would be delayed due to software
issues such delays happen all the time
in the industry and normally wouldn't be
a huge deal but one plus one seems to be
exhausting its reserves of public
goodwill after several controversial
episodes of a heavy teasing campaign
that built huge anticipation for the
2014 flagship killer the software issues
that reportedly caused the last minute
delays are now solved and devices should
be shipping soon here's the statement we
receive from one plus one we did choose
to delay the shipment of the first
phones in order to make sure the
software was secure and provided the
best possible user experience the Senate
Jamaat team worked very quickly and
efficiently and the openssl issues have
been fixed the first one plus ones will
ship to early users with invites as
early as tomorrow keep in mind that that
statement came on July eleventh so if
this is correct those phones should have
shipped out three days ago now many of
you will have been waiting with great
anticipation for samsung's new flagship
tablets with their sweet AMOLED displays
under the hood we find either an Exynos
5 octa or a 2.3 quad-core Snapdragon 801
CPU
depending on whether or not you end up
with the Wi-Fi or LTE version both
models contain three gigabytes of RAM
and 8.4 or 10.5 inch AMOLED display and
resolution of 2560 by 1600 16 gigabytes
or 32 gigabytes of storage a microSD
card slot and support for 128 gigabyte
expansion an 8-megapixel rear-facing
camera 2.1 megapixel front facing camera
and a six point six millimeter thick
profile now the major difference between
the two is that the 10.5 inch model has
a 7900 milliamp hour battery as opposed
to the 4900 Miller on battery found on
the 8.4 inch model thanks for watching
android army my name is Jace love to
connect with you here on google+ or
twitter you don't want to forget about
my brothers in android just Joe in the
tech ninja Kevin lon and Chris were all
working very hard for you you don't want
to forget about the android authority
forums where I monitor those and I look
for the best questions the answers to
include in the android QA next week talk
