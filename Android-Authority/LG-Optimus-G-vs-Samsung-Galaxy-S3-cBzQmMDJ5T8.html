Authority I have here two awesome and
powerful phones the lg optimus G and the
Samsung Galaxy s3 want to check out how
these two stack up against each other
sit back relax and enjoy this video
review first let's take a look at what's
most noticeable the exterior of the
phone the lg optimus G is a bit smaller
than the galaxy s3 it's a bit shorter
slightly less wider and a bit thinner
than the galaxy s3 both phones are
nearly the same size and thickness the
differences in size are minimal as you
can see here the optimus G is more
rectangular than the galaxy s3 to me the
Optimus G appears more solid and more
stocky the Galaxy s3 has more rounded
corners here which makes it look smooth
and fluid the optimus G is a bit heavier
at 145 grams the galaxy s3 weighs only
one 33 grams you won't be able to notice
the difference just by looking at the
two phones but the optimus g does look a
bit bulkier and is in fact heavier than
the Galaxy s3 the screen panels up front
are protected by Corning Gorilla Glass
this is really tough glass it makes the
screen resistant to scratches as you can
see the front face of the optimus G is
all black you don't see any buttons here
the galaxy s3 however has a physical
home button the locations of the
hardware buttons on the sides are pretty
much the same on the two phones the
power button is right here on the right
side the volume keys are here on the
left side in the case of the Optimus G
the SIM tray is also here on the left
side for the galaxy s3 the SIM trays
underneath this removable back plate
also if you observe more closely the
power buttons are easy to reach with my
thumb on both phones same thing for the
volume down button but in the optimus g
i'd need to stretch out my index finger
a bit further just to reach the volume
up button both phones are actually easy
to grasp but I feel that the Galaxy s3
is easier in the hand because of the
rounded edges right here
these two phones use durable plastic for
their housing they're not cheap plastic
of course they're actually sturdy
plastic so they don't easily crack chip
gets scratched with minor bumps the back
surfaces of both phones are smooth and
glossy the galaxy s3 here has a brushed
metal finish underneath the glossy
coating it makes the phone look
confident and sturdy I actually like the
galaxy s3 back covers simplicity
although I'm not very happy about how it
catches fingerprints and smudges easily
another thing I love about the galaxy s3
is its removable backplate it also has a
removable battery here let me show you
see this here's the SIM slot here the
micro SD card slot here and the battery
which can be removed and replaced this
battery is lithium ion and has a
capacity of 2100 mAh which can
practically give your phone enough juice
for about half a day of talktime on 3G
now the Optimus G the design on the back
of the Optimus G is a bit more elegant
and showy this part here has diamond
patterns underneath a very thin film of
glossy Corning Gorilla Glass you can see
the crystal like pattern if you look at
the surface from an angle this design
gives the phone an air of fragility and
affluence but that's just a subjective
effect of course the effect on you might
be different you know this back cover is
not removable
there are Torx screws down here at the
bottom edge these suggests that the
cover could be removable regardless it
is not easy to remove the battery
underneath this cover is set to be
lithium polymer with a capacity of 2100
mAh for up to about 8 hours of regular
use with 4G LTE and quad core Eco mode
turned on LG also flaunts the fact that
this battery has more charging cycles
about 300 more charge cycles than a
lithium ion battery with the same
capacity let's now check out the
displace on these two phones
these phones have nearly the same screen
diagonal 4.7 inches on the optimus G and
4.8 inches on the galaxy s3 but they
differ greatly in resolution aspect
ratio and pixel density on the Optimus G
screen resolution is 1280 by 768 pixels
aspect ratio is 15 to 9 and density is
318 PPI on the galaxy s3 resolution is
1280 by 720 pixels aspect ratio is 16 to
9 and pixel density is 306 PPI because
the Optimus G has higher pixel density
its display looks sharper and more crisp
the two phones use different screen
technologies the Optimus G uses true HD
in-plane switching LCD with zero gap
technology this makes the screen slimmer
and more responsive to touch input
Samsung uses HD super amoled for added
brilliance and vibrance the display on
the galaxy s3 looks a bit subdued
a bit more saturated and has a slight
bluish tint even if you set the
brightness level to maximum it looks
awesome and beautiful even under direct
sunlight
however I find the display on the
optimus g brighter sharper and more
readable under natural lighting reading
text and ebooks will be fantastic on
these t phones text is crisp and clear
even if you zoom out to use smaller font
size
but the optimus g seems to render
sharper and crisper text when you zoom
out on the galaxy s3 I had to spend a
bit to read small text from a PDF file
although the two phones differ and
discipline ology they are equally
capable of rendering pleasant
high-definition visuals and readable
text under various lighting conditions I
find it hard to choose between the two
but if you want sharper more vibrant and
more realistic display you might want
the Optimus G for sharp bright and more
saturated display go for the galaxy s3
these two phones are beasts they are
actually two of the most powerful phones
out there the optimus G has the Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4
chips at 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
Qualcomm Krait processor and the Adreno
320 graphics processor it's a very fast
and snappy system the galaxy s3 2 has
very powerful processing hardware it has
the Samsung Exynos 4412 chipset 1.4
gigahertz quad-core ARM Cortex a9
processor and the arm mali 400 mp4
graphics processor the Optimus G's
processing missile is matched with
muscular Ram 2 gigabytes in fact that's
twice what the s3 has although one
gigabyte of RAM seems to be more than
enough for multitasking and smooth and
no lag performance on the s3 LG skims
with internal storage though you'll get
only 32 gigabytes and only that because
there's no way to add more storage
through microSD card expansion Samsung
is more generous with storage the galaxy
s3 has 16 32 and 64 gigabyte models plus
you can add 32 gigabytes more storage
through a microSD card expansion we
subjected these two phones to benchmark
tests and the Optimus G with its
Snapdragon s4 pro chipset out showing
the galaxy s3 and its Exynos 4412
chipset remember to check out our video
of the benchmarks the sheer amount of
mega pixels on the Optimus G's camera
blows the galaxy s3s camera out of the
water
but that's as far as numbers are
concerned is the optimist G's camera
superior to the galaxy s3s camera
generally no this one's a case of more
is not necessarily better the galaxy s3s
camera actually has less shutter lag
captures more detail and works well in
low-light situations
compared to the Optimus G the Optimus G
has a 1 or 2 second lag before saving
the photo to the phone's gallery both
the Galaxy s3 and the Optimus G can
record 1080p full-hd videos using the
back camera and 720p HD
using the front camera indoor videos by
the Optimus G's front camera are very
noisy and very dark but outdoor videos
with ample light are quite good with or
without flash indoor photos by the
galaxy s3 look brighter and clearer
though outdoor shots by the Optimus G
capture richer sharper and more vibrant
colors they're also less noisy but more
smudged and less detailed compared to
the galaxy s3s
outdoor shots let's talk a bit about
media playback quality on these two
phones the galaxy s3s loudspeaker has
louder volume and also seems to have
better texture and tone quality the
loudspeaker on the Optimus G sounds okay
but LG could have done better
Samsung gave us three stereo
loudspeakers LG skimped with Mona
loudspeakers audio through headphones on
the Optimus G those sound really
Pleasant because of Dolby mobile sound
technology the colors on videos are
definitely more realistic and less
saturated on the Optimus G video colors
are rich and solid on the galaxy s3 but
they may overwhelm you if you aren't
fond of dark hues playback for both
bones is smooth and crisp high
definition YouTube videos and those
played by the stock video player aren't
choppy at all if you want to watch
videos on the Optimus G plug in those
headphones the sound will be much better
than if you used the loudspeaker as for
the software both phones come with
Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich these
two phones are definitely capable of
Android 4.1.2 jelly bean
Samsung has already started sending
jelly bean to the galaxy s3 LG however
plans to upgrade the optimus g to jelly
bean in december the galaxy s3 uses
Samsung's own skin and UI known as
TouchWiz 5 the optimus g uses LG's own
Optimus UI 3.0 both are very awesome are
visually appealing and employ nature
themes the Optimus G is generally
snappier
throughout i'm not surprised though this
is quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro see how
snappy the transitions and animations
are moving between screens is super
smooth there's hardly any jitter the
Galaxy s3 is snappy too but there's some
slight lag in some areas the lag is
noticeable in the transitions in the app
drawer let me talk a bit about some of
the software features the Optimus G has
a note-taking app called cue memo that
lets you jot down notes while you're
taking a call browsing or watching a
video without having the switch between
apps the galaxy s3 has a similar feature
known as S Memo you can jot down notes
with your fingertip but you'll have to
switch between apps
I find the Optimus G's note-taking
feature more interesting because it
instantly captures a screen shot unless
you're right notes on it
LG also attempted to put some
multitasking ability on the Optimus G
and I think it did a good job the
feature is known as cue slide this lets
you overlay one app over another you can
adjust the opacity of the app underneath
to make it more visible or less visible
the galaxy s3 doesn't have anything
resembling such function but it has
something that seems close enough pop up
play which lets you view a video in a
pop-up window sadly this is only for
videos it can't make videos translucent
and isn't an overlay another handy
feature on both phones is multiple image
capture LG implements it with a
time-machine camera feature which lets
you capture several images right before
you click the shutter so if your subject
links when you press the shutter you can
select from pre captured backups Samsung
implements a similar feature with burst
mode which lets you capture several
successive shots great for capturing
subjects in motion
either way such feature allows you to
select the perfect frame from a set of
images both phones are very customizable
too though the galaxy s3 seems to have
more customizable areas than the optimus
G but there's one customization option
that I particularly liked in the Optimus
G the icon personalized er this
basically lets you change your app icons
with other icons or with images from the
gallery the two phones may have Android
4.0 4.4 Ice Cream Sandwich but that's
all that they share in common they look
different and behave differently
thanks to Samsung and LG custom skins
custom UIs and custom software yet
despite different ways both phones have
software features intended to make
mobile phone life easier for you let me
wrap up this video review by telling you
what I love most about each phone in the
case of the Optimus G I love its sharp
crisp and vibrant display I love the
fire-breathing out of the Snapdragon s4
pro the two gigabytes of RAM the Q
slider multitasking overlay feature and
the overall smoothness and performance
of the phone in the case of the galaxy
s3 I love it simple but confident
outward appearance its replaceable
battery and back cover its micro SD card
slot it's snappy performance despite
having only one gigabyte of RAM and the
fact that it's 8 megapixel camera
tribe's the Optimus G s-- 13 megapixel
shooter but that's just me what about
you
Samsung Galaxy s3 or lg optimus G let us
