retro charm in this one you'll be

shooting at an opponent floating above
you shields and weapons will be your
tools of destruction and you'll need
some reflexes to make it through it's
surprisingly challenging and it also
features boss battles a local
multiplayer mode and power-ups to make
things easier it may not seem like much
but it literally has no price tag so you
can't ask for much more than this Lego
Star Wars TFA is the latest Lego game in
the franchise and this one revolves
around star wars the force awakens as
such you'll have the opportunity to play
as the characters from the movie and the
sand
riyo's they get themselves into it's a
puzzle shooter through and through and
you'll be doing ground fights as well as
aerial fights in space it's an episodic
adventure so you'll have to purchase

most profitable manga studio ever it
plays a lot like game dev story so fans

into with this one it's a lot of fun and
it has no one app purchases but do keep
in mind that it also doesn't have cloud
saving maiden legacy of the Beast is the
latest game to feature a celebrity and
it's actually not half bad this one

their most popular songs in terms of
gameplay it's essentially a hack and
slash fighter where you'll collect

landscape mode as well it's freemium so
you can pick it up for free if you want
to reigns is a unique little card game

make and each one has the potential to
keep you on the throne or cause you to
be overthrown if you get overthrown you
lose the game and you'll have to start
over it's $2.99 with no in-app purchases
