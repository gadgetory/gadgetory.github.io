Hindy from android authority calm and
it's about that time to be going back to
school if you're wondering what tech is
the best fit for you to go back to
school with you're watching the right
video let's start out with the
chromecast this cheap dog will let you
stream things from your computer to your
TV and it's cheaper than practically any
other hardware solution whether it's
Netflix YouTube or some stuff you have
stored on your phone the chromecast
takes what's not on your TV and puts it
on your TV you can also pick up a Roku
which is among the best third-party
set-top boxes available and it's also
pretty cheap but if you're strapped for
cash the chromecast is your best bet
when you're in school you spend a lot of
time not around a wall outlet and that
means if your phone or tablet dies
you're in serious trouble for now we
recommend lime fuels 15,000 milliamp
hour external battery charger because at
the time of the making of this video
it's on sale in our android authority
deal store that can provide you with
around half a dozen full charges and
that'll keep you going all day long if
you need something a little bit smaller
there is the rav power lipstick external
battery charger which provides roughly
one full charge depending on your device
and it's small enough to keep in your
pocket if you're not carrying around a
backpack if you're staying in a dorm or
a house with a bunch of other students
there will be a lot of devices that need
to be charged and one really easy way to
help everyone out is by grabbing
something like the anchor 5 port desktop
charger this lets you charge up to five
devices at once as though they were
plugged into the wall and all you need
is a USB cable to make it happen that
means it's compatible with both iOS and
Android devices multiple people will
probably need to charge multiple devices
and this is a great way to help out
everyone if you're looking for some more
stuff you can get a cable management
tool like this one or if you have a few
extra bucks to spend some USB charging
cables like these but like all
accessories they're not totally
necessary just good to have Android wear
smart watches saw their first release
over the summer and that means it's a
brand new platform with brand new
possibilities it is new so there aren't
as many applications as we would like
but there are more being added every day
that let you do all sorts of other
things with a SmartWatch you can do
things like check your notifications in
class without pulling out your
smartphone and being disruptive and
perform an ever-growing list of tasks as
the app market gets bigger
there are two Android wear watches out
right now the LG G watch and the Samsung
gear live both are really good watches
but keep an eye out for the Moto 360
coming out in the next month or so all
three are really good watches and you
really can't go wrong either way cables
are slowly being phased out of our daily
lives thanks to bluetooth and since
you'll be walking around practically all
the time you should have some Bluetooth
stuff so you don't have to worry about
tangled cable for right now the best of
the best stuff includes the creative
roar Bluetooth speaker which has
received almost unanimously positive
reviews the audio technica ath m50x
headphones which are awesome if you like
over-the-ear style and the jay bird blue
bird x earbuds which are top of the line
but won't cost you an arm and a leg like
bose would however all of those are
pretty expensive and it may be a bit
much if you want to go bluetooth but you
don't have that kind of money the folks
in bth 3 wireless headphones are pretty
cheap and for a limited time you can get
the icon bluetooth speaker on sale at
the android authority deal store for
about 20 bucks when it comes to tablets
arguably the best bang for your buck is
the nexus 7 2013 edition it features
high-end specs good performance and it's
running the latest version of Android as
we speak it'll be succeeded by a 2014
edition Nexus tablet soon so if you can
wait it's worth waiting for that one but
for now you can pick up a 16 gigabyte
nexus 7 2013 edition for under two
hundred dollars if you have a little
more to spend hands down the best tablet
on the market right now when it comes to
performance and price is the Nvidia
shield tablet it's a little hard to get
a hold of right now because it's
backordered and that's what happens when
you release an epic machine like that
and sell it for cheap the samsung tablet
s is also pretty good chances are you'll
have a computer or a laptop already but
if nots Chromebooks are all the rage
right now and they are pretty cheap you
can pick up the Acer Chromebook 13 for
under three hundred dollars and you can
do the basic computer e things like
surfing the web writing documents and
creating presentations and the other
essential stuff if you're in a
specialized field of study and need more
hardcore software the Chromebook isn't
going to work all that well however for
things like watching Netflix writing
essays web research and other more basic
and entertaining stuff it's a good
option at a great price point last but
certainly not least are the smart phones
when it comes to a good smartphone for
college students one stands above all
the others and that is the Moto G it's
cheap at about two hundred dollars and
that's off contract it's available for
most carriers and it works really
for how inexpensive it is it'll do what
you needed to do and it doesn't look
half bad either of course if you have a
little more money you can always go with
the Nexus 5 you can also get some
amazing smartphones on contract with
price breaks including the HTC One the
LG g3 and the Samsung Galaxy s5 if
you're into phablet you might as well
wait until around November because the
note floor will be out by then and word
is that it's going to be a beast when it
comes to technology there are a million
options out there and ultimately you're
the only one who knows exactly what you
need that said we do have a deal store
at deals android authority calm or you
can go check out all kinds of technology
that is on sale and if my years at
college taught me anything is that
technology on sale is always awesome so
don't forget to check that out once
