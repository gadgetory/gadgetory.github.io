LG G 6 well if it's true it follows the
general smartphone trend of big phones
with tiny levels you see LG has already
revealed its plans to announce its next
flagship phone in just over a month this
week a new report claims to have the
first real image of the phone the LG G 6
and it seems to confirm at least some of
the previous rumors of this device the
image here comes from the verge and
shows that the display will only have a
minimal bezel as previously rumored with
curved corners in fact the article
states the screens of bezel ratio on the
LG G 6 is greater than ninety percent
while the image only shows the top of
the phone the bottom bezel is only
supposed to be slightly taller now for
those of you new to the game let's do a
quick rumor roundup of the LG G 6 LG has
confirmed that the g6 will support a 5.7
inch quad HD display as well as an
unusual 18-9 aspect ratio it'll support
a traditional 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack many of you will be happy with that
and the upcoming smartphone will also be
made of glass and metal unfortunately
will not have a removable battery this
time around other previously reported
rumors claim the phone will have a dual
rear camera set up along with the
front-facing camera that could double as
an iris scanner it's also expected to
have a waterproof body inside some
rumors claims that the phone will have
an upcoming high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon
835 processor and a whopping 6 gigabytes
of RAM now if rumors are correct LG will
also be doing a smart marketing pivot
making clear that they will not have a
samsung battery problem you see some of
the more recent rumors claims that the
LG G six will have thermal pipes inside
for more efficient heat dissipation also
one report claims that the g6 will be
the first third party Android smartphone
with support for google assistant right
out of the box so when and where are we
expected to first see this puppy well we
have received a press invitation for

Mobile World Congress

LG G six did you want to see something
modular that was great and exciting but
