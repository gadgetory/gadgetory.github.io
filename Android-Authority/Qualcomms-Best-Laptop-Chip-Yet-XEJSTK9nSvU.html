is the last day of the entire tech
summit and Paul come have just announced
the Qualcomm 8c X which is specifically
made for these always connected always
on PCs so obviously last year we saw the
835 being repurposed in these laptops
and then they made the 850 which was
kind of a redefined 835 there's a little
bit better but this time call Tom have
completely changed this chip from the
ground up they've built it for a laptop
so it is actually 2 times as big it's
physically larger which means it's going
to be a lot faster obviously you're
going to get about 2 times the compute
performance because it's about 2 times
bigger and there's other things here -
you're getting like 3.5 times the
graphics performance which is awesome
they showed a few examples playing like
asphalt 9 obviously asphalt's a little
optimized for mobile stuff so it's not
necessarily a fair comparison
but obviously graphics have been
improved here so now you can do things
like running two 4k displays just from
this laptop through HDMI so that's
really useful if you're in a workplace
environment you're going to be able to
connect to multiple monitors and they've
added a lot of other things too they
want this to be more like a traditional
laptop experience right so they added
support for things like m2 SSDs now you
can have up to 16 gigabytes of RAM but
it's pretty obvious that they are
targeting this towards business clients
because they always want people to be
able to work wherever they are they
focused a lot on security they had
people from Microsoft and a few other
security companies up there just talking
about how secure these things actually
are and how you can get all your work
done on them so they really want it to
be more focused towards a traditional
laptop experience so now you can do
things like using Cortana and other
things that you might find on a premium
laptop or a laptop that has that kind of
thing
but it's going to last for multiple days
instead of multiple hours right
welcome obviously targeted this as multi
day use in the 8:35 in the 850 but this
is supposed to be 60% more efficient
than those chips as well so you're gonna
get probably a few days of use out of
this and these left ups are technically
5g ready to write because they're using
a lot of the same new components that
8:55 is using so if you just throw those
radios in there later next year then
you're gonna be able to take advantage
of these 5g networks pull down a lot of
data stream things from the cloud so
that's gonna be really nice but we're
not actually going to see these laptops
until probably early to mid 2019 in the
demo room here they only had these
prototypes and they were really just to
show off to partners what you could do
with these kind of pcs they had Lenovo
onstage and Lenovo has always been
really into making these laptops with
them so I'm sure we're gonna see one
from them hopefully in a couple other
manufacturers in the future so
definitely keep your eyes out for these
laptops they're definitely coming early
next year and I hope you guys have
enjoyed everything we had going here at
Qualcomm Thep Summit it is the last day
so there's not really gonna be any new
information from here on out but we've
got all the nitty-gritty details about
the HDX on our website and rotatory comm
so head over there to see all the small
details and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
