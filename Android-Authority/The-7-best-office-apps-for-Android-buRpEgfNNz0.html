handy the Android authority app guy
productivity apps are a big deal on
Android specifically office suite apps
the ability to create and edit Word
spreadsheet and presentation documents
are a big deal so in this video we're
going to take a look at some of the best
office suites for Android first up is
our obligatory nod to Microsoft's
offering even if office 365 isn't the
most popular option for Android owners
it's still one of the most popular
options for Microsoft Office users it
provides native support for office
documents both on and offline and once
you choke down that office 365
subscription price to use the app the
app itself isn't half bad either
the next up is quick office which is the
official office app of Google Drive
using this app you can browse your
Google Drive files edit and create
documents it can create presentations
Word files and spreadsheets and it's
free it takes place almost entirely in
the cloud which saves your space on your
device the only downside is you have to
use it with Google Drive but that's not
really a downside number five on our
list is Documents To Go and this is one
of the earliest office suite apps that
actually worked fairly well there are
tad behind the times in terms of
usability as you have to enter the menu
for every bit of formatting you need to
do but it is a solid app and it gets the
job done be warned the free version
doesn't really do anything so you have
to buy it to see any of the useful parts
of the app
the smart office - is number four on our
list and so far it's the best-looking
one it has a sleek interface with the
standard document spreadsheet and
presentation options it takes a few
extra clicks to do what others will let
you do in one click but other than that
it's a solid option it also supports
cloud storage integration with Google
Drive and Dropbox first in our top three
is off the suite pro 7 this is about as
professional as you can get it includes
standard document spreadsheet and
presentation options that you can save
in a variety of file types it also
includes cloud storage integration and
templates in the paid category it is the
top option number two is Google Drive
and you may be asking yourself why Drive
is on here along with Quickoffice
well because Google Drive is more
simplistic you can still create and edit
documents using the Google Drive app and
it still supports all of drives features
like simultaneous multi-user document
editing this option is better for people
who use Google Drive as a cloud storage
service first and a document creation
second whereas Quick Office is vice
versa last on our list is Kingsoft
office and it really is as good as it
gets it has all of the standard features
in terms of document creation and cloud
storage integration one thing we really
liked about it was the layout and
interface things were easy to use the
interface was friendly and it really was
pleasant to use also it's free and it's
really hard to beat free once again I'm
