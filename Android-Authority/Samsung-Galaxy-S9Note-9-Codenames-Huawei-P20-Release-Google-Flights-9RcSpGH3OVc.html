matter because they're another piece of
the puzzle that help us weigh the
credibility of all the leaks and rumors
we dig up now these are the Samsung code
names that were found by X da x da also
provides some suggestions on the devices
those code names could represent so if
you start to hear Samsung rumors
regarding a crown or star or star - you
know it's possible they may be talking
about the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 or s9 or
s9 plus big emphasis on the maybe now
let's talk about the Huawei p20 that
looks to be coming to us on March 27th
from Paris invites from plough way to a
number of media outlets have arrived
announcing the company will indeed show
off new flagship devices at a press
event in Paris on March 27th while we
didn't mention a specific brand name for
the phone that would be revealed in
Paris though it is almost certain to be
the p20 the successor to the 2017 s
Huawei p10 family unconfirmed rumors for
the p20 include larger displays for the
main phone and a p20 plus along with a
third p20 light model both the P 20 and
the P 20 plus are expected to have
Huawei's latest in-house cura 970 chip
inside a recent rumor also claims that
the high-end phones could have Laika's
camera sensors including a triple lens
40 megapixel rear camera set up with a
five-time hybrid zoom along with a huge
24 megapixel front-facing camera but our
team will be at the event in Paris on
March 27th so watch for that and news
from Mother Google as we continue down
the rabbit hole that is giving up
privacy and gaining convenience even if
that convenience is a bit bloody spooky
and I'm talking about how Google now
will know if your flight is going to be
delayed perhaps even before the airline
does according to a Google blog post the
flight features can not only show if
it's specific flight you're searching
for will be officially delayed but it
can now also predict if a flight might
not arrive on time or depart on time
this is due to Google's own machine
learning algorithm that might actually
predict delays before the airline's
themselves issue an official
announcement in addition to flight time
predictions the new feature will also
share
the reasons for the delays such as
weather Google says its prediction
engine will only mark a flight as being
delayed if it is at least eighty percent
confident that the prediction is
accurate so how you guys doing I'm doing
okay because we're about to end the lull
or slow period and Android news and
we're about to hit the new flagship
season and it's gonna be bangin so let
me know in the comments below or on
Twitter what you want to talk about in
