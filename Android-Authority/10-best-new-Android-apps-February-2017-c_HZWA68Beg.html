hindi the android authority app guard
it's about that time of the month to
round up the best android apps that were
released in February of 2017 if you want
to check out any of these apps for
yourself you can find those links in the
video description below
Amazon chime is the latest application
from Amazon its purpose is to take on
the likes of slack or Skype it's
conferencing in chat software that lets
you hold meetings send files chats and
stay organized to be perfectly honest
the application isn't much yet the
interface needs some work it's a bit
slow and it's still in beta however it
should eventually transform into
something worth using that is unless
Amazon doesn't screw it up you can try
it out for free if you want to large
organizations and businesses may need to
pay for some additional features it has
promise but it's not replacing any of
the big names just yet Cammarata 3d
camera is an application that lets you
record 3d videos it features three main
modes the first is a single user mode
that lets you capture 2d videos and then
renders them to be VR the second lets
you use two smartphones linked together
to shoot stereoscopic 3d videos
unfortunately the third mode is still a
work in progress however it should
eventually let you use three or more
phones to produce panoramic 360-degree
video it's a free application so there's
no harm in trying it out that's even if
it still needs a little bit of work core
is a streaming application that's aimed
at gamers it allows you to watch
livestream from a number of different
services and the idea is that it's
supposed to help you discover new games
watch players you like and do it all
under one roof it doesn't support every
live streaming platform however it does
stream enough of them to be handy for
fans of the genre the interface works
well enough although it can be cluttered
at times there are also new shows and
more content aside from live game
streaming it's worth a shot if you're
into that sort of thing and the app is
completely free to download email by
easily do is a fairly simple email app
it supports a variety of accounts
including Gmail iCloud hotmail outlook
AOL and IMAP accounts the interface
itself is simple enough it has a unified
inbox a built-in search auto sorting and
other features there is also an awesome
unsubscribe feature that helps you get
rid of junk mail for good it's still in
beta so expect to see some bug's here
and there otherwise the application is
free to download
with no in-app purchases face app is a
fun little camera application with some
unique filters you take a selfie and
then you can make yourself smile look
older look younger or even look like a
different sex the adventurous can make a
collage with a few of the filters
applied all at once some have had issues
with the individual filters but it's an
entertainment application and it doesn't
please everyone to be perfectly honest
this is an application that you'll
likely end up playing with for a couple
of weeks before uninstalling however it
will make for some good Instagram photos
the app itself is free to download FB I
wanted is a mobile application that
wants to show you the FBI's most wanted
list it's one of the most famous lists
of criminals in existence and the basic
idea is that the app wants to show you
who is the most wanted who's missing
wanted terrorists and even unsolved
crimes anyone with tips can call in if
they want to you'll be able to read the
list check out some additional details
and a whole lot more the app redirects
to the website which is something we
didn't like all that much aside from
that everything worked out pretty much
as you'd expect it's not perfect but
it's free and it's rather interesting
send a release to his first official
application in February and as it turns
out it's a guitar tuner app thankfully
it's also pretty decent it sports an
easy-to-use interface that anyone should
be able to figure out the application
also features 22 different tune settings
including drop D drop CD ad G ad and
others you can also tune manually
instead of automatically if you prefer
doing it by ear there are even beginners
tips for new learners and it works with
multiple instruments it's completely
free to download with no ads or in-app
purchases Inc it is an e-reader
application where you can find a ton of
content it features a variety of books
and other content from independent
writers who don't mind giving away their
stuff for free once you find what you
like you can download the books and read
them right from the app you'll be able
to change the color of the pages engage
in a night mode and there is even an
auto scrolling feature for easier
reading it's not the most elaborate
eReader ever but it does have a ton of
free stuff for you to read and that
makes it worth checking out
Lego life is a community application for
Lego enthusiasts the point of the
application is to show off your
creations view the creations of others
and engage with fellow fans of Lego the
application features build challenges
quizzes about various games and
properties and there is even video
content that you can watch it's aimed at
children as young as five years old
although the Company recommends slightly
older children use it the only downside
is that the
application still have some bugs that
need to be ironed out luckily it's
completely free so you can get it now or
later after those bugs get fixed Clooney
probe is a fun little application that
can help you see censorship the way it
works is that it runs a series of tests
the first test connections with a
variety of websites to see if any of
them are restricted you can also run an
HTTP invalid request line test to see
for the results finally there's a fairly
standard speed test tacked on at the end
the developers have expressed that it
can show false positives on occasion and
the speed test can be inaccurate at
times however it can be a useful tool
when traveling abroad using public Wi-Fi
or other such scenarios oh did we
mention it's also free and that about
does it folks don't forget to subscribe
to android authority and ring the bell

videos as soon as we release them we've
got some stuff linked up there on the
screen and all of these apps we just
talked about are linked up in the video
