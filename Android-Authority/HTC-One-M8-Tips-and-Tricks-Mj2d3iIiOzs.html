Android authority and if you have an HTC
One m8 but you're still trying to figure
out how to use it well this video is
going to help you out with that so today
let's go ahead and take a look at some
tips and tricks for your HTC One m8
alright so starting off with tip number
one and that is the motion gestures they
should already be on by default but if
not go ahead and jump into settings
scroll down to display and gestures
select motion gestures and make sure
motion launch gestures is checked the
first gesture is a simple double tap
gesture so you can easily wake or put
your phone to sleep without having to
reach up top for that power button
because the HTC One m8 is quite a tall
phone and reaching that power button can
sometimes be a little difficult so this
double tap gesture is meant to alleviate
that if you want to unlock and get
directly into the phone a simple swipe
upwards on the display will get you
right in this is probably my favorite
feature because I don't have to deal
with that power button and it simply
bypasses the lockscreen altogether
making it very quick and easy to get
into the OS gesture number three is
swiping from left to right which will
get you directly into blinkfeed so if
you're a big blinkfeed user this could
be very useful
the next gesture is swiping from right
to left and basically what this does is
take you directly to your main home
screen regardless of where you were
within your phone so for example if I
had Google Chrome opened and I locked my
phone but I wanted to get back in and go
to my main home screen swiping from
right to left will do that for me
instead of just a normal unlocking which
would take me back to Google Chrome or
whatever app you last had open if you
want to call someone using your voice a
swipe down on the display will open up a
voice command for calling your friends
and family or whoever else you have in
your contacts so if I were to say call
Bob it will look for anyone named Bob in
my contacts and call that particular
person it's very useful and it's a nice
and quick way to call someone without
having to unlock the phone first open
the dialer and then dial their number
the final gesture is launching
camera without waking or unlocking the
phone all you have to do is pick up the
phone in landscape mode and press the
volume rocker up or down it doesn't
really matter and boom you are launched
right into the camera it's a little
finicky in my experience but it does
work if all you want to do is get into
your camera quickly take a photo and be
on your way
tip number two is you focus so we all
know about the duo camera on the HTC one
and with that secondary camera you can
do some really nice depth of field on
photos that you've taken with the you
focus feature first you'll want to take
a photo obviously and for best results
you'll want to have a clear subject of
focus so that it doesn't look quite so
artificial when you apply the effect
after you've taken the photo just tap on
edit and select you focus in the bottom
left corner from here basically all you
have to do is tap on what you want to be
in focus and you'll notice everything
else will become blurred again this
isn't perfect but depending on what you
select you can get some pretty
convincing depth of field and there's
also a slider that you can use to adjust
the intensity of the blur to make it
look a little more realistic tip number
three is the themes by default the HTC
One m8 sort of has this greenish look to
it you'll find a lot of green accents
everywhere but if you don't like that or
you just want to switch things up a bit
you can do that all you got to do is
jump into settings scroll down to
personalize and select theme it's pretty
limited but just select whichever theme
you prefer and hit apply
once it's done applying you'll notice
that the accent colors have changed in
places like the quick toggles and the
settings menu and even in the camera
you'll see that the colors have changed
as well so it's a really nice option
when it comes to having a little more
customization built right into your
phone next up is tip number four and
that is the ability to edit your quick
settings toggles so it's very simple
just pull down on your notification
shade tap on the quick settings icon and
then tap the edit button that appears
here you can rearrange the toggles in
any order that you like just by simply
dragging the slider on each toggle up or
down and once you're happy with the
order you can just tap on done and
you'll see in your notification shade
that your toggles have been rearranged
unfortunately you can't remove
or hai toggles you can only rearrange
them but it's still a nice feature
nonetheless especially since this is a
feature you usually have to flash a
custom ROM for in order to get it so
it's nice to see it built into the one
m8 right out of the box tip number five
is disabling blinkfeed so if you don't
like blink feed you can actually turn it
off and HTC made it very easy to do so
it's a feature that many people
originally wanted with the m7 from last
year and eventually got through an
update and you can still turn it off
here on the m8 all you have to do is do
a pinch gesture on the home screen long
press on the blink feed screen up top
and drag it to the trashcan to remove
now you can change your mind and you
want blink feedback just tap on the plus
icon where it says blink feed and it
immediately brings it right back so you
don't have to jump through any weird
hoops like going to your app manager and
for stopping it or anything like that
HTC has made it very simple and it takes
just a few seconds and last but not
least our final tip is how to customize
your app drawer so within the app drawer
there's a few things you can do to
customize it to your liking starting
with the order of the apps in the top
left corner here you can sort the apps
in alphabetical order which is what I
typically like to use most recent and
custom with custom you have the ability
to rearrange the apps in any order that
you've liked just by pressing and
holding on the app and dragging it
anywhere you want within your app drawer
you can also create a folder within the
app drawer and it's pretty much the same
as making a folder on your home screen
just drag one app on top of another to
create a folder and you can also rename
the folder if you so desire you can also
hide apps and change the grid size and
you don't have to have your app drawer
set to custom to use these two features
it'll also work on alphabetical and most
recent but you can change the grid size
from 3 by 4 to 4 by 5 if you want your
app drawer to look a little bit more
full and if there's apps that you want
to hide just select hide / unhide apps
and go through and check off any apps
that you no longer want to see it's a
great way to clean up your app drawer
especially if you download a lot of icon
packs or wallpaper apps like I do you'll
know that these apps tend to clutter up
your app drawer pretty quickly but it's
also useful to hide any bloatware that
comes pre-loaded on your phone that you
don't use which is what I've done here
with a lot of these Verizon bloatware
apps but once you've selected all the
apps you want to hide just hit done and
your app drawer should look much cleaner
and be easier to navigate and so there
you have it some tips and tricks for
your HTC One m8 hopefully you guys found
