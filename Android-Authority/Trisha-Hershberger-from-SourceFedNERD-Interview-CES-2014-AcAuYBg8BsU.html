by Toyota hey guys it's dark slacker
venue with android authority we're
reporting live at CES 2014 we're here
with some kind folks from SourceFed and
of course is Joshua guard from android
authority what's going to everybody and
yes we are interviewing the great tricia
from SourceFed nerd a quick question how
is your CES 2014 so far it was busy um
there's so much here and the
perfectionist in me always wants to see
everything and check everything off the
list and there's absolutely no way you
can especially when you're here for work
yeah you know you're you're on a very
tight schedule and you get a chance to
see I think probably about forty percent
of the show especially when you consider
what's at the other hotels not even here
in the convention yeah I mean everyone
has locations all over the strip and
sometimes off of it so driving back and
forth it's just it's a Kim be a
nightmare definitely do you guys have a
car we do just get a card the question
is how many hours have you slept over
last week Oh altogether probably nine
nothing yes since Sunday ok yeah if you
do ever get a car for one of these shows
let me give you some advice ok don't be
the only driver cuz that's me yeah well
as the resident Android expert you know
my office yes what is the best what
would you say what are the highlights of
Android for you at the show I'm Android
in the cards I think the newest thing
for me because I'm always looking
instead of just the next evolution of
something we've already seen I want to
see something brand new and not that
having any smart features and cars is
brand new but really bringing Android
itself and that type of customization
two cars is brand new oh yeah um the
only question that it really raises from
you know and I loved hear what you guys
have to save it metal is um wouldn't you
just be distracted all the time well
that's the problem right I that I think
you know my face is buried in my tablet
my phone all the time you know when
driving my car yeah I was I saying no no
we're going to talk about that ok ok ok
say i don't know like having the big
screen on the dash or even in the center
console yeah exactly what i would
probably want to see what you know and
maybe this is the next step after this
is a heads-up display on the actual
like yeah when she look hey you know
where they have kind of dlp laser mm-hmm
exxon so you actually see it's just in
your periphery rather than you can look
at what I've also seen it in the corner
of the rearview mirror I'll have some
how would you just lay up there as well
yeah a thread of driving at night time
and stuff yeah really cool on so that
and then of course there's the curved
phones now people dropped out that you
and here's a good question from a guy's
point of view I've been talking about it
as a lady um so we got the LG phone is
is curved top to bottom and Samsung's a
side to side yeah which one is better
for your hand and your ear Josh do you
play with both of them i did and i have
to say both have their merits but if I
had to if I had to say which one was
more expensive your hands drumroll
please I would have to say it's the
galaxy round oh just in terms of the
design just in terms of the design
though because it does sit very nicely
and it is yeah and it's basically I know
three just just a little bit more
compact but I love me that note 3 the
rebut the reason why I say this though
is because I really only have one
problem i love the g flex they're both
stellar in my in my opinion but my only
problem of the g flex is just it's just
a bit too big ok the curve is great
place to do yeah i think that i wanted
to see the G flex 2 that was rumored it
would actually been degrees where is
that yes what little time you might have
had to look at the rest of the show ok
what's something that really caught your
eyes I'm 3d printing was really fun to
see in action this year I can't afford
3d printer so I don't have one at home
nor in the office um 3d printing printed
food was awesome 3d printers that can
print metal organs do you know ok we can
maybe one day our eyes yeah but like
seeing actually come to life I mean we
read about all the different stuff that
3d printers can do yes but actually
watching it
is a whole other thing and then robots
were really cool this year toaster
there's a lot of really cool of
android-based robots or raspberry pi
based were amiable robot so the AI isn't
quite there yet but they're getting the
shell of it for sure and I mean if you
think about it we have the facial
recognition software we have all of the
pieces that we really need to put
together almost to Rosie the robot we're
cool yeah absolutely yeah for me I would
have to say higher resolution displays
are really something that i want to see
everywhere i'm still debating on whether
or not it's good for a phone but we did
see well but a 4k television stole looks
really awesome a 4k tablet on the other
hand I think it's a little bit more
excessive secret yeah sure cuz if you
pick up a phone use for Caleb the
general user might be like I don't know
you get my I know about you guys but how
many movies do you really watch on your
phone does she's possible maybe like her
at the most like a video podcast here
and there okay I watching susumu bore
some podcasts yeah watch next time every
day on the plane so do you guys have
that problem when you come to CES every
year do you look at what you have and
your leg it's just not good honestly I
think that the whole consumer
electronics Marchesa
saturated after all day for all intents
and purposes awesome 1080p displays been
around for a long time yeah out of the
gold standard you know increasing the
resolution is just going to consume
battery life faster we haven't made
those improvements to the architecture
yet italian piece of golden standard but
i think for a lot of people a lot of
these manufacturers are just kind of
scraping the bottom of barrel for
innovation and new features them hmm but
a lot of consumers just really gonna
keep up no yeah you'll see a lot of that
trying to cram Bluetooth into jelly yeah
so keen to tell me about 186 new
features they had on the new tablet but
I don't know we were just know so many
fish my goodness and it made actually
big improvements you know with their
galaxy tab pro line to a point for
advice actually that one hour Award for
Best Actor so let's talk about that for
two seconds magazine UX go well it looks
like a kind of a hash up of I guess
Mashable and Instagram and there's one
more flickr what's the one Flipboard
pull it forward that's right thing again
samsung finally you guys are nicer than
me i was like it's live tiles it looks
more like Flipboard but i do like that
you know you can actually customize
everything to a certain way and yes life
tiles does doubt that i know but you
know even with that in mind what are you
looking forward to poor to this year
when it comes to technology you got this
general not even just android okay
cheaper phones are coming with yeah
chief overcome asus zenfone 6 199
awesome specs replaceable backs to build
quality that they're pretty known for
really like to see better technical
prices that's good forever yeah
accessibility like I say there's always
something that we really look at when it
comes to yes let's hope that gone are
the days of the six hundred dollar
phones with no contract especially now
that so many services are starting to go
no contract there's gonna be a big issue
yeah that's yeah and there's a huge
fence or step because a lot of people
don't leave in a gouge $105 absolutely
absolutely but as you see the newer and
newer tech emerging it's very hard as
the consumer to not want the biggest and
best out their legs or you may not need
a 4k resolution on your phone but you
want it haha and you need a projector
the x laser keyboards see that's I mean
you see it at you're like ah but it's so
cool down there take it happen you know
well never know when kids like drop
close to a thousand dollars on something
isn't they G flex that dip cost a
thousand baht whoa okay we're talking
literally yeah like I literally did a
drop test on the G flex it that's crazy
yeah cuz the whole flexible display
thing right it was supposed to be
unbreakable it's not unbreakable it's
not yet been great the display so gently
only the glass in the operand is yeah
are they using gorilla glass of it I
don't believe so because I with us
actually they just had announced one
couple weeks ago I believe where they
talked about 32
we're getting their incoming so that's
what I would have seen 2014 I don't know
if it's actually coming this year um the
s5 hopefully at mwc yeah galaxy note 4
i'm like to see the house a note boy
already 1 plus or two there you got a
couple heavy hitters coming up guys for
any of it um but yes the drop videos
make me cry a little bit I'm sorry I'm
so sorry they do where the videos where
they just blow them up okay contrary to
popular belief I don't actually like
dropping these phones no matter how
happy I might seem on the videos I'm
always crying afterwards it does it
makes me cry don't even want a man to
look away some of the comments ur not
ready either but there are people are
curious right yeah the only phone we've
ever dropped that is withstood the drop
was the experience he wanted technically
it detected why do you say technically
because I didn't turn on after we just
saw one get ripped apart and put back
together by an engineer well but they
know exactly how to rip it apart but it
matches the little connectors they just
chill it all together a little bit
better ocean will smack it down on the
car oh my god literally no we dropped it
on the floor and one way these plastic
or something I love it none of them we
drop down the floor when we picked up it
looked exactly like out of the box I'm
not being broke and all i will in turn
on her door i drop my phone all the time
so it's very nice that you guys take one
for the team and destroy yours so that
everybody else can know what happened to
us but yeah my sexy we do it for you
guys i have the s3 and it's been dropped
all over the place alright well thank
you again to tricia from a source vendor
for joining us here and with really
great to meet you for the first time
we're looking forward to working with
you again thank you guys so much for the
android
lucky lady hahaha alright stay tuned for
more coverage from android authority
