is Kevin the tech ninja and today I'm
doing a comparison between the Google
chromecast and the Belkin miracast video
adapter we're going to find out the pros
and cons of each and also help you
decide which one is right for you let's
go the Google chromecast rollout has
been an interesting one there was an
initial surge when I first came out a
device to watch Netflix youtubes and
even your web browser on your big-screen
TV for only $35 then as quickly as it
started the buzz ended the restrictions
on chromecast really handcuffed did a
lot of the developers and since the
device had such limited functionality
taking this away really made it stale
after a while out of the box
chromecast only worked with a small
handful of applications play music play
movies YouTube and Netflix then
seemingly overnight the floodgates open
Pandora HBO Go and Plex just name a few
applications that came to the forefront
this always has been the easiest way to
watch content on your TV but now it has
the apps to back it up also you can use
your mobile device as a controller and
it's so easy even my girlfriend can use
it now don't forget the chromecast had
about a six-month head start on the
Belkin miracast video adapter let's see
what Belkin did within the six months
just with any great tool there's
alternates out there that tries to steal
its thunder
the Belkin miracast video adapter may
not be as cheap as a chromecast but the
possibilities are unlimited
the miracast adapter uses miracast
technology to clone your display from
your mobile device to your TV just like
the chromecast you can watch Netflix
YouTube and also anything else that's on
your device you can possibly play
Android games on your big-screen TV
without using wires although the price
point may not be as sweet at $35 it
still comes in at a reasonable $80 both
tools try to achieve the same result but
each of them have a different way of
doing so let's see how they match up the
chromecast uses an HDMI stick to connect
to your TV and uses USB for power even
if your TV does not have a USB port you
to find a way to get this dongle plugged
into an outlet the miracast has an HDMI
stick as well that connects to your TV
but it's a bit larger than a chromecast
I did have to move a few cables around
to make it fit and I ended up using the
HDMI extension cable that was included
the Belkin miracast also requires the
USB power the chromecast initial setup
is painless and does not require much
effort if you are able to connect to a
Wi-Fi connections and connecting to a
chromecast should be quite simple the
initial connection from time to boot up
to watching my first video
was less than five minutes and to my
surprise connecting to the miracast
device was shockingly faster than my
chromecast just needed to go into
settings on my Android device select my
TV as a connection gave it about 45
seconds or so and then it connected and
it was mirroring my tablet now let's
flip back to the chromecast for a moment
I really can't figure out a different
way to make this thing easier it's
honestly dubbing proof when you're in an
application that has chromecast support
it tosses an icon in the top right
corner press the icon and it displays on
your TV then from here the play stop
pause buttons are paired with the TV you
can turn your screen off on the host
device and the video still plays the
chromecast is actually playing the video
so you can save your battery on your
device now depending on your device the
option to enable mirror casting could be
in a different location it's usually
somewhere under options display it may
say screencasts it may say wireless
display or maybe in your drop-down menu
in your notification bar it just depends
on the device that you currently have as
you can see there's a slight delay when
making any actions even though it's
advertised on the Box gaming for me was
almost impossible I have a pretty decent
set up with Comcast at my house and even
with my Comcast connection I still
couldn't play games at a high frames per
second and some games even crashed while
playing it but I had no issues playing
stickman golf I had no issues playing
paper toss or Angry Birds but when I
played grand theft auto played in the
emulators or even played burnout which
is on the cover of the actual miracast
box it crashed on me I use the Nexus 7
2013 Nexus 7 2012 gal
see note three moto X and the Nexus 5
and I have the exact same results with
each device something for thought now
that you see how they work let's talk
about some pros and cons of each
chromecast pros easy one-time setup
ease of use anyone can use it beautiful
splash screens when it's not active and
you could use it as a screen saver more
applications are being supported since
video to chromecast so you're not
draining battery on your phone or tablet
great price at $35 so let's talk about
the Belkin miracast video adapters Perls
the initial setup is pretty much non
existing unlimited possibilities videos
work exceptionally well
you can use this with your laptop to
cast to your TV so there has to be some
cons here too right chromecast cons
limited and functionality the only
application supported our Google allowed
still no open SDK not internationally
available and no official local
streaming yet here the Belkin Scott's
your host device needs to have the
screen on the whole time gaming is
advertised but it's almost impossible
with the inherit lag that it has each
time you want to connect it takes 30 or
40 seconds and due to the size of the
device an HDMI extension cable may be
required all right guys this concludes
my video comparison between the Google
chromecast and the Belkin miracast video
adapter now if you guys notice but I'm a
personal good+ page when I get a new
device in I do an unboxing and initial
impressions of it and also I try to get
an idea of what you guys would like to
see in the video review and also I try
to answer any questions that are Android
related because in this video piece I
can't really go into in depth about the
device and it's not truly Android
because this is your authority as always
guys you can go ahead and subscribe to

you like what we do
I'm Kevin the tech ninja and this is

things Android
take care guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
